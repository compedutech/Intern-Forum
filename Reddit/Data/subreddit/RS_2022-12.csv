I am a non-fresh 2022 graduate still in job hunting, graduated from a Canadian University with a bachelor of science degree in Computer Science. I was reached out by Wiley Edge on LinkedIn a few days ago but I was kinda hesitating. After days of applying other companies and nothing moved on I thought to myself, why not? And applied for the Wiley Edge Junior Java Developer position. Next day when I checked my email I was straight-up refused without any assessment or interview.

My background was okay, I had an internship but more on the data engineer side, I am getting interviews from other companies on developer jobs and I do have a few software design, Java projects. I wonder if it is because the job market is really bad?.. OR is this just a no-reason rare case for me.

I have tried to secure internships but have had no luck so-far, so I don't really have any experience ""in-the-field"" other than working summer jobs at restaurants.

I am part of a consulting organization on-campus where we offer pro-bono management consulting services to local businesses, and I have really enjoyed that. However, I am not a fan of what seems to be relatively low work-life balance in the world of consulting, and am unsure if I want to proceed with that route. I'm sure work-life balance varies company to company in the consulting world, but from what I understand as a whole it is pretty intensive time-wise.

As far as what I DO want in a job, it is admittedly vague, but I know I want a good work-life balance, like helping people, and don't like to travel that much (maximum I would prefer is once a month).

I'm also interested in data analytics, but know next-to-nothing on how to get into that field.

I know this post is kind of vague, but I'm just a naïve college student wondering what options there are for me. Thanks!"

I was supposed to intern in corporate finance with a mid sized company in 2020 but that was cancelled when the pandemic went into full force. So many of my classmates found themselves in the same boat and many of them went to grad school this year to get another shot. After a year of not being able to land a job as a financial analyst due to my lack of experience, I followed my friends to grad school.

It sort of worked because within a month of starting my masters program this Fall, I was able to land an internship in real estate where I'm learning how to do real estate financial analysis and I love it. However, due to current market conditions my company will not be giving anyone in my intern cohort full time offers. I will forever be grateful that they gave me a shot that I so desperately needed, but I'm tired of running this rat race. 

Despite the looming recession, I was able to get a couple of interviews here and there but I keep getting ghosted even after the interviews go well. The most recent company I spoke with had me go through 3 rounds of interviews and told me they wanted to invite me for an office visit after they coordinate with the rest of the team. I didn't hear anything for over a week so I followed up and was given the run around. Then radio silence again, and I finally received a rejection email this week. 

My internship ends tomorrow and I wish I was jumping into a full time role immediately so I could put my masters on pause and just finally live my adult life. My friends from undergrad are all now mid-twenties or pushing 30 and we still live like broke college kids depending on each other because we're not making decent salaries at our bs jobs. We've been trying for a year and a half now to land well paying jobs in our fields and it feels like we're getting nowhere. One of my friends/roommates put his dream of being a data scientist on hold and took up some job in marketing that pays him bs and it saddens me to see him resort to that, I want to see us all win. 

Are there any other covid-era grads out there still going through it? I feel like so many of us had the rug pulled out from underneath us and many recruiters don't want to give us a shot for entry level roles because they have the 2022 grads and upcoming 2023 grads to choose from now.

Using past posts from this subreddit, admission file viewing videos, my brother’s file, and several other resources, I will be attempting to compile a comprehensive outline of how the Stanford admission process works. Please remember most of the given information is unofficial and/or speculation so take this post lightly. 


Holistic Approach and scoring: 
Stanford’s holistic approach to admissions deconstructs a students application into different components, these being scored from 1-6, were 1 is the best and 6 is the worst. - and + are used, were - indicates a better score than a +. These are the following categories and their according acronyms:

Testing - Mainly SAT/ACT. Could also consider AP and IB scores. From observed data, a score of around 1520+ (99th percentile) scores you a 1. 

HSR (high school record/rigor) - Rigor of classes/academics. Admitted students usually score 2-3, most likely acquired by taking hardest possible provided classes. A lower score can be achieved by expanding your education outside of school (individual learning, community college courses, etc.). 

SUP (support) - Letters of recommendation; Most admitted score a 2. 

EC (Extracurricular) - Most admitted score a 2, usually through an internship opportunity. School clubs dont hold as much value (varies by location; several leadership positions might give 3). Region affects evaluation on this; unique extracurricular within context of location can lower score. 1 usually achieved through HIGH reach (international conference, awards, etc.). rare.

SPIV (self-presentation and intellectual vitality) - Evaluates growth, impact, drive for academic pursuit, etc. Measured through essays (supplemental and common app, and sometimes rec. letters); Most have a 2, but 3 is common. Most subjective as presentation depends of AO’s view on essay. Higher score usually reached by demonstrating reflection on significant application of growth or change in your community. 

Eval (evaluation) - Finalized score measured through all scores. Most score +-2. 


Sorting Process:

Given the myriad of applicants, Stanford most likely initiates by sorting applicants into their according regional AO. 

From there, they are ordered by academics (GPA; maybe SAT). The context of high school is considered, as GPA is not relative across schools (reason for region sorting). 

For this, they use something called a High School Report, which is usually provided by the school to the university. Contains info such as: 
- classes/programs being given at school
- GPA % distribution of gen. (ex: 5% had 4 unw. GPA)
- Colleges students go to (past gens)
- Stats compared to global scale (graduation rate, average SAT, AP/IB scores, etc.) 
Also compare you to past applicants and admitted students from same school

Through this, the academically unqualified applicants are sorted out (maybe considered for a quick skim).

The academically qualified are reviewed by the regional admission officer. Usually, this AO is an expert of the region you are from and its context (be it state or international countries). As such, lack of EC’s or class rigor is considered with region in mind. 

(this can provide a boost for those who do uncommon activities within the context of your region, as you are compared to applicants in your region. good way to stand out.) 

 App. review: 
AO1 (regional officer) reviews your entire app in around 10-30 min. Usually begins with ecs, then focuses on finding compelling info. in supps and PS. 

AO1 will annotate your app. Points such as unique activities, strong academics, you vs pool, are noticed. Mostly annotate about supp. writing -&gt; your engagement and impact in community. 

Small summary of each prompt is written. If demonstrates SPIV, it is noted. 

Scores are given for the previously mentioned categories, and recommendation is assigned (likely admit, for sure admit, defer, reject). 

AO2 skims application and goes through same process. Gives less thorough annotation; mainly focuses to ensure AO1’s scores and reasoning are reasonable and if recommendation is good. 

Committee Evaluation: 
Although AO1 and AO2 might recommend admit, application is taken into committee of AO’s to finalize decision. Job of AO1 is to sell you to committee as a potential admit using annotated points. Committee decides whether to accept or deny recommendation. Most likely unanimous voting. 



And thats about it, or what I understood of the process after hours of research. If I have written anything wrong please do let me know so I can make changes, or add anything I missed :)"
z9fnrs,4,2022-12-01,Cerebras 12-mo vs ModiFace 12-mo,Yamini981,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/z9fnrs/cerebras_12mo_vs_modiface_12mo/,"I'm a 3rd year CE trying to decide what 12-month internship to choose for my Professional Experience Year.

All offers are based in Toronto &amp; compensations in CAD.

I have accepted a SWE offer for Amazon next summer, and accepting either of the other two companies would mean potentially losing a full-time return offer, but I'm inclined to take the 12-month role because:
The current recession makes me worry about the odds of a return offer
Internships are free experience points lol.

Cerebras is a startup that makes custom hardware for ML acceleration. I'd be a compiler engineer there, working in C++ on their assembler, linker or LLVM backend (very low-level stuff). I've learned that compiler work is a very niche field, and the experience gained from this would not necessarily be transferrable or helpful in getting FAANG-level new grad roles. It's an opportunity to explore challenging work in a growing field, and they pay well at $87k/year.

ModiFace works on AR for the beauty industry. I was initially interested in the rendering team, but I got offered a role on one of their backend-focused web teams. I'm inclined toward ModiFace because I'd get to develop more relevant and transferrable skills, and (I feel) there's a greater opportunity for impact than Cerebras. They pay $75k/year 

There's also the choice to accept neither, as my school's job portal historically has 12-mo job postings at larger companies (AWS &amp; Wish) released in December, but there's no guarantee this year because of the recession. There's also no pressure on me to accept either offer because I still have the amazon summer role.

TLDR: should I do a 12 mo internship working on Compilers for ML acceleration, or 12 mo doing backend web-dev for an AR beauty company, or skip the 12 months and pray for a return offer after a summer at amazon (amidst the recession)?"

z9fw0s,9449,2022-12-01,TIFU by telling my gf’s three older brothers about how rough their sister likes it,billmuskrat,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/z9fw0s/tifu_by_telling_my_gfs_three_older_brothers_about/,"GF (21f) will be moving in with me (29m) soon  and just told her family about me this week. I’ll be having brunch with her parents soon but her brothers invited me over for beers at a dive bar tonight to get to know me. 

Started off very formal with intros and us just getting to know each other. They weren’t very friendly and just and pretty much just grilled me for over 2 hours about how we met with her interning at my office, why we’re moving in together, blah blah blah. Finally got to a place where we’re just shooting the shit about current events and our lives.

Several beers deep and they’re finally starting to loosen up and we’re having a nice friendly banter going. One of her brothers starts talking about his ex and some of her harder appetites. In my drunken stupor I said “yeah man that’s nothing some girls really love for you to push them to their limits” so he laughed and asked what I meant and I said “ehh it’ll be weird if you guys know about that”. 

We were all quiet and just looking at our drinks for like 45 seconds as they digested what I said and I’m realizing how fucking stupid I am. Whatever friendliness we were working up to is gone but now there’s this tense awkwardness. I offered to get the entire bill, they didn’t even thank me, and then we went our separate ways. GF is staying over tonight and she asked me when I got to my apt how it went because her family is super protective of her. I told her and she went white as a ghost. She’s still in disbelief over how stupid I am and said we’ll talk about it tomorrow. 

TL;DR : met my GF’s 3 older brothers for the first time and drunkenly told them their youngest sibling likes it really hard.


UPDATE:
Once we were both up she wanted me to give her the full play by play on how the hell this actually happened. I told her in detail everything I remembered.

She called me an absolute idiot but I got her to laugh about it so I’m not in the dog house. She said she’s probably gonna avoid her brothers for a while because this is too awkward and embarrassing. She’s also grossed out they’d even bring up a topic like sex when they just met me.

I sent her oldest brother a text this morning “had fun, let’s do this again” and he liked the text so I might be ok with the brothers.

We’re meeting her parents tomorrow for brunch. She’s banned me from touching any alcohol when talking to her family. I was planning on being stone cold sober anyway. She said if I somehow inadvertently tell her parents about our sex life she’s going to stab me so additional motivation to be on my best behavior. 




I’ve skimmed through some of the comments and a few of the PMs I’ve received so I wanted to touch on a few things.

- yes I know I’m stupid, this is TIFU. I’m not gonna post my brightest moment here. But thanks anyway for calling me stupid over and over again. I’m still shocked at how fucking dumb I was. Million ways I could’ve spun it and talked my way out of that hole but I just froze. 
- I didn’t bring up the topic myself. I was several beers in and was just trying to go with the flow of the current topic of convo. Obviously blew up in my face.
- got some PMs calling me a pedo and a rapist. Makes zero sense given the definition of those two terms. 
- yes she was an intern but she never reported to me. I had and have had interns report to me in the past and I kept those strictly professional. My gf and I just happened. 
- why is she just telling her family about me now?  She was nervous they wouldn’t approve and jump to conclusions like a lot of you have because we were still at the same firm. Now that she’s gotten a full time role at another company, we think it’s the right time.


I’m really hoping I don’t make a fool of myself with her parents and have to make another update."

Essentially, I wrote for one of my CS ML Research internships, ""trained CNNs to improve accuracy in annotating databases of crop images."" It sounds really weird, because the most fundamental thing about ML is that you annotate databases to improve accuracies, not the other way around. Some really prestigious universities are looking at this, such as Stanford, so how screwed am I? At the time of writing this, I was thinking of something else, and I wrote this down, but my thoughts did not translate into words."

I graduated in IT field with specialization on computer graphics. Thing is, I don't think I have enough ""actual skills"". Sure, I've had c++ and sql courses, but I barely remember anything anymore. Sure, I know Illustrator, photoshop, zbrush and substance painter a bit, but don't have portfolio that I could show, nor can I really create anything decent.

I have issues with self worth, so you know how people can sell themselves well even if they're not that good? Can't do that even if I was actually good.

I feel like I should go somewhere to gain skills and expierience, but can't find any jobs. I'm mostly looking at linkedin and nofluffjobs, and mostly at internships or junior/entry level jobs.

At the same time I lack direction, I don't know whether I should try to go into art and grind courses, or maybe some programming language? I'm willing to invest time but I'm anxious that I'll invest a lot of it and still end up being parasite on my parents back. Also it feels like I don't have time anymore.

As for ""any"" job I am too weak(?) to do them. I tried Amazon warehouse and I couldn't last one shift, my legs and body was hurting so much. I'm in a bad physical shape let's say that. Still feel shame from that. I am based in central europe but tbh. I would be willing to travel if that meant having a job I can do. I feel like my degree isn't worth anything really, and I don't have enough skills to do any kind of job. Just feels like I'm not enough for anything. 

So yeah, I am looking for advice because entire situation is extremely stressing me out. I am behind a curve a LOT, and I don't have resourcefullnes to know what to do, how to go about it.

I know there are a jobs on production lane or mcdonalds or anything. I just can't stand for that long. Not strong enough to do basic jobs, not smart/skilled enough to do any ""desk"" job."

z9lq0e,1,2022-12-01,Dropping out of college with ~15 credit hours left. How do I tell my employer?,Witchymothgirl,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/z9lq0e/dropping_out_of_college_with_15_credit_hours_left/," I have been in college for six years. I went to community college for my AA, then enrolled in university to get my BA in marketing. My father is a businessman, so I was inspired to pursue a business degree myself – I’m an artist, and figured my creativity would play well into marketing specifically. 

Right now, I’m in a social media marketing internship that I absolutely adore, but I don’t know how to go about telling them that I’m dropping out. (It’s due to my declining mental health. But I have a feeling I probably won't mention that to them.)

I feel like when it comes to having a degree on your resume, it’s seen as either all or nothing – even though I have 100+ credit hours of business and marketing classes, it doesn’t matter if you don’t have your BA. Although the company I’m working for has been nothing short of patient and an incredible learning opportunity, I would feel scummy not telling them ASAP that I’m no longer pursuing this degree. My job isn't through my university in any way, and the position is paid. But our agreement was that I’ll be part-time while in school, with the end goal of becoming full-time after graduating, and the original job-posting was looking for students only.

I feel confident in what I have learned thus far regarding marketing and business practices enough to do my job well, and I've come to know and love the brand. But I feel like if I don’t stay in this position, it won’t be possible for me to get another entry-level marketing job. If I could just stay with the company for at least a couple years, I think I would get enough experience to make up for the gap in education between the classes I took and a degree. Heck, I don't even know if I WOULD leave.

(For insight into what my job currently entails – I mostly do social media and blog posting, but recently began working with the marketing manager and sales director to create a marketing campaign for the business. So far, they have expressed satisfaction with the quality of my work.)

But I’m terrified. How do I position myself in the best way possible to show them I'm dedicated and would like to stay and grow in my position, but I’m dropping out of college?"

I am currently at my last year in a master degree in Physics/Data Science (kind of a mixed curriculum) in Italy. I took a lot of ML, coding, advanced statistics and math related courses and right now I'm in the process of looking for a curricular internship for my last semester which I'm also supposed to write my thesis on. I was hoping to find one in the industry, although some academic opportunities are also available, and I was hoping to find something abroad (EU or even US), but I really don't know what is the best way to proceed; best thing I came up with so far has been just browsing LinkedIn and the web for open internship positions but I just keep getting rejected with automated responses that don't really help me in understanding what am I lacking in terms of requirements or whatnot. 

My resumé is not particularly rich, I mean I do have a GitHub repository in which I stored Jupyter Notebooks and code for didactic projects I have worked on, and I am currently working on my Kaggle profile, trying to expand my general knowledge via the various contests the site offers, but it feels like I'm wasting time and I'm beginning to think that maybe I'm just not as competitive as other candidates, but really I don't know how else I could be improving on that while still being a MS student with no work experience.

So, sorry to bother you with what is probably the n-th post regarding this matter on this sub, but do you guys have any advice? Did you find yourself in a similar situation in the early steps of your careers?

Thanks a lot for any help/answers, really appreciated!"

Sunt student in anul 3 la calculatoare si pe la inceputul verii am intrat in un internship pe embedded c in automotive. Pe la sfarsitul anului urmeaza sa mi se termine contractul si nu stiu ce sa fac mai departe.

La compania unde sunt acum imi plac colegii, ma inteleg bine cu ei. La birou atmosfera e placuta si oamenii sunt deschisi la intrebari si sunt dispusi sa te ajute. Singurul lucru care ma deranjeaza este salariul: 1300 la 4 ore pe zi, fiind la inceput nu puteam sa am pretentii dar totusi e mai putin decat au alti colegi de facultate la alte companii. 

Problema e ca am vorbit cu colegi in aceeasi situatie si ei au aflat ca firma ar vrea sa ne propuna tot un fel de contract de internship pe acelasi salariu pana terminam facultatea.

Acum nu am eu nu stiu ce pretentii in materie de salariu, doar ca am 6 luni experienta si cred ca aduc o contributie mai mare decat aduceam cand am inceput. Daca pot sa negociez, voi cat credeti ca ar fi rezonabil sa cer ?

O alta intrebare ar fi ce oportunitati si ce salarii prezinta embedded c pe termen mai lung, fata de alte tehnologii ?

Ma gandeam sa incerc si alte tehnologii, dar nu prea stiu pe care. Initial voiam sa raman la compania asta pana fac un an experienta, ca sa nu dea rau in cv ca plec dupa 6 luni. Doar ca daca stau pana fac un an, va trebui sa stau si toata vara viitoare tot aici pentru ca trebuie sa fac practica de vara la facultate.

Nu pot sa spun ca ma pasioneaza foarte tare domeniul automotive, proiectele sunt destul de plictisitoare si munca devine monotona. Am avut si mai multe materii de hardware design cu verilog, dar din ce spuneau laborantii si profii munca e solicitanta si complicata. Am avut contact cu web development la facultate si la proiecte personale dar nu ma pasioneaza nici asta. Am avut o materie de OOP si mi s-au parut interesante conceptele si java. Mie imi place mai mult sa rezolv probleme si sa gasesc solutii, sa gandesc algoritmi.

Astea fiind spuse as vrea sa profit cat sunt student si pot prinde internship-uri relativ usor si sa schimb tehnologia. Pe ce ramura a programarii mi-ati recomanda sa ma duc? Eventual daca puteti detalia putin despre ce presupune munca pe care o faceti voi."

[First Chapter / They Say We Are Lucky](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/yk76tq/they_say_we_are_lucky/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

&amp;#x200B;

I recently began my internship onboard the Stasis Ark, a massive vessel that the humans built before my species, the Mutantur, had evolved sapience. After my introduction to the project, I started by taking some mandatory classes from human teachers. It was all relatively basic lessons; mostly done just to ensure we have a firm grasp on biology, physics, and chemistry. 

The humans had only just recently, in the last few dozen star cycles or so, begun to allow other species to work aboard the Ark. Most of my classmates were humans, only a handful--about twelve or so--of us were from other lineages. I was the only Mutantur there. 

On my home world Muotean, we were taught to revere the humans. They were the creators of the Ark, and had since spent many billions of years as the protectors of both non-sapien and sapien life. Yet, in my studies I learned more about how the humans viewed themselves. One class was on the First Histories of humankind, before they even left their planet’s surface. They told us both the horrors and the beauties that the humans created. It was shocking to see the vast contrast not only in the species as a whole but also in individuals. Some of their greatest and most legendary liberators and protectors were also inclined to horrendous violence and destruction. 

Further, I saw in humans that they did not have a singular personality. Far from the stoic, gods-like caricature that I was raised to believe, humans were often whimsical and aloof. Some of my classmates were arrogant, others shy. Some of my teachers were strict and formal, while others were warm and graceful. What most humans seemed to agree with, though, was that they hated the way they were viewed by the other species. A few, of course, loved being seen as omnipotent. But many of my classmates and teachers went out of the way to humble themselves and their species to me and my other classmates. The most pressing thing I learned was that humans are just regular people. 

One human in particular seemed fixated on “de-mythologizing”, as she called it, the human species. Professor Jamie Web was my ethics teacher in the short course I took on the subject. From the start, she seemed to not like me very much as a student. 

The first day in class, she was lecturing about one of humanity's ancient texts—“Rashtrapati” by Nehru—when she suddenly looked my way. She said aloud, “Please let’s save all questions until the end of the lecture.” She turned away and began pacing to the otherside of the hall, continuing as before. When she turned back again and began to pace towards the side of the hall I was sitting in, she stopped and looked directly at me, “Let me remind you, I will answer questions at the end of the lecture.” This same sentence was repeated to me two or three more times. 

“You two rows back, third seat from the left,” she finally said, “I have said to save all questions. What is your name?”

I was dumbfounded, but quietly I replied, “I… I am Newyos.” I could not comprehend why she had chosen to single me out. Had I not worked to get to this internship just like everyone else?

“Well, what is your question since it is so important?”

“I don’t have one, Professor.”

She, as the humans call it, scoffed. I had learned in my studies that it was a sign of annoyance. “Clearly then you have to return to human gestures 101. This is an advanced ethics class. We need to have some common etiquette here. For the future,” she gestured slightly above my head, “raised hands are to indicate a question.”

I glanced slightly behind me, to where my third arm was sitting comfortably upright behind my head. “I… I am…” Professor Web cut me off, “Please that is enough of a distraction.” And she continued her lesson. 

I spent the rest of class in deep anxiety. I had offended this human. I had offended one of the creatures who worked diligently to maintain this Ark. Worse yet, this was a core course, if I failed I would have to end my internship early. Slowly my anxiety drifted into anger, and then back and forth between the two emotions. How could a professor of ethics be so needless and so randomly unkind? What would I do if this bad first impression ended my internship? I would return to Muotean a failure.

Eventually, I decided that I would have to make up for my perceived transgression somehow. I tried to shift my rear hand so that it was not upright, but it kept getting tired outside of its natural state and I had to occasionally return to the position. Each time Web would glance at me with what I recognized as human annoyance. 

After the lesson was over, and all the other students had left, I stayed behind and approached Professor Web at her desk. She didn’t even look up from her stack of papers, “I know you must have many questions. But I am about to have another class come in. Make it quick.” 

“I am sorry Professor,” I said, “I actually do not have any questions.” 

That made her look up, her face was no longer annoyed, it was now a scowl. “Why did you keep your damned hand raised then?”

“It's a Mutantur habit,” I squeaked out, “That is the position that my third arm is comfortable in. Please, please do not fail me because of this. I will study my Human Gestures course again and will try to keep my hand down in future classes.”

The Professor’s face changed, softened I think the humans call it. She suddenly looked, worried? “Oh, I apologize,” she said, “I was… um I was unaware. That is no excuse of course. Please keep your hand in a comfortable position. If you have a question or something--at the end of lectures of course--then just raise one of your other two and I will know what it means.” 

“No, professor,” I said suddenly, worried I had offended her more, “It is an honor to be in your class. I will adjust to the customs on the Ark.”

Her face was, hard?, again. Her two lines of hair above her pair of eyes got close together. She said, “No, no. Newyos, right?” I nodded, a human sign of agreement. She continued, “One thing you will learn in my class is that you cannot let us humans walk all over you. I assure you, we are capable of extremes. I mean hell, you know that just by the very vessel we are in right now. But you mustn’t let us get too proud. You must stand up for yourself among us. It was wrong of me to assume you had the same physiology as myself. I will correct that. You said you were a Mutantur, right?” I nodded again. 

“There is almost certainly a description of your species that I can get a hand on. Gosh, we make all of our non-human students take a course on human gestures, I never thought about the fact that we should be training the staff as well. If you do not mind, I will report this little incident to the rest of the Ethics Council. I’ll work with them on a plan to address this shortcoming.” 

“If you believe that is necessary, Professor,” I replied. It felt good to be vindicated in my original anger. I knew I had not done anything wrong.

“I assure you it is,” she replied sternly, “I won’t mention you by name, or by species, but I think it is best that I bring this to the Council’s attention.”

“I don’t wish for you to get in trouble over a small..” I wanted to say ‘mistake’ but still feared offending her. At that moment I was both still upset that the original mistake had been made, yet still found myself cautious. 

“Oh no, no,” she said, “I am a senior member of the Council. They’ll appreciate my report. Listen, if we humans can’t do the simplest things to ensure the honor and rights of our fellow sapiens, well then we have no hope to maintain the non-sapiens we claim to value.” 

I nodded my head slowly. The gesture was becoming more natural to me. After a moment I said, “Actually, professor. I do have a question if you do not mind.”

“Of course. Please, what is it?”“

How do humans tell which species are sapien and which are non-sapien?”

Professor Web glanced at the large clock on the wall and then said, “Well we don’t have enough time for the full lecture right now.” She laughed, a human sign of amusement. “Listen, I will work it into the lesson for tomorrow.”

I nodded again and began to turn to leave, but I had a nagging feeling, “Professor, if you do not mind. I am still getting used to the human social structure here. I do not want my fellow students to think of me as… as disruptive. Would you mind clarifying to the other students tomorrow about this?”

Professor Web smiled at me, “Yes, yes of course.” 

I thanked her and left the room as other students began trickling in for the next lecture. The next lesson she really did apologize to me in front of the entire classroom. One of the students, another human, tried to debate her on the ethics of the apology. She promptly dissected his, as the humans say, Devil’s advocate. Over the next few weeks we learned alot about the humans that are known as devils among their kind. But we also learned about how caring, how kind, how amazing humans are as well. How much they struggled on their home world to forge a better life for themselves and for other species. Humans are much more complicated than I imagined.

Technically I applied for the Risk &amp; Analytics division of Aladdin Wealth Tech but in my invitation email it said that my interviewers will be part of the Client Team so I guess that where they want to assign me. 

I read on Reddit that AWT Client Team is basically a tech support role which is not what I want to do at all and if it is the case then I would 100% stick with GS as I head great things about their summer program.

What do you guys think ? Would the BlackRock position be with the Client Team and if so which would be better for someone looking to go into Tech / Data Science ?

Not sure where I am at life right now. I'm 22, just graduated college this past June with a degree in Business Information Systems. I worked one internship during my time in college as a Student Analyst and now am working another internship currently as a IT Business Analyst intern (was set to end in August but is now slated to end possibly next year, still an intern though and I don't think there's possibility for conversion to FTE due to budget/lack of open positions).

So far I've been doing a lot of QA and I feel like this is not the type of stuff I want to keep doing for my career. Also I've been feeling down recently especially post-grad that I didn't try to achieve anything in college/push myself for a more rewarding degree. A lot of my friends graduated with CS degrees and are now doing extremely well for themselves.

The job market for entry level Business Analyst positions is not that great right now (or maybe I just suck at searching). I've been thinking recently next year to enroll in a Master's program in Supply chain  to potentially pivot fields. I've also been looking at a post-bacc CS degree (two years ish).

I just don't feel like I know what I'm doing. Living at home kinda (saving money tho) sucks when all your friends are making six figures fresh out of college. Not sure which path is the right (don't necessarily think theres one right path, but also would appreciate any advice from anyone)

Thanks in advance,

z9wc95,1,2022-12-01,#SpotifyWrapped: How Spotify Turned Listening Stats to a Free Ad Campaign,mo_bach,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/z9wc95/spotifywrapped_how_spotify_turned_listening_stats/,"Who would’ve thought that showing users their listening habits would be one of Spotify’s most successful marketing campaigns?

While we don't have this year's stats yet, last year's campaign helped the app rise from the 15th position in the app store to 2nd place!

### How it Started

In 2015, Spotify launched “Year in Music” to show users their top songs and artists at the end of the year. At the time, it was only a webpage that users weren’t really excited to share.

“Year in Music” was renamed “*Wrapped*” in 2016.

Spotify realized the campaign’s potential and turned it into an annual tradition. Every year many teams focusing on marketing, and design, and engineering are spun up months before year-end to work on the campaign.

The project is so big that Spotify has to work closely with the Google Cloud Team since the dataflow jobs are run on Google Cloud (GCP).

&gt;“In 2018, the *Wrapped* Campaign data pipeline had one of the largest Dataflow jobs to ever run on GCP.”

# 2019: The story format

While Wrapped was popular since it was first launched, A few changes in 2019 campaign were instrumental in making it go viral.

* *Wrapped* became accessible through the Spotify app instead of a webpage shared with the users by email.
* The campaign presented insights in stories that can be shared to Instagram in one click.

Users loved the new features and flooded social media with their listening stats.

# Was an intern behind the idea for Wrapped?

Jewel Ham, who interned at Spotify, claimed that she invented the wrapped story concept as an intern project.

Jewel liked *Wrapped* but she wanted to make it more interactive and shareable.

She gave her presentation about the concept on her last day of the internship. She was caught by surprise when she witnessed the concept come to life a few months later!

Spotify rejected Jewel’s claims.

&gt;”While ideas generated during Spotify’s internship program have on occasion informed campaigns and products, based on our internal review, that is not the case here with Spotify *Wrapped*. It’s unfortunate that things have been characterized otherwise.”

I’ll leave it to you to choose who to believe."

But to me, these seem like some of the best jobs out there. They're not as intensive as being an actual trader, usually located in big cities, top pay, and I'm pretty interested in finance casually.

Of course these places are extremely competitive. But I'm a junior right now, and I figure why not give it a shot next year when i'm applying for New grad roles.

I go to T10 CS school, 3.6 GPA, 1 previous internship (defense company), and will be interning somewhere next summer as well (one offer from Unicorn company, but not super well known. still interviewing for other offers as well).

So my resume is certainly not stacked compared to a lot of people applying who probably have better GPAs and FAANG/Trading companies on their resume. But again, no harm in trying. especially cause it seems to me that its a field that would be easier to break into early on. So any tips? other than grind leetcode. maybe a personal project involving stock markets?"

The pay is not important to me right now. And the position at Boeing isn’t strictly SWE and combines some hardware engineering which seems interesting to me. But BofA is more SWE oriented. And there does not seem to be a lot of information out there about how the BofA intern experience is and from what it seems it is a hit or miss depending on your team and I am not sure what team I am on yet. However, my Boeing manager has reached out and is willing to tailor my experience a little in terms of what I am interested in (SWE primarily). Overall, I have not heard a lot of good things about the BofA culture or intern experience which is my main concern.

I've already bagged some internships from pretty good software companies, so I thought my list of experiences/projects was pretty decent, but it seems like most of the finance-related companies don't seem to like my experiences enough—I was ghosted from most places, and at JS and Citadel, they only wanted me to consider me for the Quant trader and Quant Researcher roles respectively, both which I didn't do too well on (I probably should be taking more courses in probability and stats).

So I'm going to apply again next year as a new grad SWE, and I was wondering what some specific courses, programming languages/skills, and projects these firms like to see would be.

Also, if I become more interested in the quant research/dev roles rather than SWE roles (which I'm slightly leaning towards now after having met quite a few of these researchers), what would be the best way to prepare / what are some projects or other stuff I could do?"

In one lab, the postdoc I worked with told me I would get co-authorship, but published an article anyway without me knowing.

My current PI keeps telling me that I should target ""large state schools that have lots of funding and admit lots of students.

I have tried my best to get opportunities to do research but nothing ever worked out. I feel like a total failure. I don't stand a chance at any PhD program.

I'm wondering if taking a cloud solutions architect offer as my final internship at a major cloud provider is a valuable addition to my hands-on coding experience? To be clear, the role involves assisting senior SA's in helping customers take advantage of cloud technologies available to them, so design docs, technical presentations, proof of concepts, and subsidized certifications if I choose to pursue them. I was also told by a team member that the role is flexible, and that it can be more dev focused and technically involved if that's what I show interest in.

I feel like my cloud experience (which I think is valuable in this space) is lacking, so being fully immersed in that area for 3 months is valuable. Also, having a big name on my resume, even in a different type of tech role, could also valuable. Maybe I'm being paranoid, but I'm also afraid of it being a detour or maybe limiting my options too much? To be clear, I'm not hard stuck on wanting to code or do dev necessarily, I'm more worried about being efficient/smart with my career progression, as almost all my experience is in dev so far.

Sorry if any of that came off preachy or like a non-issue, I'm really just looking for some guidance. Should I reject the offer and keep looking or give it a shot? Any advice is greatly appreciated."

The civilian clothes... did not fit terribly well. Seemingly hanging awkwardly on him. Perhaps it was more a matter of barely remembering how to wear civilian clothes. Aleksej had spent most of his life in military service, and he'd never really been much for going out. He'd gone on a few dates here and there... but no one he'd met had really... inspired him. Now though he found himself wishing he'd paid more attention to his shopping purchases. Or had gone to Mama-san, the Pavorus tailor just down from where he stood on the mezzanine of the promenade and gotten a suit tailored up or something. Not that Shalla would care. He probably could have turned up naked and Shalla wouldn't have cared. He stops. ""Actually she probably would have preferred if I turned up naked from what I understand of the galaxy...""

""You'd be wrong about that handsome.""

Aleksej turns to find Shalla looking absolutely jaw dropping in a tied off t-shirt that displayed an eight pack you could grate cheese on, a pair of jeans that rode low enough to hint at some of the more racy underwear that seemed to be the galactic preference when out courting, and a pair of practical leather boots. Her long red hair was tied back in a ponytail and she was smiling with the kind of bright, sunny cheer that made Aleksej think of young ladies from the countryside, not so much innocent or carefree, more enthused with the world and happy to share that enthusiasm with others.

""You know, I never really saw the appeal of muscular women. Or green women for that matter. You are, however, making a strong argument in the favor of both traits.""

Shalla grins even wider and strikes a pose. ""Just for that, you got yourself free tickets to the gun show mister.""

Her powerful arms and back flex in a delightful demonstration of finely honed Horchka anatomy, and Aleksej found himself enjoying the posing. Sure, it was very much showing off her body as part of her pursuit, but Shalla was also having fun. She was enjoying herself, enjoying his company. She desired him, her eyes made no secret of it, but she also was out to enjoy their time... maybe even be his friend, as well as try to jump in bed with him... and that simple difference made Aleksej's heart race a bit.

""You ah... look great."" Aleksej coughs, blushing a bit. He'd been staring, but one glance tells him Shalla didn't mind.

""Glad you enjoyed the show, ask nicely and maybe you can get the full hands-on experience sometime. I give a pretty stellar massage and I'd be glad to swap you. Maybe before drinks in one of those private hot spring baths?""

Aleksej smirks, there's the thirst. ""Would this be before or after you bruised my hips?""

Another grin from Shalla, the amazonian beauty leaning in close. ""Wrong again handsome. That's twice on this date. We can take a bath together, give each other massages, drink some of that sake stuff if you like it... enjoy some intimacy... and we don't have to screw once if you don't want to. See... my troops are calling me Warthog now, my team sergeant says I court like a warthog in rut you see. Not entirely sure what that means, but it's because I'm direct once I see something I want to chase. I don't believe in beating around the bush or sending anonymous letters or some shit... but that don't mean I ain't a lady, no matter how rough around the edges I can be. Especially with you humans around. Yeah war gods, sex gods, blah blah... but you're all love factories from what I'm told and I'm all sorts of interested in loving on you and getting loved on in return if you follow me.""

""...Huh. I didn't expect that.""

""A lot of you humies have seen a lot of the galaxy's worst and most desperate. Girls who almost certainly weren't going be married, and would have children, if they survived to have children, via a sperm bank, sex worker... or rape."" Shalla clearly resists the urge to spit uttering the word. ""Even some of my shield sisters are... a bit on the rougher side, but me? I'm from a decent family, firmly in the middle of the hierarchy. I signed on with Ghorza because I believe in her... and it was good experience, so my parents accepted me deviating from joining a more respectable war band. You can think of it like going to warrior university.""

""...Mercenary internships, never thought about that. I suppose your parents are rather surprised with what's happened now?""

Shalla slaps a thick thigh with a bark of laughter. ""Oh you have no idea. Jumped right up the hierarchy into a damn warrior cult. A couple of my sisters are en route to Centris to enlist right the hell now! But that's besides the point. The point is I was raised to be a lady even if a Horchka lady's a bit more... rough, than your average well heeled woman born to a clan with good standing. So we can court as long as you please without jumping in bed together. Sure I wouldn't mind sooner, even just some cuddling and skinship would be wonderful... but I'm here to seduce you. To sell you on spending a very long time with me as your first wife. I want to befriend you, and I want to love you. So no, I wouldn't have been happy if you showed up au naturale. In my quarters tonight? Maybe, but in public? Well, I angle to make you mine. I wouldn't want you to show off the goods any more than you'd probably want your woman to wander around topless.""

Aleksej can feel the smile blossom on his face as warmth rushes through his veins. He wasn't entirely sure how he felt about courting outside of his own species still, or having multiple wives for that matter, but one thing he was sure of was that Shalla Bulrag knew exactly what to say to endear herself to him.

""Well shall we go then?"" Aleksej offers Shalla his arm, to a delighted chuckle from the big green beauty.

""Being escorted like I'm the prize, now that's something new, but lead on, we have reservations at the closest thing to classy as goes around here without having Nezbet's resources.""

""Oh was that rumor true then?""

Arm in arm Aleksej and Shalla wander down the promenade, taking their time as they chat.

""Yep, took over one of the forward observation lounges, somehow, scrounged up all the vittles needed for a human style gourmet meal. One of the armor repair and maintenance girls who handles FAST's hard suits was actually hired out for the night as a waitress, obviously she saw the whole thing, and made an easy 2000 credits and got a free meal out of it! Same stuff the skipper and Ms. Nezbet ate. It wasn't leftovers, Nezbet planned for five meals to feed the people she brought on to make it happen.""

Aleksej blinks, going through all that in his head. ""That boggles the mind slightly. I've seen her in the mess and generally thought of her as a loud mouthed, glutinous braggart... reminds me of my Uncle Yvgeny actually. So besides the armor tech, who all helped?""

""Chief Noitaka cooked, and probably got paid handsomely, everyone knows she slings the best grub on the ship, even when she's cooking in the mess halls her food's top rate. I can only imagine what she can do with really top quality ingredients. The third person she brought in might be even more impressive though. Somehow Nezbet scared up a live violinist somewhere and had whoever that was performing the whole time. Our intrepid waitress never saw'em, but it was obviously a human. It was very clearly a violin and not some galactic instrument.""

""Hmmm... I didn't know anyone in the crew played violin.""

""Played it extremely well too by all accounts.""

A thought crosses Aleksej's mind. ""Say in a team that small, Nezbet's gotta know who's leaking the details about her romantic date night with the Skipper... do we need to put that armor tech into protective custody or something?""

Shalla shakes her head, smirking. ""Nah, I doubt anything on this ship save Chief Warrant Officer Jaruna's slowing Nezbet down if she's pissed off, but I know a little secret too. Nezbet asked around and found out our sweet little armor tech can't help but run her suck about literally everything and anything.""

""Huh... why would Nezbet want to do tha-"" Aleksej snaps his fingers. ""Oh, of course. She's boasting. She wants people to know. Know of her skill. Know of her talent. Know the lengths she'll go for the Skipper... lengths that have apparently paid off considering she moved her shit into the Den yesterday.""

That gets a nod from Shalla. ""You're on the right track. It's also a challenge. She's wife 18, everyone knows the Skipper ain't open to taking wives past twenty... that number's getting mighty thin. Thinner still if the Skipper's girlfriend's got a snow ball's chance in hell of making herself wife 19. So Nezbet's just thrown the gauntlet. This is the level of effort. The level of work. The level of devotion and attention to detail... what can you do if you think you're worthy of joining the family?""

""Sounds like that Bari gal has her work cut out for her... but I'm here to talk about you, not about the Skipper's wives and girlfriend.""

""Heh... making it hard to be a lady with a talk like that. Feels like I should reward smooth gallantry that puts flutter bugs in my stomach with smooches, but rain check. Redeem it if we start dating.""

With Shalla on his arm they quickly make their way down through the promenade. A boisterous group of Horchka Marines give shouts of encouragement to Shalla and a few cat calls for Aleksej from the bar they were sitting out front of... but then immediately get out of their chairs and snap to as a little man with a big smile and Asian features walks up. He says something to the girls that Aleksej can't overhear, then turns and salutes the two officers. Aleksej returns it, and the little man turns to leave, revealing a massive combat knife riding at the 6'o clock position on his belt. The young Horchka return to their drinks, acting significantly calmer.

""...Who was that? I have never seen someone put young enthusiastic enlisted troops in their place with a barely whispered word. I didn't even hear what he said.""

""I did."" Shalla chuckles. ""He told them that young ladies should comport themselves better, and implied their fathers would be disappointed. That was Sergeant Major Gurung, he's a father himself, and a lifelong Ghurka commando.""

""Will wonders never cease?""

The rest of the walk passes without incident, just talking about their various hobbies, things from Earth Shalla had gotten into recently, things from the galaxy she thought Alexsej might like. There was endless conversation available when talking with an alien with a sound mind. The simpler people were like simple people anywhere, and they were fine as is, but Aleksej needed to be engaged mentally, both by potential friends and by potential lovers.

Finally they arrive at their destination. It wasn't much, but the food was good, the room was quiet, the booths all set up to promote privacy... and they served some very good Earth cuisine. That was honestly more than Aleksej had ever expected while eating on a starship making her way through the void.

It being a special night, Aleksej decides on a treat. ""I'll take the double cheese burger. Extra lettuce, tomato and onions but no pickles.""

""Side of fries or a salad? We have other options if you check the menu."" The waitress is grinning extra wide, apparently cottoning on that this was a first date immediately.

""Fries... and a salad. Might as well eat something green to offset all the grease.""

""Hah. Imagine worrying about all that.""

""You only get one body... or I suppose you used to. Still getting used to a world of miracles.""

""Life's hard in the part of your world you grew up in right? Even by Cruel Space standards."" Shalla leans in, clearly a bit concerned.

""It's not so bad... there's always worse places, but Eastern Europe has her problems, as does my homeland. I... ah. That was fast!""

Aleksej can't help but raise an eyebrow at the wildly fast turn around. The waitress is gone again in a blink, leaving them to their food as Aleksej starts to tell a story about his grandmother's cottage. A quick lift of the bun to spread some American style sauces he'd gotten used to while training for the Dauntless however reveals a set of pickles pressed into the bun.

""Kurac. Ah well I'll just...""

Shalla holds a hand out to stop him.

""No, you're paying for it, they should get your order right, what if you were allergic or something.""

""But I'm not allergic, really Shalla it's...""

But it's far too late, Shalla's raised a hand flagging down their waitress.

""Excuse me, he said no pickles...""

As the conversation continues, the stoic Slav can't help but allow himself a small smile. It seems his life certainly wouldn't get boring so long as Shalla was around.

za9ull,0,2022-12-01,Choosing Internship Offers,WildChicken449,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/za9ull/choosing_internship_offers/,"I have two competing internships and am having trouble deciding which one I should go with. For a little bit of background, I am a first year student who is just completing my first semester of University.  I have a bit of experience from high school, but these are my first real internship offers. 

The first offer is from Lockheed Martin as a 4 month internship. It is a fully remote role and it seems like the work is interesting enough, but the pay is lower than I would like. I enjoyed interacting with the team throughout the hiring process and the work seems to be fairly standard software engineering work.

The second offer is an 8 month technology internship with a natural resources (mining) company. The position is hybrid with a 1-2 days a week in the office about 30 minutes from my location. I enjoyed the interview process, but my main concerns are about the type of work and length of the internship. It seems like a lot of the work is about automating different tasks and integrating some in house services, rather than more programming and software engineering. I am also unsure about an 8 month internship as it locks me in for longer, especially if I don't enjoy it. The pay is a good bit higher than the offer from LM, but I am not sure if it is worth it with LM being a big name and a more traditional role. 

I am looking for any sort of advice about things I should consider or any thoughts on either of the offers. Thanks!"

zad3rg,6,2022-12-02,Would a solutions architect internship at a major tech company be valuable for career progression beyond university?,someethingrandom2,cscareerquestionsCAD,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsCAD/comments/zad3rg/would_a_solutions_architect_internship_at_a_major/,"I currently have 4 full-stack SDE co-ops under my belt and I'm heading into my final year of university. I'm wondering if taking a cloud solutions architect offer as my final internship at a major cloud provider is a valuable addition to my hands-on coding experience? To be clear, the role involves assisting senior SA's in helping customers take advantage of cloud technologies available to them, so design docs, technical presentations, proof of concepts, and subsidized certifications if I choose to pursue them. I was also told by a team member that the role is flexible, and that it can be more dev focused and technically involved if that's what I show interest in.

I feel like my cloud experience (which I think is valuable in this space) is lacking, so being fully immersed in that area for 3 months is valuable. Also, having a big name on my resume, even in a different type of tech role, could also valuable. Maybe I'm being paranoid, but I'm also afraid of it being a detour or maybe limiting my options too much? To be clear, I'm not hard stuck on wanting to code or do dev necessarily, I'm more worried about being efficient/smart with my career progression, as almost all my experience is in dev so far.

Sorry if any of that came off preachy or like a non-issue, I'm really just looking for some guidance. Should I reject the offer and keep looking or give it a shot? Any advice is greatly appreciated."

What should I do?",dCatz77,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/zaebfe/the_wife_of_my_doctor_thinks_that_i_had_an_affair/,"He is my family doctor. I met him in this summer, when I decided to change my last doctor for another one. I only went once to his consult, and yes there was a good chemistry between us but nothing more. He is very well know for being a good doctor and for always having a nice charming personality. 

I recently started an internship in a company that is very close to the hospital. My teamworkes always goes to the same cafeteria, where also a lot of people that works in the hospital goes too. Well, at the begining I didn't realice that his wife was there since I didn't knew her. But over this last month it seem more and more obvious. She and her friends were always sitting very near where I was, and they were only staring at me without saying, drinking or eating anything for the entire time that I was there. This situation has been scalating to a situation where her friends are following me, asking for personal information at my workplace, waiting for me outside when I leave and maybe other things that I don't want to know. The most disturbing thing is that someone is passing information of me to his wife and I don't think that is him. I don't know who this person is and I don't have any way of knowing.

Also this situation had drawn other's people attention and I feel like there is a bad rumour going on. I don't know what to do, I don't have proof of this. If I go and I ask directly what is going on, I don't think that people are going to be honest. I don't want to go to my doctor and ask him because it feels very unconfortable to do. 

I have to mention that I live in Spain so laws in here might be different.  My job in here is temporary, and I don't have a relationship with the company. I could hold on until I leave and it disappears. I'm going to leave soon, but I'm starting to feel a lot of anxiety that is affecting my performance. I understand that I probably should let this go, but I can't stop thinking about what is going on, and why am I in this absurd situation. To those of you that gives me the advice of changing doctor, I have to say that I'm not really sure that by doing this, it will go away. There is a lot of prejudice going on here that is not going to disapear. I am an attractive 27 years old female. For this people, this means that I'm a whore. I don't understand what is going on. Moreover, why should I change? I didn't do anything wrong. What can I do? 

I feel like everyone is lying and manipulating here for their on good. My thoughts is that I should wait until I got any proof that I can use to defend myself, but it's very annoying to have to wait for something to go really bad. It's unfair. This people knows what they are doing."

zaglpv,11,2022-12-02,Post Internship Clarity,HotWolverine2846,PinoyProgrammer,https://www.reddit.com/r/PinoyProgrammer/comments/zaglpv/post_internship_clarity/,"So about a week ago I finished my internship as I posted about 3 months ago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PinoyProgrammer/comments/wztolk/when_is_an_unpaid_internship_worth_it/). This is gonna be a long post, semi-kwento, semi-asking for advice. Planning on making this account a journal of sorts.

**Short version:**

Things that I learned or was exposed to at my first internship:

* AGILE (user stories, tickets, daily standups)
* WSL (Linux commands, making small scripts, being comfortable with just a terminal)
* MongoDB (integrating it to written code, navigating with MongoDB playground in VSCode)
* Node.js (making an API via Express)
* Apache Kafka (making consumers/producers using the KafkaJS library)
* Streamlit (data visualization, Python Pandas)

**Questions:**

* Can I apply as a junior/entry level with my current skillset?
   * Know a bit about Python/Django, basic React, and Docker as well.
* How do you practice something like reliability and scalability? This kept coming up when I was learning Kafka, it doesn't seem like you can practice this part on your own like you would with something like MERN? Like do you just simulate a million transactions to test it out or??
* Thoughts on learning Java Spring/Boot? It seems like a lot of jobs with Apache Kafka are in Java, so I wonder if this would be worth it?
* I quite liked working on tech that is used by other tech, what field of CS is this? If I'm correct it would be system design?
* How realistic is it to gun for a 40k+ salary if I have 2 internships by the time I graduate? This first one is just voluntary

**Long Version:**

So I interned (unpaid) at a local startup and was assigned in a team making a minimum viable product, so not out to market yet. I was a data science intern so I was assigned to mostly making new features and updating an internal data visualization tool that they had for the MVP. I was working alone on this thing but I also interacted with other interns working on the frontend/backend of the MVP. Work hours were flexible and WFH, we were allowed to clock in as much or as little hours that we wanted.

Our team lead was incredibly nice and welcoming, they were the one that interviewed me as well. We would be given time to familiarize ourselves with the code base and learn what we had to learn, but other than that there wasn't really any hands on training. After being briefed about AGILE we were given tickets and expected to finish them on our own, but we would be asked if we had roadblocks in the daily standups. Maybe a bit much for a bunch of interns but we managed lol. Though I don't really know what training in IT/CS looks like, maybe that was training? Idk really

For the first month I as just learning about the code base and when I was comfortable enough I was assigned some tickets for the data visualization tool. We had our own branches in GitLab to work with and in my case I ended up having to make a new repo on my own, so we had full privileges on the repos. Probably not a good idea but this was an MVP so I didn't pay too much attention to it. I implemented a bunch of new features here and there and fixed some bugs, learned about Python Pandas. Throughout this whole ordeal I realized that data science isn't for me HAHAHAHA I thought I would enjoy data science and analysis but it turns out I enjoyed more the making of new stuff and making it work, less of interpreting data to information. Glad to have gotten that out of the way as early as now.

Halfway in the internship I was asked by my team lead to learn about message queues since we had a problem with an API we were using. That was new to me, the team lead just asks you to learn something and then you try to do it HAHAHA is this how it's done in the work force?

Anyways I learned about message queues and landed on Apache Kafka, learned as much as I can about the tech and then tried implementing it to our MVP, shout out to donvitocodes I used their blog post as a reference lol. Ended up creating a microservice that queues API requests and saves responses to MongoDB, used JavaScript to create the producers and consumers. Right now that feature is still experimental so I don't know know successful it actually was in fixing the initial problem but I was able to get it up and running so I would consider that a W.

After this I was a bit stagnant as our internship was nearing completion so my lead didn't want to start another sprint and I didn't have any other tickets/tasks left.  So I just learned a bit more about Kafka,  what more you can do with it, and microservices.

Overall I would say the internship is definitely worth it even though I was unpaid as I learned a fair bit.  I enjoyed learning about Kafka the most as it allowed me to be exposed to different parts of a software/product and I would honestly say this opened a new world for me and I would like to pursue that further. I also learned a bit about what type of developer I want to be and I was exposed to how software development is done by companies.

I wish for my next internship:

* First I would love to get paid JAJAJAJAJAJA
* Would like to intern at a company that uses something like Kafka, so I could learn how they apply it to their needs because it seems to be pretty hard to find a project/tutorial that uses Kafka unlike with other tech. There's tons of projects using MERN or Django which you could learn from for example.
* Would like to be under a senior developer so my code can get reviewed, since I feel like my code was dogsmear. As I was working on my own repos, I didn't really know if my code was readable or not since it was readable to me.
* Preferably work from home again, since I don't live in the metro and would rather not be there anytime soon though this may be unrealistic in the long term.

I don't have plans yet to apply to another internship, as I'm in my first semester of my 3rd year in uni, we just started making our thesis and it's taxing so I would like to focus on that. Would also just like to chill first and consolidate what I learned so far (Node, Express, MongoDB, Kafka, Pandas, Django), maybe learn more about React so I could be a fully fledged MERN developer 🔥🚀. Will also just spend my free credits on Confluent and play with KafkaStreams lol.

I'm a 23 years old guy from Italy. I graduated in IT 6 months ago here in Italy.

If you don't know how it works here, you have basically two types of degree, the ""triennale"" that's three years of studying about basic concepts (I've done programming, DB, algorithms, calculus, architecture, network ecc.), and then you can go for the ""magistrale"" that's two additional years you can study focusing on a specific topic (cybersec, robotics, AI ecc.). I got a ""triennale"" degree and don't actually know if it translates to ""bachelor"" degree outside of Italy.

My work experience until now is the following:

\- 1 year of internship in a small local IT business as a sysadmin apprentice. I've been doing many things like hardware assembly, os installation (mainly Linux and FreeBSD), storage configuration, network configuration, a little bit of programming and scripting, vpn server installation and so on. I did this while I was in my last year of university.

\- 6 months (still working) as a DevOps consultant for a multinational business based in Milan (I'm far from Milan and work from home). We work in the healthcare sector and provide various softwares for our customers and integrations between them.

Now my point is, I would really like to work in cybersecurity (specially penetration testing). I do a lot of tryhackme and vulnhub machines in my free time. My university offers a ""magistrale"" degree in cybersec, but I don't know if I should take that or pursue a more ""private"" path (I was thinking about getting CompTIA certifications like Security+ and PenTest+ to start).

Can you give me some advice? What is the best path I should take to achieve a good career in cybersec?

I am an engineering student in the third semester, trying to pursue electronics and communication engineering. Out of 7 subjects this semester I'm sure I'm failing 6.

I don't have any skills in particular like web dev or data analytics or anything that may get me an internship. 

I have wasted my parents money and will never be able to live down the guilt of being a failure. Everyone that i know in this college is not finding it as tough as me to clear exams well. 

My parents are extremely supportive and i have only been a disappointment to them throughout. 
I cannot stand the thought of graduating in 5 years and not being placed. I want to pursue an MBA but like everything else, I'll fail in that as well because my board marks aren't high and my GPA will be around 4.

The only thing stopping me from ending everything is the fear of surviving, hence being a failure in that as well. I have not ruled it out yet though.

After graduating with a level 8 computing degree I completed an internship as a frontend dev and I am now  working as a cms developer at a design agency but looking to move into a backend role. Java is something that I didn't focus on in college so I am looking for a short course to bring me up to speed before I apply for any roles. 

Has anyone done any courses like this or has any advice on what to do / where to start to become a backend dev?

I have so far struggled to get an offer from any company yet. Prior to this year, I had no Coding experience or any idea about the job market. I knew applying season started early but I literally didn't know how to code so I didn't start applying until late Sept and October. I have also sent in a big batch of Apps this month. Many of the companies I applied to auto-denied because of my resume(no past internships) and my Grad Year. Many of the OAs were so hard for my current skill level. The ones who were freshmen specific have gone okay. Microsoft Explore and Google STEPS haven't gotten back to me yet(I applied in sept/early oct). The only company I had a good shot at so far was Amazon. I got to the final round but got waitlisted on November 8th because of the hiring freeze, they did say I was ""qualified and talented"" though, so hopefully when/if they start hiring interns I make it in.  I recently applied to a few more freshmen opportunites from big companies, so I'm still waiting to hear from those.

I was wondering if it was normal for freshmen to struggle this much to get a SWE/SDE internship"

I unfortunately cannot afford my therapist anymore and my last resort is going to school counselors. Although they’re only interns it would be helpful to just sit down and talk to someone about life. 

In the beginning of the year I told the head of the counseling center that I can’t afford therapy anymore and I asked if I could potentially see any of the interns here as backup and she didn’t rlly answer my question instead, she gave me useless resources and support groups for people with depression and borderline personality disorder. I technically already “pay” for therapy services as it comes in my tuition (they literally tell us to take advantage of that). She also gave me resources for low cost therapy, why pay for therapy when It comes included in my tuition and I can just get it for free here? You know?

I really need this help. I have been suicidal, depressed to the point where I don’t want to do anything anymore. It’s really affecting my day to day life. I am worried that it’s going to get to the point where I end my life and I really don’t want it to get to that point :/. I like life I just need someone to talk to and they’re not hearing me out. 

Please help? What do I do?! Any advice is appreciated."

No name (not even T250) liberal arts school with 3.0 GPA. No prior internship. Decided to graduate a semester early. After failing to get an internship for this summer, I spent the majority of this year trying to create projects for my resume. Ended up with 1 fairly large project and 3 smaller projects to fill up space on my resume.

Started applying in August, and sent out over 300 applications by the end of September using the New Grad github repo. Received 6 interviews: 1 offer, 2 cancelled myself, 1 rejection, 1 ghosted (large fintech never showed up to interview, never rescheduled), and 1 still upcoming. TC for offer just under 100k at MCOL.

I know the current job market is terrible. I may not have received a FANG-level offer, but I consider myself extremely lucky to be in this position. It is a numbers game, one can say the more you apply the more chances you have to get lucky. Good luck!"

At my university we don't have 3 months of holidays in a row, so I would need to take a semester off, and I don't know if it's better to do the internship or move on with university since all my friends that always help me with homework and to study would move on without me, but I also don't want to graduate without real experience and then have a hard time getting a job, so I wanted to seek some advice.

Any insights would be appreciated.

For context, I am a fresh grad and I have been job hunting for roughly 2-3 months now. I'm mainly looking for a data analytics position, and it's all going well naman. I'm continuously being invited for interviews and even got a few JOs na. Kaya lang I can't help but feel disappointed or unsatisfied sa mga JOs na nakukuha ko. Although okay naman yung benefits and okay naman yung team + company + possible career growth, parang feeling ko ang baba palagi ng offers sakin. Be it local or international companies, most of the offers I'm getting have a base salary of &lt;27k. Napapaisip tuloy ako if tanga lang ba ako or what. Also, di ko rin mapigilan macompare yung sarili ko from my peers who got relatively good offers (&gt;32k base salary) agad right out of college. Especially considering na we all got almost the same background naman - same degree, same orgs, same projects. I even have more internships than them. 

I don't know. For some reason, I cant help but feel na I deserve better than what I'm getting now. Na if my classmates can do it, bakit ako hindi? Pero at the same time, I'm very much aware that I'm still a fresh grad and I should be thankful na I'm getting JOs at all. Some might even say na goods na yung offer sakin and may others nga na mas mababa pa yung nakukuha. I know I can continue job hunting naman until I find something that suits me. However, target ko talaga magstart ng Jan 2023 and I'm running out of time. Ayoko pabigat sa bahay, and nakakahiya na manghingi ng money from fam knowing na I could get a job na. At this point, parang no choice tuloy but to settle with what I have on hand. Pero I don't know talaga. I want better. But, I'm starting to think na I'm too entitled, but whenever I do I feel invalidated as well."
zawecf,54,2022-12-02,2022/2023 Internship Summary : Microsoft SWE Intern Offer &amp; More,feliciathegote,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/zawecf/20222023_internship_summary_microsoft_swe_intern/,"Hey y'all, 

I wanted to summarize my experience with recruiting this season! For context, I am a non CS major (but still tech degree) that likes to code. I'm not cracked at Leetcode like some others in the subreddit either. I honestly got super fortunate with my results this season, so here it is! 

# Background: 

**Education:** Junior majoring in bachelors of cybersecurity (3.8 something GPA) at a school no one cares about, and a state that I knowww y'all don't care abt. 

**Experience:** 

\- 1 paid internship. Its not a technical company but its a well-known household name. Here I mostly do software engineering work, and work at a high level/surface level of some AI/ML projects, mobile app dev, and building desktop applications for the company. 

\- 1 unpaid internship at a AI/ML startup. Wrote a few lines of code in python and worked with some APIs 

**Projects:** SwiftUI todo list mobile app with basic functionalities; database, decent ux &amp; design, etc.

# Statistics 

I've been super comfortable at my current internship, because the company allows me to return to work for them every semester. Ealier in the year, I was moderately eager about applying to different companies even if they paid around the same that my current one does. I just wanted to experience something different! Buttt when I made this grave mistake of finding this subreddit :D I saw how much companies could pay interns. After seeing that, I wasn't really interested in switching to a company that was super similar in pay / prestige. I probably applied to a little under 60 applications and got fortunate with my results! 

I got 7 virtual interviews, and 4 offers!

&amp;#x200B;

*Technical stuff*

\--------------------

**Leetcode stats: 38 Easies, 21 Mediums, 0 Hards. I focused on blind 75 (didn't even finish it).** I am cheeks at leetcode. Like no joke. Well, maybe I don't totally suck, but im the type that can conceptualize a problem and its solution, but coding it out is a wholeeee other beast for me. 

**Codesignal:** I'd be fortunate if I even solved the second question before the timer ended lol. I understood the questions, but my raw leetcoding skills were not good enough. I failed a tonnn of OAs but I wasn't sad, because I knew the low effort I was putting into studying was a good indicator of my score on the OAs.

&amp;#x200B;

*Behavioral stuff*

\----------------------

NOW THIS IS WHERE I SHINE!!! I believe my ability to connect with the interviewer, communicate very well, and stay super calm was my saving grace this season. For one of my rejections, a recruiter reached out to me saying even though my interview said I lacked the technical skills they wanted, the feedback on my communication &amp; ability to take pointers/tips on how to improve my solution was exceptional. They said they want me to reach back out to them about interviewing for new grad, and if I forget, they said they'll personally reach out to me to apply haha (and that felt pretty good! so NOW I'm in my technical-skill-training-arc to prep for next season lol). 

&amp;#x200B;

ps: Behavioral and technicals below are ranked by difficulty. 1 being easy peasy, 10 being legendary difficulty.

**Thoughts:** All behavioral, smooth process.

**Behavioral:** ez. no technicals. ALL behavioral. super chill process, basic questions about my internship experience, ""tell me ab a time when..."", etc. I think they really liked my willingness to learn and my upbeat attitude about experiencing new things! They also acknowledged that I did my research v well on their company values and stuff.

# Local State Financial department 

**Position:** 2022 IT intern 

**Timeline:** Applied roughly a week before the following date (cant find exact date) &gt; 7/5 Contacted for interview &gt; 7/15 Interview &gt; Offer 7/15 same day 

**Thoughts:** All behavioral, smooth process. It was 2 interviewers. This one felt like an ego boost tbh bc I kind of knew I wouldn't accept the offer, just wanted more interview experience to get in the mood for the season. 

**Behavioral:** another all behavioral process. standard behavioral questions &amp; they really liked the conversations we had. 

**Technical OA:** N/A

**Technical Interview:** N/A

# Microsoft 

**Position:** 2023 SWE Intern 

**Timeline:** Applied few days after application opened (cant get exact date) &gt; Contacted for phone interview 9/16 &gt; Phone on 10/9 &gt; Final interview on 11/9 

**Thoughts:** This is the best experience I have had with interviewing anywhere. My first interviewer was such a joy to interact with. Super positive &amp; was eager to see how I approached each problem. Second interviewer was also super cool and we had plenty of time to chat after I optimally solved the question. For the record, I didn't fully solve a few of the questions they gave me. But it seemed they cared more about me engaging them in my thought process, why I thought the way I did, and always outlining my thoughts before coding them. It felt so good.

I thought I got rejected bc my action center wasn't working, like, at all. I spent over a week stressing on whether or not I got the offer. At one point I convinced myself I didn't care about the offer bc I gave it my v best.

Turns out, action center was broken on Safari. LOL. Went to chrome and saw 'completed' in my action center. got the offer a few days after that. Turns out, my action center turned to 'completed' ONE DAY after the interview. words couldn't describe how relieved I felt haha. 

tips: 

1. you'd better do blind 75 
2. look on Glassdoor to see how other interviews went for people

**Behavioral:** ez.

**Thoughts:** OA review + behaviorals. Nothing told me I did anything terribly wrong or even messed up terribly at any point. Vibe was a little off with one of the interviewers, idk exactly why LOL. Also not sure exactly why I got the rejection, but who cares, we ball.  

**Behavioral:** 6/10. great conversations about my experiences and conceptual security &amp; OOP questions. interviewer said I answered them all correctly and I enjoyed our conversation.

**Timeline:** Applied 8/30 &gt; Contacted for phone interview 9/20 &gt; phone on 9/30 &gt; 3 final round interviews 10/18 &gt; rejection 10/24

**Thoughts:** yea this one was dead before I even joined the interview LOL. I am good at basic/intermediate sql, but they were getting into some wild stuff id never seen before during that technical. there was also conceptual questions about data science concepts that flew wayyyy over my head even tho I tried my best to answer. I feel that if someone was an actual data science major they'd fare much much better. I believe the rejection is totally fair.

**Behavioral:** 3/10. great conversation. really enjoyed this one, super laid back, typical behavioral questions.

**Technical OA:** N/A

**Technical Interview:** 100/10. by the last interview I WAS 1 HP😭

**Timeline:** Applied 9/22 &gt; Hackerrank sent 10/13 &gt; Took on 10/21 &gt; interview 11/8 &gt; rejection week after (cant find exact date) 

**Thoughts:** I really did choke the technical. Took me a while to grasp the question bc I had to pretty much write it all down myself, think of a data structure for the input &amp; explain that all in just a few mins. the time really flew by. my interviewer was super patient and helped a bunch with nudging me in the right direction. couldn't solve it 100% in the end, but this was a very valuable learning experience for me. 

**Behavioral:** N/A 

**Technical OA:** 7/10

**Technical Interview:** 7/10

# Final Thoughts:  

* **I ended up accepting the offer from Microsoft (duh!)** 
* I am very proud of myself for sticking with things! Tbh my odds of getting something like a FAANG were super low. I got super fortunate through the whole process. But thankfully, instead of my mind being riddled with imposter syndrome, I feel accomplished. Because like anyone else, I put the effort I could into my preparation! 
* Though I stated prior that I used python in my internships, I really only did a few lines of code (which where just modified solutions from stack overflow). I didn't know python really, like at all LOL. Im a java guy. I don't like it but I know it the best. I started learning python in September of this year and forced myself to get the hang of it for interviews. Maybe this is why I was a little sketchy during these technicals LOL. (it wasn't a total bloodbath tho cause once u learn ur first programming language, the subsequent ones are easier to get the hang of) 
* do leetcode more often and spread it out among a few months. don't cram like I did it (few weeks). doesn't really work.
* Put IMPACT in your resume. Saying you 'did' something or 'executed' something is cool but actually put numbers in there and make it bold (**and use** **jakes** **resume**).
* apply through your school's coop program. process is faster and it feels like I had better odds by doing this. 
* get referrals from your friends who work for local companies!!!
* stop waiting and just apply early. If I had waited, I never would have been ready.
* SMILE SMILE SMILE 
* wear a suit 

now I can finally. touch. some. grass. during this winter break I will be watching tv all day, getting back to playing video games, snowboarding again w my friends &amp; finally getting enough sleep. im not touching leetcode until next year. I feel very grateful to have accomplished something like this as a non computer science major who just likes to code. when I showed my parents my offer we all went crazy in the living room! they were like 'huhh?? they pay interns this much now?? well done!' I feel happy to show them something great came out of them coming to this country to give their kids better opportunities. 

I wish the best to all the rest of you csmajors :) this subreddit is the best and worst thing that's happened to me this year!

For being so young, I feel at least 3 times my age already given everything I've experienced in life. I've survived immense trauma and painful disappointments. I've been underemployed since I graduated college. I had such big aspirations for my career life post college, but none of them came to be. I studied what I did (English) because I loved it and it was the only subject in high school that I excelled in. Since I was in college, I did everything right: I never partied or did drugs, never got into relationships, maintained strong friendships, dedicated myself fully to networking and my studies. I had amazing internships at top companies, I networked, I applied to countless jobs. Landed one and it was a fail, but I persevered. I feel like I've tried everything and nothing is working. I'm at a point where I have faced so many disappointments, I feel fragile. I've been strong and resilient for so long, that now it's like my body refuses to try something new. Because what if I do and it fails? Again? I'm afraid that if I encounter another failure regarding a career decision that I will certainly end my life. This is why I don't think going back to school is a good idea.

I never thought my 20s would be like this. Growing up, the only thing that kept me alive was the hope that one day, things would get better as soon as I graduated. I was in the best mental state I've ever been in, I was consistently content (as content as one can be - life is uncertain and no one's happy 24/7), in college. Everything before that was a living hell and now everything after that has been a nightmare I can't seem to wake up from no matter how hard I try.

Now that I'm here, at 26, and things are still going downhill, I'm finding myself questing if my life is worth living anymore. I want to live, I have passions that I would love to execute, but I also need to pay my bills and take off the immense financial burden I feel like I've been to my parents. I don't want them to continue to be afraid of if I'm going to be able to survive financially. My job does not pay enough and despite meeting with a career coach, getting my resume reviewed and fixed countless times, networking as much as possible, nothing is changing or moving. This has been the case since the day I graduated college. I really do not know how much more I can take, but I don't think it's much. I feel like I have paralysis with taking another new step because of how much I've been burned already. My heart breaks for myself because no matter how hard I try, nothing is improving. I'm doing everything I can to help myself and nothing is working.

Can someone please tell me it gets better? I have seriously tried everything possible to change my life, including seeking mental health support with a therapist, applying numerous times a day for jobs, networking, spending time with friends and family, staying active with my faith/religious community, etc. Nothing is helping."

B- Or I can simply leave co-op right now, study winter 23 find an **internship** for summer 23, study fall 23, study winter 24, and **graduate** summer 24! There is a problem with this method, it is riskier, 1 - my manager at my co-op right now wants me back but won't take me back on a regular internship, has to be co-op, 2- I think it is easier to get an internship when you're in a co-op workterm as a lot of jobs require that you be with a co-op program. This method is more enticing as I want to graduate faster and start making adult money

What would you do?"

I was always the smart kid in school, skipped a grade, graduated early, high hopes all that 

I moved out a year ago after a fight with my parents abt my future (success is everything to them, happiness is secondary, it’s a heritage or honour thing or sth) I tried applying for jobs but I acted really dumb in all of my internships, I failed almost every task and none were fun 

I started studying forensics and I dropped out because it was too much maths I couldn’t handle 

I got into law school and now I’m failing almost every assignment 

I developed sth like agoraphobia and barely visit lectures now and I can’t catch up on material bc it seems incoherent to me, I just can’t do it, it’s too hard. I’m gonna drop out soon. 

I have no friends because I barely go out, I don’t have a hobby that’s fun to me because I suck at everything and it just makes me feel talentless, plus I can barely leave my apartment so that’s that 

I tried to reach out everywhere, my Unis counselling program, my old therapist, new therapists in my area, hell I even asked my bitch of a mother (medical professional) if she knew any contacts I could try 
Everyone was booked and busy or didn’t know how to help me (very traumatic childhood with childhood sexual assault, was told I should’ve consulted forensic psychiatry as a child already bc now my case was too “specialised” or some bullshit)

My parents said I’m dramatic and I need to suck it up, my mother even started teasing me about how I should finally drop out and rot on the streets like I’m bound to 

If I drop out, it’s over. I have no other job perspective, I don’t have hobbies or interests. 
My anxiety makes me physically ill as well and I can’t leave the house without having to throw up or faint. I’m a dumb excuse of a human being, pathetic. 
I’m going to fucking hang myself soon or sth. 

Yeah just wanted to blurt this out there bc I feel like I’m gonna pass out soon"

I just had a wild year: 
• Present- Late 10.22: 
+ At the pre-licensing stage of an offer to become an insurance agency owner after being recruited on LinkedIn by the person who will mentor me. High ranked vetted company. Mentor has been in role 18 months, has a small team she’s building with a five-year plan to retirement. Told me the company allows folks in my role to retire in 5 years. Will require hard work but can make same annual income as most recent job. When I pass pre-licensing (either 12.14.22 or before 1.14.23) I will start a 3 month paid internship of $4000/month. If I pass, I get a $5000 signing bonus. 

+ Bought/enrolled in a short-term, nationally accredited certification program for the practice I want to do as a side business the rest of my life (coaching) 

+ Bought &amp; enrolled in HealthCare.gov health care - will cost $700/month

+ Took out a personal loan to pay all bills + mortgage until 12.22

• 10.14.22 - 2.14.22: Quit a high stress job that almost doubled my previous salary. Slight career change/impact. Big hit in my confidence &amp; sense of self. But, saw this as an opportunity to go for the life I think I want at this stage of my life. 

• Jan 2022 - Aug 2021: as I entered the 8th year of a job role I built from the ground up &amp; had a clear team/scope of work, I realized I don’t have any savings &amp; I will never make enough in this role due to org policy. Had an opportunity to ask for a new position to be created with appropriate pay - was told idea was fully supported but there is no guarantee. Can’t retire for 11 years minimum (I am 49F). 

+Colleague said I needed professional help for emotional support (Aug 2021). Took 6 week FMLA 8.21-10.21: found psychiatrist, psychologist, new GYN &amp; got them all on board with my PCP. Affirmed both burnout &amp; perimenopause with severe symptoms. Late Oct 2021: another colleague appointed to a state cabinet position asked me to apply for her job (same org, different field). Was offered position over 50 applicants, finalist with internal candidate. Left job 1 Jan 2021 to start job 2 a month later. 

Summary: I am a mid-to-late career professional (29 years). I’m burnout &amp; have been since 2008, seeking refreshment, support, direction &amp; appropriate value. I may be entering a new stage of life as I head into becoming 50 years old where I own 2 businesses that allow me to work from home, earn my worth, save + invest, and rebuild my reputation &amp; self-value based off of the best of the last 8 years (relationships that can be connected to for one of the two businesses). 

I think I can create a five-year plan where as I plan to retire in 5 years from the insurance business, I establish the coaching business and create a work/life balance foundation for the first time in my life. 

QUESTIONS: 

• Have any of you done something like this at this age or know someone who has? 

• If so, what is their quality of life: do you/they really have a true focus on their personal relationships? Do you see them as who they are &amp; not someone who works all the time?

Got a ton of well wishes on PMs (in addition to an equal amount of insults and rapist and pedophile accusations…) and a lot of you asked for an update on meeting her parents so I figured this would be easier instead of individual PMs back. 



Got reservations to a nice place for brunch to finally meet her parents. Her oldest brother decided to join us too.

Overall the meeting went ok I think. Not my absolute best meet the parents situation but I was ready for the worst. When the waitress asked what we wanted to drink her brother ordered a mimosa and when she turned to me next asking if I’d like the same my gf answered for me and said I’ll just have water lol. Her brother laughed and said that’s probably for the best. Cheeky comment but I think he probably just finds the whole situation funny now. 

Highlight was definitely my gf’s mother. She loved me, mid way through the meal when her brother got up to use the restroom she actually took his seat to sit next to me so we could talk more. Super affectionate and very sweet women. Even if every guy in her family hated me I think I’d be fine if I had her mother on my side since it seems like she’s really the one who calls the shots in the family. Invited me to spend Christmas with the family and I had no choice but to accept.

Her dad is a bit of a grump.  Would’ve been an awkward and tense meal for sure if her mother wasn’t there.  Asked me a lot of questions about me, my work, how we met, my family, friends, etc.  One thing he touched on that I feel he wanted to grill the gf about was the timing of when we got together. I mentioned before that she’s only had one bf before that the whole family knew about. The bf was also Albanian so the dad probably liked him more I think. He was curious on when she ended it with him and we got together. Honestly it was pretty tight, they’d been long distance and hadn’t seen each other for close to 2 years when we started 9 months ago. Her mom immediately told him to cut it out and changed the subject.

Overall I’m pretty happy. She’s practically moved in already, I’m good with her family, my mom already loves her. 









ORIGINAL POST BELOW
TIFU by telling my gf’s three older brothers about how rough their sister likes it

GF (21f) will be moving in with me (29m) soon  and just told her family about me this week. I’ll be having brunch with her parents soon but her brothers invited me over for beers at a dive bar tonight to get to know me. 

Started off very formal with intros and us just getting to know each other. They weren’t very friendly and just and pretty much just grilled me for over 2 hours about how we met with her interning at my office, why we’re moving in together, blah blah blah. Finally got to a place where we’re just shooting the shit about current events and our lives.

Several beers deep and they’re finally starting to loosen up and we’re having a nice friendly banter going. One of her brothers starts talking about his ex and some of her harder appetites. In my drunken stupor I said “yeah man that’s nothing some girls really love for you to push them to their limits” so he laughed and asked what I meant and I said “ehh it’ll be weird if you guys know about that”. 

We were all quiet and just looking at our drinks for like 45 seconds as they digested what I said and I’m realizing how fucking stupid I am. Whatever friendliness we were working up to is gone but now there’s this tense awkwardness. I offered to get the entire bill, they didn’t even thank me, and then we went our separate ways. GF is staying over tonight and she asked me when I got to my apt how it went because her family is super protective of her. I told her and she went white as a ghost. She’s still in disbelief over how stupid I am and said we’ll talk about it tomorrow. 

TL;DR : met my GF’s 3 older brothers for the first time and drunkenly told them their youngest sibling likes it really hard.


UPDATE:
Once we were both up she wanted me to give her the full play by play on how the hell this actually happened. I told her in detail everything I remembered.

She called me an absolute idiot but I got her to laugh about it so I’m not in the dog house. She said she’s probably gonna avoid her brothers for a while because this is too awkward and embarrassing. She’s also grossed out they’d even bring up a topic like sex when they just met me.

I sent her oldest brother a text this morning “had fun, let’s do this again” and he liked the text so I might be ok with the brothers.

We’re meeting her parents tomorrow for brunch. She’s banned me from touching any alcohol when talking to her family. I was planning on being stone cold sober anyway. She said if I somehow inadvertently tell her parents about our sex life she’s going to stab me so additional motivation to be on my best behavior. 




I’ve skimmed through some of the comments and a few of the PMs I’ve received so I wanted to touch on a few things.

- yes I know I’m stupid, this is TIFU. I’m not gonna post my brightest moment here. But thanks anyway for calling me stupid over and over again. I’m still shocked at how fucking dumb I was. Million ways I could’ve spun it and talked my way out of that hole but I just froze. 
- I didn’t bring up the topic myself. I was several beers in and was just trying to go with the flow of the current topic of convo. Obviously blew up in my face.
- got some PMs calling me a pedo and a rapist. Makes zero sense given the definition of those two terms. 
- yes she was an intern but she never reported to me. I had and have had interns report to me in the past and I kept those strictly professional. My gf and I just happened. 
- why is she just telling her family about me now?  She was nervous they wouldn’t approve and jump to conclusions like a lot of you have because we were still at the same firm. Now that she’s gotten a full time role at another company, we think it’s the right time.


I’m really hoping I don’t make a fool of myself with her parents and have to make another update."

zbj1vu,5,2022-12-03,Is it best to go with my university’s degree requirements or the department advising professor?,bun-years,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/zbj1vu/is_it_best_to_go_with_my_universitys_degree/,"I’m in my 3rd year and am on track to graduate next year. I’m double majoring but just realized my second major has a requirement of 1 of 2 classes. 
The “classes” are:
1. Research Semester in Com Studies
2. Internship

I don’t want to do an internship because I’m already working a full time job and don’t have time for unpaid labor. So I asked for a meeting to discuss that requirement. The advisor for the department said the class doesn’t exist but I’m looking at it. It’s a requirement on the website and a class offered in the enrollment shopping cart.

I’m not sure if she just doesn’t understand or if I’m overthinking it but “this is the departmental capstone course and is required” seems pretty final.

My primary academic advisor says the class does exist, and it’s run through that department so I just need “permission” to take it.
Whatever that means. So, any advice here?"
zbjqjb,1,2022-12-03,How to approach this job situation?,DocOndansetron,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/zbjqjb/how_to_approach_this_job_situation/,"Howdy hey fellow engineering students, I have a job search conundrum that I would love to get some input on, because I am truly in a weird spot on what to do here.

So, for a bit of background, senior in ChemBioE, graduating May 2023. Right now I have 3 job prospects with only one secured right out. They are as follows:

Company A: Secured an offer in their lab/analytical side, with them saying “You’ll be shipped out as an engineer into the field in 9 months”. I currently intern here on the analytical side of things and have been with the company for about the past year. I find the work mildly interesting, but could not see myself long term in the company. 

Pros: Good team. Job security. Mild interest. No need to relocate.

Cons: Don’t know how much I trust their 9 month time frame. Had coworkers that it took them 2 years, others 4 months. Pay is extremely low for someone with experience and an engineering degree. I currently make more money working as an EMT on the side than I do working for this company, and the pay bump upon graduation would only slightly exceed my EMT work. That is to say the pay with a college degree would more or less match that of pay in a field that only required a 6 month cert program (and EMS is historically low paying).

Company B: Have not secured an outright offer. However, they are paying to fly me out for the second step of the interview process to meet the team. Prospects look really good right now, they seem highly invested in me as an applicant. A smaller company that has made it over the “start up hump” and is starting to boom. Work is far more interesting and in line with my research. 

Pros: The pay they discussed is far far higher than current offer. The difference is akin to 26k (my current debt from undergrad). The work seems far more interesting, and would be an engineering role right out the gate.

Cons: Need to relocate. This could be a plus, but i currently heavily enjoy where I live. No explicit offer, but trending towards very likely. 

Company C: My dream company. Absolutely love the companies mission, and the position I applied to is highly interesting and will require me to challenge myself. Applied on a whim back in August as a reach application. Literally this past week they reached out to me for a phone screening interview. Interview went great, recruiter and I spent what should have been a 30 min phone screening interview talking for nearly an hour about the role, benefits, and expected work flow as well as how I would fit in with the company. She said to me the hiring manager for the team loved my resume and wanted me to start ASAP. The only problem is I can’t start til May, and it basically boiled down to “we can’t move forward right now, but add me on LinkedIn and let’s get the ball rolling a month before your graduation.”

Pros: My dream role and company. Super well established company. Pay is the best by far. No need to relocate. Fulfills my personal mission and desired career goals. Engineering role out the gate. 

Cons: no explicit offer. Operating on a handshake agreement. Would not be able to secure a role until near graduation. 

So here is where I am torn. I desperately want to work for company C, however they have not made anything official. It’s looking like I will get an offer from company B, which would be a massive upgrade over company A, but I am not sure how to approach telling them I will hold off on making a decision until I learn more about having a potential future at company C. (Obviously I won’t tell them outright that I will hold off until I hear back from Company C). Buy basically, how would you approach the balancing act of keeping company B around long enough to find out if anything will come to fruition with company C?

Cheers!"

Legacy: Parent at Harvard, grandparents at Brown, &amp; Duke

Brother at WashU with similar stats to me

White Male, Maine, Upper Class, no fin-aid needed

**Intended Major(s):** Unsure. Most likely CS or Engineering

**ACT/SAT/SAT II:** 33 on October ACT (35E, 35M, 33R, 29S), but shooting for 34+ since I got a 35 on a practice test (35E, 36M, 33R, 35S)

**UW/W GPA and Rank:**

My school doesn't report GPA or Rank, but I have only gotten A's and A+'s and should be in the top 3-5%

**Coursework:**

School doesn't offer APs, but every class I have taken is Honors/Intensive/Accelerated

On track to take the hardest course load my schools offers

**Awards:**

3 Years (will probably be 4) Regional and State champion for tennis team

State Science Olympiad winning team

**Extracurriculars:**

* Business Founder - Created a product. Patent holder
* 4 year member and elected president of the Finance Club
* Created and ran two escape room events to raise money for a local music venue that shut down during COVID. (Built and programmed everything)
* Varsity Tennis - Only 4 year member. Regional and State Champions each year
* Tennis camp coach - a few weeks each summer
* First chair alto saxophone for 4 years in school band - Independent guitarist
* Volunteer Island Adopter For the Maine Island Trail Association - In charge of maintaining a 55 acre island off the coast of Maine, cleaning camp sites &amp; beaches, promoting sustainability
* Worked for a boat club one summer - fueled, cleaned, docked, and helped prepare boats for customers. (Also ran a small boat cleaning business before)
* Member of a state champion Science Olympiad team (Might join math team)
* Worked a few other jobs during the summer and school year
* Planing to...
   * apply for internships and research opportunities
   * take an intro class to CS or Engineering over the summer

&amp;#x200B;

**Essays/LORs/Other:**

Personal statement - I'm not sure what I'll write about, but I'm a good writer. I'll probably end up with solid essay, but I doubt it would make a significant positive impact to my application.

LOR - I go to a smaller school, so it really helps that I am close with all of my teachers. I've always had super strong comments from them. I'm sure I could get amazing recommendations from any STEM teacher, and pretty strong ones from the other subjects.

My pre-calc teacher and I have a great relationship, and he also is the teacher that helps me run the finance club. I am planning to take his economics class next year, so will will get even closer.

I'd love advice on what the other rec(s) should get. All of my science teachers would give great recs, but I think people usually get one from an English/History teacher to show a different perspective. I would definitely get good recs from an English/History teacher, but I don't have many multi-year relationships. Many have been my teacher for just a semester. I have good relationships with my Spanish teachers, but I'm not sure if that looks as good as an English/History one.

Thanks for helping me think about this.

&amp;#x200B;

**Schools:**

My school tends to send kids to small/midsize schools. It consistently sends people to Brown, Bowdoin, Bates, and sometimes Dartmouth. (Every once and a while people will go to other Ivys)

I really like WashU, Brown, Williams, and Dartmouth

Dream school would probably be Yale. I haven't looked at Duke that much but it seems awesome too.

If you have any schools that you'd recommend for someone like me, please let me know!

Any suggestions to improve my application? I'm a junior, so I still have some time. Thanks so much for your help!!"
zbmxm1,1,2022-12-03,how to maximize college resume,renaissanceboy1,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/zbmxm1/how_to_maximize_college_resume/,"hey everybody! this is my first time posting on this subreddit, and I have a question. 

I'm currently a junior in high school, and this year I realized my ambitions of enrolling at a more prestigious school. Unfortunately, freshman year was a bit of a mess (A's, B's, and a C), and there's definitely a stark comparison between then and my grades now. I always watch ""how I got into this college"" videos and notice the people in them have been grinding since day 1. So, how can I maximize my resume from here on out to deliver the most wholesome and impactful portrayal of me?

For some context, I'm currently on the Speech &amp; Debate team (first year), competed on XC this year, was offered a spot at a journalism workshop from Stanford Daily, and am currently setting up internships at my state university for the spring semester. My main passions are writing, but with an emphasis on sustainability and international conservation, which has so far fueled most of my research. I'm currently enrolled in APUSH, AP Bio, AP Lang &amp;. Comp, and plan to take AP Lit, AP Gov, AP Cal, and AP Computer Science Principles my senior year.  I'm on track to getting a satisfying ACT score and understand my GPA needs to be maintained at least a 3.9, but I need advice on how to connect these all together. 

I'd appreciate feedback! I'm not asking for probabilities or anything, only advice :)"
zbo1do,7,2022-12-03,Got the CompTIA Trifecta! How to move up Help Desk job?,Mysterious_Goal_2476,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/zbo1do/got_the_comptia_trifecta_how_to_move_up_help_desk/,"I just passed my Security+ recently. Finally completing my CompTIA trifecta within a year. I’ve been working as Help Desk for over 6 months and I plan to be a Network Engineer one day. I plan on getting AZ-900, AWS CCP, and CCNA by next year before I reached my 1 year in the company which would give me 6 certs in total. 

Current job doesn’t offer exposure to servers and networking because the engineers are the one in charge and they all work remote which kinda suck because I’m stuck with doing T1/T2 stuff and I have nobody to shadow as my team is only doing Help Desk related stuff.

Reached out to networking guy in the different team if I can shadow and learn from him to be exposed to do networking stuff and he said yes. He’s pretty nice and I’ve been telling him my interest in networking. We’ll start next year hopefully while I study for my CCNA.

I currently have a Bachelor’s degree in IT with CompTIA Trifecta certs and strong hunger for learning. I didn’t know what I wanted to do back in college so I didn’t get any good internships which put me to start at help desk. Now I know what I want to be (Network Engineer) and I’m willing to put in the work but at the same time I don’t wanna be stuck as help desk.

How long did you stay at a help desk job and what did you do in order for you to move up and get out of help desk? What’s your current job title and how is the pay like? Thank you in advance for your advice."

Compensation seems similar when I adjust for the different areas.

Pure Storage: Mountain View, CA. $53.12/hr, $9500 lump sum travel and housing

Qualtrics: Seattle, WA. $42.07/hr, \~$6-7000 travel and housing (currently negotiating)

GoDaddy: New York, NY. $7,000 lump sum housing

I got good vibes from all of the companies during interviews, so I'm having trouble choosing. I'm curious if there's anyone who is affiliated with any of these companies (as an intern or full-time) who can share more about their experience!

zbtj6j,11,2022-12-03,Worried about making a bad decision with internships,Emmettlsc,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/zbtj6j/worried_about_making_a_bad_decision_with/,"I am currently a junior and received a few internship offers for summer 2023. None of companies are particularly notable and I think the best offer that I currently have is at Deloitte where I will have the title "" **Software Engineering Summer Scholar.**"" 

&amp;#x200B;

I am worried because pretty much all I see online says Deloitte is not a good choice for advancing your career. Also, some people who interned at Deloitte have said they were accepted into a software development internship but spent most the summer working with powerpoint and excel. The people I interviewed with said the majority of the time would be spent on software development but seeing all this negative feedback makes me think I should go with another offer. 

&amp;#x200B;

Am I overthinking it? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated, especially if you interned at Deloitte with the same title!"

10. National spanish exam gold medalist

**Essays/LORs/Other:** I think I'm a pretty decent writer and interviewee! I also think I have a few good teachers I can ask for recommendations.

Note: I know I haven't done a lot of really impressive things and I also know that these schools are super competitive but I think I may as well just shoot my shot lol. I'm also still only a junior so some stuff might happen before next fall idk. Any comments and input would be greatly appreciated!"
zbu0f2,3,2022-12-03,"Can I get a job in Investment Banking, in London, if I have a degree from another country?",Unknown_User_OG,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/zbu0f2/can_i_get_a_job_in_investment_banking_in_london/,"Hi, everyone! I am a student from Romania and this year I'm graduating with a degree in Banking &amp; Finance and another one in Computer Science. Although, my university is considered to be one of the most prestigious in the country, on the international map it's average at best. 

I am very passionate about the finacial sector and I've always wanted to have a career in this industry. My plan was to relocate to London, start in IB (front office), endure the pain for 3-4 years and then look for exit opportunities on the buy side.

Now that I have about 7 months left before graduation, I started looking into it. The first thing that caught my attention is the recruitment strategy that these Bulge Bracket banks use. Some sources say that they only accept applications from top tier universities, others say that a strong academic background and experience in the field are the only things that matter. 

I did an Internship for a local bank last summer, but I doubt that it will be of great help when applying for these international banks. 

In conclusion, I have neither a degree from a top tier university nor solid experience in the field. What are my chances in securing an IB position for an international bank (front office) in London, UK? Also English is not my first language (as you can see from this post). Is this going to make it even harder for me?

Please feel free to throw in some advice if you have a career in the finacial field that may apply to my situation. 

Thank you in advance!"

zbunly,8,2022-12-03,PwC call offer,Augustin4762,Big4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Big4/comments/zbunly/pwc_call_offer/,"I had a somewhat weird hiring process so far with PwC. I was contacted directly via phone by a department manager to schedule a first interview. During the interview we discussed a slightly different position, but mostly It was me presenting my background and my plans for my career. In the end I was told that HR will be in contact with me.

A couple of days later I get a call from HR, and they ask if I would be willing to take an internship from the beginning of the year. I told them that I am interested, and then he said “I will send you the offer then”. 

After 72h I send the HR a message to check on the status of the offer.
It has been 4 working days since the offer call, and I did not receive anything yet. 

Is this common in the hiring process at PwC? I am going through hiring with Deloitte and it is completely different. Should I contact the interviewer regarding the offer on Monday?"

Planning on pursuing a bachelor's in computer science after earning my associates at a local public university. What are some things I can do right now to increase my chances of landing an entry level job or paid internship after completing my associate's? Currently financial aid pays for all my community college expenses. Hoping to be able to pay a significant portion of my tuition while pursuing my bachelor's.

If a job asks for 2 years of exepeice in CompSci and I apply for it, will they count being a TA as experience?

I begin my degree program for cloud computing starting Feb 1st. With the transfer credits I have I am looking at about 2 years until I graduate. The degree program (WGU) has most relevant certs and multiple projects built into it. I also plan on doing some side projects to build my resume while taking classes. Thankfully I am in a position where I don't necessarily have to work while I am in school. I am not against getting a help desk job, but I am wondering for the path that I am looking at is it necessary? I am 33 years old. I've been through 3 military basic trainings and if not necessary I don't want to have to go through an introductory hazing process that help desk is often described as. I've seen it mentioned before that getting a degree and having an internship lined up is one of the best routes you can go. My goal is to become a cloud architect or engineer (both have appealing qualities). Looking for any advice for people who have gone similar routes or for resources that I can explore further on my own."

Finally completing my CompTIA trifecta within a year. I’ve been working as Help Desk for over 6 months and I plan to be a Network Engineer one day. I plan on getting AZ-900, AWS CCP, and CCNA by next year before I reached my 1 year in the company which would give me 6 certs in total. 

Current job doesn’t offer exposure to servers and networking because the engineers are the one in charge and they all work remote which kinda suck because I’m stuck with doing T1/T2 stuff and I have nobody to shadow as my team is only doing Help Desk related stuff.

Reached out to networking guy in the different team if I can shadow and learn from him to be exposed to do networking stuff and he said yes. He’s pretty nice and I’ve been telling him my interest in networking. We’ll start next year hopefully while I study for my CCNA.

I currently have a Bachelor’s degree in IT with CompTIA Trifecta certs and strong hunger for learning. I didn’t know what I wanted to do back in college so I didn’t get any good internships which put me to start at help desk. Now I know what I want to be (Network Engineer) and I’m willing to put in the work but at the same time I don’t wanna be stuck as help desk.

How long did you stay at a help desk job and what did you do in order for you to move up and get out of help desk? What’s your current job title and how is the pay like? 

Thank you in advance for your advice."

LiveRoom (Pvt) Ltd. which is a software development company specialising in mixed reality, generating USD \~350,000+ annually without any funding from investors. I’ve included some excerpts in this post, but you can read the full interview [here](https://the100club.io/stories/3/how-this-mixed-reality-company-generates-sdollar500000-annually-without-investors-funding) to read more about their story as business owners in Singapore. Feel free to check out our other case studies as well, and leave some feedback for us to improve!

**Who are you and what business did you start?**

I'm an engineer and computer graphics enthusiast with over 8 years of experience in the industry. In 2016 we established LiveRoom (Pvt) Ltd. which is a software development company specialising in mixed reality. As a company we help other businesses to develop mixed reality applications and create content for these applications.

Also I recently started Kaiju Web3 Labs Pte. Ltd in Singapore which is a software development company building financial infrastructure for Metaverse and Web3 games.

**What's your backstory?**

Though I studied engineering, from my younger ages I liked 3D games and animations. I was fascinated to learn about how animated movies and games were created. I got my first gaming console in 1998 and PC in 2001. As a kid without the internet I started learning how to create animations and games with Macromedia Flash reading tech magazines.

When I got into University to study computer science I specialised in computer graphics and computer vision. I was fascinated about mixed reality from the early days way before the AR / VR hype started in 2016. So during the undergraduate time we built our own Augmented Reality SDK for Android devices as we wanted to build an augmented reality app similar to Nintendo 3DS AR game in Android.

I was able to publish papers in the field of augmented reality and got an opportunity to do an internship in a Japanese company which made a 3D rendering engine. This was my first professional experience in the computer graphics industry.

After graduation in 2015 me and my friend founded LiveRoom which is a mixed reality software engineering company.

**What led you to specialise in your industry?**

My passion for 3D computer graphics and the internship I did in Japan lead me to specialise in this industry.

**How did you spend your First 100 Days of launching your business?**

So I am currently a computer engineering technology major at my school and realized that network engineering of some sort will definitely be my career path of choice. Now, I am in the first semester of my junior year and am thinking about switching my major to Networking Information Technology, as this is essentially the CET major minus the heavy EE focus, essentially getting rid of the difficult EE grade-tanking courses that I despise. What do you guys think of this change? Would it be better to stick to the major that rounds me out better, so to say, rather than switch to the networking-focused degree? They both utilize the exact same networking courses, but CET has the EE, as I've said. I attend CCSU btw if anyone wanted to look at the curriculum sheet. It is important to note that I do plan on having an internship for this summer, as I am a fairly strong candidate (CCNA, AWS, networking courses), so hopefully this will aid me greatly in landing a good job.

Thank you in advance."

zca6o7,31,2022-12-04,Need the honesty - how bad did I damage my career?,MSPSDManager,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/zca6o7/need_the_honesty_how_bad_did_i_damage_my_career/,"I started 8 years ago in IT at an MSP as an intern, moving to service desk tier 2, Junior sysadmin, sysadmin, then back to service desk as a team lead and eventual service desk manager. I was a team lead for 6 months and the service desk manager for a year and a half. Then the company went out of business. I was instantly hired at a startup MSP to start their service desk as their service desk manager. First as a consultant (where I implemented a ticketing system, RMM, policies, phone tree, etc), then as an official employee. Three weeks later after officially starting as an employee, I was 'reorganized' from service desk manager to senior service desk technician and one of my employees was promoted to service desk manager. I kept my pay, at least, but it was pretty crushing news. While I consider this a clear demotion, the company to this day (a year later) still considers it a reorganization and swears it was not a demotion.

That said, I was given a title 'promotion' to service desk team lead back in June.... but none of our systems reflect that title aside from my email signature. I've asked the current manager several times if I was actually a team lead or not. Never got it in writing, but verbally its been confirmed each time I ask.

Now for the reason of the reorganization. I was told I was not giving clear direction to the staff. Fair point. I was working 60+ hour weeks as a consultant before official hire trying to get the service desk off the ground and making their customers happy. When I officially started as an employee, I was still working those hours trying to keep the ship afloat. As a result, the new hires got upset at my lack of direction, resulting in one quitting due to the chaos and another complaining to the CEO. So that was strike one.

Strike two, was (and I know you all will kill me for this) asking for hybrid office work. The CEO and CTO also wanted this and pushed me to ask the staff to do hybrid office work. The staff did not want to, so I was blamed for the office failure (way more complicated than that, but I accept the blame nonetheless. Ironically, the person who complained the loudest at being asked into an office is the current manager and is now also trying to push for an office, so take that as you will).

Strike three was that two of the four staff felt I was unapproachable. I accept that as well - I was constantly on the phone with clients and other remote technicians who were struggling. Plus I was stressed out of my mind. It does not excuse the fact that two of the staff felt I was brushing them off and they felt they were on their own.

I've spent the last year trying to work on being a better communicator, be more approachable for everyone no matter how busy or stressed I am, and accept that times changed and an office is not really needed anymore. I've tried to grow and I have learned a lot through this, though I will admit I am still pretty bitter about the whole thing happening after just three weeks.

I have not had any problems getting interviews for leadership positions elsewhere, but I've not been able to land a leadership position again (though to be honest I've been very selective where I've applied, which has been about 6 places).

However, I've put any job searches on pause due to having needed to sign a contract to stay on until next fall at the least. So in the meantime, I'm going to school for a masters and I am studying for Net+ and Sec+ since I never got those.

But since I went backwards and it was entirely my fault, how bad did I damage my ability to get another position in leadership? Is recovery not a big deal like I am thinking it will be? I've been hesitant to ask this for a year due to embarrassment and need advice and suggestions how to move forward when the time comes."

I recently got a part-time intern for the winter break in a startup. The work time is 30hrs a week and the pay is average for the place. Being a start-up, the work is kind of hard. For example, they gave a task to code a PostgreSQL driver over the weekend (yeah work on weekends). Should I continue this job? I can easily back out, and they too have a lot of other applicants they can get to replace me (some of my friends backed out and they were replaced the next day).

TL DR: Should I do another internship (at a startup) when I will already be doing another intern next year and a project (already completed)?"

i’m currently a sophomore who majored in the closest equivalent to bioinformatics that my school has. the requirements consist of mostly biology classes, with only intro cs/data structures being the required cs classes for the major. i decided to switch my major to computer science because i realized that since i wanted to do a coding specific job, my particular major wouldn’t have been helpful in giving me a good foundation of computer science.

the only problem is, because of my schedule and previous plan of study, i am only taking the intro cs class in the spring. i’m completing any other required class/elective i can take without that class right now and next sem so that i can overload on cs classes for my last 2 years. I learned how to code in high school but have never taken a formal cs class in school, which is why i don’t want to test out of the class either.

i’m looking for internships for next summer, and i’ve found a few small biotech companies that i’d be interested in working with. I was planning on cold emailing them and asking if they have internship opportunities for next summer, but i’m a little scared i won’t have the coding knowledge to be able to perform in interviews or for their work next summer if someone does allow me to work. my current plan is to self study data structures in the spring so that if I get an internship, I will be able to use that knowledge for it. 

but i’m wondering, is it worth it to still apply anyway? 

*for my coding ability, i’ve been working in a bioinformatics lab for the past year and have been able to complete my project just fine. so I definitely have the basics down, and can learn stuff pretty easily on the spot.

thank you so much!"

I'm (24m) looking to get into CS or my dream job is a quant trader. I have 1 semester left for an associates and I am taking a Linux and Intro to Java class. I feel okay about both- Linux is incredibly easy but I think I lack confidence for Java (it's never hard to understand the concepts I just have a harder time applying the logic and math). I've been out of school for a few years now because I was active duty army and I'm trying to get back into the mindset of school and have good habits.

My plan moving forward is to complete a Python based boot camp that the army will help pay for. With this and the associates I'll transfer to a 4 year program and I'll either complete it while working full time or continue on to school full time. I have networked and I'm looking to set up internships within my network for next summer so the ideal situation is I take advantage of my connections and get an internship that pays well and allows me to go to school full time for my bachelors. If not I'm hoping the associates and boot camp will be enough for me to land a job and then finish out school while working full time. 

Any advice or suggestions to make this process easier? Things such as content to increase knowledge or specific types of events to network at would be greatly appreciated!"

•Aside from this, there's an upcoming hackathon (like the one in which you develop something on the given topic) and literally most people in my class who know how to code and stuff have their groups and are mostly guys and don't wanna take anyone else in their groups. And among all girls in my class, I'm the only one who knows web development stuff so I'll just have to form random group and work on my own.
This really discouraged me cause unless you are working with someone else, you don't know where you stand.

•Theres a really big company that comes in my college to give internship opportunity and every year, just guys are selected.
I know it's not discrimination, the person who actually knows the stuff is selected but still the doubt creeps in.

Now, I just don't know what to do. All my friends (girls) are just interested in random stuff and just becomes jealous to see I'm learning some courses. All the guys who I'm friends with just tends to make their own groups and discuss stuff about what they are doing and other guys just prefer never to talk.

I know I should be confident and strong and keep learning alone, so that I just better myself and shouldn't seek confirmation as to where I stand but it's still bothering me."

I have already applied and been accepted to do my master's degree here in the US, which I plan to finish in Spring 2024. This gives me about a year and a half to learn German intensively before I graduate. I have already begun working through a textbook, reviewing Anki flashcards, and using online resources daily. My goal is to be at least A2/B1 German by Spring 2024, with a stretch goal of B2 (but I've heard attaining that level in such a short time outside of a German-speaking country can be quite difficult). In terms of Software Engineering experience, I have already spent a summer as an intern at a large software company and will spend the upcoming summer at a different, large software company. The experience has been/will be mostly C/C++, Python, and Java programming. I've worked with databases, UI/Frontend, and I will be doing work on embedded systems this summer.

As of now, I plan to apply for Software Engineering Jobs in Germany as soon as I finish my master's (Spring 2024). However, I was curious what the prospects of getting hired in an entry-level position as a foreigner would be. Would I be better off getting a job at a large international company here in the US then asking for an international transfer to Germany? Or is there enough demand for Software Engineers that I could easily get an entry-level job in Germany?

I didn't have many details then but I got more info now:

Overview: I'm a first year at my state school studying CS, graduating in Spring 2025. Paying for myself through college. Boeing's offering me a full ride scholarship for the next two years + two summer internships, but I would have to agree to a 3 year job contract right after I graduate.

Scholarship: Covers tuition, room &amp; board, books, and most other expenses. Room &amp; board is either on campus (not happening, unless I RA), or a 20k stipend (I believe per year, waiting on response) for off campus. Currently, I'm not getting any scholarships so I'm paying my state-school bill completely with student loans. If at any point I choose to break the contract, I would have to pay them this scholarship money back. I'm unclear on if I'd have to pay back with interest.

Internships: For Summer 2023 &amp; Summer 2024. I would work at a regional office close to where I live with a pay of about $28/hr for the first internship. Then, I would have the option to relocate to one of their other offices for the second internship. I can't get an estimate for what the salary for this will be, but I assume it's higher. If I break the contract, I wouldn't have to pay this money back.

Job: Must work 3 years full-time post-grad in a Boeing office, with relocation assistance. Location preferences will be taken into consideration—I have my eye on their SV office for networking purposes lol. Couldn't get a salary estimate for this either because it depends a lot on position and location, but Boeing definitely pays less than Big Tech. I could definitely live comfortably, but couldn't like save for retirement AND a house. Currently waiting on a response for if I'll only qualify for entry-level positions by then or if I can be L2 or L3.

Would appreciate any thoughts! Let me know if I should clarify anything"

I've been looking for internship pay information, and so far it seems like the average yearly pay for engineering interns here is either around $17 to $20 a hour, or high 30k to low 40k a year.

As someone who has almost fifteen years of experience and can already easily find jobs that pay substantially more than that per hour what would be some pros and cons of taking the pay cut or just finding an employer that will work with my schedule and allow me to maintain a higher pay rate?

And do I really need to do an internship? I'd rather not. I'd rather be able to focus on my classes and engineering type clubs and projects for fun.


Some background information if it helps:

My tuition and rent among other things are going to be paid for by a GI Bill, and I have enough money saved up that I shouldn't be worried about anything unless some terrible unseen event occurs. The main reason why I'm seeking an engineering degree is because I'm at a point in my career where I need an engineering degree to continue at my current level without having to jump through extra hoops. I've held engineering positions before, but ever since moving to be closer to family I've found that every potential employer questions me during the hiring process about why I haven't got a degree yet. Even though I know what I'm doing and have been doing it for a while now I haven't been successul in attaining an engineering type position. While I currently make decent money; I would much rather get back into making things and not just fixing the same beat up junk everyday.

zd0jih,24,2022-12-05,Everything You Need to Know About CAP,lukeywebo,UTAustin,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/zd0jih/everything_you_need_to_know_about_cap/,"Now that the application deadline has passed, I want to share my experience with the CAP program as people begin to receive their admissions decisions. This post is intended for applicants who receive a CAP offer, but it may also be interesting for any current UT students who are just curious about the program.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to start off by saying that if you were not offered admission into UT Austin, it's not the end of the world! One thing I have learned is how random admissions can be, especially at UT. A rejection does not make your efforts throughout high school and the application process any less worthy and commendable. Remember to be kind to yourself!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure I will be asked for **my stats**, so I will get those out of the way now. I took a total of six AP classes throughout high school and earned a 3.7 cumulative GPA. I was only able to take the SAT once due to limitations from COVID, but my score was 1410. I was involved in a number of extracurricular activities, including student government, sustainability, debate, rotary international, and symphony orchestra. In addition to those, I had 100+ hours of community service and volunteer hours. I also had a part-time job for two years in high school, as well as a one-year internship. I applied to the College of Liberal Arts, specifically the government program.

&amp;#x200B;

So, you were invited to participate in the **Coordinated Admissions Program (CAP)**. What does that mean? In short, the CAP program is a special entrance offer that allows a selected amount of in-state freshman applicants to begin their undergrad at another UT System university. After completing their freshman year at one of the participating universities and fulfilling the specific program requirements, they are granted **automatic admission to  UT** **Austin.**

&amp;#x200B;

There are a lot of things to consider before choosing to participate in the CAP program. For starters, CAP **only guarantees automatic admission to the College of Liberal Arts.** If you do not plan on majoring in a COLA degree, it is generally not recommended.

&amp;#x200B;

*\*If you are interested in a major outside of COLA, there are still a few routes you can take within CAP. You can decide to complete your CAP year and enter UT as a liberal arts major, then apply to internally transfer into your desired major. Your second option is to still participate in CAP, but apply for a non-COLA major as your first-choice. As a CAP student, UT will reach out to you in the fall to confirm your major choices. You are given a first-choice major and a second-choice major. If you decide to go with this route, it means you will not be guaranteed automatic admission into your first-choice major and will still be competing amongst all regular transfer students. Here is where CAP comes in: you can list a COLA major as your second-choice and still be guaranteed automatic admission if you are not accepted into your first-choice. These options are a bit more complicated and because my major is within the College of Liberal Arts, I am not too familiar with the process. But there are plenty of CAP students pursuing non-COLA majors, so it is still a viable option if you are dead-set on attending UT.*

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to this, you may also want to consider the amount of dual-credit and/or AP credits you have obtained. In order to successfully fulfill the CAP requirements, you must earn a minimum of 30 credit hours at the participating university. CAP students are limited to a small number of selected courses approved by UT at the participating system school. If you have too many credits, you may be unable to fulfill the 30-credit requirement. There are a host of additional factors to consider, so I **strongly recommend** taking the time to read through all of the materials provided by UT about the Coordinated Admissions Program. You are going to be dedicating a year of your life and expending a hefty amount of money. If you are seriously considering the program, it is worth it to read through all of the fine details to ensure it is the best option for you!

&amp;#x200B;

Although I was admitted into a variety of other Texas universities (including Texas A&amp;M, UNT, Texas Tech, Texas State, and TCU) and additional schools out-of-state, I am from Austin and therefore opted to participate in the CAP program. **Among all of the participating UT system schools, UTSA and UT Arlington are by far the most preferred schools.** This is most likely due to their independent reputations and proximity to major cities. If you do decide to participate in the CAP program, selecting your school is one of the most important steps in the process. The schools you will be offered depend on your high school stats, so this may affect your options. **UTSA and UT Arlington only admit a limited number of CAP students, so they are extremely competitive.** The slots fill up within minutes of the portal opening (typically sometime in February), so you must be ready when the time comes.

**The general CAP requirements are as follows:**

(1) **Maintain a 3.2 or above GPA.** None of the individual grades you earn for transferable CAP courses can be below a C, regardless of your cumulative GPA. If you make a D or an F in a course during the fall semester of your CAP year, you must retake that course (or take another course in its place) during the spring semester.

(2) **Complete a minimum of 30 semester credit hours** of transferable coursework specified by the UT System school that you choose to attend.

(3) **Submit a final, official transcript** detailing your work at the UT System school to UT Austin by the provided deadline.

*\*Throughout your CAP year, it is crucial you follow all of the specified guidelines, limitations, and requirements. While there are CAP advisors that will assist you, they are not always reliable. UT Austin provides little to no help in making sure CAP students are on the right track, so it is your individual responsibility. The biggest trend I see amongst CAP students is people who fail to read the agreement and accidentally void their contract. If you make sure to read all of the details and stay up to date, you will be fine. I recommend getting to know your advisor well and building a strong relationship with them. Schedule meetings with them often and don't be afraid to advocate for yourself. If there's something you have questions about or concerns you might have, bring them up and be persistent. UT Austin is one of the top public universities in the country and admissions are naturally extremely competitive, so the CAP program only exists for students who are extremely set on attending. It is designed to weed out the students who will most likely not be a good fit at UT, but if you are committed, it should be a relatively straightforward process and you'll be on the Forty Acres in no time!*

&amp;#x200B;

I selected UTSA due to its campus life and closeness to Austin. I have a few friends participating in the CAP program at UT Arlington and they have told me that it's been difficult finding other CAP students there. That's about all I can say in regard to the CAP experience at UT Arlington. **I just completed my first semester at UTSA and could not be happier with my decision.** There is a large community of CAP students, so I've had no trouble meeting people. My professors have been extremely great and the campus is very nice. There are tons of amenities on campus, from the rec center to the wide variety of food options (Chick-Fil-A, Subway, Einstein Bagels, Starbucks, Smoothie King, etc.). While I can't wait to be a longhorn, my time as a roadrunner will always hold a special place in my heart.  I've grown particularly fond of UTSA in my short time here because of its close-knit community. The city of San Antonio really rallies around the school, which is a comforting feeling and a fun experience. Not to mention how far their football program has come within the past few years. The games at the Alamodome have such a special energy, unlike anything I've experienced! Plus, all of the games are free for UTSA students. **A lot of CAP students even end up electing to stay at UTSA, so rest assured that it's still a great school where you can have a positive experience.** I urge you to enter your CAP year with an open and excited mind. Put yourself out there, join clubs, and attend events! The first week of the fall semester was filled with fun events. The night before classes, there was tons of live music and fireworks on campus! UTSA even rents out Six Flags for one day, free for all students and faculty.

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's easy to feel impatient or even frustrated with your situation at times. Trust me, we have all experienced this at some point during the year. **But my time at UTSA has been truly memorable.** Try not to go about your time at UTSA (or whichever system school you end up at) feeling ""above"" the regular students. I've seen a few CAP students here that want nothing to do with UTSA and it's pretty disappointing. The people around them and their professors can sense their entitlement and it's just not the type of energy I recommend bringing. This university is a great institution that has tons of character and unique opportunities!

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot speak much about the dorms, as I opted to live in an off-campus apartment, but they are what you would expect. Typical college dorms. I have been inside every dorm hall and I personally think Alvarez is the nicest. However, it seems like most people prefer Chaparral Village due to the dorms being more apartment-style. There is also a nice swimming pool and hot tub in Chaparral Village if that's something you think you'd enjoy, but it's open to all students from any dorm hall. **If you do choose to attend UTSA and have a car, I highly recommend bringing it.** The biggest difference between UT Austin and UTSA is the walkability. While the campus itself is walkable, you will most likely want to leave campus, and it's impossible without a car. I know there is an extensive bus system, but I prefer the reliability of having my own car. If you are spending a year in San Antonio, you might as well take advantage of it and explore! There is a lot to do and bringing your car will allow you that freedom, especially for visiting home during breaks.

&amp;#x200B;

One important factor to consider is that **UTSA and UT Arlington require CAP students to complete their first two courses over the summer semester.** You can choose to take them online or in person. I took both online and they were extremely easy. Although it may be irritating at first, it means you only have to take three courses during the fall which is really beneficial. You then take five courses in the Spring. Also, be aware that UTSA does not allow CAP students to accept their merit-based scholarships.

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout your CAP year, UT Austin will reach out to you a number of times. The school will email you around November to confirm your major choices, and then again in April with a few reminders. You must send your freshman transcript to UT Austin BY the deadline, otherwise, you will not be able to transfer. This is extremely important.

&amp;#x200B;

One last piece of advice is that if you plan on living off-campus once you get to UT, **I strongly recommend figuring out your living situation for Austin during the fall semester of your CAP year.** Ideally, you should aim to sign your lease before the Spring semester. My roommate and I signed our lease for Austin in September. By doing this early, you ensure that you'll secure an apartment and may even find some nice deals to save cash!

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen some applicants worried about any stigmas surrounding CAP students and to that, I'll say this: Most of my friends are at UT and many of them don't even know what the program is. They've told me that once you're at UT, nobody is concerned about where you came from and that CAP students are treated like any other transfer student. While CAP students can occasionally be the butt of a few jokes at UT, none of them are in bad taste. Don't take it too seriously! When I initially toured UT, even our tour guide was a former CAP student. Anyone who would seriously judge you for being a CAP student simply isn't worth the time of the day. A lot of my friends at UT have even told me that many people respect CAP students for their commitment to attending UT. Ultimately, if you really see yourself as a longhorn, then go for it! Spending a year working hard to fulfill the requirements is admirable and you can feel proud knowing you earned your place at UT.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this post will be of help to any high school seniors out there who received a CAP offer and are confused about what it means. I tried my best to include all of the information that I wish I had known at the time. I'd be happy to answer any and all questions you might have. Remember to go easy on yourself and trust that you will end up where you are supposed to be. Hook 'em and Birds Up!"

zd3eyn,2,2022-12-05,Is a grad cert in IT at Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology worth it to become an SWE?,nerdyGirl221,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/zd3eyn/is_a_grad_cert_in_it_at_royal_melbourne_institute/,"Hi all, I'm posting here because my situation seems to be a bit unusual. I'm currently teaching myself maths and computer science from home, which I've been doing on and off for the last few years, and I'm hoping to get work in the industry very soon, as my partner is currently shouldering all the financial load. I'm really just looking for a piece of paper which will allow me to get a job, as I already have some pretty advanced knowledge in CS and programming. 

To give you an idea of what I mean, I have been working on some projects in Python, including a blog with Flask and some Raspberry Pi Pico projects, which I am uploading to GitHub. I have also worked a reasonable amount with C and some other languages. I am partway through the Nand2Tetris book and projects as well.

I have already done an internship at a startup several years ago where I was writing scripts in Python and involved in the admin of several databases and web servers for an embedded product, but then I took a break from the industry for a while.

So this is why I'm now just looking for a qualification. I already have an arts degree with a double major in history and literature where I had a very high GPA, so doing another bachelor's would be frustrating. I am looking at the Grad Cert in IT from RMIT here in Melbourne. You can find the course at rmit dot edu dot au if you search for graduate certificate in information technology.

The course is short and basic, but I will be bringing my own experience and a decent GitHub profile with me, so I'm hoping that these things combined might be enough to help me find a job. Ideally I'd like to get work in applications or backend. If I have to settle for some pretty junior roles at the start, I will do what I have to, and this course does also provide guaranteed entry to RMIT's Masters of IT, so I could do that either immediately afterwards or a few years down the track. RMIT also has a lot of industry connections.

My preference would be to get work straight away with the grad cert though, as my partner needs me to take some of the pressure off. So, do any of you have experience with a grad cert in IT, or with RMIT? Do you think it's worth doing a six month qualification just to get the attention of employers, or do I have to do a full bachelor's to even have a chance getting a job?

TIA!"

zd60zl,156,2022-12-05,How do I politely decline a PhD offer without burning bridges with my potential advisor?,kn0xchad,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/zd60zl/how_do_i_politely_decline_a_phd_offer_without/,"Hi all,

I'm currently in my final year of a physics M.Sc degree. Last summer, I had applied for a research internship abroad but due to issues with my visa I was unable to go out of my country and had to proceed with the project remotely. My project advisor asked me during our first meeting about my plans after graduation i.e. if I would be interested in pursuing a PhD. I positively mentioned that if given the opportunity I would be very interested and do plan on applying for PhD positions before my graduation. However, with certain experiences I've had (or the lack thereof), I'm not very keen on going on the PhD path just yet. However, my advisor is very interested in taking me into his group as a PhD student. In fact, after my scholarship application got rejected, he offered to fund my PhD through his lab grant.

For a bit of context, my field of interest is in experimental condensed matter, and due to various reasons (mainly lockdowns due to covid), I feel inept with my ability to conduct research and frankly don't feel ready to dive into a PhD program immediately after my masters. My plan for now is to pursue a position as a project assistant for about a year or so after I graduate, and then apply for a PhD position. That way, during this ""gap"" year I wouldn't be under the pressure of a full-fledged ""program"". And my research interests might change during this course, may not. Regardless, I would like to keep my internship advisor's group as an option in the future when I do apply for a PhD. 

So, my question is as the title suggests, how do I politely decline this offer without burning/hampering any relations with my advisor? I'm also in the middle of the internship project with him and would like to complete it without disturbing my rapport with him.

I'd really appreciate any advice on this. Thanks in advance!"

A little background, I have been a full-time software engineer for a year and a half now as part of a development program(F100 company) I got into straight out of college that is meant to last two years. I have worked on three different teams in that time(as part of the rotations we do) and have gained professional experience with python, pyspark, and java. I have worked on chatbots, geospatial data, customer service, and data cleaning/preparation, and even a little ml. The team I am on even got recognized company-wide for some of our cost-saving efforts. While working full-time and back in college on the side I have been doing web development for friends and friends of friends who need websites for businesses or themselves and have been getting good at that too. I would like to think that I have some good experience for someone at my level but I am unsure.

Here is the situation, I have about six months left on my contract and I am worried that there will not be a full-time job waiting for me when I finish the development program. The day before thanksgiving there was a surprise meeting where the head of the organization I am contracted to announced they were going to be laying off 7-8% of the department. I was really hoping and working hard to impress these people so I could land a full-time job but now I am unsure whether there will be a spot for me. Since the surprise meeting, I have been looking at other jobs but have been finding it hard to find jobs that fit my skill set, most junior roles I see are looking for 3-5 years of experience which I barely have with my internships and this development program. I have mostly been looking at python developer roles since I feel like it is a good fit with my experience but I wanted to reach out to you all and see if I am putting my efforts in the right place, or if I should take a different approach. I would really appreciate any advice."

I just started applying for a new role and as part of that first batch of applications I interviewed at and got offered an internship role as full-stack developer for a company who's been around for 15 years, still label themselves as a startup, and using that excuse to justify a super low intern monthly salary (2300) for on-site, full-time work. I did ask but they said remote was not possible and HR basically said the 2300 was not something they could move on. It also seems like a very hierarchical structure and nothing is written about them online so I've little to go on in terms of their culture, etc.

I have to let them know by Thursday if I am taking it. Thing is I have not sent out many applications yet and so I was expecting nothing to come to me for a good while. I have another interview for a remote internship next week that I would really love to get given their tech stack and culture but I can't obviously take that as a given. They also pay more (3500).

What can I do here? I would like to also position myself for FAANG applications later and so I'm thinking maybe to go for a junior engineer role instead of a second internship? I might be selling myself too short here. The last internship was remote and a tiny team and I'm looking to really get some good experience with a bigger sized team but with some room to be slow at first if I'm at junior level and so on. I do know I am probably lucky to get an offer but the salary feels exploitative esp. given it's not remote."

As long as the commute is an hour or less one way, I don’t mind, and I’m probably okay going a bit over budget since I know 1000 isn’t a lot for monthly rent in the Bay Area.

I am an engineering student and i will pursuing my masters thesis in Devsecops, that will be my first experience in Devsecops ( I only have done Devops and Cloud before)
But the thing is that I will be doing it in a startup that also doesn’t know what to do and I m a bit nervous to not know what to do or mess up things

I’m not too sure if I am attacking the software engineer internship application process incorrectly, or if the economic downturn screwed the internship hiring market over."
zdkeq9,1,2022-12-05,"Post-grad program was cancelled, struggling to figure out next steps for kicking my career of?",EternalStorm44444,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/zdkeq9/postgrad_program_was_cancelled_struggling_to/,"I'm a 24F and I'm feeling a little bit stuck in terms of my career trajectory. I love tech and ultimately would be happiest to be in a job where I can focus on technical program solving and ideally code or discuss code frequently. If I had to specialize in any field I think Artificial Intelligence is the most interesting but don't want to do a PhD. I do also think I would be good in positions that involve entrepreneurship or intrapreneurship and potentially would be interested in the management side of AI one day.

I studied programming in my undergraduate degree and graduated with a four-year Bachelors Degree in CS and in Psychology but wasn't able to get a CS internship during this time in part due to my undergraduate degrees rural location (very few people got internships and there was no co-op), instead ending up working for a local makerspace throughout university. I definitely made a lot of mistakes during this time and was clueless as a student what to focus on that would help me after university. I spent the first six months applying to tech internships in Toronto and striking out at second and third rounds, before taking a low paying job outside my field basically doing marketing and administrative work for farms through a family connection. I got into a post-graduate program with a co-op for AI and had just moved into an apartment to be near my new program, which was about to start in January only to have it cancelled this week. 

I'm just not sure what to do at this point. I've reapplied to upcoming post-grad programs in AI with co-ops in my area but the intakes for these are all at least eight months to over a year out. I've been looking into AI bootcamps in Toronto as I can start soon and they have good scholarships for women, but these seem like a weird option for someone who already has a CS degree? I'm really looking for guidance on what to do with the next year as I've had to do a 180 with my plans and in the long-term how to achieve my career goals. I've gotten resume and interview feedback that I'm not specialized enough in a subfield of CS and don't have a relevant internship experience so I know I need to work on getting these as much as I can in the next year. All I can think to do is to spend my time pursuing the Tensorflow Developer Certification, building up my portfolio and networking if I'm able to stay in the GTA (and of course continuing to apply for internships although I'm no longer a new grad or a student so this is getting a bit tricky).

I apologize for the lengthy post and really appreciate any advice!"

**Letter of Recommendation:**

* 9th-11th Gr. teacher for Regular Bio, Medical Biotechnology, and AP Biology 10/10. Really close relationship with her and has been through a lot with me concerning mental health and have seen me academically succeed in HOSA and other endeavors.
* 10th-12th Gr. teacher for Medical Biotechnology, Chemistry, and Human Physiology/Anatomy 9/10. Grew close to her and knows my passion in Chemistry and teaching students.
* Counselor 9th-12th: 7/10 Decent relationship with her. She probably talked about my struggles with mental health, but she is also part of my academy so she has seen how much I planned for the academy and served the students.

**Essays:**

**Personal 9/10:** Wrote about a speech a CEO of a company in Hawaii made through the internship I was in. She talked about how she didn't expect to found her own company since she had unrelated interests, but found a common interest in sustainability and marketing that led her to founding her own company. I then wrote about how I had unrelated extracurriculars then found my passion in Chemistry as I am taking AP Chemistry. Chemistry teachers then saw my passion in Chemistry and offered me to teach their students. I have taught 93 students so far.

Essay starts off with onomatopoiea and has a great hook. PM if you want to read.

**Essay edited and peer reviewed by a student at Harvard.**

**Supplement #1 (Open Curriculum) 8/10:** Talked about my passion in research and medicine and environmentalism, and how I would use Brown's open curriculum to bridge a connection between the two. Explained how I would use science to create change; using biological processes and finding out ways through research to put them to good use (based on my independent research). Went in depth in specific classes and professors.

**Supplement #2 (Something that brings us joy) 9/10:** Talked about my love for Malama 'Aina which is taking care of the Earth. Talked about how I find peace after each gust of breeze (means the ancestors are thankful) when completing an Oli which is a Hawaiian chant. Talked about my realization that ""treating mother nature with attention and goodness allows her to treat us back with nourishment to move closer to a sustainable life.""

**Supplement #3 (Challenged by a perspective) 10/10:** Talked about how being both in a health academy and in the Future Farmers of American organization usually sparked stigma. Then emphasized my efforts to deteriorate this stigma by introducing this organization to a hundred students on campus with different academies and interests. I then mentioned how I noticed an 18% increase in academy of health students and a more diverse group of students in the roster.

What if I or any other student was in a position where they could afford to earn no income for one summer in order to help guarantee their spot in a graduate program. I'm in a position where I'm too early in a long degree to land a proper internship program, and even if I was far enough into my degree the interviews are known to be very selective.

The question is how could I even find these roles if I was happy to work for free? (For one summer)"

I was wondering though that if the team is nice enough to accept me despite not meeting the requirement, should I go with Discover or just chill at Walmart? I accepted both offers and I’m just waiting to renege one (idc if this is unethical). Discover pays more and is closer to my hometown, but I also don’t know what I’ll be doing.

**Demographics:**

Hispanic female, AZ, 75k a year, maybe financial aid, small charter school

**Intended Major(s):** Mechanical Engineering, might apply as Data Science to some

**SAT:** No clue, I'll find out Dec. 16. 1420 PSAT

**ACT:** Have not taken and not sure if I should

**UW/W GPA and Rank:** 3.95UW/4.75W, school does not do rank because I have a class of 20

**Coursework:**

8th: APES

9th: APCS, AP Calc AB, AP GoPo, Honors Bio, Honors Lit, Honors Lang

10th: AP Calc BC, AP Lang, AP Bio, AP Euro, Honors Chem

11th: APUSH, AP Physics 1, AP Lit, AP Spanish, Linear Algebra

(I haven't seen the light of day in years)

**Awards:**

* AP Scholar with Honor (10th), AP Scholar with Distinction (11th)
* School's honor roll (9th, 10th, 11th), received recognition at my school for exemplifying its values (10th)
* Placed top 20 in my age category in a pretty large half marathon (8th, not going to talk about this  on college apps) went and did a marathon a year later for shits and giggles and placed top 30 in my age category (9th)
* On the race tangent, a few buddies and I ran an overnight relay trail race and placed 1st in the High School category (10th)
* National Hispanic Recognition Scholar (11th)

**Extracurriculars:**

* Robotics Club (9th, 11th): I really enjoy Robotics and this year I've taken up the role of assisting the younger kids with their robot, almost like a mentorship role (?)
* Ran competitively for 7 years, had a ton of fun but all things do come to an end (and in my case, rather abruptly). Currently I weightlift but nothing crazy to write home about
* Varsity Track and Field (9th-10th), Varsity Cross Country (9th-10th): For the sake of possible readers I'm going to keep the running talk short. I did serve as team captain in 10th and our teams were one of the more successful teams at our school in terms of awards and amount of State Championships attended so that may be relevant
* NHS (10th-11th): Collaborated with Student Government to put out events for the school, several successful food drives under our belt. One of our most prominent ventures was raising enough money and constructing a school-wide ""community"" garden
* Member of a Rocket League esports team (9th): This was like the filler episode of my high school career. Was pretty fun, we hit Diamond in competitive 3v3, none of us play Rocket League to this day. Really minor and irrelevant
* Part-time job (11th): I work 20 hr/wk at a grocery store making minimum wage ($12.80) and I plan to hold this job until I go off to college

**Essays/LORs/Other:**

I've not written any college essays being a junior, but I had two of my best friends proofread a random essay I did. One praised it for being fun to read, the other roasted me for not being concise enough (like this Reddit post). So it's safe to say my essays will reflect that.

If there's one thing that'll be good about my applications, it's going to be my LORs. I've known my teachers for God knows how long. Teachers that stand out are my Physics teacher (9/10), my Robotics teacher (8/10), my counselor (I've known her since middle school so solid 9/10) and my Spanish teacher (8.5/10)

**Schools:**

I'd prefer the school to be big as I've spent too much time in a class where people know every intimate detail about me. I don't really care if this school has good sports teams, but I'd rather not go somewhere where the football or basketball teams are an afterthought. Basically looking for the experience I didn't have in high school. As for a thoughtful preference, I'd like good connections to internships. Preferably OOS, but as I'm aware I'll most likely need finaid, I'm open to anything. Thanks in advance, especially if you made it through this whole thing!"

* Fun work (Gaming)

* HQ is in California where I see myself post-grad

EA Cons:

* Internship bleeds into school fall semester, so I would have to be working 4 weeks of the internship during school :(
* Was told internship would be remote for the summer and would much prefer in person
* Intern pay is significantly lower than Goldman (\~35/hour vs \~48/hour)

Goldman Sachs Pros:

* Internship is based in NYC which I would love to be in for the summer for final internship
* Higher intern pay &amp; relocation money
* Offices around the country if I wanted to change locations for new grad

Goldman Sachs Cons:

* Never worked in finance, prefer tech culture
* Lower new grad salary come next year for return offer
* Potentially less interesting &amp;&amp; more stressful work environment than EA??

I then tried so, so hard to balance school and my co-op, as well as Leetcoding every day, to catch up with those Ivy League folks for 1.5 year before landing an offer with FAANG. 

My point is: if you also didn't come from a top CS school and want to get into big tech, you sure need to try super hard to make up for it. For those who succeeded, I for sure respect the shite out of you.

What are common mistakes that you see applicants from outside the EU commit and get rejected outright?**

For context, I'm from Brazil, recently graduated in CS from a top university in Brazil, with \~2.5YoE as back-end developer (2 companies) and \~1 year of internships (also focused on software dev.), mostly worked with the bread-and-butter of webdev: Java/Quarkus, Node/TS, Docker/K8s, microservices and a handful of message queues and databases.

I've been applying for a few months for software dev. positions in Germany, and had almost zero responses, most of the time I just don't get anything, the remaining 15\~20% are insta-rejections, although I'm very cautious and apply to positions that have tech-stack and experience requirements match to me.

I really don't have a clue of what I'm doing wrong, I got a few interviews at some big tech companies (e.g. Amazon &amp; MS) for positions in Canada (which are now frozen) and an offer from one of these companies here in Brazil, I've also had a few former colleagues from college working in FAANGs review my resume (idk if i should post it as it's easily ""doxable""). The biggest issue that I can think of is that I don't speak German, at least not yet, but I'm only looking at job posts in English that don't ask for German. 

I'm inclined towards Germany as I've gathered almost all documents to request a citizenship certificate (already citizen by descent) and I want to settle there at least for a while. I'm also targeting Germany as I don't even need a specific visa or something, my degree is already recognized by the Anabin and I had a consultation with the AHK Brasilien, who told me that I can just walk to my local German embassy with my degree and a job offer in hands and request a visa for qualified professionals.

I don't even know how to specifically ask for help, but... what can I do to at least get an interview? What are common mistakes that you see applicants from outside the EU commit?"

Does the university help with finding an internship? I’m a CS student and an internship is a crucial part of my undergrad.


People are probably sick of hearing this question but, is the college life really as bad as people say? I had a super social life in my former university, but my social life was basically erased when i moved to the states and it would be really hard for me to finish 3 years in total seclusion from any social life.


As i said i was also considering TAMU but the ETAM is keeping me from fully committing, I’m already 21 so I’m not trying to waste more years.
And honestly I prefer living in/near a city more than a small town, but that would be kind of irrelevant in the grand scheme of things.

I will start a 6-month internship on 01.03.2023.  It can be full remote, though it would be better to go to office in Biberach an der Riß.  I will need to move to Germany, register my address, open a bank account, etc.  
Given that I live abroad and will not be able to be in Germany long before March, I plan on going to a friend's in Mannheim in mid February and stay there until the start of the internship at least.  In the meantime I could look for a room/apartment somewhere.

(1) This is based on the assumption that it's very unlikely to rent anything before being around in person. Is that correct?

(2) Will I be able to rent a room in a shared apartment for a 6-month stay? And what about a shorter stay, like 3 months?

(3) What kind of accommodation will I need otherwise? A Zimmer/Wohnen auf Zeit? Airbnb?

(4) It looks like things in Biberach can be expensive, especially rent. Could you name some cheaper (but bigger) cities, please? Like Leipzig, maybe?

ChatGPT:

Sure, here is a TL;DR of the career advice I provided:

* If you're looking for a career that allows you to use your skills in software engineering as part of a broader role that involves interacting with customers and working on product development, there are a few different paths you could consider, such as working as a product manager or engineer, working as a consultant or contractor for small businesses, or starting your own business.
* Being unemployed for an extended period of time can make it more difficult to find a job, so it might be helpful to focus on building your skills and experience through internships, freelance work, or other opportunities, in order to make yourself more attractive to potential employers.
* It's important to carefully consider your skills and interests, and choose a path that allows you to use your strengths and pursue your passions. With time and effort, you will be able to find a job that allows you to make a positive impact.

Me: I have searched for software engineering work, but I don't find it to be compelling on it own. I enjoy software and tech to be part of the work but not all of the work, so I would like to work on product and with customers as well. I have thought about to be a freelancer making websites for small businesses. Is this a good idea or should I keep searching for a software engineering work in a startup instead?ChatGPT:

It sounds like you're looking for a career that allows you to use your skills in software engineering as part of a broader role that involves interacting with customers and working on product development. Freelancing as a web developer for small businesses could be a good way to achieve this, as it would give you the opportunity to use your technical skills to create websites for customers, while also allowing you to interact directly with those customers and work on developing products that meet their needs.

Working in a startup as a software engineer could also be a good option, as it would give you the opportunity to be part of a small, dynamic team where you would have the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects and be involved in the entire product development process. This could be particularly appealing if you enjoy working on cutting-edge technology and solving complex problems.

Ultimately, the right choice for you will depend on your personal preferences and goals. If you're interested in working on a variety of projects and being involved in the entire product development process, a startup might be a good fit for you. If you prefer to have more control over your work and the projects you take on, freelancing could be a good option. It's important to carefully consider your goals and priorities and choose the option that best aligns with them.

Me: Is there something else I could work on to achieve the career you described?

ChatGPT: If you're looking for a career that allows you to use your skills in software engineering as part of a broader role that involves interacting with customers and working on product development, there are a few different paths you could consider. One option is to look for a job as a product manager or product engineer at a technology company. In this role, you would be responsible for working closely with customers to understand their needs and develop products that meet those needs. You would also work with a team of engineers to design, build, and test the product, and you would be involved in all aspects of the product development process.

Another option is to work as a consultant or contractor for small businesses. In this role, you would be responsible for providing technical expertise and support to small businesses as they develop and implement new technology solutions. You would work closely with the business owners to understand their needs and develop solutions that meet those needs, and you would be involved in all aspects of the project, from planning and design to implementation and testing.

Finally, you could consider starting your own business. This would give you the opportunity to use your skills and expertise to create products and services that meet the needs of your customers, and you would have the freedom to determine your own work schedule and the projects you take on. Starting a business can be challenging, but it can also be very rewarding and allow you to build a career that is truly your own.

Ultimately, the right path for you will depend on your personal preferences and goals. It's important to carefully consider your skills and interests, and choose a path that allows you to use your strengths and pursue your passions.  


Me:  Would the fact that I'm unemployed and have been looking for work 2 months change your take on this?   


ChatGPT:  

The fact that you are currently unemployed and have been looking for work for two months does not change the overall advice I provided. However, it is important to consider the fact that being unemployed for an extended period of time can make it more difficult to find a job. In this situation, it might be helpful to focus on building your skills and experience through internships, freelance work, or other opportunities, in order to make yourself more attractive to potential employers. This could also help you gain practical experience and build a portfolio of work that you can show to potential employers.

Additionally, it might be helpful to network with other professionals in your field and reach out to potential employers directly to express your interest in working for their organization. This can help you connect with potential employers and learn about job opportunities that may not be advertised elsewhere.

Overall, it's important to remain persistent and focused on your goals, and to continue pursuing opportunities that align with your interests and skills. With time and effort, you will be able to find a job that allows you to use your skills and experience to make a positive impact."

I am not feeling suicidal but I am very much tired and I hoping that this is just a temporary feeling.. 

I’m not sure how to survive through the remaining months of the internship. I feel lost, suffocated in such an environment.. I am not sure if this is signs of depressed, or burnout..

I could feel my anxiety being back a little.. I am hoping that this emotions that I am feeling now is temporary..

zee5nv,0,2022-12-06,Will I get paid less as Full-Time for the company I have been contracting for?,g-unit2,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/zee5nv/will_i_get_paid_less_as_fulltime_for_the_company/,"**Background**  
I graduated in May 2022 (so i'm a new grad still) with a BS in Comp Sci from an average state school in california. I probably spent more time working on a company i founded throughout undergrad. I was the backend engineer for a mobile app where I gained more experience than the average undergrad working with AWS and GCP services. I also had an unpaid internship 1 summer where I was a ""Cloud Engineer"" and worked with AWS services there as well.

**Situation**  
I was lucky enough to secure a position as a DevOps Engineer. I was targeting Back-end Development but this opportunity seemed too good to pass up. 

I had a recruiter reach out to me for this position, they initially thought I didn't have enough skills because I was a new grad, but my experience with cloud was good enough. I had 3 calls with different people from the company, all within 1 week they offered me a position ***for $65 / hour fully remote 1 year contract.*** 

**Current Compensation**  
I countered with $70 / hour expecting to maybe get 67 or something but they said that was fine! I was really happy that all the hard work finally showed. I'm 22 and still on my parents insurance, not having benefits doesn't affect me negatively.

I work 4x10s and after looking at my first paycheck... I'm actually compensated as overtime for the last 2 hours each day ($105)... so altogether I'm actually getting paid closer to **$77** an hour! *I don't think my boss is aware of this extra $7 / hour from the ""overtime"", I just didn't mention anything because I didn't want things to change*.

Fast forward, I've been working here for about 6 months and everything has been pretty great. I flew out to the office for an event, finally met my boss and coworkers. I was talking to a more senior coworker and he mentioned that it might be a good idea to transition to Full-Time since there obviously were some benefits I am missing out on (other than healthcare). Additionally, I think I will feel more secure as a full-time employee with the current economic/job market situation.

I mentioned it to my boss and he liked the idea, said he'll look into it. Looks like we're going to have a call soon and discuss some of the details like compensation/salary etc.  


**Questions**  
How should I approach this conversation to make sure I don't somehow get a big pay cut. I think anticipating a small decrease is expected since contractors have slightly higher rates because of increased taxes and no benefits. (This is a mostly non researched assumption I just made).  

I was planning on showing one of my current pay stubs and propose we structure the compensation to reflect how my current pay is, then hear what he has to say.

I feel slightly nervous because I don't have a ton of leverage since I'm still more of a junior engineer. Additionally, I don't want to leave the company or create some dispute with the management since I plan on staying. 

If they offer me compensation that is lower than my current pay, is it rude/unwise to stay as a contractor until my contract expires, then transition to Full-Time?"

Not a huge fan of especially since it’s a summer only program. I am mostly between Verizon and Amazon. I feel that Amazon has a better name and I am looking for the best outcome for my career.

If not what are other options I should study and focus on,Mochatranchan,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/zeekpv/wondering_if_i_can_get_an_entry_level_qa_job_with/,"Am a former college student that  cant finish my degree any time soon if ever since I exceeded SAP and can't pay the back tuition due.I did an internship a few years and just did Selenium automated testing with Java and haven't done much with it since then and resume has more recently just office temp jobs. 

My most recent temp job and ended and wondering if maybe I should just try to go back to QA for now  Originally I wanted to try to do something that was maybe like full stack or DevOps but would like to try to use the month or two I have just to review study maybe work on my resume make some projects and just get a tech related job that will let me finish my degree if possible. I'm on the east coast and see there's a lot of entry level tech companies in my area but I can't get a lot of government related ones because of my debt and low gpa. Others have told me to just reach out once I get my degree probably because I'm like 7 classes away but it is frustrating because I literally can't and was looking for  something entry level or internship to support me completing it instead of working jobs that don't allow me to go to school.  

There's just so many different online things I could study that I am not really sure what's most popular or to focus on.  I've mostly been studying html CSS and JavaScript, while refreshing up on Java. Was thinking as a project maybe I should make a web desktop app , do the backend and learn AWS may get a certificate and use that to host it? I also see a lot of courses about python or c /c++ full stack which I'm interested in but figured Java and html CSS JavaScript is what I've been looking at the most so maybe just go with those? Either that or just maybe see if I can get an Entry level job w the Selenium experience but a lot of positions I see are asking for more like a grid and other things I'm sure I could learn but not sure how to put that on my resume with all my most recent stuff being non technical or academic. I haven't heard of what types of automated projects people put on a resume. 

The only other thing I could think of is to do a QA boot camp with job placement but the one that contacted me is asking for $500 upfront when they weren't initially but also at the same time giving $500 to people that refer to someone else which is weird to me and  also would take a portion of my pay. The other boot camp was full stack Java but not offered online and too far away.

Would really appreciate any advice."

zeixu3,6,2022-12-06,About me,Rbowman023,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/zeixu3/about_me/,"Hello everyone, 

I just wanted to share a little about myself and what it’s like having social anxiety, so here we go

I’m a 24yo male, I’ve always been a shy person but I can be social if someone seems interested in me. Somewhere along the line, probably in middle school I started to become self conscious and had a hard time making friends. I also began using porn as a coping mechanism around this time, which I feel only contributed to my awkwardness. High school was better because I had one close friend and other people I enjoyed being around but I was always alone on the weekends and never hung out with anyone outside of school. At the time I felt lonely but never felt any desire to ask people if they wanted to hang out. It was kind of weird. I guess I was too worried that people would judge me if I asked them to hangout and so I never did. Of course, I also enjoyed being alone and still do but there was a lot of missed opportunities because of me placing my time alone above time with others. After graduation I had no plans of going to college and just worked and that was it. Those few years were very lonely for me because I isolated so much and had no one to hang out with. Then when I was 20yo I decided to go to college. It’s kind of laughable but my main reason for going to school was to try to make friends because I was so lonely. The degree was secondary. And that first year was rough because at first I didn’t think I was going to meet anyone there but the second semester was pretty great. I found several people to hang out with in between classes. I did a few things outside of school with some of them like going to the gym or grabbing a bite to eat and it felt like things were working out for me. I even asked out a girl for the first time that semester. I still don’t know how I found the courage to do it lol and it didn’t lead to anything but I was proud of myself for trying. Then the following year I decided to make the move to main campus. I was feeling brave and confident in myself and wanted to experience main campus life so I moved there and I was very nervous and doubtful that I’d ever make any friends but on the second day of school I joined the dodgeball club and my life changed from that point on, in a good way.  I’ve met some great guys in the dodgeball club. We have a lot of whipping balls around lol. I never knew about college dodgeball but it’s real and it’s the funnest sport I’ve ever played. We travel to nearby schools and play in tournaments against some very talented teams. It’s so much fun but it’s only because the guys on my team make it feel like family. It’s sounds cheesy but it’s like we’ve always known each other. Anyways if it weren’t for dodgeball I don’t know if I’d still be in school 3 years later. That’s the only reason I’m still in school at this point. I lost interest in my major because I lack confidence and my major requires a ton of confidence. I didn’t even have the guts to try an internship to at least get a feel for the career. So here I am in my fifth year of college with no clue what to do. I can only play dodgeball for so long until I have to call it quits. The guys I started out with will be graduating and moving on soon. Speaking of them, I haven’t actually hung out with any of them outside of dodgeball and I’ve know them for almost 4 years now. My therapist tells me to ask them to hang out sometime and I know it’s the right thing to do but I can’t find the courage to. I know they won’t judge me but my mind keeps telling me that. Anyways I’m currently in this program that involves group therapy and one on one therapy and it’s been an awesome experience. It’s my last week there and then I graduate as they call it. I’m going to miss it very much because it’s given me a chance to be around people who are also struggling just like me. It’s like family there. The therapists are so joyful and happy to be there it’s almost hard to believe a place like this actually exists. It’s like family there. Im sad to leave :( I’ve met some cool people there that I’d like to get to know outside of the program. Im also sad because I’ll no longer have people who know what it’s like to talk to. And I know that my weekends will still be lonely. Im trying to find clubs and groups to join but they’re not very common where I live. I’d have to travel about an hour, which I might have to do. Oh another issue with some of these clubs is that they rarely have events. Anyhow im trying to find ways to make friends, it’s just a difficult process, throw SA in the mix and it’s even harder. I know this is one huge paragraph. My apologies lol. If anyone decides to read this I’d like to hear your thoughts and maybe make a friend :)"

I am a CS grad and I have done damn near nothing technical at all in my career. For whatever reason, I am apparently doing well enough that I have been promoted and given several raises. In spite of how cushy this may sound, I fucking hate it. I want a real job and to be doing something even remotely intellectually stimulating. When I am working, I'm doing the same thing, over and over again. And I'm stressed out the entire time.

I was not an excellent CS student. I was really counting on my job to give me hands on experience. I didn't intern as a student. I have very low confidence in my ability to program, so I just have never even considered a role as a dev. I like puzzles, but I have a mental block on programming now. I just feel utterly inadequate.

I interviewed at a company I was really excited about and got a rejection letter from them. This rejection has hit me even harder than usual. People all say ""oh keep applying, it'll get easier,"" but you know, it doesn't. It sucks every single time.

In the meantime, I have friends who are getting recruited constantly, interviewing, changing jobs, moving up. And I'm just stuck. Same place, same job, completely trapped.

For every position I apply to, I carefully tailor my resume. I've gotten referrals from people who work there. I reach out on LinkedIn. I network, I apply far and wide, and yet, I feel like they've got me figured out. Like I've been a total fraud this whole time and everyone knows it. Call it imposter syndrome, but I'm starting to think they're on to something."
zendtu,1,2022-12-06,Am I being lowballed or is this good? Should I try to negotiate salary?,backwardsshortjump,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/zendtu/am_i_being_lowballed_or_is_this_good_should_i_try/,"CS new grad here with 2 internships (may 2022 graduation from Cornell), just got an offer from a small DOD-associated company (\~100 employees) for $30 an hour, and the work looks like trying to puzzle out what some other engineers-that-left did in their largely C-based legacy codebase and working with some hardware. 

Should I try to negotiate with them or should I just take this and run with it? The interview was entirely soft skills only and they had a total of one (1) other software guy who wasn't exactly talkative when I shadowed him for the in-person interview/tour. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks folks!"

And it's honestly shameful how few life skills I've amassed during this time. I'm sorry this is so rambling but I'm a bit frantic right now, even though I get that my situation isn't as bad as others because of my family's privilege.

I am currently a junior studying CS and am interviewing for SWE internships with multiple companies and have made it far in the interview loops for Oracle OCI, Yext, and Qualtrics.

I am trying to (preemptively) figure out, if I were lucky enough to receive multiple offers, which offer makes the most sense to take. I am mainly concerned about what would look best on my resume / give me the best experience for future job opportunities when I am applying to full time SWE roles. Pay rate and location are not hugely important to me for my internship as I believe the pay rates are similar. I'm just not sure what the reputation of each of these places is in the tech world and how to compare them."

I am set to graduate and get my bachelors for this depth in winter and looking to go into the graduate program for ISRC because I can't seem to find an internship. Maybe it's because my gpa is too low at 3.4? Any tips on landing internships and jobs as a ML and controls depth? Also for ECE graduate students, how difficult is it to land a TA/RA job without contacting or knowing the professors? I unfortunately was unable to build too much of a rapport with any of the professors during my undergraduate studies. Any reply would be appreciated, thank you."
zesri3,0,2022-12-07,Can someone help me assess whether it's worth it for me to even try? [international student],school-accnt,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/zesri3/can_someone_help_me_assess_whether_its_worth_it/,"Alright, so I've just started researching about this whole process and this all feels so overwhelming to me, and it feels like I'm 2 - 3 years behind everyone else. Like, I still have around 11 months until my app season starts, and yet it feels like there's nothing I could in that time to try to better myself and become even slightly competitive. At this point I'm questioning whether it's even worth it for me to try/consider applying to college in the US or if my time would be better spent elsewhere (maybe trying to learn German and see if i have better luck there lol).

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, here's some info about me:

&amp;#x200B;

* Demographics: black (African), [Mozambican](https://www.britannica.com/place/Mozambique), male, in my country I'd say lower to regular middle class, though compared to the US, *extremely* low income
* Intended Major: CS or EE (though I'd be willing to do Math too)
* Have never taken any standardized test score (SAT, ACT, or TOEFL)
* School system/curriculum (I feel like this should precede the GPA): In my country, after you finish 10^(th) grade, you have the option to continue in the regular path (until 12^(th)) grade, or go to (something similar to the US's) vocational school (your certificate/diploma will be equivalent to 12^(th) grade, but you'll have had a technical/professional education instead). In this system we don't have subjects, but rather ""modules"". Each module ranges from 4 to 8 weeks, and is pass or fail - to pass you need to have had 80% or 100% in all of the tests (depending on if it's a vocational module or a general one). At the end of each year (it's a 3 year program), you make a project where you apply what you've learnt that year, present it, and then your grade for that year comes from that project. The minimum grade to pass that project is 16/20.
* A note on the above: Other than the final project, and minimum of 16/20 grade, another pre requisite to graduate/pass is to do an internship each year (though you could accumulate and do it all at once). So by the time I graduate, I'll have at least 420 hours in internships (with 100 hours/one internship being related to electricity, and the rest to IT). I can expand on this point and the above if anyone would like me to.
* Course (at vocational school): Industrial Electricity/Information Technology (though its mostly the latter)
* GPA: The last one I have is from 10^(th) grade, it's a 16/20. When I graduate vocational school, I'm guaranteed to have at least a 16/20 again (though I can try harder harder to get an 18+).
* AP/Coursework: Those don't exist in my country and everyone (who doesn't go to a private/international school) just takes the same maths, physics, portuguse, english, biology, chemistry, geography, history subjects  (in 11/12^(th) grade its a bit different - but again I didn't go there).
* Extracurriculars (those also mostly don't exist in my country, unless you go outside of school and are willing to pay, plus I'm not even sure what counts, so I'll just list what i think might): mostly none, though from 7^(th) to 9^(th) grade I practiced chess (though nothing memorable, only won 3 medals in some small competitions), 10^(th) grade did nothing (that was 2020/Covid for me), following year started started taking some programming courses and practicing and do so till now
* Awards: None
* List of colleges: Haven't compiled any, due to the reasons stated above
* Budget: Would probably need a full ride (*if i went further in this process*). Haven't had ""the talk"" with my parents about college yet, though i doubt they'd be able to afford anything more than 2K USD/year. Plus this process is **expensive**, *like for real the application fee for some of these colleges are higher than my country's minimum wage*
* Other info: I was reading something from educationUSA from my country and it said that that, as of 2019, from the \~1 million international students in the US, 127 of them were from my country. So I don't know if that means anything...

&amp;#x200B;

That's mostly it about me. Could anyone help me assess if it's worth it to even try given my profile/circumstances (and preferably explain me why or why not)?

&amp;#x200B;

If it is worth it to give it a shot, how should I approach this/what should be my strategy? What could/should I  try to do until the next app season to improve my chances/profile?

Is there something I could even do about my lack of ECs at this point? I could maybe try to level up as a programmer and find [open source](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/open-source/what-is-open-source) projects to contribute to? Maybe try and get into something like [GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)  or other similar programs (though that'd be probably be very hard, but I'd be willing to try my best)?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for anyone who's read it this far, and to anyone willing/able to help me.

&amp;#x200B;

Note to the mods: This wasn't intended to be a chance me or anything, but if it came across as that, feel free to tell me and I'll reformat the post or take it elsewhere."
zesz29,1,2022-12-07,Frustration,GoingAway_,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/zesz29/frustration/,"My friend is an adult and I cannot believe how inept she can be. I never had anything to complain about, I love the fact she’s the sweetest chatterbox ever, her personality is not the issue.
But for a bit now I’ve been receiving what feels like backhanded, all ever since she started her internship.

I am a night owl, I work way better at night, but if an affair calls for early morning I will come of course. If I gotta do something during the day yes I will because although I work better at night I am not useless during the day.
A few back we was talking about doing something early and she said “Oh this is the time I’m in my internship and you’re usually sleeping.” Which yes I just saw as an obvious observation at the time and chuckled.

We watched the opening to the World Cup together and it was early on, the day before she asked on our groupchat if it’d be okay for her to be earlier here since I’m usually sleeping during the day. I’ll admit I was having a bad day and answered along the lines of “i am having people over of course i am goinf to wake up earlier to prepare stuff, i do stuff too, you know?” To which she sent an audio saying it was her bad and she was sleepy and not thinking right when she asked.

She also interrupts people a lot, claiming she remembered something and taking over the conversation. But god forbid you interrupt her, she’ll deadface you. This is personally annoying because many times I’ll be talking to someone else about something she doesn’t know and I don’t wanna talk to her about and she’ll jump “what was it? I lost the end of it.” Good! You weren’t invited to this convo anyways! We don’t exclude her, sometimes we just talk about stuff that involve other than the friendgroup.

It’s all little things I’ve been holding back on calling out, mainly cos I like her, but enough is enough.

I’ve come to realize she sometimes comments stuff uncalled for, during a random amount of time, little comments about something that you don’t particularly feel good about. And after you explode she’ll be surprised. Another annoying habit is when she realizes she irritated you she’ll playfully go “oh you love me!” No i do not, not right now.

The straw that broke the camels back was when I was speaking to another friend at uni about her job. My friend works at a clinic I really wanna work at and her boss kind of asked her to ‘scout’ classmates since we’re majoring in psychology. The conversation was just that friend and I, and then she tells me “I told boss you’re very calm-“

Then the inept friend dramatically spat out her water and yelled “OP? OP ISNT CALM LOLOL.” And that irritated me a lot. She has this image of me being lazy for lack of a better word because I am not constantly neurotic as she is. She’ll think that of anyone that isn’t 24/7 worrying like her.
When I turned to ask her what’s her problem, she’s smiling and saying “OP u gotta admit thay from our group I am the most calm!” To which I snapped and said she’s the furthest thing from it.
After class she just came over to talk like nothing happened. What she did was specially upsetting bc she isn’t even interested on the job, and her little show could’ve actually tainted how the scouting friend saw me fit for the clinic, I feel like she did it just to act out????

Worse is she does all that and will act surprised if you call her out, like it isn’t POSSIBLE she doesn’t realizes that even if it was a “joke” to her, other people might not see that way??? Now after I told her why I’m pissed at her, she claims I’m twisting her words

It isn’t me only being a bit done with her, but now I’m more mad because she cannot possibly be so inept like this."

**Interviews**

Only had one interview for UPenn biodent program. My interviewer was very laid back and nice

**Essays**

TONS of Questbridge Essays, I spent around a month on biographical and topical, and two weeks on short answers

Biographical: Wrote about an experience with having my house robbed and how it caused me to reflect on my relationship with my two sisters, spoke about being the middle child and how each of my sisters shaped my personal foundation and how I will build on this foundation in college- I wasn't a huge fan of it but others told me it was good and represented me well so 7/10

Topical: Chose the community prompt. Wrote about how my hair connects me to my black community and how it will connect me to my community at college. I wrote my last paragraph in relation to each sense which I thought was unique. Was one of my favorites to write and I believe it was very unique to me 9/10

Additional Information:

I indicated on all my applications that I switched schools after two years, which explains my extracurriculars. 

I had zero expectations of matching, so this was a nice surprise. In the end, I really believe my essays set me apart. I poured my all into them and made sure to make them unique to me. I believe that each essay told a different part of my story that readers could connect with. My advice is to really set aside time for your essays and have a lot of people you trust help with editing (I had three proofreaders). Such a relief to be done, good luck everyone!"

I am feeling so discouraged that no jobs were reaching out for any sort of interview. If I screwed up the coding interview and got rejected then that's a different story, but I can't even get to that stage. So I decided to buy LinkedIn premium and get an idea of how other applicants were. I then found out that for every internship that I apply to, over 50 to 60 percent of applicants have a masters degree or higher. Is this normal? I don't ever know why a job recruiter would choose a person like me with no work experience and an undergrad over a person with a master's degree. Anyone have any experience or advice?"

I have ILR and relevant work experience in the UK.,banpav,UniUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/zex44t/will_my_english_proficiency_be_overlooked_i_have/,"Hi folks. I am a true outlier when it comes to university applications - I was partly raised in the UK as my parents immigrated here, but I had to do my bachelor's in India because of medical reasons (serious skin conditions). 

I moved back to the UK to reunite with my parents in 2020, and have been steadily working as a software engineer since then, and have even been promoted every 5 months at each job I have worked at (so I have relevant work experience IN THE UK for the course I am aiming for which is MSc Advanced Computing or Msc Computing).  The british accent has stuck with me ever since I moved back to Mumbai, India.  


The weird thing is, my parents are now British Citizens but I am on an Indefinite Leave to remain visa, and I have been working here for almost 3 years in total now, on track to get  my citizenship as well.   


My question is, a lot of the universities I have been looking at applying to (Imperial, King's College London,  University College London etc) do have some exemption rules for English Proficiency, but I do not explicitly (clearly) fall into them.   


Hence my question is, is it even possible for me to get an admit for a Master's degree in Computing, **given I don't really have anything to demonstrate english proficiency?** I have not taken the IELTS or TOEFL, but doing so now would waste time and I think I would definitely be rejected if I were to apply to these competitive unis quite late in Feb or March, and the exams cost a lot of money. Will universities understand that I am proficient in English from my work experience in the UK? (I mean, I wouldn't be getting promoted if I wasnt communicating properly right? I have hinted at this in my personal statements too)  


Should I still go ahead and apply to other university (King's is next on the list) without much proof of english proficiency apart from work experience in the UK? **Or should I save money by applying next year instead after taking an english proficiency test?**  


Background - Bachelors in Computer Engineering from a fairly well reputed university in India, 8.5/10 CGPA, 2 internships both in CS"
zeytne,2,2022-12-07,"[UK] Should I leave a good dev job and do a master's degree, in *this* economy?",banpav,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/zeytne/uk_should_i_leave_a_good_dev_job_and_do_a_masters/," 

Hi folks. Been a long time lurker on this sub, and most of the bits I have needed help with over the years, y'all have solved beautifully, for which I am truly grateful.

I am currently working as a software engineer primarily on APIs in Spring and Java in the UK (not in london sadly). I would really like to work for one of the big companies, as I need to get a big bump in pay (currently only at 35,000GBP) to be able to afford to start a family, buy a house and stuff... I was considering a Master's degree in Advanced Computing because it would allow me to hone my skills specifically at machine learning which I really enjoy, and I feel that a master's degree would allow me to soldify my position here in the UK (I have a foreign bachelor's degree)... I'll be open to working in the UK, US and India after the master's.

So my question was pretty much going to be, **""Should I leave my job given the current stormy economic conditions to pursue a master's degree, with my primary motivation being getting into a ML role in a FAGMAN** (picked up from this sub lol) **company?""**

I have been practising ML at home but I haven't really been able to fully dedicate and apply myself to it because of other things and commitments, so I thought a master's degree would let me focus on one clear goal for a while, and steady efforts would eventually enable me to achieve my goal of getting into a big company. **What do you guys think?**

Background - Bachelor's in Computer Engineering from a fairly well reputed university in India (Distinction), 2 internships in ML and 1 year of Experience in .NET as a Web Developer, 9 months of experience at a fortune 700 software company."

It was only last week I really started to really realize I turned into a full on workaholic. Like I would usually come go work at 8:45am but only reach home at 9pm or 10pm and I don't even complain.

Most of my career has not been in a normal economy due to the pandemic and the current recession in 2022.




I would say the best recent years to graduate would have been 2010-2011.  It is just long enough after 2008 for the economy to start improving, and well before anyone knew that being a computer science major was a path to success.  I imagine there was less Leetcode too.  I used to work with an engineer at a large tech company who graduated around then without any internships and a GPA in the 2.0 range, who has never found it too difficult to find a job.





Even better than 2010-2011 would have been the mid-2000s before the 2008 recession, since it would have been possible to start working for many of the tech unicorns/big tech companies today as an early employee.  I have noticed that a lot of tech leadership at different companies are made up of people who graduated around that time, so it seemed like another great time to build a career.




For anyone graduating around my time, it seems like the best we can do is study Leetcode after work and hope that translates to higher paying jobs in the future."

For more context, I am transferring from an extremely non-target uni for finance and I got already into much better schools however they are still non-target for high finance roles. I am an international European student, so I did not know much about target and nontarget unis and I discovered more about this concept after I did my transfer application for these schools. The schools that I got currently in that are worth mentioning I think are W.P Carey School of Business ASU (I thought this school would be good for finance since it ranks 24 in the country for business but apparently not), Bentley University, University of Richmond, and maybe (I have not heard from them yet) Lehigh University. Now l am thinking if to wait for another application cycle (so as to transfer for fall 2023) or I should just accept the offer from the best school that I can go to right now for the spring (I am thinking Bentley University). Here are my stats with some important notes:

Note #1 in total I am 1 year out of school (I withdrew one semester because of family and mental health reasons and this semester I did not go to my uni)

Note #2 I have junior credits (so yeah I am a junior, so a lot of unis, especially the Ivys will not accept my application because of my junior credits)

Note #3 I am missing a core class requirement for some schools for Finance: Calculus 1. (Yeah I know my uni was crap. However, I can solve this by taking calc 1 at a community college next semester).

Ok now, here are the stats:

High school: 

I will not say much about my high school in order to keep myself anonymous however it was really rigorous and for international terms, I had a 3.5 GPA (I guess you can translate it like that). With some EC that are mostly meaningless.

SAT: 1260. However, for most unis it is now test optional and I will not submit it

COLLEGE:

Academics:

Finance and Applied Economics double major 4.0 UG GPA. Dean's list. Honor student Phi Kappa Phi (given only to top 10% of the class) and Beta Gamma Sigma (business honor society)

ECs:

Student government representative part of the finance board committee, managing millions of dollars of student money to donate/fund to RSOs on campus.

Managing director of a consulting club that helps non-profits around the area.

Treasurer of a fraternity on campus.

Internships: 

Two internships over the summer: one as an undergraduate researcher at my uni for economics and public policy and the second one as a financial analyst at a big city in California (analyzing the fixed-income investment portfolio of the municipality).

Reasons for transferring:

There are personal, mental, and academic reasons for why I am transferring (it is not just for the ""prestige"" of an elite university). The main reason is mostly the death of a family member caused by Covid-19 and how it impacted my entire family financially, mentally, and my uni life (It was a horrible year, to be honest).

So should I wait and try universities like UVA or Boston College or others? Which universities should I pursue for finance given my current situation? Or should I just accept where I got in this cycle (likely Bentley)?

I want to thank everyone for reading this and any feedback is appreciated, thank you so much for your help!

zf4l47,1,2022-12-07,"I feel lost, and have no idea where to go next.",cleanshirtuk,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/zf4l47/i_feel_lost_and_have_no_idea_where_to_go_next/,"Happy timezone everyone! 

Long story short, I am sick to death of being broke and working silly hours (I work a 9-5 ET, but am based in the UK so it's really a 2pm-10pm). My issue is that I've really become a 'jack of all trades, master of none' kinda guy. For context, I've worked in a contact centre in the last 4 years, beginning as a tech support agent for IoT smart speakers. After 2 years, I was promoted to the Tier 3 team, handling mainly customer, technical and safety escalations, as well as other small projects that come up (assisting the privacy and security team in data gathering, fraud analysis, and generally being the cleanup crew when somebody paid a lot more than I do inevitably fucks up). In addition to this, I also was part of an 'internship' where I fulfilled a temporary project management role to launch 2 new contact centre's on different continents, as well as 2x fixed term team leader positions during peak season to lead our seasonal agents. 

All of this has been on a base salary of 25k GBP. Opportunities have arisen, which I have been passed up for, and every time I have been told that I'm the 'runner up'. Every manager I have had has had a lot of confidence in me and has tried to do their best to put me in positions to progress - unfortunately, suitable roles seem to appear once in a blue moon, and my 'jack of all trades'-ness means that there's usually a candidate that has better experience in one specific part of the job description. 

I would say that I have an intermediate experience in the following technologies: 

\- Windows, macOS &amp; Linux OSes (End User specifically, whilst I have dabbled in spinning up my own servers for personal use and small businesses I'm not very well versed)  
\- Consumer-grade networking  
\- Google Home &amp; Alexa  
\- Bluetooth &amp; AirPlay   
\- Creative applications (specifically Adobe PS/AE, Ableton Live)  
\- MS Office apps (again, from an end user perspective, not necessarily maintaining O365 from the back end)  
\- Home Theatre Technologies (troubleshooting HDMI CEC/ARC specifically as well as audio format issues)

I have found that I've really enjoyed taking ownership of projects and seeing them through to fruition. I also love identifying issues with policy/processes, and implementing new processes within the business to make improvements. I've always been dedicated to what I do, working all kinds of odd shifts and being the port of call for last minute overtime, hell I'd work 12 hour days if the company would let me (believe me, I've asked lol). I know the suggestions normally would say to look for a 'helpdesk' job, but I don't know if what I've been doing currently would already be considered helpdesk?

Apologies for the overall negative tone - I try to stay optimistic, but today has been one of those days. My question is - given the skills listed above, but with no qualifications, what role should I be looking for something new? Or alternatively, can anybody suggest any recruiters in the UK (south east specifically) that may be able to have a conversation and suggest a general direction? 

TIA!"

Are there any good aggregator sites like indeed or bright network that I could check out? All the advice online I've found is applying to companies directly.

Even better would be if you've already done this and could share how you did it.

zf8bep,6,2022-12-07,Can someone help me assess whether it's worth it for me to even try?,school-accnt,IntltoUSA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/zf8bep/can_someone_help_me_assess_whether_its_worth_it/,"Alright, so I've just started researching about this whole process and this all feels so overwhelming to me, and it feels like I'm 2 - 3 years behind everyone else. Like, I still have around 11 months until my app season starts, and yet it feels like there's nothing I could in that time to try to better myself and become even slightly competitive. At this point I'm questioning whether it's even worth it for me to try/consider applying to college in the US or if my time would be better spent elsewhere (maybe trying to learn German and see if i have better luck there lol).

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, here's some info about me:

&amp;#x200B;

* Demographics: black (African), [Mozambican](https://www.britannica.com/place/Mozambique), male, in my country I'd say lower to regular middle class, though compared to the US, *extremely* low income
* Intended Major: CS or EE (though I'd be willing to do Math too)
* Have never taken any standardized test score (SAT, ACT, or TOEFL)
* School system/curriculum (I feel like this should precede the GPA): In my country, after you finish 10^(th) grade, you have the option to continue in the regular path (until 12^(th)) grade, or go to (something similar to the US's) vocational school (your certificate/diploma will be equivalent to 12^(th) grade, but you'll have had a technical/professional education instead). In this system we don't have subjects, but rather ""modules"". Each module ranges from 4 to 8 weeks, and is pass or fail - to pass you need to have had 80% or 100% in all of the tests (depending on if it's a vocational module or a general one). At the end of each year (it's a 3 year program), you make a project where you apply what you've learnt that year, present it, and then your grade for that year comes from that project. The minimum grade to pass that project is 16/20.
* A note on the above: Other than the final project, and minimum of 16/20 grade, another pre requisite to graduate/pass is to do an internship each year (though you could accumulate and do it all at once). So by the time I graduate, I'll have at least 420 hours in internships (with 100 hours/one internship being related to electricity, and the rest to IT). I can expand on this point and the above if anyone would like me to.
* Course (at vocational school): Industrial Electricity/Information Technology (though its mostly the latter)
* GPA: The last one I have is from 10^(th) grade, it's a 16/20. When I graduate vocational school, I'm guaranteed to have at least a 16/20 again (though I can try harder harder to get an 18+).
* AP/Coursework: Those don't exist in my country and everyone (who doesn't go to a private/international school) just takes the same maths, physics, portuguse, english, biology, chemistry, geography, history subjects  (in 11/12^(th) grade its a bit different - but again I didn't go there).
* Extracurriculars (those also mostly don't exist in my country, unless you go outside of school and are willing to pay, plus I'm not even sure what counts, so I'll just list what i think might): mostly none, though from 7^(th) to 9^(th) grade I practiced chess (though nothing memorable, only won 3 medals in some small competitions), 10^(th) grade did nothing (that was 2020/Covid for me), following year started started taking some programming courses and practicing and do so till now
* Awards: None
* List of colleges: Haven't compiled any, due to the reasons stated above
* Budget: Would probably need a full ride (*if i went further in this process*). Haven't had ""the talk"" with my parents about college yet, though i doubt they'd be able to afford anything more than 2K USD/year. Plus this process is **expensive**, *like for real the application fee for some of these colleges are higher than my country's minimum wage*
* Other info: I was reading something from educationUSA from my country and it said that that, as of 2019, from the \~1 million international students in the US, 127 of them were from my country. So I don't know if that means anything...

&amp;#x200B;

That's mostly it about me. Could anyone help me assess if it's worth it to even try given my profile/circumstances (and preferably explain me why or why not)?

&amp;#x200B;

If it is worth it to give it a shot, how should I approach this/what should be my strategy? What could/should I  try to do until the next app season to improve my chances/profile?

Is there something I could even do about my lack of ECs at this point? I could maybe try to level up as a programmer and find [open source](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/open-source/what-is-open-source) projects to contribute to? Maybe try and get into something like [GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)  or other similar programs (though that'd be probably be very hard, but I'd be willing to try my best)?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for anyone who's read it this far, and to anyone willing/able to help me."

I’ve worked every holiday and my birthday for the past few months. I pick up at least 3 or 4 shifts per WEEK when people call out. This only made me seem like a pushover and my manager takes advantage. 

I’m routinely scheduled over 50 hours a week. I’m completing a paralegal degree and studying for the LSAT….all of which I have no time for when working over 50 hours per week. 

I also work in a pharmacy and will be the only person at pick up. So I just spend 8-9 hours dealing with angry and impatient customers every day. With zero breaks (we don’t have lunch and I don’t even take 15 mins). 

Now I have to work 9 days in a row and expected to work Christmas and Xmas eve. I tried to show that I was a hard worker by always going to work when scheduled, never calling out, and filling in for absences. But it just made my manager take advantage and treat me like shit. 

I don’t know how I will mentally cope with 9 days of verbal abuse from customers tbh. And I also work 5 days straight (with one day off) prior to the 9 day stretch. Wtf? I am going to fall so far behind with school and I had to quit my volunteering and another internship because of this. 

Meanwhile my lazy coworkers all get to take a “holiday” and call out while I’m being abused for the whole month and work every single holiday. Or work for 9 days straight. And these are the same asshokes who complain about not having enough hours. But refuse to work weekends or shitty hours. 

My boss says it’s because they have “families” LOL. Just because I’m younger and don’t have a baby or a child doesn’t mean I have no “family”. I mean, she can probably tell that I’m a loser with no family or friends (which is true). But why should I be punished for having no social life and not having a child???"

I have one complete minor project and one project that I made during my gap year. Now, I am thinking of narrowing down and start preparing. I have already told myself to learn DSA holistically and practice leetcode.   


I am also thinking of making more projects (maybe 2 more) before I get an internship. What areas and technologies to base the projects in? How to host the project (now that Heroku has also started charging money)? and Maybe a few projects that make you standout or gets me to the interview round.  


I have great academic record, I have multiple positions of responsibilities, I also published an academic paper in my gap year (very basic stuff).   


My profile doesn't have any certifications as I found most of them as waste of time. It's easier and efficient to learn directly from the documentation and reading things of the internet. But my seniors have told me to get a few certifications as well. But the problem is most of the certifications are pretty expensive. Will it be fine if I dont have any certifications? Maybe I can photoshop the certifications (as most don't have anything that can be used to verify if it is legit or not)

I’m (25F) moving out with my LDR boyfriend (27M) and need to tell my religious parents about it. I have recently been accepted to a Graduate program at the University in my boyfriends city. That program is the best in the state and will make it easier for me to complete my internship and getting my license in my field in the future. 

The issue is that I have decided to live with my boyfriend instead of living in my own. My boyfriend has a home that he owns and living with him would save me so much money that can be put towards my schooling instead. I grew up as the daughter of pastors. My parents are both evangelical/Pentecostal and have raised all of my siblings the same way. All of my siblings waited until they were married to move out but I will not be doing that. My parents love my boyfriend and they are happy with my relationship, but have mentioned that they would hope I would make my boyfriend go to church because he’s perfect otherwise. They also always bring up how much they want me to go back to their church but I am not happy going there. I know they have an image to keep up as pastors and already they expressed they feel they have “failed as parents” because I am not going to church regularly and am the only one of my siblings that doesn’t go to their church. I also know that by moving out with my boyfriend I will make my parents extremely disappointed and it will cause so many issues, but I need to get my graduate degree in order to work in my field and I cannot afford to pay both a graduate degree AND all the living expenses in that city (it’s a very expensive city to live in) on my own. 
 
My other issue is that my mom was recently diagnosed with cancer and I feel so guilty about the fact that I’m going to have to give her this news while she’s getting treatments. I have been losing sleep, having nightmares and I have constant headaches and body pain from being physically tense from the guilt. I don’t want to be a horrible daughter but I need to do this in order to improve myself and be where I want to be as well as find happiness. I have already made up my mind and will be moving for sure in May. I just wanted advice in what is the best way to tell them and what I can do to lessen the betrayal and hurt they’ll feel."

100 apps -&gt; 2 Interviews -&gt; One Ghost After Recruiter said she would give me next round, other gave me a difficult dp problem and then I brute forced couldnt do optimal and rejected.

pain I'm back at drawing board. How did you guys land your first internship especially in SWE? Im at 125 apps and at this point im losing hope. I cant even focus on my classes cuz im so hellbent on getting an offer. I've got my resume reviewed but to be fair its just teaching experience (CSM + AI), 61B projects + an app in Android + an internship I did in HS with web-scraping and SQL . Im so tired bro

zff55b,3,2022-12-07,Biology PhD Student: Advice Needed,Ok_Recognition_3833,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/zff55b/biology_phd_student_advice_needed/,"TLDR: I’m a 3rd year PhD student in a Population genetics lab in North America. I want a bioinformatics/computational biology internship in industry after my 4th year and similarly a job upon graduation (after 5th or 6th year). I have concerns that I won’t have extensive experience by the time I graduate. This is because I won’t get data I need for my main projects till the start of year 4 (infectious disease single cell omics projects). I’m not from a hardcore coding lab that mostly uses omic databases like gtex and gwas summary stats etc. I’ve had to do time consuming extensive fieldwork to generate my data. I have peers from dry labs who spend all 5-6 PhD years immersed in intensive coding projects. I’m worried that compared to them I won’t be as competitive when applying for jobs since I’ll just have 1-2 years experience. 

Background:
My first PhD project was on infectious disease epidemiology (long story)and I’ve become relatively good at R. I have experience with Unix,Python, HPCC from classes but I’ve never carried out an actual project with them. As a third year I’m starting to get self conscious of my lack of experience with analyzing/simulating -omic data. When I’m at meetings or conferences with other population geneticists I can understand the theory of their research but I get lost in the bionformatic jargon they talk about. I spent my first 2 years on my epidemiology project (completed) and studying for my qualifying exams. I am in my 3rd year and it involves a lot of fieldwork, data collection, reading and grant writing. I’m trying to figure out a computational genetics side project I can do but tbh I’m so tired after fieldwork that I don’t have the bandwidth. In my 4-5th years I’ll finally have data I need for my -omic projects. 

I know that I’m complaining and sound insecure but It’ll be nice to get some reassurance from people that might have been in this position or work with/hired people in my position. Unfortunately I don’t feel supported by my PI and he isn’t the kind of person I can talk to about things like this"
zff6qc,0,2022-12-07,What did just happen?,DidiiBoi,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/zff6qc/what_did_just_happen/,"I'll try to keep this as short as possible guys. 

I was in the military and left because I couldn't stand the isolation, which made me depressed to the point where I puked every day during my service; I left about 4 months ago. Because I quit, I decided to take a gap year and participate in volunteer programs all over the world, but first I took a month off, participated in some programs but I didn't feel that spark of joy that I expected to have and so I began to learn programming, specifically front-end development.

Time passed and I have learned the basics of front end development, html and css and wordpress. And so I somehow managed to land a coder's dream job, well its actually a one month intern and then begin with a contract since I have no previous work experience. However, it's really a dream job; you have flexible schedule of your choosing: 9-5:30, 10-6:30 and 11-7:30, all you need is to have 7.30 hours of effective daily work, it's a friendly environment where everyone is like a family, an empathic boss who actually cares for his staff but needs to be tough since he doesn't want his workers to be spoiled and neglect work, you have a pool table to play anytime you want, a chill room with a ps4 and a 55 inch screen TV if you want to play in, you decide when to have your 1 hour break and also a free gym membership and a 25% off a nearby restaurant. 

Ps. A cousin of mine whom I didn't know about happens to work there as well as my best friend who I grew up with works there. Since today was my first day at work I had to be under my best friends command and no, none of them intervened in having me work there, I wanted to be there myself. 

However, I go to work today and start to feel the exact same sickness that I had in the military, I felt like vomiting in the morning, and I kept being doubtful and asking myself ""wtf am I doing here? I don't want to work for anyone and I want to be financially independent, I can start trading and eventually become financially independent."" 

I feel like I don't fit in there, basically everyone does their job, my team is very supportive even though I'm nowhere near their level and I don't have any pressure whatsoever, at least for now, everyone is just okay. However, after lunch I started settling and feeling like I could do this but, the moment I went home for some reason I just hated the idea of having to work and I felt sick of it. I just don't want to work but I know that it's better than staying home all day and doing nothing. 

The problem with me is that I don't care what people think, I live my life how I see fit, but I feel like not caring at all will make me lost at some point in my life. I feel like I'm a little spoiled since I haven't had a real job before and I want to ask you guys what do you think about it?

I'm 18 btw and I'm very serious about this. 

Thanks in advance."

zffy2f,2,2022-12-07,I’m tired,Writing_Dreams_2,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/zffy2f/im_tired/,"I’ll preface this by saying I really love my family, especially my mom. But, I’m tired of constantly feeling invalid.

My mom and I just got into a fight, so I’m still simmering down. But, this fight got me thinking of some fight we had in the past. It wasn’t long after I came back from an internship of sorts in a different state, I had spent six months there and only physically saw my family once during the whole six months. Things were good for a while, but then my younger sibling and I got into a fight, and my mom came to my sibling’s defense and said something along the lines of “we didn’t fight once when you were gone”

And now, looking back at it, it really hurt to hear that. While my family probably heard those words at surface value, all I heard was “it was better here when you were gone”. I know my mom didn’t mean it like that, I know she loves me, and I know that what she said was probably an exaggeration (a few of my friends laughed and told me it was impossible since my family fights frequently over petty things).

Still, even when she hugged me after this fight, it still feels like everything I feel is invalid. Because I feel like I don’t deserve to feel bad or unseen. I live at my house rent free, all in exchange for chores. I have it good, I know I have it good. But, I just can’t help but feel helpless at the fact no one wants to even try to understand how I feel.

I’ve carried this mental baggage since my step dad died. Even though I mourned, I know my mom needed me. I’m the eldest child, so I was also the impromptu helper if something came up. I try so hard to help, but it always feel like it’s never enough.

I’m tired, but I don’t want to leave. How do I fix this? I don’t want to break apart my family, I know it’s my mom’s worst fear and I know she needs me more than she lets on. But, I’m just exhausted."

zfhged,7,2022-12-07,Effort levels as a student,ernesto905,devops,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/zfhged/effort_levels_as_a_student/,"I'm currently a sophomore at University and I'm very interested in pursuing DevOps as a career. I landed an internship this summer but don't have much experience with Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, AWS, YAML, ruby on rails, or Linux. Assuming burnout is no issue, would it be a good idea to start learning about these technologies throughout the next school semester prior to my internship?

I ask because I was once offered the advice that ""it's best not to set the standard too high during my internships"". In retrospect, the only rational explanation for such advice is that starting slow is preferable since rapid improvement is a very desirable metric in it's own right. Maybe someone else has heard or offered this advice before?

Ruby/Ruby on Rails (just the fundamentals) 

Linux fundamentals and server management (UC Boulder course on Coursera)

Basically, at a specific time on a specific date the pages become available for booking. The issue is that there aren't enough places for everyone and i end up not booking any, even if I'm just a few seconds late. It's very similar to try and snipe a ticket early before they ran out. 

I know how to write a script to navigate the page and log me in but I'm having trouble with the specific timing and the fact that i don't know the url of the page when it goes live. 

Which is the best method i can use to achieve this? Is this doable for someone with little experience? Idk if this is the right subreddit but I'd appreciate any advice."

zfiz9e,2,2022-12-07,Should I drop Math 214?,HJ_Icarus,uofm,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/zfiz9e/should_i_drop_math_214/,"Heyo. I currently have a B- in Math 214 and have calculated that I need an 85% on the final to get my grade to a B and keep my semester GPA above 3.0. I'm a first-semester freshman intending on pursuing CS and this semester has been rough grade-wise. I'm worried that I won't meet this 85% benchmark and will end up keeping my grade low in that class, which will pull my overall GPA to slightly below a 3.0. Should I drop this class at this point? I want to keep a 3.0 at least for internship options and am aiming to pull my GPA up next semester. I'm also worried that a low grade in linear algebra, which is a decently important course for CS will reflect negatively on my capabilities. If I drop, I plan on taking Rob 101 next year. I have a meeting with an advisor already but I am just turning to reddit to get any advice or insight about this situation. Even if you don't know about Math 214, any insight into if its possible to recover from this low first semester would be appreciated. Thank you!"
zfj6r1,6,2022-12-07,Studying Mechatronics engineering vs computer science,Think-Journalist6629,cscareerquestionsCAD,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsCAD/comments/zfj6r1/studying_mechatronics_engineering_vs_computer/,"Today I was accepted to queens university for both tron eng and compsci. I want to go into swe, but I was wondering if it really mattered what I’m studying and if it would affect me being able to find internships?

Obviously CS makes more sense to study but I’m leaning towards Mechatronics for multiple reasons: 

1. Easier to make friends in engineering, and it has a much more tight knit community 
2. Get the opportunity to take hardware classes + exposure to more fields
3. Harder to self learn hardware stuff then self learn coding 
4. Can still take some coding classes, 4th year can be entirely software based 

Maybe I sound crazy as compsci has a lower tuition, less workload and more relevant classes, but Mechatronics just is really appealing to me.

I’ve been programming since I was a kid so I have a ton of projects already and know how to code fairly well. I’d definitely be joining clubs related to CS and doing stuff like hackathons. What should I choose?"

I am a rising junior at Vanderbilt interested in recruiting for management consulting &amp; investment banking analyst roles for summer ‘24. Best case, I will have around a 3.44 gpa in computer science and a 35 ACT, if that helps. I had a bad freshman year but my grades are going up from there. I have previous intern experience in tech-related roles which can be spun well on the resume. Am I basically out of the running for MBB/BB with my low gpa, or is it possible to be salvaged?"

I plan to graduate soon and begin my job search. I will be graduating with an BS in computer science, and now, due to the hiring freezes, I believe I may have a harder time getting a job than how it used to be. At my school, many of the kids in past years would graduate and easily make 150k or 200k+ getting jobs at FAANG, But now, since those comapnies are no longer hiring, this seems unrealistic.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, how hard will it be for someone like me to get a high paying, or even just any SWE job as a new graduate. Especially with my low GPA?

&amp;#x200B;

My stats are as follows:

BS in Computer science from MIT

2 internships at facebook

2.5 GPA /4

How hard will it be for me to get a good job? What should be my main strategy for applying?"

zfq0tv,1,2022-12-08,Mildly Lost,Green_Tangerine1,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/zfq0tv/mildly_lost/,"Hey guys, I’m a freshman at college studying CS. I got here with practically 0 coding experience, so I’m trying to catch up. Recently, I learned that to get internships it’s useful to have some side projects, so I started doing University of Helsinki’s FullStack course for like two weeks (I did parts 0 and 1) before giving a break bc of midterms. Now, I talked to some friends and they told me it’s better to just follow tutorials online, so I was following a freecodecamp tutorial on how to create an authentication application but omg it feels like nothing works. I always get unexpected errors, and it’s hard to find a solution on google. I have barely any idea of what it’s happening or what im doing when following the tutorial. Any advice on what to do?"
zfq5xb,2,2022-12-08,Should I file a complaint with the Union/HR for discrimination?,disneyprincesseaw98,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/zfq5xb/should_i_file_a_complaint_with_the_unionhr_for/,"Hello!

New to reddit, but have read lots of it on IG. Basically the title I think? I work for a mega company with literally  200,000 plus employees. I have NEVER had an issue with them, they have treated me and the hundreds that I personally know beyond amazing, through covid, deaths, injuries etc. I cannot imagine a better workplace. I am your average 24F, white college girl who works part time. I have been with the company for 4.5 years but it doesn't all ""count"" because of internship and covid layoff. I have 1 year worth of ""seniority"". Seniority with this company usually is accounted for to the day. I want to get 2 ""extra"" trainings and also become a trainer to new employees, this is common for part timers who are decent at their job, as well as a cover for like a ..... team lead (I get recommended/given online rewards on a weekly basis by clients and coworkers because I work hard to amazing at my job). Once your 90 days is up and you express interest it's usually as fast as they can that you get to be those things. I'm at my official one year in this exact spot, never been late, never reprimanded, never called out except for an 8 week medical leave where I should have died.  We have workers who are Fulltim (FT), Part time (PT), and intern (IN).FT gets 1st seniority, PT 2nd. IN nothing. They can be trained if theyre good, if they want to be, and once EVERYONE else who wants to be is.  There are INs who have gotten ALL of the extra trainings, trainer and team lead before me. I have filled out all forms, expressed interest, done the work, asked for feedback, been told I will be given these things, while these INs call out all the time, don't do the jobs well, and are only here for a few months to almost a year. There are at least 15 in my 150 person location that have been working there by 3 to 9 months less than me and have those trainings.

An extra bit that might help was with my medical leave I have tons of documentation where I was super sick/should have died, had to learn to walk again basically. I was never ""Punished"" for it because it was a totally reasonable request. But my BIG boss, when I first came back asked me if I liked my ""vacation"" and a different boss asked if I enjoyed my ""fun time off"". I was so confused that I literally said ""what are you talking about? my medical leave? where I couldn't stand up and had to learn to walk again?"" which now sounds super sarcastic but I didn't know what they even meant. Since then ( 5 months) I have continually been lied to about getting these trainings, not getting scheduled for 5 plus weeks then one week then same cycle, getting left at positions for 4 to 6 hours when we are supposed to be moved every 2 or less, being left at HIGHLY physical positions alone when its usually a required 2 to 3 person job, bosses randomly picking apart something about me (ie, shoes I've worn for 3 months that look like everyone else's I'm not allowed to wear again, hairstyle I've worn for 6 months is not allowed and 'never was'), bosses refusing to speak to me when I wish them a good day, getting grunted at by bosses instead of being asked or spoken to, getting called the wrong name/ shortening of name when known I don't allow that ( we wear nametags) ,being put alone as a F on a dangerous and physical job but all Ms get to go in groups of 2 on that job and more.

Is this cause to be able to file a formal report?  Is this a medical, ableist, sexist, or downright personal discrimination? What should I do? I'm trying to transfer to a new part of the company but I'm stuck for now and I don't want to make a bad name for myself as I want to stay with the company forever.

TLDR: I'm being severely mistreated and I think it's due to medical/ableist discrimination or possibly sexist/ a personal vendetta discrimination. How should I report or should I? Want to keep my job."

* AP/IB: Bio(4), APUSH(4), Lit (5), Spanish Lang (5)

**Extracurriculars/Activities**

**Letters of Recommendation**

(*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*

10/10 AP Lit Teacher: He’s honestly my biggest advocate, even in times when I’ve doubted and undermined myself. I had him for English 3 yrs in a row, so he’s seen my progression from regular English all the way up to AP. When I requested the LOR over the summer, he even asked for help condensing it since he had so many positive points to make about me. I suspect that he focused more on my personal qualities than my academic performance, which is greatly appreciated.

8/10 AP Bio: We don’t know each other as well on a personal level as I do with my Lit teacher, but I’m sure she emphasized my work ethic and determination in succeeding in the class. At first I hesitated to ask for the LOR, but she seemed super eager to write it for me. She’s such an excellent writer and communicator that it’s possible she expressed my academic qualities better than my other recommender did. 

**Interviews**

(*Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)*

Well, well, well….if it isn’t the reason I concluded that I 100% would not match anywhere.😃 Everyone I knew was receiving MULTIPLE interview and even transcript requests, so I had come to terms with not matching and having to continue 5 more months along this stressful journey :( In the end, I did end up getting an interview LITERALLY 3 DAYS BEFORE DECISIONS CAME OUT, so I doubt my interview had any impact on my Penn app. 

**Essays**

(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*

800 Word Personal Essay (9.5/10): Very well written according to people who I asked to review it. It made over half of them tear up (trauma dumping–slay). Really showcased my growth during my years of adaptation following my migration to the US. I ended it in a very optimistic note about the future that awaits me, let’s just say that those predictions have so far come true ;) I received some criticism for not mentioning in specific what impact I hope to make on my community, but I believe I made up for this in my other essays.

Other 200-500 word essays (9.8/10): My intellectual abilities and passions were best reflected in this section. I wrote extensively about what in specific interests me about the engineering field, and how I hope to make all my findings accesible for low income patients. I sprinkled some personality here and there by mentioning my favorite musical artists and acknowledging that I’m obsessed with them 💀

35 Word SAQs (10/10): This section was basically just me rambling about KPOP and my dog LMAO. While the rest of my app was largely professional, I let loose during this section and let my personality shine through. 

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* State university  
* Yale!!!!?? (4-year guaranteed scholarship through Questbridge Match)

*Rejections:*

* Stanford? (I ranked them #1 over Yale, so, since I didn’t get matched with them, I equate that to a deferral/rejection.

I’m obligated to withdraw the rest of my applications, so I’ll never know whether the schools I ranked below Stanford and Yale accepted me (Brown, Columbia, Penn, Northwestern, UC Hicago and WashU) 

**Additional Information:**

I want to dedicate this section to emphasize the importance of believing in yourself. A year ago, I wasn’t even planning to submit an application to any top colleges, much less Yale. Even throughout the application process, I thought that my ECs were too weak, that my SAT Math would get me automatically thrown in the rejection bin, and that I simply had 0 chances of getting into any of the colleges that everyone around me seemed to dream about.

While it is possible that my SATs and ECs raised some eyebrows about whether I was qualified enough, I sincerely believe that my essays confirmed my strength as an applicant. I’m not gonna lie to you all, I did procrastinate in some of my supplements, but at all times, I made sure that MY voice and passions were shining through, and NOT whatever we assume some Admissions Officer would like to hear. 

I had like 10 mental breakdowns during the time I was awaiting decisions ☠️but that final day, when I fully expected everything to take a turn for the worst, I realized that we should all have a higher ego. “IF YOU DONT WANT ME, I SHOULDNT WANT U THAT BADLY EITHER” was the mentality I grew to acquire. College decisions should be a 2-way relationship, so as long as you know that you did your best and gave your all on your essays, don’t let some decision by a committee of dinosaurs who judge others for a living diminish your perception of yourself. 

Also, if you’re a sophomore or junior, apply to as many fly-in programs as you can; the people you’ll meet there will make this process 100x easier.

**Anyone who’s gotten this far, BELIEVE IN YOURSELF AND SHOOT FOR THE FUCKING STARS. If I could do it, so can you :)🫶🏽**

*The imposter syndrome is killing me, and I'm still wondering how I even made it, but PM me if you’d like some clarification or additional information about any part of my application; I’m always here to help out!*"

From February I'll be finishing my bachelor's and it occurred to me that I'm pretty stuck what to do next.

My main goal is to become iOS Developer, I'm also writing my thesis about iOS App Development but from September I'm working part-time as a Junior IT Specialist in a medium-size company that produces car parts. My chores are mostly about solving hardware or basic windows user problems like ""my outlook just stopped working"". Occasionally with my coworker I do networking stuff which I like way more than helpdesk and I have to say I learned a lot from him and in general about how network infrastructure in company works. 

As of February I'll come back to the city where my university is, so I'm going to change job eventually and here are my doubts about it, should I seek for something as an Internship or even Junior positions in iOS Development? 

I'm not sure if I feel confident enough with my skills so far, I know how to create API-based apps with both UIKit and SwiftUI, also on a basic level stuff like animations, MapKit, ARKit, CoreML, CocoaPods, Design Patterns etc. Do you think it's enough regarding how little low-level position offers are on the market?

I made a handful of friends and maybe a few close ones since I was heavily involved at my job for years then abruptly quit when my boss started threatening my job if I didn’t work. I also didn’t have any internships, I was in a few clubs but nothing super serious, so it just doesn’t feel like I really got to do everything I wanted in college, even though I did? Just not fully? Maybe it’s the closing a book rather than turning a chapter feeling for me I don’t like. Has anyone else felt like this?

Would I be able to get a job in cybersecurity after getting Sec+ given that I already have a Bachelors of Engineering in Computer Science and Engineering but no work experience in IT, because between the end of my Bachelors and start of Masters there was covid and my enrolment got dealyed so there's around 1 year gap in my resume.

Deciding to go back to school at 28 was a really tough decision. I start my new career on Monday with a company I've been interning with for the past two years. I cannot be more excited.

My advice:
Read the syllabus and understand the requirements of each course. Then just do all the homeworks and whatever other bullshit you need to do. Don't waste emotional energy complaining about it. Just do it.

If your university allows penalty free drops, use them. There's been a couple semesters that midway through I wish I had taken more on to graduate faster. Also the classes that I got to take for half a semester before dropping were a lot easier the second time around.

Time management is key. Get ahead. Stay ahead. Every semester there will be unpredictable struggles or difficulties. Stay ahead of them so that when those challenges come up you stay on course.

Get internships and outwork everyone around you. I got 2 internships and both resulted in job offers. I was the only person to get job offers at one and one of three to get an offer at the other. This is because I actually put in effort, asked a lot of questions and worked circles around the people I interned with. Getting hired is the hardest part of the job.

Other then that, good luck. I hope nothing but success to you all. The world needs more engineers!

This is the way."

Long time lurker of this sub-Reddit. My profile is the following:

- [ ] Demographic Info: Male ORM, 31 y/o
- [ ] Education: Undergrad in engineering + Masters in information systems management 
- [ ] Work Experience: 9 YOE with 6 at a T2 Consulting firm, focusing on tech consulting (been based in NY area). 3 years in data science consulting mainly
- [ ] Current Salary: $210K base + ~10-15% bonus
- [ ] Test Scores: Executive Assessment 166 (13 IR, 15 V, 18 Q)
- [ ] Targeted Schools: Primarily PT programs because the cost of quitting this job is too high plus I do enjoy my job most days. Targeting mainly PT programs because of the opportunity cost (Time and Money) loss at a FT program. Nonetheless targeting CBS and 2 T10s that take the EA - curious if there is an opportunity for a scholarship.

Goals: (1) Either switching to a PM or VC role, and I understand the latter is next to impossible without an Internship
(2) Pivoting to a strategy role at MBB or a lateral switch into my current company’s strategy arm. Finance was of interest, but with plans to start a family in the near future, I don’t think the hours will be worth the sacrifice.

Employer only sponsors Programs with the stipulation of returning for a full 3 years after graduation, and the timeline has already passed for the 2023 intake.

Questions for the Reddit community -

1. Does it make sense to invest in a PT MBA or wait another cycle if I can get an EMBA fully sponsored, but with limitations of staying in with my current firm and not switching?
2. With the FT Apps - does it make sense at my current comp, given personal family plans that are coming up? 
3. I also understand there is little to no chance of financial aid for the PT programs. Is this assumption accurate? 

I lean towards PT and I Understand it’ll be doubly hard with personal and professional commitments overlapping."
zg308i,0,2022-12-08,Data engineer salary,No_Storm_1500,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/zg308i/data_engineer_salary/,"Hi all, 

The following is specifically oriented towards junior data engineer jobs in France (so written in French for simplicity).
I did look for subreddits specifically for French people in data but I didn’t have much luck.

I’ve been asking myself a lot about what salary I can aim for after my final internship as a data engineer:

Salut à tous,

Je suis étudiant en 5eme année d’école d’ingénieur en informatique et j’ai un stage dans une grosse ESN française (qui me proposera probablement un CDI par la suite) en tant que data engineer.

Étant contacté par pas mal d’entreprises sur LinkedIn par rapport à un CDI suite au stage, je me pose la question du salaire et de la négociation. 

Si je me trompe de subreddit, n’hésitez pas à me le dire et éventuellement me rediriger !

Ce qui est difficile pour moi, c’est de savoir à quel salaire je peux prétendre pour un premier emploi dans la data, spécifiquement en tant que data engineer (ingénieur de données).

Informations sur ma situation : 
-stage development web (2,5 mois)

-stage recherche opérationnelle (2 mois)

-stage data engineer (6 mois en 2023)

-école plutôt bas du classement car réorientation en informatique, mais dans les meilleurs (voir major selon le semestre) de promo

Sachant que je cherche hors région parisienne, avez-vous des idées du salaire auquel je peux prétendre ou des conseils pour la négociation ?

Quand je cherche sur internet (Glassdoor, par exemple) je trouve des estimations de moyennes autour de 40k-41k/an, voire 45k, pour 0 à 1 an d’expérience. Toutefois, je doute de la fiabilité de ce que je trouve sachant que j’entends pas mal d’offres pour d’autres étudiants en informatique de 32-35k pour un premier CDI. 

41k me paraît un peut-être haut pour un salaire hors région parisienne mais 32-35k me paraît quand même bas pour un métier qui est censé être parmi les plus rémunérés dans la tech en France.

En tout cas, j’apprécie toute aide, notamment si vous êtes dans le milieu de la data."

I have recently finished my master's degree, Marketing analytics and data science, I am looking for jobs such as Data Analyst, Data Engineer, and similar roles. The thing is, I did not do an internship during my studies, I was too focused on getting things done with my studies. I consider it a big mistake because for these positions without experience there is always a candidate before you, no matter the grades you got in your master's. I keep improving my analytical skills, doing courses on Datacamp, competitions, etc.

To enter the sector I want to do an internship (at this point I don't pay too much attention to the money), the problem is that at least in the Netherlands you need to be enrolled in a University to do that. My question is, can I register in an educational organization to be counted as a student? What other alternatives do you recommend to me guys?

I am applying mainly on LinkedIn, do you recommend another job portal?"
zg3w63,0,2022-12-08,Should we start refusing candidates not from top tech companies?,mystichor,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/zg3w63/should_we_start_refusing_candidates_not_from_top/,"I've been a software developer for the past 10 years. Yesterday, some colleagues and I were discussing about how awful the software developer candidates we interview that are not from Big N have become.

We have asked some easy/medium leetcode questions and standard system design questions that you can find all online. There is a long-lasting trend from candidates who think they're the second coming of Guido. What these candidates seem to forget is that either they have multiple 1-year experiences, they're a lead developer on a team of just themselves and an intern who joined 3 weeks ago, or their work only affects a couple thousand customers, usually not comparable to the scale of the work at Big N where engineers impact millions of users and lead multiple seasoned engineers.

Many years ago, an ex-googler published the ""Cracking The Coding Interview"" and I think this book has become, whether intentionally or not, a positive influence in today's hiring practices for many software development positions. This book has made it more accessible for developers to get in Big N through a couple weeks of studying.

What bugs me is that the tech industry has a lot of title inflation and companies are handing out titles like candy, especially the title ""senior"" developers. There seems to be an unspoken assumption that more years of experience equals good and there is no such thing as bad experience. They think they deserve a job without interviewing just because they have been coding for 3 years at a no-name startup where they're the only developer. Other professions won't allow this kind of bullshit. You wouldn't want a self-taught doctor from a 3-month bootcamp with 3 years of experience of googling and operating his own clinic with 0 other employees to treat you, do you?,

This needs to stop.

Should we start refusing candidates not from Big N?"

zg4o8a,0,2022-12-08,How much do you try to avoid getting extra work on a daily basis ?,165817566995,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/zg4o8a/how_much_do_you_try_to_avoid_getting_extra_work/,"I'm still a student and I will soon be graduating and starting to work. Until now, during group projects, and have always been the one doing ""most"" of the work, trying to do a quality work. However, I could always see that students doing the bare minimum, waiting for the work to be done by others and avoiding additionnal tasks when possible were having a better time.

On top of this, I feel like working hard wont necessary get me to a better place / position. Obviously, I guess that working ""hard"" might help me to be better at what I'm doing, and thus help me to be hired in another company with a better salary / work conditions. However, I'm not sure this is purely correlated (for instance, I might be expected to work hard on a specific task that wont help me to gain knowledge).

I feel like by thinking that I'm supposed to work hard, I'm just getting stupidly baited, while smarter people who already understood that you could get away without much efforts are right.
During my internship, I've already witnessed that people working harder were getting more work to do (and expected to do more) because managers understood that giving work to them was the best way to get the work done.

I insist on the fact that I'm not aiming to do the bare minimum and avoid working at all cost. I'm always proud to deliver a quality work. However, I feel like I'm way too naive, kind of the useful idiot of the system who is willing to work hard just because we told him to.

I'm curious about your opinion about this. On a daily basis, do you try to avoid additionnal work because it will only add you more stress / workload ?"

(updated location),tonobodysdelight,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/zg5jt8/salesforce_vs_renege_company_updated_location/,"Was able to change my offer for salesforce from indy to SF, but I'd need to work on EST hours (starting from 7am PST) remotely. I'm in the east coast and already wake up at 8:30ish so I believe this is feasible.

With Salesforce I know my team and they're very nice, and they seemed relaxed. Not sure how much fun the work will be. Their tech stack is c# backend with js frontend, so not exactly proprietary stuff, and I'd be working on more their frontend but they said they could prolly find a full stack project for me. The benefits at salesforce also seemed super good. Don't know anything about my team for that company I've signed except I'll be working on a certain subsidary known for terrible wlb. 

As for new grad, I'd love a return offer (I know salesforce gives these more) but my end goal is to get into an unicorn or somewhere like Google. I've gotten interviews at some top tiers like Stripe and Netflix with just a F500 on my resume, but I'm not sure if the resume value of this faang will be so valuable compared to a chill but still productive summer at salesforce?

I'm genuinely super conflicted. Thanks everyone, if you have any comments about ur reasoning would be greatly appreciated! I guess in the end this might be a question between SF and Seattle. SF more money on the stipend but housing is also more expensive.

Edited: I've decided to go with Amazon for a couple of reasons: 
1. SF team work incredibly similar to my past internship, and I've had an internship this fall which was very boring (mostly fixing frontend) and I didn't get much out of it
2. Seattle seems to be much better than SF, and I like nature
3. AWS is def safer than SF (I'm on s3 so i doubt layoffs), plus the nature of the work seems far more interesting
4. It's just an 12 week internship and my goal is to get into a place better than sf/amzn for new grad. I think aws experience will help me diversify skillset and get there. There's no on call for interns plus i think the learning would be good for me 
5. aws  s3 just seems way more interesting than the marketing cloud.

zg74y6,1,2022-12-08,How do I manage my stress in a way that it doesn't make me feel worse?,Kittcore1805,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/zg74y6/how_do_i_manage_my_stress_in_a_way_that_it_doesnt/,"Hello, I'm Kit. I'm a 14 year old girl with autism. Currently, I'm in 9th grade and I'm seriously not doing well. Well, I mean, my grades are...manageble, but I'm not doing well mentally.

9th grade is definitely the hardest and most stressful year of high school, in my opinion. But even after school, my stress doesn't end, and I'm afriad it may not end well if I keep ignoring it.

Here's my usual weekly schedule. This schedule is when no teachers are sick and there are no events.

I wake up between 6:10 and 7:20, it depends on when I start lessons, which parent I'm with (My parents are divorced. At my dad's home I have to cycle longer so I wake up earlier) and if my parent is driving me to school or not. But just imagine if my parents don't take me to school in this:

On Monday I normally wake up 6:10 at dad, and 6:40 at mum. I start with Cambridge English from 8:10-8:50, then lessons begin from 8:50-14:10. At 14:15 my internship at a primary school starts and it ends on 15:15, then I go home and do homework.

On Tuesday I wake up at 6:50 at dad, and 7:20 at mum. I start with Cambridge, from 8:50 to 9:30, then usual lessons from 9:30 until 14:10, then internship from 14:15 to 15:15. Then I do homework.

On Wednesday I normally wake up at 6:50 at dad, and 7:20 at mum (again), then, I have school from 8:50 to 14:10. I'm still unsure if I'll sign myself up for homework help, but if I do, my schedule extends until 14:50. Then I do homework.

On Thursday I wake up at 6:10 at dad's place, and 6:40 at mum's place. School starts at 8:10 and ends at 15:40. Then I do homework.

On Friday I wake up at 6:50 at dad, 7:20 at mum, and I go to school from 8:50 to 14:50. Again, if I sign myself up for homework help, my schedule goes on until 15:40. Then I have after school art class from 15:00 to 16:30. Then I go home.

On Saturday I wake up at 7 at dad's place and 7:30 at mum's place. I have a part-time job as a shelf restocker from 9:00-12:00.

On Sunday I do homework.

This is what a regular schedule of mine looks like, but these weeks, it has more, much more, like:

\-Biology project, which takes extremely long and is extremely hard, and my classmates don't do anything.

\-Geography project due after Christmas

\-Physics project due in 2 weeks

\-Chemistry project that I may have to redo

\-Debating in Dutch class

\-Many, many tests to study

And some other problems that aren't school, which include a part-time job that I hate, and questioning if I should quit or not, family issues (Mostly with my dad), and extreme fatigue.

I have tried some ways to manage stress, but I'm too unmotivated to do exercise, I can't get myself to go on a diet, and I cannot get enough rest.

So, if those options aren't there, what should I do? Because I'm clueless and not well."

The startup I used to intern at is also going through funding issues and everyone in my network says that there is a hiring freeze for all junior and internship positions.

I made the mistake to stop improving my skillset after getting an offer in college, which led to no growth at all. I had a basic project of a website, which used basic web development, pretty mediocre stuff.

Now I'm trying to upskill so I can find an appropriate job. What else can I do to get internships? I'm also starting to prepare for my master's entrance exam so a full-time job won't cut it I guess, things can vary though. Thank you for your time."
zg85ui,1,2022-12-08,Need help with describing my first internship experience in my resume,Rainmert,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/zg85ui/need_help_with_describing_my_first_internship/," I'm a senior CS student who has completed his first internship which took 6 months. I want to describe this experience in my resume the best way I can in order to land a better internship or job. I'm not sure which parts I should emphasize and to what degree I should fancy it up. Here's what I did in the span of those 6 months:

I was in the R&amp;D department for the first 2 months. Our task at the time was finding an open-source replacement to ElasticSearch that was being used and implementing it. The team was already looking into Typesense when I started working there so I joined them. I went through the documentation, run a Typesense setup in a Docker container, and wrote a Python script to move data from MongoDB to Typesense in bulk for testing purposes. My script worked considerably faster than the previous script that was written by another team member. I then made performance tests and monitored search speed and RAM usage by Typesense. We then realized this was not the correct product for our purposes after our tests.

I later found another alternative search engine called ZincSearch and suggested that we try this one to my team. With the positive feedback from my team, I started working on it. I wrote multiple scripts for bulk data ingestion, search, and aggregation. I actively followed the development process of this product and extensively tested each version. During this time, I was also in contact with the creator of ZincSearch and I've organized 2 meetings that included the ZincSearch team and our team in which I've presented my test results and got feedback. But the focus of the team was shifted towards another product and I started working on another project. During the time I was in R&amp;D, I also contributed to a Grafana backend project that was written in PHP by writing a couple of endpoints.

In this new project, I worked in the backend and was the sole API developer. The product we were developing was collecting logs from multiple clients and sending them to our server. I first developed the server-side application with Python which collected the logs from multiple clients through a websocket. It then parsed these logs and saved them into our PostgreSQL database. I used RabbitMQ in order to correctly get all of the logs. I had no experience with microservices so I mistakenly made it so that the consumer and producer were a single app. I also again mistakenly made it so that each incoming log launched a new consumer thread. I later got feedback from a senior and learned how it should've been correctly structured, but I left this job without implementing the required fixes. This service side application was a small part of what I worked on during these 4 months though. I mostly worked on the API.

I built an API from scratch with Flask. It had endpoints for user signup/login, displaying logs, feeding charts in the dashboard, making detailed calculations on the said logs and displaying statistics related to them, for adding/editing/removing users and templates. I implemented JWT authentication and also used SQLAlchemy for the database queries. I designed the entire database from scratch too. Lastly, I implemented a customizable role-based authorization system. I ran the server-side application and the API as Linux services."

So as the title says, I'm currently an RPA (Robotic Process Automation) intern for a US government agency and also in my junior year of my CS degree. My internship is great, I'm happy with my team, fully remote (for now), getting tons of experience, and exposed to new and interesting systems. However, the pay is quite low ($12k/year part-time) which is leading me to consider an alternative to renewing my internship another year. My manager has already told me that I'll have that option when my 1 year is up in the summer.

I appreciate the stability, benefits, and work-life balance of this government position, but I'm curious if the experience that I've gathered would allow me to attain a full-time position elsewhere with better pay. Maybe I'm just too eager to get a full-time SWE position before I graduate with just a year of government internship experience, but the possibility is tempting. The things is, though, I could see myself sticking it out for another year and work towards a good chance of getting hired full-time with this agency after I graduate.

Also, I'm afraid if I leave this position for another internship, I'd be throwing away the possibility to get hired full-time in a position and team that I really enjoy. Would a full-time SWE position even be a possibility for me given this year of experience?

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated, thanks!"

Some points to consider:

* PIMCO only takes 18 SWE interns in the US (thus feels more selective and gives me the impression that I'd have a more personalized experience), while Capital One takes hundreds of SWE interns.
* PIMCO has a return offer rate of 100% according to the recruiter (but I’m pretty sure C1 is around that too from what has been said on this sub).
* Capital One SWE intern pay is $61 an hour with corporate housing or $3,000 post-tax lump sum, while PIMCO SWE intern pay is $52.50 an hour and $5000 (not sure if this is post-tax or not) lump sum for relocation. However, pay is not that important to me; I care more about career growth and learning.
* PIMCO is in Newport Beach, CA, while C1 is in McLean, VA...neither of which are ideal tbh because I want to live in NYC post-grad. If I choose PIMCO, then I won't have to move states for the summer, which would save me a lot of headache/money on flights and transportation. However, C1 has a NYC office, but idk how hard it is to get moved here for full-time.
* Capital One seems to be more tech-oriented than PIMCO. PIMCO gives strong finance vibes. I know Capital One has a really good WLB, but I know nothing about PIMCO's work culture.
* The PIMCO recruiter told me that the company ""really, really wanted me"" and would be ""happy to do anything to accommodate me""...idk if they are just saying this or it's because I am a woman from a top STEM school. Does this mean that I could potentially try negotiating my salary?

Until now, I learned C++ and Python, at least in school assignments, I did well and enjoyed both so grades don't help in comparison. I also had some basic data science/analytics courses as I thought that is the thing that I want to focus on. However, I am not sure now because everyone seems to be in the same direction and I am afraid that internship and junior application process will be brutal, also it seems like most data science jobs require at least a Master's and all the people I see on data science subreddits complain that they did master's but they just do uninteresting stuff now. I also do not consider PhD so these lowered my hype. I like problem solving but I realized that I would like to create a product, or be part of creating a product in the end. So I thought checking out some Game Dev. courses, thought it shouldn't be so hard since I know C++, or iOS development as I use a Mac and I want to select and try swift everytime I use Xcode.  
Yes, I know that the best solution is trying all of them and find which suits me best but I feel like everyone already found their direction and if I just keep playing with every tool that I see, I won't be specialized or good at anything by the time I graduate, or at least by the time I apply to internships.  


So, what do you suggest? Should I keep going with data science until I say that ""yeah I am not doing this shit again"" or should I try other options? if the latter, for someone who likes problem solving and want to be a part of creating a product, which area seems the best fit?"

After this, we have to do an internship for the rest of the semester which I already have found.

My question is, is it worth it to go to university 3-4 years to do a Bachelor in CompSci or would those couple years staying at my internship (software dev in a bank) be better off if I do end up getting a fulltime offer afterwards. If I don't I would try to find another fulltime job here or in the U.S. remote.
I am still quite young and want to setup my future for the best, I also have the money to go to university.

Longterm is university worth the investment, or can I work my way up and get good experience.

Thank you all for the answers in advance!"

It pays almost 2x more than my job. Right now my IT job I make 36k. I also have a computer science degree, and did not get an internship. I started my first IT role in September.

For this job, I will need to know SQL(only know some), and Linux Red hat somewhat (only know ubuntu). 

I have until Tuesday to separate myself. I think what separates me from the other candidates is i've been in the cryptocurrency space for awhile and know the difference between l1 and l2 chains, some defi projects, NFTS, diff chains, staking, etc. In fact, I legit have over 5k trades for 2021. 

I would really like to separate myself from the other candidates for this interview. Any advice is welcomed. There are not many applicants for this role, so it's possible I will only be going up against like 1-3 people."

They said they'd pass on my resume and might call me back in a week or two for a technical interview. 

There's probably no point of worrying, but what are the odds of getting a techical interview after a phone screening? Thanks for any responses 🙏"

I am not exactly sure what career path I want, but I am very interested in IB/IM. I want to end up in the VC/Private Equity area.

I took on the CS minor as a backup in case I burnt out in finance or do not like the lifestyle/career when I am there. My backup is always a product management/marketing position at a large tech company like Cisco. I know this is something I am good at and can do easily. I had a product management internship  (competitive analysis, product pricing, SEO optimization &amp; competitive analysis, etc.) my freshman year summer to ensure that I was making the right choice choosing finance.

I DON'T PLAN TO CODE A DAY AFTER LEAVING COLLEGE. I am doing the CS minor only as a fail-safe, so if I end up applying to tech companies I have some background knowledge on the products to get up to speed faster and not spend too much time simply trying to understand the product or terminology.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently registering for classes and unsure if I should take CS 225 or not. I am aware that it's one of the most relevant courses for Computer Science and that multiple companies take value in it. However, I am not sure that it is relevant for me to take it, as it's not my directed career path and I don't plan to code a day in my life after college.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is - As a finance major in Gies with a computer science minor, should I proficiency test out of CS225 or is it still important to take the course?"

* Are there agencies that can help me network?
* What skills should I have or need before starting an internship?

zgpb22,2,2022-12-09,Therapy (in my situation) is like trying to solve problems that can't be solved should I quit?,catboy519,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/zgpb22/therapy_in_my_situation_is_like_trying_to_solve/,"Depression and burn-out (which I have) COULD be caused by wrong behavior and thought patterns. And if thats the case, therapy will work. But for me, I'm very sure therapy doesn't help me because my problems and the cause of my problems cannot be solved. Atleast by therapy. But I'm not here to anser my own question. I actually want advice on my decision because I'm not too sure about it.

\--- Problems outside my mind, that affect how I feel, inevitably ---

1. Recently Alot of close friends have blocked me and stopped communicating with me. The fact I have an attachment issue and I was really close with the friends who left me, made it very painful for me.
2. My girlfriend who I still love very much, has been offline for 5 months and I don't even know if she is alive because she said she was suicidal. She has actually been ghosting me for 1,5 years, chatting with me only once in 3 month but now she has been offline for 5 months in a row. I have no way of contacting her since she is offline on every communication platform. She does not live in my country so no I can't go to check.
3. My desire to be a girl. Yeah, the only solution would be: coming out in real life and then going for surgery and hormons but thats something I will probably never do. I'm not really happy as a boy
4. Earlier this year I was already dealing with so much shit (see above) but I was still studying. University kept giving me loads of homework that I was never able to get done because I was too busy focusing on my mental health and friends and my girlfriend and solving all these problems just had priority over homework. So in the end I had terrible grades and had none of my homework done, thats the point where I decided to just quit uni. I must admit its one of the best choices ive made because it did relieve alot of stress from me. But still my mental health is shit.
5. I see no meaningful future. I'm 23 and I still don't know what my dream job is. And.. why would I go through so much effort to find and work a job, when I already have enough money to stay alive? I'm not rich, but I have more money saved up than I can even spend. I'm just not a big spender, so it would take a long while before I run out of money. So why would I get a job? The only reason would be mental health and making friends. But no, I have learned from experience that going to college, university, work, internships... it has never made me feel better. I hated all of it. I prefer staying home and I have experienced enough to come to this rational conclusion. It also didnt get me any friends. So why would I bother getting a job when it most likely will just drain me even more mentally + most likely not get me any new friends anyway? Its too much of a time and effort investment.
6. I enjoy nothing in life. Psychologists have suggested me so many hobbies and activities that I could try. None of these activities had ever made me feel better.

My theory is that, because I don't enjoy anything in life at all, and life is only throwing shit at me and not any good things, I subconsciously become unwilling to take life serious, work hard, be there for the world while I owe this world nothing. I didnt ask to exist in this stupid world. This life offers me nothing. So why would I have to work hard on anything when it will not give me anything in return anyway? And this is why I refuse to get a job.

\--- problem with my behavior ---

* I have burn-out and depression. One of my biggest problems now is that, I'm extremely unproductive. I don't work, I don't study, I can't even get anything done of my task list. I have this to-do list on my laptop and I rarely ever get anything done off it, even if its just a one minute task. I'm physically and mentally drained, 24/7, I just cant do the things that I know I shoul be doing

But even if I somehow manage to be productive again ... it won't solve my problems. I could study, work, go out and force myself to be social and do all those things... but experience from the  past has taught me that doing all this will do nothing more than drain my energy and disappoint me. Outside of my comfort zone, I have been there long enough to say it doesnt help.

Life is hard. Painful things happen. And we can always handle a little bit of stressful events. But sometimes life just becomes too much and overwhelms us. That is exactly what is happening to me. Life is too painful and stressful for me. To be honest I want to die in peace so I no longer have to work hard for nothing.

Therapy is nothing more than talking. And talking with a therapist can't change anything from outside that happens to me. If someone decides to hurt my feelings then it just happens and I have no control over it. The only things therapy could in theory change is behavior and thoughts. Many therapists seem to be a fan of talking about thoughts. But look at my situation: painful things still happen, no matter what I do with my thoughts. Life is still going to hurt badly . The fact that I'm unproductive and cant even get one minute tasks done most of the time, can only be changed by my behavior. I got to just open my task list and do whatever is on it. But I can't becausd I'm tired. I'm tired of working hard for life when life never gives anything back for it.

Therapy only helps if:

1. Therapist gives advice
2. Advice is followed
3. Advice solves a problem

But this doesnt work for me! Out of all therapists I have had, none of them have been able to give me a problem solving advice. Almost every conversation is about feelings and thoughts, how is that supposed to solve the problems that go on in my life? These advices are not even something I can do anything with.

I'm really convinced that therapy is useless for me. But why am I here asking advice and not quiting therapy yet? Maybe I missed something. Maybe therapy can help but I treated it wrong. Maybe soon my therapist will give me an advice that I can actually do something with which would bring a positive change in my life.

I really don't think so. I think quiting therapy is the best option for me. Could anyone give me a clear example-situation of how therapy could help me?"

zgq3vi,8,2022-12-09,I finally got a job! Here's what I learned in the 7 month process,lordotnemicsan,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zgq3vi/i_finally_got_a_job_heres_what_i_learned_in_the_7/,"A little backstory: Recent college grad in 2 degrees (one marketable, one not so marketable). Decent experience. Interest and experience mostly in data, research, economics, public policy, so looking for something in that area. I should also say that I spent a few months in this period doing an internship. So here are some things that worked, and what didn't.

&amp;#x200B;

What worked: 

\-Tracking everything I applied for. I started a spreadsheet, where I tracked the name of the employer, position, date applied, method of application (on their website, via Linkedin, etc.), sector, and status. This allowed me to draw trends and see what was getting the most replies.

\-If you can find a sector that ""likes"" you, meaning they tended to reach out to you more (even if it's for a rejection), go ham on that. Look up everything you can about companies, positions, find their subreddit, etc. Once I found mine I went all in and almost all of my applications since that discovery have been in that one sector, including for the job I ended up getting.

\-Cold emails. This is huge. It actually works a lot better than you think. Here are my interview rates for applications using the various methods:

\*LinkedIn apply (31 apps): 12.9%

\*Direct website (54): 5.5%

\*Requested email (6): 16.7%

\*Cold email (20): 20.0%

As you can see, cold emails perform the best. If you're not doing cold emails, you should be. Target them to specific companies that you think would fit really well and may have a place for you. Look at their staff page and pick out who might be in charge of hiring. Don't write a unique one either; make a template of a couple sentences and swap out a few phrases to fit with the company. Include your resume and cover letter. This strategy works because A) it shows interest and research skills that you were able to find them, B) Saves them time in sending out postings and reviewing mountains of useless resumes, C) They may not be interested in hiring you right now, but it will usually get their attention and they may contact you later (although this hasn't happened to me yet). I should say that I got my current job via Linkedin, not cold emails. 

&amp;#x200B;

What didn't work:

\-Spending hours a day applying. In a long session of applications, you may find yourself applying for things that aren't as relevant by the end in a desperation to get as much out there. You're wasting your time. Instead, let the well recharge. Every day there are new listings; sip the best stuff each day and your time will be used much more efficiently. 

\-Be afraid to find an interim position. I did this, although I can't say for sure if it helped secure a main position. But it certainly kept me busy while I kept looking. Just make sure to stay a reasonable amount of time (in my case, 3 or more months), before deciding to start applying again so it at least looks good on your resume.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, wishing everyone the best of luck!"

But I quickly got into a very anxious mood and panic about the scenario that my offer will be rescinded. (btw if u went to check my previous post u might probably know which company is but plz do not say it loud. Thanks a lot.) All the big-tech are having lay-offs these days, even salesforce, the B2B service company used to be supposedly regarded as recession proof. I went to check the [https://layoffs.fyi/](https://layoffs.fyi/) and found that the company I probably going to join is the few that does not have big lay-offs but that does not mean that in 2023 , it will not start to lay-off if their revenue growth does not meet the expectation from the shareholders. My anxiety grew because while I was in a virtual career fair with an Amazon recruiter in the early October, he proudly shared their expansion plan in Ireland and the headcount  they are going to hire. But in late October, all the hiring paused and they only retained the internship recuitment in Ireland.  I felt quite unsafe these days because that is the only offer I get till now and I was rejected very often during the past few months because I am an international student (I can apply for stamp1G but only after I graduate and I also need visa sponsorship in the future) and my graduation date is in next year. Am I too anxious?  I even considered quite my study and started to work for the company starting from the first quarter of 2023. What are ur guys thinking about the situation these days?

I am looking for ideas on a guest talk I could do for high school students that might increase their interest in computer science and the field of software engineering. I have several years experience as a software engineer at large companies, including FAANG, and brief experience at a startup when I was younger.

I have done a few guest talks before for prospective interns in college on subjects like A Day in the Life, Intro to Machine Learning, and Intro to Distributed Systems (Basic CAP Theorem). However, I think some of these subjects may be a bit advanced for an average high school student. 

I know I could just do an explanation of the field, but I’d like something a bit more inspired if possible. Either for high schools with a CS related club, or a high school lacking a CS class at all. Just hoping to inspire and encourage smart kids to consider the field if it interests them. Any ideas or advice would be appreciated."

I want to transition to a job adjacent to my current one and I’d like to mention my education on my resume, most specifically two of the first degrees that I didn’t complete had a lot of relevance to what I’d like to do.  I’ve read a good bit online about how to list a partial degree, but I haven’t found any examples that work for my exact situation.

So the gist of it:  I got very close to finishing a dual major in Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering.  Let’s say the total number of credits for both of them put together is 200.  The way I’ve seen recommended to list it on a resume is to put the number of credits taken and any relevant courses.  Something like

    State State University | City, State | MM. YYYY - MM. YYYY
    ### credits towards BS in Computer Science
    * relevant course 1
    * relevant course 2
    * certification 1

    State State University | City, State | MM. YYYY - MM. YYYY
    ### credits towards BS in Mechanical Engineering
    * relevant course 1
    * relevant course 2

In my case though, there are a lot of credits overlap between the two majors.  Let’s say 100 in common and 50 unique to each.  In that case, how should I list them?

* list 150 credits towards each major and have them both listed

* list 150 credits towards just the most relevant one

* list the full 200 credits towards the most relevant one (since the courses in the additional major are no different from elective credits that would be included in the number if I only have one partial degree)

* list the full 200 credits and both partial degrees, for the same reason in the above bullet

* something else entirely, maybe without listing credits.

I know, I should finish one or all of the degrees, and when I can afford it I intend to, but that’s a whole can of worms that has a bunch of other factors.  For the time being in my current job search, how should I go about this?  For the record, I have been doing software development for the last few years, so I have very relevant real-world experience for the kind of job I’m applying to despite lacking the education required by most employers in that field.  I just want to make the most of the education I currently have.  Thanks!"

zgzb8p,0,2022-12-09,RANT: I CANNOT find job out of college...,[deleted],datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/zgzb8p/rant_i_cannot_find_job_out_of_college/,"OK, sorry if this post is all over the place as this is my second reddit post (and I really need to rant).

&amp;#x200B;

So I graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Science and a Masters in Data Science and Analytics. I did an internship with my college in their Teacher Education unit, helping them create a database and cleaning their data using Python.

Seems fine and dandy, right?

NO. The job market is totally screwy! Here's a perfect example of what I mean:

My girlfriend graduated too with a Master's degree for SOCIAL WORK. Now as far as I know, social workers do not typically make as much as a data analyst, right? Maybe starting salary, sure. OK. So my girlfriend gets a job immediately out of college. She wasn't referred. She just applied and got the job after maybe 2-3 weeks of applying. She's getting paid 30/hr FULL-TIME!

After 2 months of searching and living in my car, I finally get a remote contract job. I thought it was wonderful! HOWEVER, they were severely underpaying me. 20/hr??? Come on! And to make matters worse, after making me feel like I was their teammate and making me believe they were gonna turn me into a permanent worker, they let me go 3 months before the contracted ended. Leaving me with just 3 months of experience. So I was super underpaid and let go like trash. Great!

Now this is where it gets worse! Before, I was getting 1-2 interviews for every 100 applications. Now, I've submitted maybe 3,000 applications and I've only received 1 interview. In this interview, I felt severely underexperienced and I could tell the interviewer enjoyed highlighting my lack of knowledge.

The crazy thing is that I've been highly productive in my search for a job. I've had my resume looked at by 3-4 qualified professionals who have each told me that my resume could look a LOT better. This is after the last professional looked at it. OK.

I watch youtube videos to improve my SQL and other data science skills. I even took the Google Digital Marketing and E-Commerce course and earned a real certificate. Is this not enough for employers? How do you expect me to pull experience out of my ass?

I put in my resume ""looking for an entry level position"", hoping that might paint the picture for some employers, but nothing! Is it because my name is Zaid? Maybe they don't like Arabic names. Maybe my black skin is off-putting when they check out my LinkedIn. I mean, I know how stupid that sounds, but what other reason can it be? /endSelfHate.

It just bugs me how every job posting that says ""Entry Level / Junior"" always wants 5+ years of experience. It doesn't make any sense! Or Healthcare Industry Experience 5+ years. I consciously know that not everyone will fulfill EVERY qualification; this is quite logical to me, but for employers? They're delusional!

tl;dr: job searching sucks

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: APOLOGIES IF I CAME OFF AS ENTITLED AND BITTER, AND I ACTUALLY APPRECIATE THE HONESTY. I LIVE ALONE WITHOUT MUCH HUMAN CONTACT SO IT IS NICE TO KNOW WHERE I CAN START ON THIS JOURNEY. IT APPEARS MY ATTITUDE COULD VERY WELL BE HOLDING ME BACK. THANK YOU ALL"
zh00jq,2,2022-12-09,Transitioning into a finance position if I’m not studying finance,Hoax7,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/zh00jq/transitioning_into_a_finance_position_if_im_not/,"Hi all. I have read on forums about many instances where people who did not study finance/economics in university working in high-finance positions, specifically IB, PE and analysts. I understand that most of these employers are seeking graduates from so called target schools, regardless of their degrees or area of study. 

This got me thinking about how these people are actually able to make the transition in career from a say, a prospective software engineer if you happened to be doing CS, into finance. Also I believe internships and other job offers are something which are part of university/college especially in the later years, so how exactly would someone change their career route towards finance with hardly any qualifications or knowledge in the said field? 
Would really appreciate if someone could provide me with an answer, thanks in advance!"

zh23z3,1,2022-12-09,Was this employer rude or is it just me?,Nea1000,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/zh23z3/was_this_employer_rude_or_is_it_just_me/,"I don't know if I should laugh or cry?

My background: I studied English in college and had 3 internships at great, well-known companies. All internships were in publishing, but in different types of publishing.

When I graduated, I struggled to find a job in publishing, so I accepted an offer in a different field of work all together because I saw it as an opportunity to continue writing. I quit this job nearly a year later. As soon as I left, I began working a sales/commission based job in a different field of work. I learned a lot about this type of work and really enjoyed it. I've been with the same company ever since and I love my co-workers and boss. I've been at this sales/commission based job for almost 3 years now.

I like this field of work so much that I've decided to pursue a different role, but still within the same field. It takes a Bachelors degree or lots of training to do this job and I don't have either, but what I do have is experience in the field and have worked on gaining some of the skills needed to do it.

Although I love my sales job, it is hard not having benefits like health insurance and a salary since it's commission based. I have felt really discouraged and depressed for the past 3 years because I've been applying like crazy to places with nothing coming from it. I recently decided that I would be willing to take on an internship in order to learn and build up my resume from there. I received an opportunity to have a phone call with the owner from a very small company, so I accepted.

He was 20 minutes late to the call. I emailed him 10 minutes to check in and he told me he would call 10 minutes later. He did, and apologized for being late and rushing this phone interview because he was on the way to an appointment (which I thought was strange, because he was the one who picked the day &amp; time of our phone call interview.

He said he was impressed with my resume, but referred to me, multiple times, as a ""renaissance woman,"" which I thought was strange. I studied English, had solid internships in publishing, worked in 1 different field but was still writing, and have been in 1 other field in my current role of 3 years? Which I am still trying to stay in, just looking for an opportunity to grow and learn. For reference I am 26.

He said he would be willing to take me on, but is scared I'm going to bounce to something else. He then said I was ""saying all the right things"" and had ""impressive answers"" which I also thought was weird because I literally did the interview in my car with no notes. I've never worked in this role before either, so I had no way of knowing what he was going to ask in advance. He followed everything up by saying, ""when we train someone, it takes business away from other people working here. So I do expect you to get further education and to stay here for a while."" I was like okay: it's nice to have security, but what training will I receive? He said 2 hour training and then I will be given an assignment for the team to judge... and that is how the internship is going to go for me to ""prove myself.""

And for the final kicker: He said, ""okay, so do you \~really\~ want to be a \_\_\_\_\_\_ forever? Like really? For all of these years to come, this is what you want to do?"" This was just bizarre because I never said this was my plan forever. I answered by saying I think I would enjoy the role because I'm in the field now and have had great experiences/I really like what I've learned so far, so I could see myself doing it for many years as a long-term career. He said, ""right. Okay, that's a good answer.""

Some of the things he said were hurtful to hear. I don't know if he's right or if I'm being too sensitive. I am currently very depressed so it's possible I'm overthinking this. I just felt ""off"" after the call. I even had a temp job (another field, but this isn't on my resume so he never knew this) a few months ago and even the people there never, ever belittled my background or made me feel ashamed.

I'm trying to better my life and I'm persevering despite the obstacles in my life. I don't think anyone should be knocked over or negatively judged when they're a hard worker.

I was offered to meet him and his team in person. I also received an interview recently for a huge company for a full time position doing the role that I'm interested in. The recruiter has been very kind and thoughtful so far.

Can someone please help me read into this situation? Am I overthinking what happened? The owner is in his 60's so there is a generational difference there."

tl;dr: I more than 4x’ed my salary over a period of 10 months. This post outlines the journey, and provides insight to those looking for similar results.

Monday is my first day as a software engineer for a Fortune 200 company with a six-figure salary. I owe a lot of that success to tutorials and testimonials I’ve read online. I was a little hesitant to make this post because I know there are people struggling, but I hope that this will serve to give insight and inspiration to those who are trying to do something similar to me.

Here’s a little about myself, for context. I’m 30 years old, and I grew up in a very poor part of the US. There was a lot of unemployment, which lead to a mindset of taking what ever job was offered to you. I worked a lot of different physical labor jobs from the time I was 17-27. I never made more than $36k a year from any of them. So I decided to make a risky decision and get a lower paying job that involved doing what I loved.

Background:

&amp;#x200B;

* Spent first 10 years of adulthood working physical labor jobs
* Highschool dropout, with no college degree
* Felony on my criminal record for possession of marijuana
* Love of technology
* Strong work ethic
* Zero friends with tech careers
* Above average people skills

At 25 years old I knew that I was not enjoying my current career as a warehouse worker, even if it was paying my bills. I was stuck in a position where I worked too much overtime to be able to go to my local community college, but I still really wanted to learn to code. I swear I would look up job postings on indeed, and just stare at the requirements. I was too anxious and underqualified to even apply to them.

## What You’ll Need to Begin

&amp;#x200B;

* Strong work ethic / self-discipline
   * If you are going the self-taught route, there are no parents or teachers that will be grading your work or following up on missed assignments. Every success and failure is dependent on your ambition to DO THE THING
* Desire and ability to learn new things
* A computer
   * Doesn’t matter the operating system or specs, but something that will run your code and a browser is preferred
* Internet
* Ability to change careers
   * This seems to be the biggest blocker for most people I know. They have already established a job that will pay their bills and have people that depend on them to do so. I was in the same boat. The hard truth is, if you continue to do what you’ve always done, you’ll get the same results you’ve always gotten.

## Process

## Learn ($0)

On my 25th birthday, I found freecodecamp. There are many online tutorial sites you can use, but that’s the one I found and stuck with. In four months, I ran through all of the courses available at the time, learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you haven’t gone to university, you will NEED some type of self-teaching platform. It does not need to be the same as me, as long as you are consistent. I should also note that while freecodecamp was the platform I spent the most time on, there were also others I used in combination, like YouTube, Code Academy, etc.

## Apply Knowledge ($0)

I was lucky enough to have a friend who owned a business. This friend was great at his craft, but knew nothing of coding and had no website. I told him I had been learning to code, and offered to build him a website for just the cost of hosting.

A lot of people discourage working at a discounted or free rate when you’re starting out, but I disagree.. at least if you’re coming from a background similar to mine. I built his website for $100 which included the cost of a logo design from a freelancer, and hosting fees. I made MAYBE $40 on this project.

A lot of people pay a lot of money to go to school, and some people even take unpaid internships towards the end or right after school. I saw myself as someone who was learning for free, but needed real world applications to refine myself and gain experience. This turned out to be a catalyst for a lot of change.

That project, and the discounted projects I took over the next year served as experience, and exposure. I worked my full time warehouse job, and when I would come home I would work on these sites on my time frame. They were free after all. I learned what business owners cared about (cost, aesthetics, conversions), and I overcame the blockers that freecodecamp didn’t prepare me for (documentation hell, cheap cloud hosting, clients who didn’t actually know what they wanted).

During this time I also just started building things that I found useful, which is a habit that I have kept with me. Again, you’re doing this to learn. It’s not enough to take a course and say you know a language like javascript if you’ve never used it. I guarantee things will not go as planned from what ever tutorial you read, and you will be forced to.

To find projects if you don’t have anyone in your life that needs a website.. hit Google maps. I would look up businesses in my area (but they didn’t need to be local), and I would find ones with crappy unresponsive web pages, or no website at all.

I would build a skeleton site for them before even calling, and then show up at the business and ask for a manager. I would tell them that I was trying to learn more, and had noticed they had an outdated website. I would tell them that I had already done most of the work to gain experience, and then offer to sell and host the website for them for a heavy discount.

You would be surprised at the amount of people that even after telling them that I was happy to do it for the experience thought that I was trying to scam them. But, thankfully there were enough business owners that saw the value in what I was offering to keep me going. DON’T GIVE UP!

## Make the Jump into a Tech Career ($36k → $23.4k)

For me, this was the most daunting task of all. I had been making roughly $22/hr as a warehouse worker, and had become accustomed to the lifestyle that pay afforded me. Now for some people, they will be able to find a job right away making at LEAST that much. With my criminal background and lack of education, this proved to be very difficult.I didn’t really care what I was doing, I just knew that I wanted to sit at a desk, and work on a computer.

I found a job as a front-line Tech Support Agent for a very popular retail store. Call centers are a great place to use as your first stepping stone in tech. The reason for this is, there is ALWAYS a high turn over as the job isn’t glamorous. You get a lot of people yelling at you for things that are not your fault. The second reason is, there is ALWAYS some technology that is running the place. If you can stick it out for a few months as a front line agent, you can find which positions are available to do more technical work.

The job was HORRIBLE. They started me at $11.25/hr (literally half of my warehouse pay). But the job was pretty simple. Take in phone calls from distressed PC customers and walk them through the resolution of their issues.

There was very little training on how to actually solve the issues, and this is where I first learned that no one knows everything, and that we all use Google, even in a corporate world. This job taught me how to document all of my work, and really upped my soft skills. If you can talk a 78-year-old woman through troubleshooting her 2-year-old printer over the phone… you know what I mean.

## Demonstrate Your Value ($23.4k → $28k)

September 2020

After 7 months, I was offered a promotion to data analyst with a $4/hr raise.

The data analyst job was the first place that I could actually use my skills. There were a lot of reports to run using an Oracle DB, and a TON of manual tasks that were being distributed across our seven person team.

My boss was the worst. Think a chain-smoking, not-as-nice Minerva McGonagall. She was all about policy and procedure, and micro-managing everything that was being done. I attempted to automate a tedious process, and when I presented my work I was told that not only was I being written up for working outside of the tasks I was assigned, but I was also warned that automation meant loss of work for the team, which would lead to lay-offs.

That really sucked. I was discouraged, but still felt like I could use this job to learn and grow. I started automating EVERYTHING behind my managers back. I turned 40 hours of tedious work into 4-6 hours of tedious work. My manager had no complaints because the work was accurate, and always on time.

## Leaving the Nest ($28k → $60k)

December 2021

A year into my Data Analyst position, my manager approached me and told me that COVID was over and they were sending a percentage of employees back into the office to work.

I had no idea what I was going to do. I had barely been able to afford to pay my bills as it was, without commuting to an office an hour away five times a week. She told me that I was chosen to come back because I was the newest on the team, and she was letting tenured employees stay home.

I made it two days in the office. On my second day, I realized that automating my work at home translated to not having a thing to do if I were forced to be in the office. This was not going to work.

I spent the next two weeks applying to jobs, like that was the only thing I was paid to do. I applied EXCLUSIVELY on LinkedIn because I had made friends in tech who told me that’s where they got the most engagement with recruiters.

I applied to 147 different positions. I built my resume around the work I had been doing as a freelancer, as well as the work I had been doing as a Data Analyst. Out of 147, only 4 recruiters ever responded to me. Out of those 4, I had two people tell me that I wasn’t a good fit in the initial interview, 1 give me a coding challenge that I failed, and finally, the company that hired me.

I ended up getting hired as a “Technical Support Analyst” for a mid-size software company focused on K-12 School District Administration.

Here’s what I learned about the applying/interviewing phase that I think would be valuable to people that are in my previous position:

&amp;#x200B;

* It is 100% a numbers game. That whole every no is closer to a yes could not be more accurate. I don’t see how I would have made it through this without having that mentality. It used to take me days of research to find a company that I thought I was qualified to work for. I would write an extensive cover letter, and then apply. When I didn’t hear anything back, I would get discouraged and tell myself I was never going to get a job. THIS MINDSET DID NOTHING TO HELP ME GET HIRED, and it wasn’t until I was able to shift my perspective did I have the energy to apply to dozens of positions a day.
* Your attitude matters. The company that hired me told me that me, telling them how excited I was to work for a software company really won them over. Companies understand that it is near impossible to find a candidate that is familiar with EVERY piece of their technology stack. The important thing is that the candidate is willing and able to learn new things. What I didn’t know was that most candidates didn’t want to do that. They learned a language ten years ago, and fully planned to use that technology the rest of their careers (don’t do that).
* Initiative matters. I would have never had anything to show for myself if I had waited to be hired to make something. Do it because you want to, not because you have to.

## Finding Your Niche ($60k)

January 2022

Depending on the company you are working for, your job title may or may not have a rigid job description and responsibilities. The reality is most companies do not, and because of this you will often find people wearing many hats and gaining skills in fields other than the ones they are originally hired for.

There’s two different ways to look at this:

&amp;#x200B;

1. I’m not getting paid enough for this, I have had no training on this, and I have no interest in doing work outside of my title.
2. I get the opportunity to gain professional experience in a job that I am not qualified for, and learn on the job skills that can translate into a higher paid position down the road.

If you’ve made it this far into the post, I am assuming that you see the value in the 2nd perspective.

Upon getting hired by my first software company, it was clear that the job I was hired for was just a small part of what needed to be done. So, I just started doing all the things that looked fun to me.

A little background about me, is that I found my love of tech at eleven years old in a game called RuneScape. For those who have never heard of it, it is a browser-based RPG that requires many hours of pointing and clicking the same objects in a repetitive manner. I learned to automate the game by writing PERL based scripts. I would sell in game items at lunch time in middle school that I gained from the scripts I wrote. This really installed a love of automation that I carry with me to this day.

## Rising to the Occasion

So at my new job, I just started automating everything that I could. This time, the bosses loved it. Within three months at this company, I was retitled from “Technical Support Analyst” to “Site Reliability Engineer”. Unfortunately, that did not come with a pay raise.. but that was a mis-step on their part more than it was a failure on my negotiation skills. I would like to state that I hold no ill-will towards this company, and I am forever grateful that they gave me the opportunity.

I have heard before that tech careers are T shaped, meaning that there are many low paid entry level positions, but the highest paying are those that specialize in something (think T upside down). This is absolutely correct.

Upon my retitling, I began researching the responsibilities and job descriptions that I could find. I got lucky because the job title was created by Google, and they were kind enough to write an entire book on it.

Over the next 7 months, I did my best to embody all that a Site Reliability Engineer offers to an organization. For my position that included converting our cloud infrastructure into Infrastructure as Code, setting up monitoring and alerts, and automating all of the tedious tasks that our team had across our applications.

## Recognizing Your Value

June 2022

During this time, it became very clear that I was definitely being underpaid. I added my new responsibilities and skills to LinkedIn, utilized my company’s reimbursement for certifications, and got a couple of popular certifications that were relevant to my title.

You will know if you’ve found a good niche, because recruiters will begin sliding into your LinkedIn inbox like you’re a female on Facebook who just changed their relationship status to single.

I started interviewing regularly, while things were still going great at my job. This was counterintuitive to many of those around me.. but the truth is, things don’t need to be going bad for you to move on. It allows you to get a realistic idea of what the market is offering for your skills, and also takes away the stress of having to find a job to pay your bills.

During this period, I experienced a lot of disappointment, and a lot of surprises, mostly because of my background. In July I was offered a position working on Federal Government contracts for the FDIC, but the offer was rescinded because of the felony on my record.

This ultimately worked out in the end, with other companies happy to take on an ambitious newbie who had a lot of progress to show for themselves in a short time.

My advice for anyone at this point in their journey is to just remember that no one but yourself can decide your value. 100 no’s and a yes, is still a yes.

Also, tell your recruiters to do their own paperwork. I spent hours filling out questionnaires, following up on emails, and reaching out to prospects only to find out that most of the interview requests I was answering were automated and not even being read.

## Reaching Six Figures ($60k → $120k)

December 2022

After opening myself to work on LinkedIn and speaking with dozens of recruiters, I found myself deciding between multiple offers for well known companies. For the first time in my life, I did not need to apply to any positions, and people were willing to bid on my talent. This has been an incredibly gratifying and validating experience.

During a quarterly review I let my manager know that I was actively interviewing for other positions. I had previously asked for raises and was told that there was a pay-scale re-org in the works, but that had never come about. I was offered a $20k raise to $80k when I told them how far along the process I was, but by that time I was already being offered $120k which they were unable to match.

I was lucky enough that there were no hard feelings, with both co-workers and managers congratulating me, asking how I did it, and offering references. I hope that who ever is reading this is also lucky in this regard. Although, if you find yourself in a position where other people can not be happy for your success, just remember that this is a reflection of themselves and has very little to do with you.

## Reflection ($120k)

So, this is where I am now. A few people told me that I should have gone the over-employed route and kept both jobs for a total salary of $180k. That sounds nice, but the reality is that I would have most likely been lying to both companies to get out of meetings, and not been able to maintain the same level of productivity if I had to spread efforts across two jobs.

If there is any other advice I can give, it would be to find a good work life balance. In my early working years, I was taught that only millionaires had a right to rest. This led to me burning out, and not enjoying my work. When I took a step back to begin enjoying myself, things that would stress me out on Monday mornings would start to just roll off my shoulders. I cannot stress enough how much of a noticeable change this made in both my attitude and quality of work.

Also, I know that this post is outlined in terms of compensation… but the truth is that money is merely a shadow of value. If you can provide value, it truly does not matter where you live, what your currency is, or standard of living is… you will be wealthy.

So that’s it for me. I hope that this post will help people, and not come off as me stroking my own ego. I see myself as someone who still has a long way to go. My career goal is oriented towards software architecture, which is not where I currently am. I plan on using my new job to further refine my current skills and learn new ones.

I’m happy to answer any questions about my process and provide feedback on your own from my perspective.

Hope this helps!!"
zh4tgm,389,2022-12-09,Why Humans Dye Their Bones,CarterCreations061,HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/zh4tgm/why_humans_dye_their_bones/,"Humans were a relatively successful species. Most sentient species barely make it past their nuclear age, but in their half a million local years of existence humans were able to conquer two more planets as well as several natural satellites in their star system. The humans originated on the Third Planet. They had quickly, within the first 300,000 local years, spread to the rocks around the Fifth Planet in their system. By the end, they had conquered all of the spaces habitable to them. 

When my species, the Ri’icher, had moved in, the humans were long gone. We had heard their radio transmissions and decided to wait to see if the humans would become interstellar. Few of the species in the galaxy had the know-how and patience to create a working sleep chamber. For some reason, almost every species besides the Ri’icher failed to achieve interstellar status. There were a few that had conquered one or two local star systems, but none rivaled the Ri’icher empire, with well over four thousand systems in our grasp. 

We sat and watched as the humans tried to escape their system. Their transmissions told us that they too dreamed of the impossibility of traveling faster than light. When it seemed that their scientists fully realized just how impossible it was to go out and into the stars, their society began to collapse. They seemed, like all sentient creatures, to crave exploration and when denied the opportunity, they turned on each other. 

Once they had disappeared for good, we moved into their Second Planet. The dense, hot atmosphere was extremely pleasant, especially after the long slumber to get here. It would be the only planet in the system that wouldn’t need intense terraforming. I awoke and was given my assignment: travel to the Fourth Planet to study human civilization. Other teams went out to study the other areas that humans had managed to settle. It had been decided that we would immediately begin terraforming the Third Planet--in fact the humans had done us a big favor by already warming and thickening the atmosphere quite a bit--but our job was to see if there was any historical significance in saving the other bodies. 

Once we arrived, I went to work quickly. My job as a Priest is to study the human remains we pulled from the ground. We Ri’icher are a civilized species, so we treat the dead--even the dead of the lesser species--with great respect. I carefully cut into the remains with religious precision. To my horror, the bones inside were tainted. They were a bright green color. I checked my manual again. I had studied human anatomy that we had gleaned from their transmission for the better part of my life. I was sure that the human bones were naturally white, like ours. Yes, yes my notes confirmed it. 

I sent a message back to the stations on the Third Planet. They confirmed that the bones should be white. The Ri’icher on the Third Planet dug up some of the human remains there as well, yes those bones were white! Over the next few hours and days, reports came in from the other stations. Every research team reported that the bones of the humans were a different color. Blue from the First Planet, purple from this moon, black from that moon. Had these vile little creatures dishonored their dead by tainting their bones? And seemingly in such a tribalistic fashion. Just as we thought, these humans were so busy with their differences that they failed to come together to invent the sleep technology needed to venture into the stars. 

When the reports were compiled, the Council decided that almost all human artifacts and remnants should be destroyed. It would be a sin to let the legacy of such blasphemous creatures live on. A few artifacts and remains were taken from the Third Planet, but it seemed that once the humans left earth they gave up honoring their dead and decided to mutilate and discolor their corpses. Those remains and ruins would be wiped out by the terraforming process. 

I had been so fascinated with the humans. It came as a complete shock to myself and the rest of my species that humans would do such a thing. They seemed so cultured, relatively speaking. Of course they could never rival the Ri’icher empire, like I said few could. But they had been more successful than most. They had had art, religion, science even. Why would they go through so much trouble to dishonor their dead with dyes? 

Once the terraforming team arrived on the Fourth Planet, I was told to return to the Third. I had stayed for roughly 60 local days, largely doing nothing because of my new disdain for human culture. I missed the sweet, hot air of the Second planet. It would be a good home while the other astronomical bodies were rid of the human ones. 

In transit, though, I was told that I would actually be rerouted to study the remains of a human spacecraft. It had recently been found by a different team, but their Priest was a high ranker and refused to touch the corpse of these sinful beings. I was the lowest ranking Priest in the system, so the uncleanness fell on me. 

I arrived at a Ri’icher ship 5 local days after hearing of my new assignment. I was led to a storage area where the battered human ship was being kept. Apparently no other Ri’icher had dared to go near it. They were afraid that the humans were cursed. I donned on some holy protection and entered the craft. Inside I found several human cadavers. It seemed that there had been a small breach in the craft, so these humans would have all died simultaneously. Thank the gods, none of them would have had the time to taint their brethren's skeletons. 

I began the dissection with haste. I wanted to be away from this cursed vessel. However, I was shocked to find that these humans had colored bones as well. First was blue, then green, then orange, and on and on the colors went. How had they done such a thing? I immediately went to the ship's log. My human tongue was a bit weary now, but I was able to translate the logs with relative ease. 

The ship’s computer told of how the vessel had stopped. Like I had guessed, there was a sudden breach in the hull that caused all of the oxygen to escape. But then how had the humans prepared their dead? Was it natural that human bones decayed into the awful coloration? No, no. The bones on the Third Planet were all a dull white. Perhaps there was a natural explanation? 

Over the next few days I reported my findings to the Council. Slowly it came upon me that the human’s must not have desecrated their dead. More busted ships were found around the system and told the same story. The humans had different color bones while alive. I looked for any genetic marker, but found none. I thought perhaps it was the effects of different environments? But the human bodies seemed uniquely resistant to evolution. 

On most ships, we found a typical arrangement of human items: devices, exercises machines, medications, books. Soon I was given a team and I had them precisely catalog all the items found. I even requested for the Council to stop terraforming the other worlds until we could find the answer, but they said that the blight of humanity had to be extinguished quickly. 

A while later a different ship came under my growing collection. I dissected these corpses as well and found that all of the bones were that naturally dull white color. I had my team pore over the catalog of items. There was a class of drugs, common on most of the other ships, but mysteriously missing on this one. Overtime we began classifying the drugs with what colors of bones they were found alongside. We soon had a data sheet. It appeared that many humans took a mixture of drugs, some mixes turning their bones red or orange or purple, ect. I hypothesized that perhaps the different mixtures were to affect the physiology of the humans living on each of the planets and satellites. Some planets would need weaker radiation protection, or stronger bone density enhancers.  It also seemed that all of the bones found in space had a bit of a lighter tint, perhaps because of an additional drug taken by the humans during deep-space travel. 

Upon this discovery, one of my interns on my team suggested that we test the medications on some of the human remains. The suggestion was made by a young researcher in a meeting with the entire team, some dozen other people, and we all quickly shut it down. To desecrate the bodies would be a mortal sin, and besides the council may excommunicate the one who asked.

I was totally defeated. I reported my hypothesis to the Council but was forbidden by conscience and clergy from collecting the data necessary to prove or disprove it. The Council waved off my suggestion that we preserve human cultures. They said that the original findings stood: humans were to be known as a species that did not care about their dead. They graced me, though, and allowed me a small satellite around the Fifth Planet to continue my limited research. While I was of course grateful for the opportunity to continue my research, it was also difficult being so far from my fellow Ri’icher. We are a very social species, and isolation is like a punishment. 

The humans had called the satellite, “Europa.” It was the least terraformed object in the system, besides the gas giants, and was a place where the last ruins of humanity had remained mostly untouched. According to my notes it was where the Blue-boned humans came from. 

I spent the next dozen or so local years on the planet. I cataloged all that I could on the quickly decaying human stations. I requested time and time again for a team to help me preserve humanity, but the Council refused. All of the labor had to be directed to the terraforming of the soon-to-be-habitable worlds. The Council had sent back a message to the Home Planet and told of the sizable real estate available in the new star system. I heard whispers that there were many Ri’icher who were wary of even setting tentacle in the cursed system. Within 200 local years--only about three years on the Home Planet--there would be vast ships coming into the star system, with millions of Ri’icher asleep onboard. 

One day I entered into a vast structure. As I had done countless times before, I took visual and auditory records of the building. It seemed to have been some kind of educational facility when the humans were alive. There were tons and tons of paper and computer data to comb through. Eventually I made my way to what was known as the “physics department.” Ri’icher do not have such arbitrary lines between science, nor between science and religion. Humans had such a unique ability to specialize. 

It would take dozens of Third Planet days to get through all of the data, but I began anyway. This was my existence now, to try and catalog as much of human society as I could before it crumbled away. 

But wait, what was that folder on the computer? It had the three simple human letters, “F-T-L.” Was this some sort of fictional story that the human who had used this office was writing? I knew those letters, it was what humans had used to refer to the impossible technology of traveling faster than light. I opened the documents. 

It was amazing. The humans had discovered the secrets to traveling the stars in mere minutes. It was mostly theoretical, but the equations worked out. They used realistic, physical assumptions. I spent the next several hours trying to find all of the data on the “FTL” theorem. It appeared that the humans had only managed the tiniest of experiments for the technology, but the results were promising. They even had plans for much, much larger experiments. These humans must have been trying desperately, against all odds, to break the laws of the universe in order to save their civilization from gobbling itself up. They must have been just a few local years away from the secret before the last sparks had extinguished. 

I compiled the data and sent a report back to the Council. I had been sending reports about human artifacts for a while now, and they were mostly ignored at this point. I sent perhaps three dozen follow up messages before a Council member actually reviewed my FTL report in any detail. They were astonished. My report was read to a full Council and the calculations and data were quadrupled checked. . Soon I had a much larger team, nearly 40 dozen individuals, working with me at the decrepit educational facility. 

Within a few dozen local years we made the human’s plans for larger experiments a reality. The technology spread rapidly among the Ri’icher in the galaxy. Within 300 of the Earth’s years--upon my discover humanity’s savage image was revoked, they are now considered among the most refined species in the known universe, and we thus honor them by preserving the name of their home--with those 300 years the technology has been used to save countless sapien species from extinction. The humans are now perhaps even more famous than the Ri’icher. "
zh4wvv,1,2022-12-09,Applying for Internships,Jaron555,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/zh4wvv/applying_for_internships/,"So, I have social anxiety. I am a CS major in my third year of college and I am trying to apply for internships for the coming summer. I know it's sort of late already. I heard that companies' job postings have fallen sharply in the US. I feel as if I shouldn't even try applying and that I will not get anything. That's probably me just avoiding doing this whole thing, giving in to my fear, and saying that I will fail before I start. Even if I get something, I'm already terrified of the thought of an interview. Does anyone have any advice? Other than just do it haha, like anything reassuring? Have any of you already applied to a bunch of internships and gotten any offers? I want to know if there is a chance. "
zh59sz,5,2022-12-09,"I Quit Working Altogether, Just Not The Way I Hoped",EffectiveDust,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/zh59sz/i_quit_working_altogether_just_not_the_way_i_hoped/,"**TL;DR at the bottom**

I don't work and haven't for a few years now, which is what I always wanted, but with a cruel twist. I just got back on reddit after finding out this sub existed and thought I'd share a bit of my story since there seem to be so many like-minded people here in terms of not wanting to work their whole lives.

**THE PLAN**

My plan when I was younger was to do everything I could to earn and save a lot of money so I could retire no later than age 50. In fact, I actually told several people that if I had to work past 50 I didn't see the point in living and was planning to kill myself rather than go on like that. And I meant it.

So in my 20s I not only went to a university and got a degree, I went on to graduate studies and got an MBA. I worked the entire time, including managing a small business for the local owner during all of graduate school. I also worked three internships and volunteered with a non-profit. All except the last was just to make sure I could earn a lot of money at a good job, and the last actually helped me too because they served as great references.

I was all set to earn and save money for my retirement at 50 or earlier.

**MULTIPLE SCREWJOBS**

Fresh out of the MBA program, I got a job with a large corporation before I even graduated officially. It was drudgery middle management but supposedly with a great chance to move up. I worked my ass off, treated those I managed the way I want to be treated and was well-liked for it, and in exchange I got...to work there six months until the company started hemorrhaging money, at which time they cut  their workforce in half based on seniority. Guess who was the newest management hire so the first to go? Yep. 

So I said fuck it, and applied at their biggest competitor. The only job they had open was the one I used to manage, so I took it and did the same work as the people I had previously supervised.  My brief experience helped. My boss told me I was on my way to making management again and going even farther, and I enjoyed the work more than I thought I would.

Then I got recruited by another company in an industry I'd never worked in, but for a sales job related to the industry I was already in. I was interviewed three times and offered more money in each, and every time I told the man interviewing me that I was not familiar with his products and would need at least 3 to 6 months to learn more before I felt I could sell successfully. He agreed, and so when he made his final offer at more than double my previous management pay, I took it.

Three weeks into the new job, he was already complaining that I'm not selling enough and began refusing me any time to learn the industry. Five weeks after that, he ended my employment and offered me three weeks of severance and told me ""you're lucky to get that"". Somehow I didn't feel lucky.

**SEXUAL HARASSMENT ISN'T FUN**

So I moved on, got married shortly after that, started a family, and got a job I loved but that didn't pay much in another area of the country. I worked that job for nearly 4 years with no raise while being sexually harassed regularly by my boss. I'd rather not share details on that. I really liked the work - I just didn't like how I was treated.

Finally I found my ticket out with another job doing similar work and paying about twice as much. I liked everything I was told in the extensive single interview (over 4 hours long) and I was a perfect fit for the job. I accepted the position at the small company, then found out that nearly everything the young owner told me during the interview had been a lie. Other than the fact that I had the job and the pay rate, nothing was true - not even my job title, which had been downgraded because he ""didn't feel like it should be on par"" with his own title. The work from home was taken away as I was made the de facto secretary at the office instead, and never mind the work he'd hired me for. I was effectively an overpaid administrative assistant.

The owner was the most incompetent person I've ever met, and the business only made money because of other people. His mother handled all the sales, I did my job, and his technical person did all of the technical stuff. The only thing he did was micromanage myself and the tech person. After a few months his mother informed me that he had made a mistake in hiring me and offering me so much money because they couldn't afford me anymore. I was let go because he didn't know how to budget at all. Back to the drawing board for me.

**DISCRIMINATION SUCKS TOO** 

I found another job earning a lower rate of pay again, with more pleasant work. This went fine until a new owner bought the company, a subtle racist who became more open in private. I documented this extensively, though he only ever said anything obvious when we were alone. He kept trying to get me to quit with little things like making sure I got the worst work. He then demoted me from full time to part time and put me on the worst schedule for no reason other than racism.

Soon afterward, the racist fired me for supposedly missing work too much (which didn't happen, but he had altered my time cards to suggest it had), and I finally sent everything I'd documented to the EEOC. The person reviewing it sided with me and wanted to know my demands. I met with an employment lawyer and figured it all out...only to be contacted by the boss of the EEOC reviewer to say they had reversed the decision and sided with my former employer. Why? My documentation didn't include enough specific details on exactly what he'd said and done each time, and they wouldn't let me add to it. He was denying everything, and I didn't have signed statements of others to corroborate it. So it was dismissed and my only recourse was to sue.

I found another attorney who would sue for me with no fees unless I got money, but I still would have had to pay all sorts of court and other fees that would total as much as I had recently made working for him in several months, and that had to be paid right out of the gate. Plus I would have had to travel several hours to the court in question unless it settled quickly. I took a pass and the jackass got away with his racist shit.

**THE END OF WORK FOR ME**

A few months after that, fate would intervene, giving me something of a Pyrrhic victory in my quest to retire younger than 50. While walking along a street, a vehicle driven by an old man who couldn't see properly slammed into me. Thankfully it had been going only about 25 MPH, but it was enough to launch me onto the sidewalk some distance away. The old man denied he'd hit me, either because he was senile and didn't know or to try to save himself the trouble. I don't remember anything about it, but there were cameras on businesses that showed it all, so he didn't get away with that denial. I don't want to detail my injuries, but they were rather severe.

So after some hospital time and a much longer stay at a nursing home, where I made friends with a number of people older than myself, I regained some mobility. I got a lawyer and sued the old man. During that time I also filed for and obtained disability pay. Then came the settlement from the old man's insurance company.

My spouse has a good job and we don't live an expensive lifestyle in an area where cost of living isn't too high. Given the pain I still deal with just to get through each day, the settlement money, and my disability pay, we decided together that I'm done working. I'm officially ""retired"" and under 50, just not in the way I'd hoped.

**NOT WORKING FTW**

I go through my days now trying to look for the positive, and it is there. Most of it is directly because I no longer have to work. 

We save a ton of money on daycare because I'm able to watch the kids despite my limited mobility. The remainder of my student loans were forgiven due to being disabled. My commute is now zero minutes and I spend nothing on gas to get to a job I don't have or need.

And of course, I don't have to waste my time working only to put up with screwjobs, sexual harassment, discrimination, and other bullshit.

It sucks that I was injured and disabled, but when I look for the positives, many are associated with no longer working. I am glad to be free from the hell of the grind.

I wouldn't wish my circumstances on anyone, but I do hope for the best for all of you who may also want to stop working. It truly is a blessing, particularly if you can get there without  going through what I have.

**TL;DR -** I did everything I could to set myself up to retire young. Then I dealt with a lot of shit at various jobs, suffered a horrible accident and was disabled, and no longer work as a result. I stay positive by reminding myself no matter what else sucks, I did achieve my goal of no work at a relatively young age."

I like company B, and they pay twice of what my internship at company A pays me.

He had completed his undergraduate course a few months ago (BCom) and is now looking to enter the job market. He liked Computer Programming in high school (dabbled in a bit of Java) and was one of his Marketing professor's favourite students in uni. His grades are also not shabby tho his college wasn't top tier.

He wants to explore his options and is wondering if he should do some online certifications/courses for Python, Java Script and SQL, and then data analytics.

I had suggested doing an MBA, however my cousin is adamant that he does not waste time and gets to experience first hand whatever he can. His parents are also not in a position to pay for a whole degree and finding a part time job to fund his education is not really possible (he lives in India). And student loans are not easy to pay off (I'm paying mine off myself and it's honestly taking forever) so given his family's finances, I can see why he's apprehensive.

While he doesn't have a set career path in mind, he wants to know if the mentioned courses or certifications will be enough to land him freelancing projects or internships, after which a formal job hunt could start. The general direction he's thinking in seems to be some Business Analyst job.

Can I have an honest opinion of whether not going to uni for an MBA is unwise or if his plan might work?"

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**What I want:**

\- I want high TC (for new-grads) in case I get return offer from the company. 

\- Intern TC does not really matter.

\- I want to work hard and learn a lot (both in technical/non-technical).

\- WLB does not really matter.

\- I want to use Python in my professional career. (if possible)

&amp;#x200B;

**Information:**

**C1:**

\- High intern TC (about 55$/hr)

\- Decent new-grads TC (\~130K) ?

\- Great WLB (from what I heard)

\- Many branches around US (Flexible Location ?)

\- SWE

&amp;#x200B;

**Wayfair:**

\- Don't know about TC at all.

\- [levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi) says \~150k for new-grads  

\- Boston 

\- Data Scientist

\- A bit worried about the company's future considering the recent stock price. (?)

&amp;#x200B;

**Ocient:**

\- Low intern TC (about \~30$/hr)

\- Decent TC for new-grads (\~130K/annual)

\- Boston

\- C++ heavy

\- Seems to have nice people in my team

\- I think that the company has a bright future (?)

&amp;#x200B;

**Mckinsey**

\- No idea about TC at all.

\- New York

\- Coding + Consulting + ETC

\- I personally think work at Mckinsey sounds very interesting. (Solving problems in many different industries)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'd appreciate any information, reason and/or advice.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you ahead.

3. First full-time job - It was in a foreign country but I had to quit because of terrible working conditions

4. Second full-time job - I had to quit because of family problems. I had to move back to my home country.

5. Contract job - I lost it when the pandemic started. I was laid off to save costs.

Yung school namin is nago-offer ng 3 majors for IT which are the following: Major in Service Management Track, Major in Business Analytics Track, and Major in Network Technology Track. Is it better ba to have a degree physically or kahit online nalang para makatipid? Our school is also accredited by the US-based Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology – Computing Accreditation Commission (ABET-CAC) kasi eh kahit state university siya. I want to be financially independent asap, sa mga IT and naging IT students diyan, kaya bang mag-free lance or side hustle or intern while studying?

&amp;#x200B;

Ayos lang sa akin na if bumalik ako sa 1st year, malayo raw kasi ang subjs between engineering and IT pero kakaunti nalang yung ite-take ko kasi na-take ko na yung mga minor subjs namin. Kaso parang ire-repeat ko lahat ng mga majors ko (wag naman sana), baka pwedeng idaan sa pakiusap? I am not sure if na-inform na sila ng dean namin kasi I once asked our dean to help me to inform my profs regarding my condition and sinabi niya na siya na raw ang bahala. Should I ask my profs 1 by 1, face-to-face if na-inform sila ng dean and if pwede bang gawan ng paraan para makapasa ako or let it slide para mabawasan yung load ko, since I’m going to shift and not going to take anymore major subjects in me na req muna na ipasa yung subj na iyon (pre-requisite). The reasons why ayaw ko na mag-me is because after kong malaman na may agency na ng mga me for dito sa ph I feel na it is not worth it anymore, hindi na rin worth it iyakan yung pinag-aaralan ko tapos pag-nagtrabaho ako as me nganga kasi 8k-20k per mo lang ang starting salary tapos swertihan nalang kapag 20k+, tapos ang hirap pa mag-apply kasi hinahanap lagi ng mga companies are those that have job experience already. If mag-aabroad naman dapat may backer. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am academically struggling because of my hyperthyroidism, it badly affects my studies as it makes me agitated, easily gets fatigued lalo na mentally, wala pang 1 hr sa klase gusto ko nang magpahinga and lutang na ako (kaya ang super nahihirapan akong i-absorb yung mga lessons naming mga maths at mga theorems), madaling magutom pero I'm maintaining my bmi to normal, trembling (kaya ang baba ng scores ko sa mga problem sets ko sa mga math kasi hindi straight pagsulat ko eh need na naka-engineering lettering huhu), sensitive to heat nakakainis kasi I can feel my skin being warm tapos ang pawisin ko pa. I am currently under medication and hindi pa namin alam if curable ba yung hyperthyroidism ko or maaagapan. Nakakaapekto rin yung stress kasi bumabalik yung mga symptoms kapag stressed ako.

Dati gusto kong mag-IT since I was in jhs pero may mga tao na noon na nag-pi-peer pressure sa akin na bakit hindi raw ako mag-engineering? Ang sagot ko naman sa kanila, “Ayaw ko po ng matitinding math eh.” Kaso when the pandemic striked, nadala ako sa peer pressure ng mga clients namin (ina-assist ko lagi si lolo sa pag-me-mekaniko and he is actually a licensed me), lagi nilang sinasabi na bakit hindi nalang daw ako mag me kasi nakikita raw nila yung potential ko to work with the machines. Well nag-enjoy naman ako sa experience ko working with and to the machines may nabuo rin ako na skills but I mostly don’t like our clients kasi madalas humihingi ng discount.

I want to know how much importance is actually given to society POR's during the campus recruitment. When I asked the seniors they recommended that I join a society to build my CV. Though, they are supposed to recruit new members so I believe they can't say otherwise.

 My past month was completely occupied in giving GD's and PI's due to which I had to skip important classes. Some of my friends who have been selected are being bombarded with hefty amount of work.

I personally don't have any interest in these societies due to their toxic work culture. BA Hons (eco) already has a very rigorous curriculum. 
I have figured out that I will not be able to manage both academics and society work. 

Though, I have plans to do internships and learn technical skills on my own.
My future goals include earning well and gaining work experience before applying for a masters or MBA. 

Will I be at a disadvantage at the campus recruitment if I focus more on a good CGPA and don't join any society?"

I have applied to most UK-based unis but I feel like going to America would be a pretty cool experience. Not quite sure how to fund it though as the tuition fees are so much more expensive there. Are scholarships quite common for international students or extremely hard to come by? And are most international students paying out of their own pockets? Tuition in the UK isn't something we think about due to costs being relatively low and full tuition loans being so easy to get. Also, what sort of universities would be a good shot to apply to (not looking to do a GRE)? I know I am a bit late but could hopefully send out one or two applications by the deadline as my personal statement and references are at hand. Would appreciate any advice! :)"

\-I'm 25 this March

\-Dropped out of school in 2020 to work &amp; resuming classes this spring

\-Have 13 classes left (should be done by Fall '23 - Spring 24' Latest)

\-Don't enjoy/know how to do any high level coding.

I dropped out because I didn't enjoy CS but I'm way too far into this degree to pivot to another major. School was really stressful for me but I was more aimless at the time so I loathed class but now I kinda wanna get on with my life after seeing so many of my peers move on.

I'm not against coding but I've never really been good at it and even if I was, I wouldn't want to work on anything too complex/stressful. I'm looking to apply for summer internships and wouldn't be against doing an internship in something more IT related assuming they take CS students. On the other hand everyone I went to school with were also morons so maybe some coding jobs aren't too difficult. 

I guess my questions are:

\- Are there any roles that exist for a person like me? (Lighter level coding) Ive done a search on this sub and seen things about testers and alternative roles but I don't know how to get there from where I'm at right now. Additionally I'd hate to pivot just to find out there are some coding jobs that aren't bad at all and don't require you to work more than a couple of hours.

\- Should I be looking to pivot to IT internships that'll hopefully eventually land me an IT related job?

\- Am I too late to be applying to internships?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a bit lost and could use some advice. Thanks all."

I applied to a company that was looking for student interns that were completing their BAC in software engineering. 

About a week ago I received an email back where they said : ""We’ve taken some time to go through your experience for this position and, on this occasion, we have decided not to move forward with your application.""

But the thing is that I've been working part time for the past three years as a full stack developer, and before that I worked full time for almost a year.

I don't mind being declined as I didn't think I would get this internship to begin with, but is this normal or they just didn't take the time to read my resume? I find that kinda strange since the internship is targeted at students and I think I have a decent amount of experience compared to most students."

zi4vt4,36,2022-12-10,ServiceNow Red Flags Everywhere,SomeYak,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/zi4vt4/servicenow_red_flags_everywhere/,"Before starting, I would like to preface this with the fact that this is just my own personal experience. Its very possible that I got dealt a bad hand of interviewers and recruiters.

I applied for the Digital Technologies SWE Internship at ServiceNow in early october. I heard back from the recruiter on October 11th asking for availability for a phone screen. He scheduled it relatively quick and we had a discussion about my background and stuff the following week (October 19th). He said he would be asking for availability to schedule the virtual onsite via email ""soon"" and I would have a decision before thanksgiving. (that is a long time, but i didnt bat an eye cause recruiting usually takes a while).

red flag #1: got completely ghosted. sent him an email following up and giving him my availability. he followed up after a few days telling me that they're still gathering their interviewing team. I was like ok fine whatever.

red flag #2: Recruiter followed back up later and addressed me by the wrong name?? literally like Hi Chris, my name is not even close to chris. he told me about the format of the interviews and that his recruiting coordinator would be emailing me soon. This was November 7th.

red flag #3: recruiting coordinator emailed me maybe 30 mins after telling me about the interview I had in less than 24 hours. I know I gave that availability to them but I dont think &lt; 24 hours is sufficient notice..

I had three interviews, out of which only the first one with the hiring manager went well.

red flag #4: second interview. the engineer started with asking questions about APIs and my knowledge and background. They asked what was a 401 status code and yes I should have known what it was but I hadn't had experience with authentication so I was honest and told them I didnt know. I proceeded to tell them all the other status codes but it didnt seem like they cared at all. After this, i genuinely think they just fucked off. They gave me a coding question and just were not there. (bonus red flag #5: they never had their camera on). At the end of the 15 mins they gave me to code, they asked me to explain all of my logic as if they were never listening.

red flag #6: this was a genuine person tbh. he was extremely nice and was listening to each of my answers and genuinely engaged. the only red flag here was that they were looking for a data analyst... this was listed as a swe role and i told him that. I continued to then have a relaxing conversation with him and I actually really enjoyed that. Why was the position listing so incredibly wrong?? maybe this is on the recruiter or maybe its on the manager but this is just not it. the technical questions i was asked were all very data-y and I had no idea what to say cause that is not what I had prepped for at all. 

red flag #7: A week after finishing (nov 16), my recruiter told me that they would be winding up interviews soon and I should have a decision by ""next week"". He also asked me if i had any pending offers, i replied back saying no and that I am looking forward to hearing back soon. I havent heard anything back. My interviews were over a month ago and they absolutely should have a decision by now. I have also followed up with the recruiter asking if there have been any updates and no replies.

zi7ema,1,2022-12-10,Letter to an old friend,Aggressive_Box_9068,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/zi7ema/letter_to_an_old_friend/," Hey. It’s been a while since I’ve seen you. I finally went to the doctors, and it turns out that I have a dysfunctional pelvic floor. I had to go to physical therapy for some time to strengthen some surrounding muscles in that area that have been repeatedly injured is what I was told. It did not fix things completely, but now nine times out of ten, I’m in the clear. I guess that is improvement, right? 

 You wouldn’t believe the journey I have had since you’ve been gone. It’s been quite a mixed bag. Right after you left, I got COVID for the first time. It was absolutely awful. I was so sick that I could not even drive home to get help from my family, I also did not want to get any of them sick. I was able to get work and school off and get paid for it, which is good, but those two weeks of agony and isolation were torture. 

 After that my smell and taste never quite came back the same, and I even got parosmia. Most of the foods that I ate like eggs, nuts, cheese, protein shakes, and many other things smelled and tasted like a rotting corpse. I began to lose a lot of weight and become very sickly. I had to go to work full time now and school full time. I had to do this because of all the expenses and responsibilities that you left me with. I never got any sleep because of this and got even more sick. 

 I developed a worse relationship with alcohol and drank every day, even at work some days. I drank like this until one day I got so sick that I thought I was going to die. My whole body was shooting with pain, and I threw up so much, so violently that my back was sore for a week. I did not sleep for 2 days, just laid on the bathroom ground and shivered in my own mess too weak and scared and sad to call an ambulance. I didn’t drink for months after this and now only drink on occasion. The doctors put “Alcohol dependence” on my medical records.

 The isolation was the most difficult thing I have ever had to deal with, I had and still don’t have one friend. It was unbearable to not speak to anyone but my boss at work occasionally for months on end. No one to share any thoughts with, to talk to, to get a hug, etc. I would pace around that five-bedroom house for hours, so much that I wore a trail into the carpet. I broke holes in all the walls and destroyed the couch and lots of other things in the house out of sadness and anger.

 I really got into walking, especially in the woods. I found so many beautiful places that were hidden away in nature. I would walk whenever I could get a chance and would go for miles and miles. This became a coping mechanism because it was easier to feel less lonely when I was connected with nature in a way. I would go into those woods and cry and cry and yell and scream and throw wood and punch trees and hit the ground, but the nature was understanding.

 I found a loophole into graduating college because they felt bad about the situation that I was in. Got some close offers at big companies for marketing internships, but never made the final cut. Right as the lease was coming to an end, I hear of a job opportunity down in Novi. I went through three rounds of interviews and by a stroke of luck they hired me starting at $60,000 a year salary with great benefits and 2 weeks paid vacation. Not too shabby for being 22 with no experience. 

 I had to leave and move down to the area and found an apartment in Walled Lake. Not very big or nice but it’s okay because it is close to work. My brother ended up coming to live with me, which I welcomed because I was so miserable being alone all of the time. We had some fights but now are closer than ever and he is growing up into an adult now. He also got lucky and got his first job at a good company for $18/hr. which is not bad for his first ever job. I also 4 months or so into my new job got a brand-new car. It’s a sporty nice black car with a turbo and everything. It was $42,000.

 My mom has been doing alright and so has my dad and other brothers. The family is doing for the most part good too. A couple people are getting divorces, but that is just a fact of life that sucks for everybody. It is kind of sad to see my mom and dad slowing down and having more aches and pains. I thought they were like superheroes that were invincible when I was growing up.

 About 2 months ago now I began to have terrible headaches that got so bad that I ended up in the hospital. They eventually dismissed it as a migraine or something that was viral in nature. A couple days after that I began to have a very weird feeling in my chest, heart, and lungs. I was escorted back to the hospital where I got dozens of blood tests done, x-rays, ECGs, and other examinations. They said I had strep throat very bad. I took antibiotics for 2 weeks but was still having the same symptoms. I went back and was tested for strep, mono, hepatitis, but they all came back negative. I had to go to yet another doctor that said this whole month I had untreated severe GERD and esophagitis. I am on my 10th day of a 2-week treatment and still don’t feel better and headaches are coming back. I’m not sure what is wrong with me, but it’s been really hard, and I wish you were still here.  

This hasn’t been easy."

I had an internship interview two weeks ago, and the guy asked how would I go about designing a TLB caching system. After sitting on it for like a few hours, I can give you some description about a circuit that dissects a virtual address via some control regs to get a TLB index and check if there's a value. If not then just waits a few cycles to fetch the memory and place it into the TLB cache. I can even give you estimates on optimal TLB length based on page size, and how it would allocated in the RAM. Or perhaps design a circuit that could trigger an expection if the physical memory address is out of bounds.

But to think of that on the spot, effeciently as a stupid looking Junior BS in Computer Engineering who has less than a year of Verilog experience and learned what a TLB is a few weeks prior is literally beyond me. I just spewed some nonsense about reading from a cache and I/O of the TLB system. Like, I'm simply not smart enough to do that and I don't know if I'll ever be. Even my university's capstone Computer Architecture course which I'm taking next semester doesn't cover that (or at least I think so). 

Is that level of thinking really expected of me at this point in my career? Cause if it is, I might as well drop out right now and maybe I can spend the rest of my life at the Best Buy geek squad if I'm even smart enough for that at this point.

1. 5 Year Fixed at $5.54%  
2. 5 Year Adjustable at Prime - 0.80%

What I could decipher from all the screaming was that we can't afford to pay more than $2200 in mortgage payments in the future (monthly income will be decreasing permanently by $600 sometime next year and then decreasing another $300 permanently in 2024). 

Here's where I come in... I'm a college student and got a one year internship that starts in May next year. With the income I make from that, I can help my parents pay the mortgage. But after the internship ends and I go back to school, I'm not sure how long that saved income will help cover the future mortgage payments. So I'm trying to persuade them into taking the 5 Year Adjustable rate offer because at some point during the next 5 years the prime interest rate should decrease to a more affordable level. At least I hope it does because otherwise it sounds like we'll have to sell the house. 

I already work two min wage part time jobs to pay for the internet bill and the cell plans for my younger brother, mom, and myself. I also give half of whatever is remaining to my parents to help pay for groceries and other bills but they've always been terrible with money. Dad has been bankrupt once and I've seen the balance on his line of credits, its very likely he'll file for bankruptcy sometime in the future. My mom became disabled some years back and has been unemployed since. Between the two of them, the only one that even pretends to listen to me is my mom so I've been trying to get through to her but she is too afraid and in a state of despair or anxiety to act or make any real changes. Dad is a lost cause, I can't talk to him. Earlier today I convinced my mom to call the bank and ask them about  that mortgage renewal agreement letter we got in November and they said that their rates have changed and are much higher now. Can we still sign the mortgage renewal agreement that we got and mail it to them? It says on the first page that we have until the maturity date which is February to return the agreement signed. Will they honour this agreement or will we be forced to go with whatever new rates they are currently offering? Is there anything else I can do help?"
zif7oo,1,2022-12-10,CSE Transfer Profile,r_kobra,ucla,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/zif7oo/cse_transfer_profile/,"Hello!

I am currently interested in transferring to UCLA as a Computer Science and Engineering major next year.

Being that the CS Department is so selective as a whole, I had a few questions for those who have been admitted as a transfer. 

What do you think made you stand out? It seems like almost all applicants have crazy high GPAs, so that is a given. My GPA is in the 3.8s, so it’s a bit low, but I have landed a FAANG SWE internship for the coming summer and was curious on how much of a boost that would give me.

Furthermore, did you have any successful personal projects that made you stand out?

I just want to understand how to increase my odds.

zihuuz,3,2022-12-11,I grew up in a family business and it wasn't all nice and glory. How do I talk about it?,IamAMelodyy,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/zihuuz/i_grew_up_in_a_family_business_and_it_wasnt_all/,"I (F20) grew up with my mum who was mostly an only parent but also self-employed. I grew up going to each one of her business meetings, no matter how serious they were. I went to every single fair she went to, had me travel A LOT in and out of my country, see many cities, talk to many people. Had me grow up extremely fast, I was always well-behaved and proud of it, even as a 6-year old. I went to places at 12 that check entry because children aren't allowed but they didn't check me because my dress-code and appearance didn't match my age. I know how businesses work somehow, I get the mindset and culture of different business. I've seen tons (TONS!!) of offices, and factories, smells, work spaces, employees, and co-workers. . Not all that exist, but plenty.

Needless to say I don't understand how all of that was possible. Did nobody see that I was just there because my mum didn't have time to take care of me and didn't (never) give me away for others to take care of me? I'm at a loss about how I was allowed as a child to be in such legal/serious environments always and people always took me seriously (because I was the boss's daughter lol).

Idk how to process this now and how to talk to others about it. It's been an extremely damaging but also enriching experience. I talked to a recruiter lately and she told me (1) nobody is going to take me seriously (2) this is all just abuse and I better never mention it to anyone and (3) what did I actually do? Was I responsible for anything? What was my job?

And I was like.. my job was everything. Talking. Translating. Listening. Discussing, witnessing collaborations unfold. Witnessing negotiations. Catering. Visiting fairs. Doing some taxes. Being a full-time non-paid assistant for literally everything. Moving company headquarters from country A to country B. And it seems like all of that was... for nothing??? Do you really want to tell me that all I've seen and done was for the trashcan? That because of my age (20) nobody would think I've had job interviews and have had major responsibilities?

It's beyond frustrating.

TLDR/IN SHORT: I was neglected/abused from a young age as an ""do-everything"" full-time assistant to my mother. I know many things now, legal to corporate to business relationships and etiquette stuff, I literally grew up between companies and business meetings. But I didn't have a ""responsibility"" per se. Was it all for nothing and shouldn't I mention my mum's companies in my CV? If so, how? How do I mention them without saying that actually my mum was incapable of hiring someone outside so I was her full time assistant my entire life?? This makes zero sense. And I've burned myself out actually my entire life too so that makes sense. I want to feel that what I did and my efforts counted. Maybe i didn't have all the responsibility but it sure didn't feel like that. Never. I'm not like all the other university students who have seen nothing and are seeking a first job for minimum wage to see what it's like to work for a company. I've held fucking interviews with people wanting to work at OUR company, I have fucking cared for OUR interns. And now people tell me it doesn't count because (1) there's no set time frame (I always was available when needed and didn't have logged working hours or such) (2) there's no responsibility or measure for my performance.

What do I do? I'm in therapy for many other reasons, not this one. And I'm good. I just don't know how to make sense of this for my career and how to frame this mess of an experience into my CV. I hate when the hours I spent working as a child don't count because people are more convinced that I was playing around. Thanks for reading. Got longer than Anticipated."

Im a third year college student studying Information Science. I just recently changed my field of study though, as my freshman and sophomore year I was a Public Health major. 

I’ve come to really love learning network fundamentals and cyber security and have been gaining knowledge on what I need to do in order to pursue a career in this field.  I currently work as an IT Held Desk student in a major department on my campus. I know the basics of Python and I’ve been learning linux, bash scripting, and have really enjoyed doing beginner CTFs. Ive also been studying Net+ and Sec+ resources. Im not sure if I want to take the exam yet but I know that I know that the information and resources provided for studying are very useful and relevant.

I want to participate in an internship because I know that best way to learn is through hands on experience, but due to my transition and me not having any relevant course work I’m wondering how likely am I to even get offered a position. I know that not everyone is looking for a candidate with the most technical skills and that soft skills are a thing too, so what would be the best way to highlight that in my resume?

I was wondering if I could get any tips on good ways to structure my resume, what other resources I need to be looking into in order to show that Im a good candidate, and any other relevant advice.
 
Thank you!

I was fortunate enough to have been accepted at a small company for a 3 month internship. I work in the tech department.

Although I don't earn that much, it's initially about the work experience. I hope that 3 months of working will make my profile more attractive to potential recruiters.

Anyways, my internship ends around March. There is a possibility of staying in the company, but if that doesn't happen, I would like to be prepared and apply to other companies.

When would be a reasonable point to start applying to other companies? In 1 month? In 2 months? Right now?

Also, is 3 months of experience maybe not enough? I mean it's better than nothing, but will it have any meaningful impact on future job opportunities?

Thank you all."
zj3bq9,3,2022-12-11,Finally quitting the Xbox,jdsjosh,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/zj3bq9/finally_quitting_the_xbox/,"For the last 12 years I have dedicated a big party of my life to gaming, I got my first Gaming device the playstation 2 when I was eight, I played it now and again with my friends or occasional on a rainy day when playing outside or spending the time out of the house was less likely, after the course of 2 years my time spent playing the PlayStation started to increase slowly in ways of playing every other night or staying a couple hours past 10pm my cut off time, to late to play some extra mission on the new game I was obsessed with. But soon enough I got the next best consul at the time, The Xbox 360. And soon enough my gaming time doubled and not long after that  tripled when I was 15 getting the Xbox 1 , I had developed my gaming habits to the point of staying up till early hours of the morning playing Xbox or stopping myself playing outside with my mates and would instead trap myself in my room having quick scope matches on nuketown and chatting rubbish with some random American guys on COD Black ops 2. It got so bad that I even started now and again getting up 3 hours before school time just to race around liberty city after completing a hard mission on gta 4. 

Then Covid hit, The habit that had already consumed great amounts of my time got even worse when Covid hit, my schedule turned into waking up and playing xbox, consistently completing Franklin and Trevor missions on gta 5 or mastering my UFC skills to the max determined to become an unbeatable fighter, at which point I would play till the evening, I would go out for the rest of the evening (usually the shop)  and would then finish the day cycling my bike past midnight for atleast 2 or 3 hours each night before bed, and the following morning I would pick up on gta where I left off and would do the same again. 

After Covid my habit improved slightly with work uni and spending time with friends,  family the girl and of course the bike taking up a majority of my time. Quickly enough tho my habit took another turn for the worst when I moved away from home to complete my 6 month internship in which I don’t know many people and chilling with the people I would usually hang with being 3 hours away in my home city. So my addiction which i now called it, took up time before and after work including days off with the occasional casual activity like going shop or chilling with work mates. I hardly ride my bike anymore and I don’t spend any time socialising with people which has caused me to become a half hibernating like penguin that has increased  levels of social anxiety and self doubt. My contact with family has become limited as the ‘I’ll call em back after this game’ card is played consistently but is always being disrespected as i always forget and never call them back after finishing the game. And worst of all, I’m worried if I don’t stop I will soon enough be looking back in 2 3 years maybe more wondering where all that time went and being faced with the realisation of all that valuable time being thrown to the fire of that being a gaming addiction. 

So I’m getting rid of my Xbox, in the next 5 months I turn the page to a new life chapter, containing a series of valuable opportunities that I’m scared I will neglect from failing to investing enough time too and instead wasting that time playing race after race on gta 5 online or planning and building my 200k City smegglington on City Skylines. My relationship with gaming which started off 12 years ago as a casual activity had now become a monster, My mind that deep down wants to banish this addiction has finally taken over. 

I have also thought that this is the best time for me to try and quit as next month I go travelling for a month which will force me away from the xbox, almost like a detoxing opportunity. 

I know this is a long rant and thanks for getting this far but I wrote this post to show how bad my gaming habits are and how much they have effected the last 12 years of my life, and to finally ask if anyone has any tips from personal experience with quitting gaming or facing another similar addiction, and any suggestions on how to insure I avoid buying the new Xbox series X  in 2 months time and diving straight back into the dark void of gaming?

zj8d3a,1,2022-12-11,I feel useless,InternationalWay2556,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/zj8d3a/i_feel_useless/,"Hello, I would like to speak a bit about my life.
I've had chronic depression for almost my whole life, ever since I gained consciousness and because I'm in An Arabic country having a mental illness is really frowned upon so people have humiliated me almost my whole life to the point where I can't stand going outside the house not even for a few minutes but life still goes on, I've had my mom taking care of me in terms of mental health but other than that I never really got anything, It always felt I was pushed away from the family in terms of everything like if I wanted help with my studies I would be told to do it myself or if my family ordered food they wouldn't tell me because they don't want to communicate with me, it improved overtime when I started communicating better with the help of doctors, online friends, and anti-depressants medicine.

I'm on my third year of computer science bachelor's degree and I've been in love with coding and how much it gives me imagination of the possibilities of each language, but then these 2 months I've had a friend tell me to work for his brother in an internship as a friend group and it always feels like I'm behind and I can't catch up and I can't express myself well, it's like everyone is absolutely nailing it and going above and beyond and I'm taking my time to do my best but it's not enough, I've had them laughing at me even tho I am finishing what I'm asked for, it just takes longer time for me than others. 
I'm starting to feel like I'm only attending these to hate coding and hate myself for not being better and for thinking about how bad I am for a long time that I stop doing the stuff that I enjoy including spending time online with my friends, I have thought about letting everything go and flying to a different place but because of my origins it's basically impossible.

I like flutter, java, html, css , python, game development, C++, C#. I wake up everyday excited to learn more or just hanging out and playing random online games with friends is enough, but if that's gone then what else do I have

I'm thinking about this now, but I'll wake up in 2 days a little better and start gaining confidence again but the glooming thoughts of it going away is gonna stay on my mind.

I'm sorry If this made you sad, I don't want that for anyone, I just wonder if there will be a future for me where I'll have the self confidence to know that I'm going to be fine, and that I can get a job and finish my studies and go on with my life without feeling shit at every step of the way"
zj8owa,172,2022-12-11,This subreddit is pretty cool,stressed_cs_major,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/zj8owa/this_subreddit_is_pretty_cool/,"People usually hate on r/csMajors being ""toxic"" and all, but I have a different opinion. Just want to thank you guys for being here, sharing your journeys, successes and failures. 

I initially joined this subreddit (on my alt account) when I was a freshman in college. At that point, I didn't even realize the value of internships. As someone in a third world African country, I didn't even realize that big tech companies were within reach. Two years later, I've grown so much as a person and have even gotten the opportunity to travel abroad and intern at a big company, something that I would never have imagined for someone like me. By being part of this community, I have gotten a road map to set up myself for career success. Of course, career and money doesn't make everything better. I still have other deep seated issues, but at least, I'm working on making sure financial hardship won't be one of them. 

This season has been rough for a lot of us, but let's also not forget how far we've come from where we started."

It has not been suitable to my needs, and I'm leaving next fall for industry accounting. The CPA exam..... screw that, it's hard as hell. I used excel skills for pivot tables and have the basic skills for it. I wonder which field in computer science/information systems I can fit in. 

I'm not so huge on programing or a help desk position doing customer service stuff, I'm more fit for working behind the scenes, talking within my team, less-so the public. I have an interest for data analyzing and data trends, my previous internship helped with that. So, which careers could I fall into? A few more years down the line I could be making crucial decisions."

I deleted Outlook at the end of the internship. But now I'm wondering if there was anything else I needed to do to make my ex-employer doesn't have access to anything on my phone.

Im a third year college student studying Information Science. I just recently changed my field of study though, as my freshman and sophomore year I was a Public Health major. 

I’ve come to really love learning network fundamentals and cyber security and have been gaining knowledge on what I need to do in order to pursue a career in this field.  I currently work as an IT Held Desk student in a major department on my campus. I know the basics of Python and I’ve been learning linux, bash scripting, and have really enjoyed doing beginner CTFs. Ive also been studying Net+ and Sec+ resources. Im not sure if I want to take the exam yet but I know that I know that the information and resources provided for studying are very useful and relevant.

I want to participate in an internship because I know that best way to learn is through hands on experience, but due to my transition and me not having any relevant course work I’m wondering how likely am I to even get offered a position. I know that not everyone is looking for a candidate with the most technical skills and that soft skills are a thing too, so what would be the best way to highlight that in my resume?

I was wondering if I could get any tips on good ways to structure my resume, what other resources I need to be looking into in order to show that Im a good candidate, and any other relevant advice.
 
Thank you!"

I think they are good I wrote about wanting to be an astronaut but that I almost couldn't because I'm really short lol. And about how I basically live on my own and provide for myself (thats a huge part of why  my grades are so low). My LORs are like 7/10 Overall I have 2 really good ones (robotics coach and ap cal teacher), 1 good(acadec coach) and 1 eh(counselor). 


I'm so incredibly scared that my grades will disqualify me from all of my top schools, and even though I feel l have alot of extracurricular, having average grades and tests really brings me down and I know it. I do have a hard homelife I hope admissions will take sympathy on, but I truly don't know. Please tell me what you realistically think ;-;"

Anyways pls be very brutally honest, tysm :D

**Demographics:**  
Female, Southeast Asian (proud singaporean &amp; hong konger! anyone else?)  
I go to a competitive public high school in the the Bay Area (yes classic asian moment)

**Hooks/How I can kinda stand out..?**  
US Figure Skating Gold Medalist (not the Olympics, but i got the gold medal for USFSA’s Senior MITF)  
im a competitive snowboarder and skier giant slalom racer*Yes i like winter sports*

**Applied as**: Biomedical Engineering (chose bioengineering if BME wasn’t an option), and I indicated that I wanted to minor in French language and culture.

**SAT:** 1530 (one sitting)

**GPA and Rank:** 3.91 UW, 4.3 W, school doesn’t rank but I assume top 5-7%? My grades lwk sucked in sophomore yr so that dragged my weighted gpa down

**Coursework:** Total of 12 APs including senior year, 3-4 honors

**AP Scores:** Currently taking 5 APs senior year (kms), got a mix of 5s and 4s for previous AP exams..

**Awards:** (didn’t have a lot of academic ones lol)

* Taught weekly coding lessons to middle school students in Jamaica, indonesia, India, US, + canada
* President of my school’s French Club

**Essays/LORs/Interview:**

Im fully aware that my stats and ap scores are bit below avg for t10s and ivies so i knew my essays would be my only saving grace here so i kinda put a lot of effort in my essays LMAO

My common app was abt my experience as a figure skater and somehow connected it to research.

For supplements, or why majors, I wrote about how my brother grew up with 20+ allergies and I would always take care of him =&gt; learned to use epipens when I was only 5 =&gt; interest in medical devices =&gt; wanted to improve medical devices =&gt; BME summer research program =&gt; interest biomedical engineering.

I also highlighted another thing kinda unique abt me ig? I wrote about my interest in languages (I speak 4 and am learning 2 others).

I took a unique twist to this essay by writing about my experiences growing up in a multilingual community with clashing cultures. I spent 1 year in Hong Kong, 2 years in Belgium where I was the only asian within a 50 mile radius, and then I came back to the bay area where my whole school is asian.

This essay was mostly used for the “intellectual vitality” or “describe your community you come from” or “describe ur culture” type of questions.

**LORs**:

Teachers: (\~8/10?) not rly sure but i think they’lljust be alright. I go to a big school so my counselor barely knows me, so it’ll prob be a basic standard letter. Also, i go to a public school so teachers dont give a shit abt writing good letters soooo uh i think they’ll just be mid LOL

Research Mentor: (10/10) I had my Stanford research mentor write one so I think that’ll probably be the only good letter. I was very close to her and I feel like she really got to know me and how I work. (my only hope lmfao)

**Interview:**

(-10/10): I did REA to Princeton and holy shit my interview went TERRIBLE. Not even joking, the alumni interviewing me seemed like she rather be sleeping than talking to be (i feel you) but seriously I felt like I was gonna cry near the end of the interview since it was so awkward and she sounded so tired and I felt like I just annoyed her the whole time. whatever.

**Schools**:

**Early**

Princeton (REA) help it’s literally coming out in less than a week i’m gonna cry

Purdue (EA)

Georgia Tech (EA2)

Umich (EA)

UIUC (EA)

My princeton decision is literally coming out in less than a week and I feel like I’m gonna shit myself just thinking abt it. i have finals on the day Pton comes out and im lwk just expecting a rejection. I’m gonna be more surprised if they accepted me since my interview went so terribly.

zjprch,3,2022-12-12,Can any qualtrics swe interns from last summer share their experience?,Hyroas,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/zjprch/can_any_qualtrics_swe_interns_from_last_summer/,"I’ve gone through the interview process with qualtrics and I believe I’ve got a really good shot at their summer 23 swe internship in seattle. However, I recently got an email that their hiring freeze has extended to interns and I won’t hear an update until January. I know that the hiring freeze has also affected return offers for last year’s interns as well.

I also have an offer from JPMC (wilmington, DE location) that I’ve accepted. However, if given the offer in January from qualtrics, I’d overall rather work there for a number of reasons (I personally like seattle over wilmington and it has more opportunities as a tech hub, qualtrics seems to have a better work life balance and engineering culture - at their seattle office at least, I align more with their values, and they have much higher growth potential in terms of promotions and pay raise than JPMC over time even when factoring cost of living).

If it were before the tech burst, I’d renege on JPMC for qualtrics in a heartbeat, but now I’m concerned that even if I’m offered the internship for the summer (it doesn’t seem like they’d rescind so I’m not worried about that), that a hiring freeze or more competitive return offer ratio might mean I won’t get a full time offer after the summer. Another thing though, is that qualtrics doesn’t seem to be doing layoffs or anything so not worried about that either.

Anyone care to share their experience with qualtrics specifically, their thoughts on the state of tech after this summer, or what they would do in this situation?"

I’ve completed internships as a data analyst and risk analyst at banks and have built reports, dashboards and forecasts with Tableau, Excel, Power Query and R. I also worked on a ML pipeline and trading bot in Python through hackathons.

Most DE jobs require extensive YOE and I know I don’t have that so I plan to develop the skills through projects on the job. Previously, I pushed to get involved in projects that I liked and found valuable at work, so I’m plan to continue doing the same even if my first job is not DE related.

I’m looking to move into the DE field as soon as possible and was looking to enrol in useful online courses/certificates or degrees. Or even create my own side project. Any suggestions on where I should get started."

zjsiiq,2,2022-12-12,Fundamental concepts for Computer Science,arityy,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/zjsiiq/fundamental_concepts_for_computer_science/,"I am currently in my 3rd year pursuing a computer science degree. I have been applying for internships in hopes I can get one during summer. I have gotten a couple of interviews and every single one of them I failed. I understand that failure is inevitable and that I should take this opportunity to learn from my mistakes. The only issue is I know my mistakes but I am so lost that its starting to hurt me, I am losing motivation and I seriously don't have anywhere to turn to. I was hoping that maybe,Reddit could help me, so here I am. There has been a lot I have been thinking about and my main concerns are I am no where near the level I should be at for an average 3rd year cs student. I know that I shouldnt compare but its so hard not to, all my classes I am below average and I spend so much time every day studying and yet I am under performing. My second biggest concern, soon to be first as time goes on, my foundation. I started university with 0 experience, I learned from the courses I took and I feel like I forgot everything. I have these concerns for the past year now.

The funny part to all this is, one of the interviews I did (roughly 1 month ago), I was stopped in the middle of the interview by the interviewer and he straight up told me that I dont know anything at all. I dont have any foundation at all and that I have no skill in computer science. As harsh as it may seem, that interview was my favourite, it opened my eyes. I officially consider myself a failure as I wasted the past 3 years learning nothing. However, the interview also gave me hope and motivation. I know its not too late, I know I'm not a failure, I know I can do cs. I want to learn. I enjoy cs a lot despite me being bad at it. So after the long context, my question is, what are the fundamental concepts of computer science that I should know to build a strong foundation. During the 3 years of my cs journey, I know some stuff but everything seems so ""blurry."" If that made any sense... for example, I know what object oriented programming is but if someone asked me a question more specific to oop, I dont think I would be able to answer. 

I was hoping if someone could list most of the fundamental concepts so that I can start learning them and have a stronger foundation to cs

Thank you for reading all that :) and I really appreciate all the help!"

zjvgta,11,2022-12-12,How to get a CS career started without connections or several years of experience? Entry-level is about pure luck otherwise.,CoolbreezeFromSteam,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/zjvgta/how_to_get_a_cs_career_started_without/,"It's been two years since I've gotten my degree (B.S. in 'Computer and Info. Tech.'), and I've honestly been trying a lot to make it work because it's stressed me out greatly. The problem is, my small 'internship' doesn't seem to cut it, nor do my projects, and although I've gotten feedback saying my resume looks alright, I get no interviews.

I apply to remote and physically located roles, locally, and nationally. In a spreadsheet I've been using to record my applications, I've recently surpassed 1000 submissions to a massive list of companies big and small (I have so many accounts on myworkdayjobs...). When I was under the impression I possessed a TS/SCI clearance (I may still have Secret), even that didn't do much, regardless of the fact that's a big plus to straight-up have that for positions that need it.

I don't just apply to SDE roles strictly, or any specific type of company. I stopped being particular about things pretty quick after I started my job hunt. Part of the reason it's been two years is because I was planning to join a branch of the military as an officer and going through the pipeline for that with the Navy in that first year, so I wasn't putting too much of a focus on starting a CS career.

So at the moment, I've tapped the few connections I have to try to get help, yet no interview, and I still don't have any more relevant experience, especially because the place I live (in Indiana) doesn't really have great opportunities for me as far as tech jobs relating to SDE.

Do you guys have any advice for trying to land something? There's a decent chance I might've tried it already, but I'm still just trying to make it work because I don't want those 4 years and all that money to have been a waste, you know? If I can ever manage to get it, it'll be a world a stress of my shoulders.

I am struggling with life, how do I handle it? 4 months ago I got a new full time job that I was so thrilled for, it’s an amazing internship where I learn so much from my amazing supervisor. I feel so lucky to have the position but there are so many moments in the day where I feel out of place. It is a school for kids with autism and although I am extremely intrigued to learn more and want to work with the kids as a behavior therapist, I am a huge introvert when it comes to social settings. I have worked with children with ASD before but I was not a fan of private clinics as I felt isolated, therefore I wanted to work at a school. Working at the school now, I am having a hard time connecting with the kids as I don’t get much 1:1 time and it’s hard for me to “prove” myself, which I know I’m capable of doing but I still just feel so new and there’s been some encounters from teachers almost barking orders at me and so many other therapists in the room watching me which makes me extremely uncomfortable. On top of that, I’m enrolled in an online masters program which I’m barely keeping up with ever since I started working full time. After work I pick up my daughter from day care, go home, make dinner, clean, have some wine, get her ready for bed, and pretty much go to bed with her as I am exhausted and I prefer to go to bed early and wake up early to finish any laundry or catch up on homework before work before taking my kid to daycare and going to work. I have weekends off so it’s nice and I try to get homework done, but then there is also problems with my daughters dad. He is horrible to me, bitter, jealous, always texting me paragraphs talking down to me and how I’m a horrible mother that doesn’t spend time with her daughter. I try to stay strong but I have guilt of not spending as much time with her anymore as my time is limited with work and school. Her dad takes her some Sundays but there’s always so much problems that come with it and it throws off my whole day. I know he’s good to my daughter, she loves her dad. But I can’t deal with the mental abuse. I have two years left of the master program and the internship.. and then if I sit for the boards and pass I will be set, but I’m worried it won’t happen because I’m struggling so hard to keep up with everything, and I’ve been having doubts at work wether I really am a good fit there. At home I live with my parents so it helps but I’m still so behind on everything in life and I find myself breaking down at least once a week. I’m disorganized and miserable.. and I just want to have my sh!t together already, at least somewhat."

December 16, 2021, 1900ET ---- a moment that supposedly has the power to change lives. In spiking adrenaline level and beating heart, I opened the portal of University of Pennsylvania, and… shall we say, the graphical greetings of blue and red wasn’t there. Instead, I was presented a few paragraphs of perhaps the coldest, cruelest and most heartbreaking words that could have been presented to somebody of my position. The table my laptop sat on became my victim for the next half-hour or so; or, more accurately, my right fist became my victim, because the table is much sturdier than what I can smash apart. 

The next 36 hours became living agony. Years of study, of working in supermarkets, labs, clubs and everywhere else possible, of de facto living with a single parent, of transition across cultures as a first-generation immigrant, of anything that I have done well of or any positive sentiments I have accumulated, have been conveniently wiped out some random persons ---- two of them, in fact: I have no reason to believe my application even made committee ---- all within minutes. I lay in bed, doing nothing productive or of value; my parents’ attempts to cheer me was returned by enraged shouts of “shut up!”, an act that I know I couldn’t have avoided but which I regretted ever since. “You are f--king useless!” “Why are you here?” “Look at your peers landing the finest schools ---- what are you doing?” “TAMU \[1\] and UTD \[2\] sure suck :)” Thoughts of this nature continue to magnify themselves nonstop, leading to perhaps the most tortuous day in my memory.

Strangely enough, by the time I woke up to my next rejection on Dec. 18, I have somewhat moved on from that. Am I still sad? Yes; am I still infuriated enough to give Philadelphia a shower of SS-25s and DF-41s \[3\]? Also yes, except I don’t get to. But do I still lay in bed in visible pain and agony, looking like a patient on hospice care? No, not anymore, for a thought has formed in me. I spoke to my counselor, discussing prospects of the “take-two” round (ED2/RD), which I have placed so much hope to avoid just 48 hours ago; but well, since it’s unavoidable, I may as well embrace it. I found my energy rejuvenated, my aim restored, this time targeted towards elsewhere.

In retrospect, the “elsewhere” mattered little ---- I found my place in their rejection pile alike. But the greater value of that idea is really the motivating component, that I am not “done for”, and that the cycle is not over yet, and that I can still take initiative to change the situation. This motivation ---- well, plus the fee waiver, if you insist ---- became the basis upon which I inched through perhaps the longest winter break in my life, filling it with application after application to place after place. Towards the end of that process, it almost become what internet users call “copium”, where the act of researching and applying to places become a coping mechanism against the suffocating stress and self-deprecation. It is neither healthy nor effective college-app wise, but it shed light into the many dark nights I counted through.

The good news eventually arrived; came late January, I was finally given positive news to places of my desire, thus ending the excruciating suspense on me. If you choose a positive narrative, I have since gone on to successfully secure and excel on a variety of jobs, with a vibrant life that brings me to organizations, social circles and destinations across the continent ---- but that omits the days of agony, of dread, and of striving for the dimmest glimmer of light in seemingly boundless darkness that have propelled me to move on, to grow, and to achieve.

In retrospect, I must fundamentally claim the majority of the responsibility in this process. The essays are, to put kindly, gacky at the least, failing to address the key points exhibited in any sound writings. Nor have I recognized the level of competitiveness to expect, adjusting plans accordingly: a dangerous degree of self-hypnosis must have taken place. But nevertheless, I still choose to recognize that rejection as a setback and not a destructive change, not only because I can’t conveniently destroy Philadelphia as those two lads destroyed my vision of Philadelphian life, but also because I recognized the potential of attempts, of moving on from where I fell, a lesson that proved useful. Internship search never proved easy for me ---- has it ever proven easy to anyone? ---- and when the one interview I received returned a negative, I knew what I had to do then. Two months from that rejection and about 50 more applications later, I was officially onboarded by somewhere else that I know I will also greatly enjoy working in.

Such is the power of setbacks: it can and will crush you. However, you get to control your share of the power too. Do you want the crushing force to transform yourself into a better, stronger being, or do you want to remain as some crushed dust, forever blown away? It is up to you. May you make the right choice. \[4\]

Notes:

\[1\]. Texas A&amp;M University is not actually bad ---- it certainly provides a quality of education that benefits me. However, for a number of reasons, ranging from their engineering admission system that requires lengthy degree completion despite my large number of dual-enrolled credit to undesirable location, I was not too welcome to the prospect of going to TAMU.

\[2\]. I wasn't too happy of the prospect of going to UTD due to its high cost of attendance after accounting for eligible grants and a resentment of going to “that safety at home”. In retrospect, the cost of attendance could be cut down by staying at home and expediting the degree, but these options were not given full justice in my fury.

Please understand that this is fundamentally a rhetorical technique, and that I have great friends who attend University of Pennsylvania ---- I am not nuking places, I promise.

\[4\]. Importantly, please do not go on to blindly spam applications. This is not my intention, and when I did that, it did not work well. Still pour your heart and thoughts into things you write and do; but keep in mind that not everyone will recognize it and it’s their fault if they miss it."
zk5jbu,5,2022-12-12,Non-traditional (Nursing Ph.D. Student),BurntoutATL,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/zk5jbu/nontraditional_nursing_phd_student/,"*I appreciate your willingness to read my profile and story, as it is long. Please know that I am not applying until 2024 or 2025. My goal in this post is to get feedback on my profile and questions so that I can improve my application.*

**Work experience:**

\-One year experience as a COVID ICU nurse (large teaching hospital in the Midwest)

\-One and a half years of research coordinator work on an FDA NIH study (major Midwest university)

\-Will have 3 to 4 years as a fully compensated Ph.D. student (scholarship + stipend is 115k/year)

\-Will have a healthcare administrative internship this coming summer

**Education:**

\-Undergrad: BS in Nursing, 4.0 GPA at a public state school

\-First-year nursing Ph.D. student at a top 3 research intensive nursing school (T20 university).

\-Have yet to take the GMAT as I am trying to formulate a plan

**Extras:**

Undergraduate: One published article, 20+ dissemination activities, worked on five research projects, was president of my undergraduate nursing programs association for men in nursing org, vice-president of my undergraduate nursing honors society (Sigma), lead nursing mentoring program, and a nurse leader scholar.

Ph.D.: Will have multiple pubs by the time I apply, graduate research coordinator and teaching assistant (leadership courses), in the process of starting an advanced degree consulting club, strong connection to a major hospital system (working with CNO, CNE, and other hospital admins), allowed to take select MBA courses and other healthcare business courses as my Ph.D. electives (T25 b-school), and a future leader scholar.

**Background:**

I graduates with my BSN in 2020 and headed straight into the COVID ICU, thinking I was starting my dream job. Unfortunately, it turned it a nightmare shortly after I started, as I encountered numerous workforce issues and witnessed the impact of these issues on other nurses. Staffing, organizational support, and resources were non-existent Furthermore, I had extreme difficulties with the mental and physical impacts of my time at the bedside during COVID. Watching nurse veterans crying in the halls, watching families say goodbye over facetime, and seeing more death than I could have ever imagined. These impacts resulted in my decision to leave the bedside after roughly a year of work to pursue research and leadership opportunities. I started my Ph.D. program with the sole goal of advocating for the nursing workforce. My dissertation will focus on nursing burnout, nurse staffing, and healthcare economics. I will be conducting a cross-sectional secondary data analysis of nurse data (nurse well-being surveys or nurse staffing) and hospital-acquired infections, then calculating hospital and societal attributable costs associated with the relationship.

**Why an MBA and my goal:**

Nurses make up 2% of all healthcare system board members, according to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. The literature and my anecdotal experience confirms that nursing is underrepresented at the executive level in comparison to business and medicine. My goal is to work in a c-suite environment in a hospital system to fight and advocate for the nursing workforce. I believe that an MBA will equip me with the leadership, management, and financial skills I need to complete my skill set. Additionally, an MBA provides me with a broader scope of opportunities than a DNP in leadership or MHA may provide (potential of healthcare entrepreneurship education). My nursing experience, research abilities, and business/leadership knowledge will enable me to achieve my short- and long-term professional goals.

**Dream opportunity:**

Wharton’s HCMG major, Fuqua’s HSM concentration (especially since I have connections at UPenn and Duke nursing), and Kellogg (healthcare pathway) 

**Other schools of interest:** T15 + Goizueta, WashU, and Vandy

**Questions:**

\-Is a two-year MBA program post-Ph.D. the best option or should I look at one-year MBA programs?

\-My WE is non-traditional and may be seen as a negative, is there anything I can do to be a better applicant?

\-Has anyone experienced schools that look down on Ph.D. experience and do not consider it work experience?

\-Thoughts on my lack of brand name undergraduate university? I choose my undergrad because I had a full-ride and every BSN is the same as they are preparing you for NCLEX (boards)

\-Depending on my GMAT (I know the sub doesn’t like giving advice without GMAT scores), are these schools feasible?

&amp;#x200B;

I have been unemployed for a few months now after graduating undergrad with a physics degree this summer. I didn't know what to do after graduation but I quickly found Data Analytics and saw it as a good fit for my needs, so I started self studying by taking a crash course on SQL and learning Tableau on YouTube. I have a small portfolio to showcase SQL skills but ill be honest my portfolio is not worthy of submitting with an application (I need to make more robust content).

I live in Chicago but I have mostly been applying to remote jobs. I have had zero success with DA and other SQL related jobs I have applied to, not even a single email or phone call after many many many applications. I know that I am not as qualified as someone with a masters degree or a few years experience but I cant even get my foot in the door. I have had two or three networking ideas but they all ended up not being a good fit for my needs (location, job type, etc).

I dont have any relevant experience but I did two physics internships in college and I have a long work history at part time jobs, some of which I gained professional experience at such as the fundamental soft skills, how to organize groups of people, leadership, etc. 

I recently had my HR friend help me with my resume and I have been working a little bit every day to learn SQL and to try to gain some skills that are applicable. I am desperately asking for any advise on how to get my foot in the door and how to get a company to take a little bit of a risk on me. Any suggestions are welcome. If you need any more info please ask in the comments. Thank you."

But now I'm working as a Java software engineer, the job I've always wanted, and I do love my current job, but I feel like so much effort was wasted in college since I never wanted to study engineering at all. And even if I did want to work in that field, there are no opportunities for my field of study where I live.


The degree did help me land a job faster, I basically learned java at home and got accepted to an internship pretty quick, since software companies here ask for degrees in computer-related fields.


It was a challenging, yet fun journey, but it's sad that I won't get to work in the computer engineering field."

We had an extremely close relationship and I excelled both academically in intellectually within his close, and when I talked to him briefly about my NYU supplemental essay he touched on how what I mentioned in that tied in well with what he had written in my letter. 

Was also able to submit a letter from one of my employers at my management job. This letter I was able to read and was extremely strong not only due to being very detailed and well written but because I was very fortunate that the person who wrote it is a management consultant at a Fortune 500 company and goes into some of my strengths and perspectives when it comes to business and as a person in general. 

For schools that took 2 teacher Rex’s I also received one from French teacher of all 4 years which I expect to be 7-8/10, definitely good ideas but she’s not the strongest writer or anything.

**Essays**: * CommonApp essay was about my journey from getting cut my freshman year of soccer to becoming one of two varsity captains in my senior year but with a twist. Essay is threaded by my love for the song we can work it out by the beetles as a child and finding out why the song resonated so deeply with me (because it was always just a vehicle for me to harness my own intrinsic resilience) * NYU diversity supplement was about how where I live especially being a minority in the type of place I live, the concept of the renaissance man and someone with an intrinsic motivation to just learn is constantly suppressed and not aloud to flourish but in a community like that of NYU I would be aloud to embrace this aspect of myself I’ve felt I’ve always had to suppress (letter of ref from English teacher ties in as he told me in my letter how mentioned how I was someone you could have an intellectual conversion about anything with) Overall pretty all over the place application. I’m completely at terms with the fact that NYU is probably wishful thinking but figured it wouldn’t hurt to ask some opinions. I was struggling with motivation my freshman and sophomore year which is why my academics are lacking, never failed a class or anything but did not set myself up to be in the position I want to be.

The first thing to think of, is of course my resume. But it has been approved by the coop office at my school, so I'd imagine it should be ok. That said, if get a chance to annonymize it, I might post it here.

I work currently as what we call Software Engineer, but this is not my true occupation. The R&amp;D subjects are robotics, computer vision, machine learning and mobile.

I work on development, supporting customers, and discussing with customers what we must focus on to achieve their goals. These customers are not technical people, so I have to do a lot of explaining to them about complex concepts. Currently, this is not a problem. I'm ok with this.

The problem is the following, I work as a developer and as a ""Product Owner"" for a customer, let us call customer A. And as a Manager of two engineers in a totally different product for customer B. Also, I work as a Manager of two engineers in a third project that is also different from the other two, for customer C.

The problem is that customer A doesn't know that I work on other projects. Customers B and C also don't know. Customer A asks me a lot of things all day. Furthermore, I have to attend meetings with potential customers of his. And this customer A consumes almost 90% of my time. And the reason they don't know that I'm involved with other projects is that my bosses sold me, and the other employees, as full-time developers.

In addition, in the company that I work for, I also have to correct admission exams for hiring new members. I have to schedule technical interviews every week.

zkl5ed,2,2022-12-12,United Nations Internships are a Nightmare.,UNthrowaway111,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/zkl5ed/united_nations_internships_are_a_nightmare/,"I work full-time as a paid intern for a United Nations agency, and I currently have 40$ on my bank account.

Most of my groceries come from local food banks, as my ~~salary~~ monthly stipend only covers my rent and about two weeks of groceries. I tried to ""make-do"", as most of my peers have. I got a second and a third job during the weekend, I stopped eating meat, I started eating more rice, potatoes, popcorn for dinner. I stopped going out almost altogether, save for free events or when my friends offered to pay. 

Also, because I didn't really have any free time. I was always working. 

During the weekend, I would work until late on my second and third jobs, and the second I got home I just crashed in bed. During the week, I got to the office at 8:30am and usually left at around 7pm, 6pm if I was lucky. Not that I was ever paid overtime. Working as an intern for UN agencies you get paid a set amount, no matter how much work you do. 

Doing the math, the US$1000 of the monthly stipend only amount to about US$6.25 per hour accounting for a 40h work week. Not that I was ever able to work 40h. If I did the same math for the 55h that I worked last week, I'm only paid about US$4.50 per hour.

But I'm thankful. I know it will look great on my resumé. My friends make fun of me because I'm always so excited about my job. I love the topics that we cover, I feel like I'm making a difference, and nothing could be so fulfilling. I was a huge Model UN nerd growing up, and I dreamed about being where I am right now since I was 15.

I'm an immigrant in the country I am in right now, and whenever my family calls they are so, so proud of me. My family doesn't have a lot of money, but they help me out when they can, saving every bit to help the pride of the family. I don't have the words to tell them what I am going through right now.

I'm tired, and constantly hungry.

And the icing on the cake? I just got a message from another intern I befriended, working in HQ, that this month's payments will be late because the Finance department was on a retreat.

Not only am I paid near nothing, but the organization doesn't have enough respect to pay me on time. Talking to other interns, you hear stories of people who only got paid their ~~poverty~~ wages on the 25th, 29th of the month.

**It's FRUSTRATING**. A UNITED NATIONS agency, an organization that sets out to help people all around the world, has no respect to the people who do most of the work. And you know what? I promise you my bosses, supervisors, and non-intern coworkers will be paid on time. It's not like I have any need for it, right? It's not like I have bills to pay, rent, hydro, groceries. Why would I need to feed myself, exist as a person at all.

I feel drained, cheated, tired. I just got home from work, it's 9pm.

Again, I'm very, very grateful. The opportunity is incredible. I was able to meet people I never thought I could. I was able to participate in projects I had only ever read about in books, and actually improve them. I am able to go forward with a gold star on my resumé, an experience that stands out, differentiates me. I love my job, I really, really do. And I'm good at it. I talk with pride about my experience because that's how I feel like I am expected to talk about it. Because I am scared of the backlash of sounding ungrateful, of being blacklisted in my industry, of not being taken seriously because there are so many other stories of intern strikes and complaints that didn't lead anywhere.

But I just don't know how I'll be able to afford my rent this month.

Best to all, hope someone hears me.

I'm currently in university for a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I had planned to study Game development, but there is virtually no place in this country that offers it, so I had to opt for this. I currently don't have a lot of experience in the field, but I am taking online courses (mainly YouTube Courses, but whatever) and am in touch with an old professor who is a games developer, who said he'll let me intern in his company.

In all honesty, the reason I'm even making this post is that ... I'm trying to find someplace to pursue my sexuality, Other than my best friend and a university therapist I go to, nobody knows about this, especially the 100+ relatives in my combined family. And with good reason to: it isn't specifically discussed or talked about,  and the laws here do not allow it either, but if someone is found to be gay, they can be jailed for life, if their own families don't kill them, anyways.

I would also like advice on how to move to that specific country, what kind of sanctuary they will offer, plus how much it could potentially cost me, so that I can create a road map for myself."

I have been faced with circumstances which are very very bad. I will not reveal any names of course but everything I say is true. Please read the full text because every little detail is important

I am in a certain Mtech college. I was supposed to start my project in August 2022 and end by May 2023 as all other students do. Then I got an internship opportunity from a so called 'Big company' and they offered me a 'No stipend' internship but they were going to give me an Mtech project thesis and full help to do it with their company resources. Now physically the company was very very far from my home and I couldn't rent a room closer to it because my mom's health was very bad. So I made my daily commute which took 2 hours for going and 2 hours for coming back. 

The problems started within the first month as their machine which was going to arrive in 15 days never arrived. Then on top of it, by the second month I discovered that the person in charge was the ONLY member of that particular department and he seemed to have no interest in furthering the project. He also had OTHER JOBS in other departments so he didn't even have time to attend to this project. Furthermore the project was a greenfield one(ie, starting from zero) and thus they did not have any clients nor any plans for what to do. However I thought at that point in late August that when the machine would come, the project would start. My daily commute to their company made me so physically exhausted that I wasn't able to do any work on the project outside of my time in the company(on top of that I also had to complete lots of University assignments, presentations, curses and exam studies in my free time). 

My college guide worsened the problem. He is on a very high administrative position and so seldom has the time to look into matters of my project. Lets just frankly say he is quite useless as compared to my collegue's guides who are very competent and help their mentees with their projects on a daily or weekly basis. Also just the process of meeting him always takes up half a day as I have to always wait hours and hours for him to arrive.

Under these circumstances I decided to ask him in September if I should change my project. But he was adamant about continuing the company project and told me that it is not possible to do an in-house project this year. I managed to fullfill the requirements for my first review in mid September by doing literature review but the situation just didn't improve. So I trudged on. The machine didn't come. It didn't come in September, October, November and it hasn't come till now.

The so called 'big company' has no plans, no clients and no vision on any project let alone an Mtech thesis which requires atleast a degree of originality. 

In October it finally dawned on me that if the project had to be done then I would have to take some extra steps. I tried to do simulations but they all failed miserably. There was just no literature available for doing what I had to do and nobody at this so called 'big company' knew how to do it. They were all useless. 

So by late October I started contacting various outsiders and freelancers who could do some things for me in exchange for money.  However even after intense work they could not do it and morever they told me that usually companies which do this kind of work have entire research teams dedicated to it. He was surprised to know that my company only had one person and one intern and the one person in charge was also working for other departments.

So in November I finally started pestering my college guide for taking up another project. He resisted a lot and attempted to hook me up with another professor who he thought could help me do the project but as it turned out, even that professor had no idea on what to do so I ditched him an. Remember that at this time I was under intense pressure and my second review(where they expect you to have completed 50% of your project work) was mere days away. I could not afford to wait for people like him. 

Eventually after extreme pressuring, my college guide agreed to give me a project that was 'half completed' by some bachelor students. I took it and then gave a short review on it to somehow pass my second review.

But as it turns out, the Bachelor students have not even done 10% of the work and now I am stuck herein mid December(I had to study for final exams in the time between my second review and today) with a project thats not even half completed. Other students have already completed a huge chunk of their projects, a guide which doesn't have the time to help me and my project end date is 6 months away.

I HAVE TO DO AN MTECH PROJECT IN 6 MONTHS!!!  


To summarize 

1)Company: Only one person in charge of project. Machine delayed by 7 months. The oen person has lots of work in other fields. Has no interest in my project, does not ever read or study the papers I send him and knows much much elss about the topic than me, an intern. Company has no plans for a project let alone a hefty Mtech thesis but they also don't give me stipend. And of course my 4 hours commute.   

2)College guide: Very busy man. Have to wait hours to even see his face. Doesn't ever help me directly in the project and many times doesn't even remember what project I am doing exactly.   

3)Current status: Am working on a new in house project. I have just started it. Only have 6 months. Am very depressed and feel like this is an uphill task. I hate my life now. HELP ME."

zkpf2b,58,2022-12-13,Bachelor's in Biology to Master's in Data Analytics. Accepted $90K Offer + Performance Bonus at an Major Bulge Bracket Investment Bank.,chenj38,dataanalysis,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/zkpf2b/bachelors_in_biology_to_masters_in_data_analytics/,"**TLDR**: Did my BS in Biology, Withdraw from Optometry School, Enroll back to my college's Master in DA, Apply to Summer Internship very early, Apply to Full time Job early on, 7 Interview Invites, 1 Job Offer. Copy  of my resume at the bottom.

# Intro

This is not a brag post and I hope my experience helped someone deciding to transition into a new field and on the fence on doing a Masters or not.

I graduated with my BS in Biology a couple of years ago when the pandemic was in a full swing. I was accepted to an Optometry School and was planning to attend after graduation. Unfortunately, they announced that they were changing the modality to Online and I didn't think it was worth paying $65K a year, for 4 years, just to be saturated with debt to be an Optometrist. After some research, I did decided to enroll back into my Alma Mater in their Masters Program in Data Analytics.

&amp;#x200B;

# Master Program

I am no way a scholar student. I had a 3.2 GPA in Biology and withdrew from Chemistry and Organic Chemistry classes before passing with a B-. I noticed my college had a evening Masters program in DA. Strangely, it stated that you could complete the Pre-Reqs the same time as you complete the Core Master Courses. I had almost no experience in Excel, or any programming at all so I was hesitant to enroll. After talking to the graduate counselor, I decided to enroll into the program which took me 3 semesters to finish.

The program was a little bit weird. It was set up for people who have absolute no experience to people that have experience in the field. Languages use were SQL, R, and Python. You could even take electives and learn to use SAS. There was some classes I took that taught advanced Data Mining methods (Neural Network, Association Rule, Clustering etc.). I was expose to using STATA and some Tableau for at least one of my courses. Honestly, it felt more like a Data Science program versus an Data Analytics program. While I took a Pre-Req and an Advanced course in SQL which I had a solid understanding in, but the Python and R Course was pretty lacking. They taught the course with the understanding that the class was a mixture of language proficiency. They didn't teach the very basics and the homework + exams were just changing variables and numbers around. I could look at the code and explain what the code was doing but if you ask me to write it from scratch, I could not do it.

Overall it was an okay Program. They started the program about 4 years ago and definitely were trying to fix the curriculum around to see what worked and not. 50% of the professors that taught this course had full time jobs on the side. It was nice hearing how the stuff we learned in class and which how they apply it to their day job.

&amp;#x200B;

# Internship

I knew from the very start, if I want to find a full time job, I needed some experience. The most impactful way to get one is getting a Summer Internship. If I learn anything about grad school's rolling admission is to APPLY EARLY, longer you wait, the less spots available and harder to get one.  I only started applying 3-4 weeks after I started the Program. I had a great resume back from applying to Optometry School and all I added was a Project section which was some Homework assignment that I did. Surprisingly I did not have to send that much applications out before receiving invites for interviews. I had a solid list of shadowing and various leadership experience. During my talk with recruiters, they were more interested in my soft skills and experience doing other things versus hard technical skills.

    ~30 Applications Sent
    3 Interview Invites
    2 Offers
    1 Rejection

The Offer I accepted was a Fortune 200 manufacturing company paying **$26 an hour**. I applied on their website and the Intern posting was for a Undergraduate student but I manage to score the Offer as a Master's student. During my time, I learn a lot of things. Such as Agile Method, Different Technology Stacks, Communicating with different Orgs, etc. I did a real life project and presented my finding to the entire Division.

To make it short, I received a great Performance review and met my OKR's but.......

I did not received a Full Time offer at the end of the Internship. Even though I did great and the other interns thought I would get one. They wanted someone to hit the ground running with more of an Statistic Background and the couple of courses in Statistics was not cutting it. I also didn't know back then what was a XGBoost or Random Forest was (now I know now lol). I was thinking they wanted someone as a Data Scientist which I definitely did not qualify for.

&amp;#x200B;

# The Job Hunt and Offer

I was disappointed that I didn't receive a return offer but at least I had something that I could showcase on my resume, *Experience*. I started to apply for full time positions right after the Internship and oh boy that was a challenge. Took me 3 months of applying every week to finally receive a fulltime offer. I had an okay ratio for interview invites to application sent. Invites from anywhere from Consulting, Insurances, Retail, Healthcare, and Finance field. I applied mostly on LinkedIn, Company Website, and even the College Job Fairs.

    ~250-300+ Applications 
    7 Interview Invites
    2 Ghosted
    2 Declined
    1 Position Cancelled
    1 Rejection
    1 Offer Extended

I knew the economic slowdown and hiring freezes were not looking into my favor. This was my last semester of the Masters and the constant rejection had me a little depressed. One day, I was looking to see at a one particular Bank on the progress of my application of a job role I applied. I noticed there was a Data Analyst job posting the same day on Workday. Read the job description and I hit some basic qualifications (SQL, Six Sigma, Communication, etc.). I did not know what the hell was MicroStrategy or have coding experience in SAS but I apply anyway because I didn't have anything to lose.

A week later I received a call from HR and went trough 4 rounds of interview. I had great discussions with VP and a Manager. I tried to make the interview very conversational since I would be working with them directly. I think what stood out for me was my interest in the Financial Space. I had a interested in Stocks, Financial Market, and Personal Finance. We even talked about Charlie Munger and his ideologies. They also liked that I had experience taking something technical and reducing it down to some understandable from a nontechnical viewpoint. Also my experience talking with stakeholders was a big plus. My technical interview was a little joke compared to a Data Science Case interview I did with a Three Letter Consulting company that I absolutely bombed. They asked me What is a Where Clause, Explain a Subquery, What is a Difference between Inner/Right/Left Join and a Example. I would use mostly SQL which I was good at and they actually have learning cohorts onsite to teach me Python and SAS which was a big plus. 2 hours later on my fourth round, I received a phone call with an offer.

    $90k + Performance Bonus. Amazing Health + Wealth Benefits. 4 weeks PTO and 10 Sick Days. 

I did not negotiate because I didn't have any leverage and it was wayyy more than I was making now. I also dreamed of working in the Financial Market and will be in a Division involving the Global Market.

&amp;#x200B;

# Final Thought and Future Plans

I would still recommend doing a Masters even with it's flaws. I know most Master program, such as this, are cash cows to make money for the School. Majority of my classmates were International Students paying full price and the other half are currently working and their company are paying for it.

I knew that I did not have the discipline to complete a Google Certification or DataCamp. Tuition was pricey but they gave me a 7% discount of tuition for a returning student (LMAO). Looking at past classmates LinkedIn, majority of them worked as Data Analyst and eventually as Data Scientist or Data Engineers.

If I would recommend anything, definitely have an outstanding resume, practice interviews, and communicate efficiently. I am a Introvert so I absolute hate doing Presentations and get anxious talking to people but it gets better slowly.

I know people would not recommend doing a Master's especially if you have no experience but at the end, it worked out for me. My future plan's is hopefully get into the Data Engineering field. I enjoy working with the databases and had a great relationship talking to the DE at the internship or even maybe a Sales Engineer lol.

It reminded me of my freshman year where we had a Christmas potluck too, but I also felt nothing and had no one to hang out with. I remember freshman year that I wanted to be top of  my class and craft a solid application for top UC schools and t-20's. However, now during my senior year, I have no motivation to do anything. It is finals weeks and I have a frustrating C in both Pre-calculus and AP Physics 2. No matter how much I study I still get really bad grades on the test and I do not know if getting a C will affect my admissions chances or if I will risk getting rescinded if I apply to a UC or t-20 as a computer science major. Throughout my years, I was super ambitious and ready to be part of something greater and to really be phenomenal, but no matter my efforts, it has shown to be worthless and I barely even achieved anything. I guess I am not good enough to get into a UC or good enough to earn strong grades in classes that matter. I had never gotten a C before but this year I got a C in AP English Literature despite trying my best and I really have trouble connecting with others. I feel like these four years were terrible. I had no leadership opportunities and was only lucky to get 1 internship and somewhat decent extracurriculars. I still want to apply to the like 5 t-20 schools because I know freshman year me would be proud, but I have not even started my commonApp prompt essay or any of my supplementals-I just don't know what to write and don't know how to write essays. I just feel like everything turned against me and that there is not much point in trying anymore if you just don't get what you want. After RD, I am just going to give up on school because I am so tired of it. What should i do?"

zkrkfv,107,2022-12-13,I've been unemployed all my life. What can I do if I have 2 degrees but can't find a career?,GoldenTeacher666333,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/zkrkfv/ive_been_unemployed_all_my_life_what_can_i_do_if/,"I’m urgently looking for advice because as a 32 year old, I’ve never been able to have a proper career, for various reasons. Hopefully someone takes the time to read this because I want to be as detailed as possible. 

I’ve been perpetually unemployed all my life. Sure, I’ve had a couple of low-level, low-skill jobs here and there, but never a “proper” job, let alone a fulfilling career.

When I enrolled in university back when I was 18, I made the mistake of going into architecture because on paper that seemed like the right choice for me based on my personality. 

Halfway through, I realized I dislike most of what’s involved in the practice of it. At the time of this realization, I felt like switching careers was too late so I decide to stick it out and be miserable for the next few years until I finished my degree. Now, looking back, I was young enough (early 20s) to switch paths but couldn't see it at the time. 

Upon finishing my degree I did an internship at a construction company which I hated. That proved to me that I wasn't cut for this field. 

Since getting a job as an architect was out of the question, I got a job as a phone sales rep for an electricity provider. Basically, I had to do warm outbound calls to previous customers that had canceled the service and were dealing with the utility company directly. I really enjoyed this job, I was naturally good at it for whatever reason. I made a sale on my first call and quickly became a top performer with little effort. About 3 months in, a supervisor role opened up and I applied on a whim and surprisingly I got the job. Unfortunately that particular team I was in charge of had to be terminated shortly after so I was forced to be demoted back to sales agent. 

It all goes downhill from here because I then took a customer service role which I really hated. I wasn’t particularly bad at it but nothing sucks more than being berated by strangers all day for no fault of your own. I lasted about a year there and quit because my mental health was suffering and I couldn't take it anymore.

At this point I tried to make it independently as a real estate agent and I was quite motivated about this “entrepreneurial” part of my life. I was learning a lot and felt like I finally was going to make something of myself. It was tough to make ends meet, however, because I had no stable source of income so I gave up, maybe a little too soon, after a year. 

That’s when I decided to give education another chance so I found a master’s program in communications and brand management. That was about 4 years ago. I genuinely loved it. I was super excited to formally learn about management and everything related to brands, communication, marketing,  and so many other things in that area. I did fairly well and graduated by the end of 2020. While getting my degree I did two internships which I really enjoyed as well. 

I feel that my timing was terrible because I finished my studies in the middle of the pandemic so finding a job was impossible. I’ve applied to hundreds of companies at this point and have only gotten a handful of first interviews. I did get really close once, in a marketing role at a fintech startup and made it to the final interview only to be rejected over someone with actual experience, which I completely understand.

Last year I worked in another low-skill role as a delivery guy and then as an “associate” in a warehouse. 

And that is basically it. I’ve been continually applying to every role that could be a fit for me only to never get even to the first interview. Don’t get me wrong, I understand perfectly why a company wouldn’t want to hire someone with no actual experience in a role. But it feels like the more time passes the harder it will be to ever get a job. 

I know I have to be proactive, learn more skills, and so forth. I’m just at a loss because since I’ve never really worked in anything I don’t know which direction to take. The possibilities are so broad that I get analysis paralysis. The thing is that I need something that I can learn somewhat quickly and which gives me enough value to be considered for a role. 

So I come here asking, based on what I’ve said, what advice would you give me? I’m not lazy, I can definitely turn on my productivity and be conscientious but most of the time I’m so depressed about my situation that I barely do anything. That is, I understand rationally that I should do something but I feels so emotionally destroyed that I can’t get myself to do it. Not only that, but I think that even if I did get a job, I would feel so out of place because I wouldn’t know what to do on day one. 

Anyways thanks for reading if you made it his far, I look forward to what you guys have to say. I can answer questions too, I just don’t want to make this post longer than it already is."

I’m a 36 year old Physical Therapy Assistant who’s in the early (very early) stages of learning Python. Rather than get hung up on big programming goals which seem unattainable at this point, I’m really just trying to understand what an an entry level job would look like. Even if you could toss out some position titles for me to Google would be helpful. I don’t live in a big city. Are remote internships a thing that exist?

 When the student is ready, the master will appear. Where’s he at? My local community college has certifications in Cloud Foundations, Cloud Architecting, Professional IT support, Google IT-AWS Joint Certificate. I know that I didn’t list the actual curriculum, but do any of those sound promising? 

I’m just trying to build a foundation, get practical skills which will make me employable in the near-term so that I can begin to transition out of my current career. I know that my growth in this area will accelerate when I can start putting in work-hours, not just my off-time hobby-hours. Any advice, focusing a 1-to-2 year plan would be really appreciated.

Right now I’m doing a Udemy 100-days of code Python Course (Dr. Angela Yu), going through the FAQ, reading/listening to books that are over my head, and trying to not feel too old for this mid-career switch. Should I buy a skateboard?"
zkx4wx,3,2022-12-13,I don't know what to do after the new year,EnvironmentComplex98,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/zkx4wx/i_dont_know_what_to_do_after_the_new_year/,"I'm finding myself in a unique situation and need all the advice and different ways to look at it I can get. So basically I'm 33 and had started a corporate remote job last year. It was stable with good pay and benefits. In 2020 I begrudgingly made the wise decision to move into a rooming house in order to cut down on expenses and pay off debt, mostly student loans. The plan was to stick it out for 4-5 years whereby I'd pay off my debt, increase credit score, lose weight I had gained, may or may not buy a car, earn my associates, and move the heck away a few states over and put more effort into relationships and hopefully finding an SO. Last few months those plans just don't seem possible. 

First off, I was excited to hear about the loan forgiveness program. I'd be eligible to have $20,000 forgiven which would take care of most of it and I'd be able to pay off the rest within a year. Well unsurprisingly it got shot down and it's up in the air with whether or not they can go through with it. 

With my job I was getting tuition reimbursement as I went back to school and enrolled in an IT program and am on track to graduate in 2024. My job announced restructuring and moved us to a vendor where a lot of benefits are lost including tuition reimbursement. I know I can still go to school, but I hate the idea of taking out more loans when now I am not even sure if the majority of them will be forgiven and I don't want to get into any more debt. There is also an issue of being able to complete an internship for 3 months at 15-20 hours a week while I work full time at the end of my program. On top of that, as much as I'd like to have a college degree in the IT field and believe it would open up more opportunities, it still is not a guarantee I would get a higher paying job than what I am making now.

I still have some smaller plans on the works that would hopefully keep me on the right track. I'm looking into getting an adjuster license as I really need to be making more an hour to get this debt taken care of so it's not a huge monthly payment I'd have to worry about for years when I am also trying to save for a house and car and relocating. I am still registered for classes in the spring but instead of being on the path to an associates, there's 3 more classes I can take that would give me a technical certificate in business operations and those classes can still apply to an associates if I choose to go back. At least it would be something to show I completed some type of program at the college level. 

I'm applying at other companies that offer tuition reimbursement. Only thing is most of them have you wait a year til you can apply for it. I have also looked into TN reconnect program where an associates degree is paid for as long as you graduated highschool and lived in TN for a year. I did not move to that state because where I am living it is affording me the ability to keep most of my income and not spend on high rent prices. 

I signed my lease so it is not up until June of 2024. I feel so lost and bummed. For the most part I make good choices and am responsible. Ive been working so long and feel like I can never catch a break. I realize the importance of education and have always had plans to finish school. Jobs always get in the way. After years I had finally found myself in the best position to be secure in finances and help with tuition that made it possible for me to enroll, got 1/3 way there and now of course my job lays off or takes away those benefits and loan forgiveness Is on hold. God knows what else is going to go wrong. Sometimes I don't want to even bother making an plans or trying to better myself and my life because it never works out. At the same time I feel like whenever I put plans into fruition and show up and do the work, it works out for a little time then all goes to sh#$t. But also I feel like there's so many different paths I could choose from and have a lot of doors open for me, but then I remember how nothing ever works out."

I’m currently 24.

Basically when I graduated with no internship experience and things were looking grim, I considered grad school and to just continue studying while looking for a job.

A few months later I got a job and now almost two years later am about to pay off my private loans after aggressively paying them off. For context I owed about $15,000 or so. I have some federal ones but didn’t plan to pay them as aggressively. 

The thing is, with those loans gone I really want to move out from my parents house finally and live a little, however grad school now is a bit of a tether on me. The school I go to is a great university in my state but the tuition for two courses is about $6600 a semester. While working that is doable, however simultaneously trying to pay for living expenses and loans that seems like I’d be stretched a little for the first few months. I also look at that and just think **that is so much money**

My work offers financial assistance but requires you pay it back if you leave within two years of receiving it, and I’m currently looking for a new job. Coupled with the fact that my university has a five year cap on my degree and I took 2022 off to pay off my loans, I feel trapped. I’m not sure if I can leave the program and return or if I need to just accept what’s happened so far and delay moving out, but the idea of living at home another 1-2 years really bums me out. I really don’t want to take out more loans. 

Now that I’m financially a little more free I just really wanted to start having a place I could call my own and enjoy life. Though with budgeting I’d say it’s possible. Any insight or advice?"

I really liked the engineering culture at Google when I was there as an intern. I couldn't see myself at Bloomberg for longer than two years or so, but since I'm an international, it'd be harder to leave cause they only start the green card process after the first year.

I'm kinda worried that Google will rescind -- maybe Bloomberg is more recession-proof? But idk I don't really know too much about the two companies in this regard.

Chief concerns: engineering talent/growth opportunities, economic stability, location. Difference in TC is negligible (but Bloomberg's signing bonus would have to be returned if you leave before 2 years)."

I was just wondering what y’all’s advice is for part time work and where to find it? I currently work full time and have been doing so while in graduate school for the past 1.5 years. However, next year I have to complete my practicum internship, which requires 18-20 hours a week from me. I told my work I can no longer work full time due to this, and initially they proposed and were willing into looking into a LOA but have began to back off of the idea as I have gotten closer to my internship starting. 

I’m now looking into quitting if they can’t accommodate me or work with me towards potentially providing part time hours. Are there any part time or flexible jobs you’d recommend for someone in my position? 

Thank you all:)"

I began applying to internship roles on August 30th and my last interview was November 11th.

Background Info:

I'm a junior at Rice University. My previous experience includes an internship at a small, no-name defense contractor. My project was very boring and not at all impressive. I also included some data science projects I did in my free time and some school projects on my resume. I also only started tracking leetcode data when I started applying. I probably have an additional 100 hours of leetcode from doing most of Neetcode 150 before applying. IIRC I did all easies and mediums for Arrays and Hashing to Graphs. Currently I have 174 LC (57 easy, 113 medium, 4 hard) problems done, and I did two contests.

|Finals|9|
|Offers|6|

I got offers from AT&amp;T, Discover, Paycom, FlightAware, Unnamed Startup, and Unnamed Big Tech. I reached the final interviews for Zendesk, Mathworks, and Oshkosh as well.

Thoughts and Reflections:

My internship process was grind, but I am happy with my results and I think it was worth it. I secured a winter offer at Series A startup (42/hr), and a summer offer at a big tech company (\~50/hr). I'm not going to name them because I would be easily findable if I did. If you are really that curious, the big tech offer is one of {Microsoft, Salesforce, Robinhood, Datadog, Reddit, Snowflake, Airbnb, Bloomberg, Doordash, Pinterest}. The process was very draining though, both physically and mentally. I am taking the easiest course schedule possible (2 gen eds, 2 cs classes), and I'm borderline almost failing my algorithms class.

I think luck plays a much bigger role in the internship process than you expect. When I started applying, I expected to get at least one if not multiple big tech offers. I became very discouraged and humbled when I proceeded to get ghosted by almost every big tech company I applied to. I even got resume rejected by Lowe's. Ultimately, finding an internship is a numbers game. I only heard back from two big tech companies: Palantir and my offer. Got rejected after recruiter phone for Palantir as well. There is also luck when it comes to interviews. During my Mathworks process, I absolutely aced the technical and had a really good conversation with my interviewer. My HM round was a complete disaster. It legitimately felt like an interrogation. He did not seem interested at all in what I had to say and just asked questions from a script. He even asked me where the headquarters of Mathworks was located. I'm pretty sure he wanted me to fail for some reason. I was absolutely crushed by this because I thought Mathworks was the best offer I was going to get, but luckily got in the loop with unnamed big tech company later.

The biggest tip I can give is to apply early. Like in July. I never got a chance to interview at Capital One or Amazon because they hit headcount before reviewing my application. Furthermore, you can start recruiting during the summer and potentially get an offer before school starts which means at the very least you can be more selective with the companies you apply to/interview for, saving a lot of time. If there is one thing I could change, it would be to apply earlier. I also think you should treat behaviorals just as seriously as technicals. After my final for my big tech offer, I genuinely thought I bombed the interview since my code still had a bug I couldn't figure out. I think my saving grace was that I connected really well with my recruiter and behavioral interviewers and had really in depth reasons for why I wanted to intern at the specific company. I would recommend generating a list of common behavioral questions and writing answers down for all of them in STAR format. For every company I interviewed with, I would research what the company did, what its missions and values were, and would craft an answer for why I wanted to work there. You don't want to memorize your answers and appear like you are reading off a script during the interview, but you should know the general outline for each answer/story."

zl83j0,2,2022-12-13,Am I on the right career path? How do I better market myself for a full-time WFH job?,Specialist_Tough_737,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/zl83j0/am_i_on_the_right_career_path_how_do_i_better/,"I (34F) need career advice. I feel stuck and lost. I want a full-time WFH job with benefits. Right now, though, I am a freelance tutor/copywriter with a $16k AGI. (Please ignore the random username; Reddit auto-created it for me.) 

I charge $65-$70/hour for most of my tutoring, and I bring in $600-$650/week except during school breaks/summers. Copywriting gigs are more sporadic, but sometimes I make up to $25/hour after fees are taken out. I made $4k from copywriting gigs this year. (All income is before taxes and deductions.) 

I do have a master's degree (in fiction writing; yes, I know it's silly and impractical . . . it wasn't so much a career choice as a creative fulfillment thing). Jobs in that field are difficult to find. You have to publish a novel, etc. I'm honestly just not interested in looking for jobs related to my degree. My undergrad degrees were BAs in Literature and Classics (Latin), with a minor in Mass Comm.

My current situation doesn't feel stable. I find quarterly filing and seasonal work stressful, and I crave the stability of a full-time job. Based on my prior employment (at a publishing company, a nonprofit, and a university), I think I could realistically qualify for a job in the $45 to $65k range. This economy doesn't help my job search, but then again, the most lucrative tutoring period for me was in the first four months of the pandemic, and back in 2010, I got a full-time job at a publishing company straight out of college despite the housing market crash, so I guess I feel like: Fuck it. Let's try.

Although I have corporate editorial and administrative experience, on average, I only stayed at those jobs for 2.5 years. Despite applying to many copywriting gigs, I've had no luck finding full-time WFH jobs. I suspect this is partly because my experience is wide-ranging, and I've also never worked at an agency. (I'm happy to DM people my CV, scrubbed of some personal stuff.) I tried to get around this with my CV tagline: ""Detail-oriented, hard-working writer and editor with a creative, DIY spirit."" I do think that accurately captures what I bring to the table.

For instance, I taught myself the Adobe Suite with the help of Google and YouTube and did graphic design and edited photography for some years. When I was a marketing intern at a university, I did all marketing, editorial, graphic design, social media, photography, etc. I came up with and spearheaded a marketing project that involved collecting testimonials from people using alternative transportation, which the university had been trying to promote. The thing is, so much of my most ""impressive"" professional experience is from a decade ago. The last decade's experience has been more sporadic, DIY, freelance, broke but much-awarded grad school student and instructor . . . you get the idea.

I guess what I'm asking is: What are my options? Where should I be looking for full-time, WFH, full-benefit jobs? I'm utilizing the usual channels. How can I better market myself? Is copywriting for me, or should I pursue another path? With the state of our planet, I can't say I'm eager to market a product that will worsen emissions and drive consumer desire. I'd rather market a PROGRAM or a nonprofit or something meaningful. I do love education, but I don't want to teach. I'm also interested in tech writing, except I can't figure out how to break into that. Any ideas?

Another note: I'm great at marketing products and programs but terrible at marketing myself. I have reached the second or third interview stage with a number of jobs I've applied to in the last year, and I'm afraid my timidity and honesty betray me. A supervisor from 2016 (I was an Administrative Assistant at a nonprofit) told me I was one of the best workers he'd ever had but that I interviewed poorly. He hired three people to replace me because I worked so hard. If I'm being honest, I've avoided corporate full-time jobs in the last decade because they always seem to expect absurd overtime with no overtime pay. BUT, now that I'm in my 30s, I'm more mature and have better boundaries, so I feel more confident communicating those to my supervisors.

In short: HALP! I'm always riding the edge financially. I need more stability but don't know how to find it. I've done many free certifications through HubSpot (SEO, Social Media Marketing, etc.) but wonder if my time would be better spent some other way. It's also just exhausting writing cover letters and applying to jobs that have often already been filled (because the listing is old, even though it says it's from yesterday) or that don't list a salary range or say if it's WFH, and so on. Worth noting: I live in Atlanta and have a lemon of a car, hence wanting WFH. Thank you for reading this disorganized post!"

I’m doing software engineering at a finance firm, and I signed full time after a summer 2021 internship to start fall 2022. I asked if they would let me take time off to travel, and they approved it, so I’m starting in winter 2023. The new grads coming in then have gotten a significant pay bump. So, if I start in February I’ll be making about $50k less than everyone else who starts with me. 

Should I ask my recruiter for the same package, or should I just hold my tongue? My main concern is if I start lower, I will continue making less the whole time I’m at the company."

I’m a junior having trouble deciding which internship to go with next summer — Deutsche Bank’s Technology, Data, &amp; Innovation Internship or a Disney SWE internship. Would appreciate any insight or thoughts :) thanks so much!

Deutsche Bank

Position: TDI Intern

Location: NYC

Salary: 48$ / hr

Benefits: N/A

Pros: location! (perhaps more opportunities for full-time, a summer in NYC seems exciting), teams haven’t been assigned yet and I get more say in my team/work (interested in ML/data-related work, which could be an option aside from pure SWE)

Cons: the interview process wasn’t technical at all, so I wonder if the role isn’t as tech-y/a good indicator of a future tech/SWE role, less interested in the company than Disney

\---

Disney

Position: Systems Engineer Intern

Location: Orlando, FL

Salary: 40$/hr

Benefits: $5000 relocation stipend

Pros: I’m a huge Disney fan (looking forward to the perks) — I think it would be cool to experience the environment/working there, maybe better if I’m interested in SWE (not sure about this, but at least the interview process was slightly more technical than DB)

Cons: location (don’t want to be in Orlando full-time, might meet less people since the only people there will probably be for Disney), don’t get a say in team (I’m less interested in systems engineering than some other things, but I do want to experience more full-stack-type SWE as I’ve never done that before)

Basically, I’m wondering which would be a better stepping stone to a future in tech (is one more widely-recognized/cutting-edge?), as well as hoping for thoughts on internship culture/location from anyone who’s interned at either company — was it easy to make friends with other interns, did you feel like you learned a lot, etc?

Location is definitely pretty important to me so I’m leaning towards DB right now (also feels like it could open more opportunities?), but not sure if I should weigh it that heavily since I do love the idea of experiencing working at Disney.

That makes sense.

But then they go on to say that many of those applicants are useless, in that they have no training or experience, and just handed in a application because they heard getting a CS job is easy.

That last point doesn't make a lot of sense to me. A lot of people on this sub have degrees, projects, internships etc but still struggle to get entry level jobs. If that many applicants were truly garbage, surely it would be easy for pretty much any reasonably motivated CS graduate to get a job, based on their degree alone.

I ask, because I'm trying to figure out what I need to do to be competitive for entry level positions, and I'm constantly getting mixed messages. On the one hand, I'm told that if can solve fizzbuzz, I'm better than 90% of the applicants for entry level jobs. But on the other hand I'm told that I at least need an internship, ideally from a major company, and I should probably start contributing to open source to stand any chance of being noticed.

Ideally people from hiring positions. What is your experience?"

I have a interview for a summer 2023 in around a week for a internship this summer. About 2 weeks ago, I got a part-time dev internship that I am able to work through winter break as well as the Spring semester until the summer starts. The resume I originally applied to the 2023 summer internship did not have the part-time dev internship I am currently doing.

The interviewer will ask about my current and previous experience, which leads to me wonder if I would benefit from letting the recruiter know of my most recent position? I ask this because I don't want to do my part-time gig full time during the summer since it does not pay the greatest(the summer 2023 interview I have is for 30% more).

Potential downsides I've thought of by updating the recruiter: They may become hawkish of moving me forward as I technically already 'have' something. I would assure the recruiter that given I pass the interview, that I would 100% be able to quit the part-time gig in order to do the internship.

Potential upsides: More experience, as in what I am doing now would make me a stronger candidate. I can talk about 'industry' experience I have through this position.

Thoughts? Has anybody been in a similar position? I know its really case-by-case. Thank you"

I just cannot turn to my parents or family for advice, so I hope that some people will be willing to share some advice/wisdom because I am at my wits end turning the thoughts around in my head.

I am currently a sophomore at college. I have made good grades, am on the e-board of one of the most popular clubs on campus, am in the honors program, and have been accepted into a selective program within the honors program. None of that is important because I still feel stuck. I go to my in-state school because I chose it. However, I chose this school because it was the cheapest option and the easiest pathway to a degree as I am low-income and first gen. It was my last choice.

I have made a lot of friends and networked with professors and professionals. I have a professor who is willing to help me apply for internships, and he is going to recommend me for one in D.C.

I have tried pursuing studying abroad (which is something I really want to do), but the university is not much help (it notoriously makes it hard for students). I have been sent on a wild goose chase to figure out who to talk to actually make it happen.

I know I have pursued a lot of things. However, a lot of what I do now parallels what I do in high school, which is something I did not want. I wanted to explore more. I worked hard in high school to get out of my state to receive better education as my state is one of the lowest-ranking states for education (and everything else). I feel like I am just stuck in purgatory trying to get out again and that I am losing my youth to it.

I have tried to engage with all the stuff going on on campus (as there are tens of thousands of people), but I hate that it is so big. I would rather be at a smaller school with more opportunities for my field and for studying abroad and expanding my worldview, but I feel dread at starting over because that means everything I built here to try to be content with myself and my position has meant nothing.

I am very grateful that I have to opportunity to attend college and receive financial aid and do all these wonderful things. I recognize my privilege and reflect on it every day. I have tried to shake this feeling, and I just can't. I know that part of it stems from elitism because I come from a competitive high school and going to a state school is frowned upon and ridiculed. Just today, I visited my high school with some friends, and I would be ignored completely or negative comments would be made when I would tell teachers where I ended up. I have even gotten this from family. I have had strangers twice laugh in my face when I told them where I go. I want to drive them wrong too. I want to prove that I am still of value and that I can take my degree from this school and do great things and achieve so much. However, I am also not happy with the quality of life my school provides. I want out."

zleglg,4,2022-12-13,How to make the most of living in DC? Crazy pivot or keep trying to reach my Archaeology dreams?,Amsmoonchild,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/zleglg/how_to_make_the_most_of_living_in_dc_crazy_pivot/,"Hello everyone!

I recently graduated with a degree in Anthropology with a focus in Archaeology from a top tier university on the west coast. However, my husband got a job in the DC area, and now I find myself over here in a totally new place. I know no one, and I have a remote job. I am at least one year from starting any kind of graduate school, more likely 2-3 years because I have to do a lot more archaeology certifications and figure out what exactly I want to study before I apply for PhD programs. Also he wont want to move due to his job for probably 2-3 years as well, and the PhD programs I am interested in are in Boston, NYC, and in the UK. There isn't a great uni for me in this area.

I currently have a remote job that I was able to keep when I moved here and I love that. However, I feel like I really want to take advantage of being in DC. The problem is, I feel like I am under-qualified for most of the 'real' jobs around here. I have interviewed for a few executive assistant positions (which is essentially what my remote job is, so I have about 2 years experience with that), but I don't seem to stand out from the crowd enough for a second interview. Also I don't have a security clearance or military experience.

I'm not super interested in politics. If I could do anything I wanted, I would love to work at the Smithsonian, but to be honest that seems impossible. I have been passed over for internships there for the past two summers.

I don't qualify for government archaeology work because I haven't done my field school thanks to covid (I am hoping to do that this coming summer). But even with that, the DC area isn't the best for archaeology and I would probably have to travel a lot away from home and to be quite honest, it just doesn't pay enough. I don't want to waste the many years I worked toward my archaeology degree, while at the same time I feel like I should attempt to pivot to something more lucrative. But I am not sure how to do that without tons more school, which I am willing to do but I need to choose a direction.

Other things about me- I graduated with a high GPA and a lot of awards and honors. My other work experience includes 7 years elementary school teaching (don't want to go back to that), 3 years ESL teaching (The 10 years total of teaching was all outside of the US, so I have a lot of international experience) 4 years of bartending and bar managing to put myself through college, and my executive assistant role I am doing now. I am also an artist and musician, not great at math (though I am trying- I am currently back at community college taking chemistry courses so that I qualify for one of the graduate programs I want to apply to...it never ends!).

Things I have thought about are:

1. Just keeping my remote job and doubling down on my continuing education. Do my field school, get my pre reqs for grad school out of the way, and apply to graduate school. Do some hobby stuff on the side, join a gym, try and get my painting practice going again. The problem with this is that I have little opportunity for meeting people (therefore reliant on husband for social life- which is not great), I feel like I might be missing out on something great here in the DC area. I also would love to make more money and be less broke for a while.  It feels a little like a cop out/lazy to do this.
2. Keep applying to jobs and just take whatever finally comes my way- but I am not even sure where to start with that since I have not had much luck so far and I don't seem to have what people are looking for. I am an artistic girl from the west coast who lived outside the US for 10 years and is great at photoshop, writing, anything creative, understanding cultures. I'm very organized and can use all the gmail/outlook/ etc admin stuff, but I am not as good as some of the others I have met/heard of with degrees in HR or business or whatever.
3. Make a crazy pivot like try and join the FBI or CIA, become a paralegal, do a certificate course in machine learning, or something else like that I haven't even thought of. I am always down for a new adventure and if I want to do something, I usually can if I can overcome the imposter syndrome.

Any advice from anyone about any part of this would be greatly appreciated!!"

Heya, 16/NJ/(ft)M junior here, and I am a total mess if you want to describe me generally. I’m Syrian/Lebanese (first generation, parents were born there) so white for stats, and I’m in that weird zone where people either think I’m mixed Black/White or a really dark Italian but not an Arab. Both of my parents are college educated, my mother is a big name doctor and my father coowns a banking software company, so my family is basically just American dream’d immigrants, highest tax bracket in NJ. I can speak English, Arabic and French, and can read/write English and French but am practically at an elementary school level in formal/literate Arabic, even though I can speak close to native.

My first semester junior year GPA (unweighted) is currently sitting at a great little 2.73, which… well, yeah, that’s subpar. I’m in all honors/AP except for English, which I was booted out of the AP for because I have trouble with formal writing. 5 on AP Calc BC without taking a class because my grades were too low, 4 on Phys C (without class because failure), and some other tests that I don’t think are relevant and this is getting pretty long huh. I have been struggling with a legitimate medical condition though and will be undergoing surgery for it soon. I think my total high school GPA, including that semester, is ~3.3 UW.

My ACT is a 36 which is all luck because I didn’t prep, SAT is 1560 so I’m not sure if I should include that as well or not. I have research experience and have been in that little old et al. section three times, though I’ve never led a research initiative and have been, of course, a pretty minor role in most of them. All of these are related to STEM in some way, two of them on artificial intelligence and one on genome engineering, which are a weird combo. I’ve been programming since I was seven or eight but have only taken it seriously starting maybe four years ago.

I somehow got into and am currently wrapping up a NASA internship, which I’m going to be relying on for my super stupid MIT ED I’m dead set on. 

My grades are nothing impressive. I don’t think I could go to a school that tries to get me to stray out of my area of interest too much; I’ve been deadset on some kind of job in either AI or something related to space and data and stuff since I first looked up “Mindcraf mod tutural eaasy 4 kids” at seven and was hooked with funny little lines of code on the screen. I’m so worried about my grades because I go to a fancy college prep school and the competition is really hard. I just want somewhere I can live my life and learn new things, you know? 

Anyways, yeah. Am I crazy? Sorry for the longpost, my parents have been on me recently and it’s gotten my stress levels up by a million. Peace ✌🏽"

I am debating what my next move should be towards CPA licensure and I would really appreciate any and all insight.

The most straight forward path is to get my Master’s in Accounting from the same state school since it will require less change and it’d be an environment I’m already used to. I have great relationships with the staff and my peers there and I enjoy attending the recruiting events. However, it’s the most expensive and least flexible out of the two options.

My second option is to enroll at WGU with a MA in either Data Analytics, Cybersecurity, or IT Management (after finishing the remaining accounting-specific hours required at a local community college). This one seems more appealing to me since

1. It’s cheaper
2. Classes are recognized by the Texas CPA board
3. More options for when I decide to leave PA
4. PA doesn’t necessarily care how I became a CPA, but this might set me apart from other candidates in industry.
5. I’ll have enough money after my PA internships (PwC and Armanino) to not have to work and completely focus on getting the hours I need. 
6. More flexible as you do one class at a time until you pass it as opposed to doing 3-4 at a time. Could \*maybe\* finish sooner than at the state school.

Alternatively, I could do the MA in Accounting program at WGU, but I feel that something tech-related might be more beneficial. Especially considering that the profession is headed more towards tech every day.

**If you suggest WGU, could you let me know which three of the MA tech programs you think might be best? That is another dilemma I have yet to figure out.**

I hope this wasn’t too wordy, and I hope I provided enough context. I look forward to being enlightened by everyone. (Please be nice to me cuz I’m sensitive &lt;3)"
zlk01l,4,2022-12-14,Post/Near-Graduation Burnout,bleazel,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/zlk01l/postneargraduation_burnout/,"I'm a CS Student right now, approaching my last semester of college. I've been feeling such dread towards a lot of CS related stuff lately, not to mention this feeling of burnout. Except, I don't feel burntout when it comes to things I enjoy. I'm able to do them quite well. But for some reason all of the joy I had for CS just got sucked out of me through college. I had an internship for a year and a half while going to school the entire time, and I genuinely think me having to do coding almost constantly for so long on top of life has drained me.

I have to apply for jobs soon.. But I don't know what to tell people when I go to interviews. Do I want to start working in June right after graduation? Do I want to start work in August and take a bit of a break? Or do I actually somehow hate CS suddenly and will never be able to deal with working with it for the rest of my life? I did used to like it. I didn't have this huge passion but I loved solving problems and the challenge it gave me to come up with solutions. But it seems now most of it is gone, and has been gone for at least 6 months (it comes in waves but they're infrequent).

Has anyone else gone through this? I worry the burnout will take a long time to go away because frankly my last semester is going to be busy and idk how to lessen that load for myself. Any advice or encouragement would be great."

zln6ai,1,2022-12-14,Need advice on master's or getting a job.,metquanta,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/zln6ai/need_advice_on_masters_or_getting_a_job/,"I'm a 3rd year undergraduate majoring in ECE in a pretty good university in India. My interests are computer architecture and digital design. My grades are not great because of the first two semesters being online and me having no interest to study during that time. But, since my third semester I have grabbed on to computer architecture, especially RISC-V and have indulged pretty well. I have had three internship experiences so far, two research and one industry. My first research experience was in a university lab and it was about RISC-V on FPGA and I thoroughly enjoyed this. Next one was last summer, I worked for a semiconductor company as a CPU Verification intern and really enjoyed working with open source tools to verify a RISC-V CPU. Currently, working as a research intern at a software startup in the field of DNN accelerators on FPGA. 

Now, my concern is that; should I continue my integrated master's or get a job in either of the two companies I have worked at? My end goal is to get into research and get a PhD. Next semester, I will be rejoining the research lab at my university and will be again working on a well funded RISC-V project.
I'm concerned my gpa would hinder my opportunities when applying to grad school abroad. Any advice as to what I should be doing and what I should choose would be appreciated:)

tl;dr decent internship experience, not so great gpa. End goal PhD, so master's or a job before applying to that"
zlnaa7,1,2022-12-14,Fear-based upbringing; tips on how to move on and not be afraid of the world?,lilcons,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/zlnaa7/fearbased_upbringing_tips_on_how_to_move_on_and/,"Hello everyone, this is my first post on Reddit. I'm writing this because after almost a year of group therapy I realized that I'm still a long way from being over the fear-based upbringing I was subjected to from early childhood up to my early twenties (I'm currently 22).

A little context: my father has always been overprotective of me and my brother due to the fact that he had us late in life (he was 47 and my mother was much younger, 30); the only emotion he's ever used to express his fear and anxiety is anger, which would lead to huge fights and emotional abuse, especially when I was younger. My mother on the other hand has always played the role of the enabler, even though she's not particularly overprotective herself. As a result of this environment I've spent most of my teenage years alone in my room, not being allowed to go out on my own until I found a friend in high school when I was 16-17 (still one of my best friends to this day). Even then I remember at first I was not allowed to stay out past 9 pm, which is kind of silly now looking back.

I'm a student at university now (have been for the last 3 or so years, working on my master's degree), which means I'm out of my parents' house. Being at uni has allowed me to experience new things and new people, I've been able to make friends and live life in the city. I've recently realized, however, that my father's fears always find a way into every decision I make: I'm constantly worried about everything, I don't like going out that much and I have a hard time trying out new experiences. My university offers the opportunity to have a year of free group therapy, which I was able to take starting from last year; therapy was one of the key factors in understanding that my fear of the world is not exactly normal.

These fears also affect the way I interact with people: I find it near impossible to let my guard down, even with close friends, and I noticed I have a tendency to self-isolate very frequently in an attempt to safeguard my mental space from everyone. I'm currently in my first romantic relationship, and even though I love my boyfriend very much and know he's a very honest and caring person I still have a hard time trusting him fully (he knows that and knows I'm working on it).

My wake-up call happened a couple of days ago, when my boyfriend left for an internship abroad - in a different continent; I was offered the same opportunity when he was (we were not together at the time, which was a year ago), but I decided not to take it in order to graduate from my bachelor's earlier (the details are hard to explain, plus I live in Europe and to my knowledge universities work a little differently here); I've always known, however, that graduation was not the main reason: I was just very afraid of taking a leap and doing something scary and new.

Watching him leave was hard because I'm going to miss him a lot and he's going to miss me too, but it also made me realize that I too want to try new things, even if I'm very scared and I really don't know where to start. I was thinking of having a small solo bus trip to a different city when I have time and I'm not too busy studying, but that's just one idea. I just really want to be adventurous and confident; my boyfriend will be back in 1 month and a half, and I'm not gonna lie, I also really want to be able to tell him that I've grown a lot when he comes back - what he's doing is very inspiring to me.

Does anyone share a similar experience? Do you have any tips? Thank you all in advance, hope the post wasn't too hard to read.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I've had a fear-based upbringing which still affects me to this day in every decision I make. Looking for tips on how to take opportunities fearlessly and confidently."

I attend a top research institution as a computer science major as a junior. I have two semester of research experience while at the school. I've had an internship at Microsoft as a software engineer and got into an undergraduate research internship at Microsoft in machine learning for this upcoming summer.  Unfortunately I have a pretty low gpa of a 3.1 which wont be getting higher as im studying abroad.

Im worried about my chances of getting into a top Computational Neuroscience or Machine learning PhD program, and asking for advice on how to get into such programs being that my gpa is so low. 

From what I was reading, it seems like it's a trend for people to do their masters then apply to PhD programs but wouldn't you be ""completing"" a masters if you do a PhD program and master out for example so im unsure about that route since it seems time inefficient compared to directly going into a PhD program?  

I was even considering doing full time software engineering after undergrad but I don't think that would help my application much.

Ultimately, considering my situation how would I best position myself to be able to have the best available options in terms of PhD programs I would like to attend, and does my profile seem strong enough to get into top programs straight from undergrad? Thanks for any advice!"

I will be programming drivers and testing equipment to validate circuit-boards, however I will not be interacting with the quantum circuits. I have had programming experience like this in the past, so I am concerned that I will not be learning many new skills. And to work as a quantum engineer post-grad, I would need to pursue a PhD.

I have also been contacted by Tesla and am in the final interviewing stages. This would be an embedded role on one of the vehicle systems, which is a skill I've wanted to develop. Tesla would pay more, and its an opportunity that I've hoped for for a long time.  


I would hate to renege on my current acceptance and lose many future opportunities, but I also don't want to refuse an opportunity I've hoped for for a long time. Quantum computing is a field I am highly interested in, but it seems that an undergraduate internship would have limited utility until I get a PhD. However, the quantum computing experience is certainly more unique, and it is something I won't get to participate in again unless I enter the world of academia for 6 years.

I am currently working on a CS degree, but I have no relevant IT experience. I've put in close to a hundred applications with no callbacks. Until this week.

I was given an offer for jr help desk technician tier 1 with a government contractor for $28k +benefits. This is less than I was hoping to start out with. The commute will also be long, with odd hours. I was also offered Geek Squad Agent, which is down the street, but the pay is $30k. I am not sure which would be better for me to progress in an IT career. At the help desk role, I will have the title, but the pay is less than what I see others landing on here. Does Geek Squad hold any weight on a resume?

I am willing to take the $28k if it is better in the long run. With Geek Squad, I would probably have to get help desk after? The difference is I would now have relevant experience and hopefully, get a better offer at a help desk job. I am so torn, but ultimately, I want to do whatever will be best in the long run.

Edit: Thank you Redditors for helping me put it into perspective. General consensus is the help desk, and I agree. I think that's what my gut what was telling me. I am just so excited to get an entry level position. I definitely need the confidence boost, and I plan on learning as much as I can while I'm there.

My original goal was to go the SE route, but I find that I've enjoyed my IT type classes more. Programming ends up being a 24/7 thing for me, because I seem to lack the ability to put a project down. I'm feeling burnt out after the last two years of it. "
zltcit,1,2022-12-14,Bioinformatics internship - listing online courses / project on CV,twothreefivenine,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/zltcit/bioinformatics_internship_listing_online_courses/,"I mention CV specifically because the internship programs specifically requests a CV - so no ""skills"" section, but I do have a ""work and other experience"" section. I'm an undergrad studying Biochemistry but trying to transition into bioinformatics / more computational work with very little experience (thus internships!). I've completed Harvard's CS50x and have a couple of fairly simple bioinformatics related projects in my github - imo not worth putting under an entire ""projects"" section. How should I list these in my CV, and is it appropriate to put a link to your github in your CV?"
zlu9ar,1,2022-12-14,My fiance hates my friend/coworker,IrishCreamTheNerd,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/zlu9ar/my_fiance_hates_my_friendcoworker/,"So, before I start this, I understand my fiance's position, her former step dad cheated on her mom, her last major relationship (10 years ago in high school) ended with her boyfriend cheating on her. 
We have been together for 10 years.

Anyways, onto the issue.

At work some years ago, we got several new interns. I had just become a full employee myself and had decided I was going to help the newbies avoid the complete lack of training I had.

I ended up being friends with one of the interns (henceforth 'Z'). We both played Pokemon, she had a fiance, I asked her for advice picking a ring to propose to my (then girlfriend). She's a good friend. 

The issues start with Z getting me and several other buddies/coworkers some Christmas gifts. I made the mistake of not immediately telling my girlfriend (now fiance). It wasn't a huge gift, I didn't get Z anything, so I didn't bring it up because fiance can be a little jealous. Fiance found me thanking Z briefly when she was going through my messenger.

Anyways, fiance decided she hated Z. Which is a shame, because I thought they could be good friends. 

By this time Z had inserted herself firmly into my friend group (now friends with coworkers X and Y). So X and Y are inviting Z (and her husband) to everything they invite me to. Fiancé has been slowly amping up the hatred for Z because I try to avoid bringing her up because it immediately turns any day sour.

I have tried just not communicating with Z, but she still occasionally tries to talk to me and I'd rather not be rude. Id cut her off completely, but she's pretty firmly planted in my friend group and I really don't want to lose X and Y. Fiance refuses to meet Z. Z insists she wants to be friends with Fiance.

I'm normally a born problem solver, but this is driving me nuts and starting a lot of fights."

zluisw,1,2022-12-14,Career change; Breaking into IT,paipai130,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/zluisw/career_change_breaking_into_it/,"So 6 months ago I graduated with an A.A in general studies. I've been wanting to make a jump to an IT position but have had only an internship tht lasted 5 months (beta tester that would occasionally change the code for the product we were testing) i have built things but always with a tutorial and a follow along. I feel like getting an A+ certification would at least get me into the door into IT. And if the programming side isn't for me well I could still be open to other options. 
What should I do? And how should I study?"
zlv1s0,2,2022-12-14,How bad is Infosys?,Parker-Smith,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/zlv1s0/how_bad_is_infosys/,"Hey all,

I've been applying for internships for this summer since august and haven't had much success until this week. Out of the 100+ positions I applied to I received only two interviews, one of them being Infosys. I had a few rounds with them and just received an offer today. While I'm really happy to receive an offer, I have heard a lot of negative things about the company. The whole reason I am hesitant to accept is that because of the other company I have been interviewing with. I have gone through a few rounds with them and I have my final interview with them next week, being a ""chat"" with the project manager to discuss projects. They are a large company but fairly unknown outside of my state and do not have a big-name appeal. From my conversations with my interviewers and recruiters I am fairly confident I am going to receive an offer. The issue is that I only have 5 days to make a decision with Infosys, and my final chat isn't until next Tuesday. Not 100% sure what to do. Has anyone had an internship with Infosys recently, while I've heard mostly negative things, I have heard that they have been improving in recent years.

A little bit of background, I'm a 3rd year cs student at a high-ranking university in the US. I did have an internship last summer but it was with a small startup."
zlv2cv,1,2022-12-14,Does an Information Systems bachelors mean anything without experience?,Invisiblehost,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/zlv2cv/does_an_information_systems_bachelors_mean/,"I am 27, live with parent, and debating on graduating soon with an IS degree for which I can do extra credit in my 68 class to graduate in 3 days or stay another semester taking the needed class and two others (comp forensics and network security). From what I remember having two computer related associates degrees (comp specialist / network specialist) did not help me in my job search for entry level and level 2 IT jobs. For example I spent 2019 searching for a multitude of IT jobs and got two interviews and no offers. I haven't worked in 5 years so I don't have any recent work history and I have social anxiety and no real applicable programming skills.

I feel like with the IS degree I still only qualify to do a help desk related job where you answer irate phone calls all day from customers and clients wanting you to fix something for them. That seems terrible as a job but being a server administrator involves some of that same phone call regularity doesn't it? Those type of jobs require more than just a bachelors in my mind it requires 5 years relevant experience, software knowledge I don't have, certifications I don't have. I also did not do any internships and that opportunity will go away in 3 days if I graduated.

It is questionable how one gets that much relevant experience in that field since help desk is supposed to be a transitional job which doesn't necessarily involve the same tasks as server admin type roles. I might just not do the extra credit and stay another semester to think this through and just graduate in May instead of in 3 days to figure this out. What do you think I should do in this situation and how much does this degree actually help without any relevant experience?"

Another thing is i looked for startups and the one with actually good ideas don't have intern positions and the one with Intern openings are doing something which has been done by many othet people. Now i am basically clueless what to do ."

I already filled the application and have two academic recommendations covered (working on 3rd) but I wrote a draft of my SOP but that what is holding me back the most….

I just feel like I don’t have enough experience to get in. I have 3 years of work experience (software engineer associate for 2 years and data analyst intern for 6 months) but my undergraduate degree was in finance from CSULA and I had a 3.0 gpa.

I’m comfortable programming in C and Java but I wouldn’t say I knew everything since I am self taught. I just don’t really have any academic evidence of a computer science background other than a few CIS courses and STATS.

Do you think I have a chance at getting accepted? Also I was nervous because my two recommendations gave me there personal yahoo emails to list since they said sometimes my emails won’t come through or go to spam. Also hoping that won’t be a problem."
zlwlww,13,2022-12-14,What matters more in an internship—The company name or the experience you get?,gchECE,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/zlwlww/what_matters_more_in_an_internshipthe_company/,"I have been throwing out a ton of internship applications this cycle and I finally got an interview with a local company that seems to pay quite well. The company name doesn’t have a ton of clout, but from the job description it seems like I would learn a ton. In the description it basically sounds as if I would learn all facets of Web Development including multiple languages, frameworks, database design, as well as the overall software engineering process. Additionally, I would start with a bootcamp to bring me up to speed on the technologies they use and then I would work on my own projects immediately afterwards. This seems like a great learning experience, but again the company name isn’t a household name.

tl;dr
I am about to start interviewing with a company where I would learn a ton and have a great experience and pay at home, but the company name isn’t particularly notable. What matters more?"

After getting a bachelors degree in construction management, I spent 5 years in management positions before deciding to switch to computer science to follow my passion. I spent the last 6 months self teaching. I’ve completed CS50X and CS50P, and I’m currently up to the point in The Odin Project where I completed the To-Do List app. I’m at the point where I can solve many Easy LC problems relatively quickly and I’ve taken a stab at a few Mediums as well.

Recently, I’ve decided to pursue a bachelors degree in computer science. I’ve enrolled in a post-bacc bachelors degree program that begins this January and will be completed by Dec 2024.

Since I really only have this summer and next summer before I complete my degree, I want to maximize my chances of getting internships. However, being that I have limited experience in the computer science field I’m not sure if it’s worth trying for an internship this summer or if I should focus more on portfolio projects and just write this summer off. 

Any advice or input is greatly appreciated!"

The ""not boring to look at"" part is pretty important for me cause I have ADHD and this kind of work can be extremelly tedious and discouraging, but I do want to work with it as I think it's a very interesting field and could help me in many personal projects I have.   


When studying data analysis I notice people work with very basic-looking spreadsheets with numerous lines and columns and that bores me just by looking at it. I fear that having to deal with this kind of work will eventually drain me and make me lose interest in the field.  


I just want to know if anyone here copes with ADHD and works with data anlysis, if so, how do you feel about your work? How do you keep things interesting in the long run? Any insights or advice are really appreciated :)"
zm2cka,6,2022-12-14,Effective long term preparation strategy for quant finance recruiting (6 months+),PleaseDontSueMe1,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/zm2cka/effective_long_term_preparation_strategy_for/,"For this internship recruiting cycle, I didn’t have much time (and baseline IQ points) to prepare for quant interviews so I didn’t make the cut for the top firms like Citadel/2S/HRT. Fortunately, I received an offer from a “lower tier” hedge fund (\~Akuna, quant at banks, Virtu). This will be my first experience working in a HF.

Like most regular people, I do much better when I have time to dig into the details/build intuition. I want to plan ahead so I can perform better in next year’s fulltime recruiting cycle (which some people say is generally harder). What do you think is a good long term strategy for quant interviews preparation? My current plan is to, from now till end of Jul/Aug next year:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Grind leetcode + probability puzzles. I’ve gotten better at these but probability puzzles can still be hit or miss. I get the fundamental approaches to solving these like looking for symmetry, recursion, drawing Markov chains, coming with simplified examples, etc. Is there a systematic way to train these skills other than just doing more of them and let the intuition build up slowly?
2. Do a side project. My PhD research is stats heavy but I have decent coding ability. What do you think is a good project that allows me to understand the fundamental aspects of systematic trading + showcase ML knowledge? To working quants, if there is an advanced class in applied maths/stats that you wish you had taken while in school, what would it be?
3. Networking with people in top firms. Sliding into people’s DMs on linkedin doesn’t seem that effective. My uni’s alumni catalog is not very up to date. I also don’t have a “mentor” in quant finance, like someone I can reach out to ask more specific questions. How do you find these connections?

Background: second-last year PhD in CS/Stats/ML at \~T15 US school — more well known for its stats, undergrad FAANG internship . Staying one extra year is unlikely due to funding.

P/S: how do you deal with general feelings of incompetence/inadequacy? Maybe I need therapy. I know I shouldn’t compare but several of my friends have gotten offers from Cit Sec, 2S, DE (I got the objectively worst offer among people I know). I’m used to failures during PhD but wow quant recruiting is a different beast."
zm4l5o,5,2022-12-14,Should I pursue a combined bachelor's and master's since the job market is crap right now?,FearedEngineer,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/zm4l5o/should_i_pursue_a_combined_bachelors_and_masters/,"I am a 5th-year Computer Engineering student graduating in the spring and my resume isn't the best. Also, in my school, CENG is basically EE with a little CS so I am more of an EE than CENG/CS. However, I do want to switch to the software industry. I don't have internship experience since I got ghosted by all of them but spend my summers taking classes. My senior project isn't really that impressive either. Right now, I am seeing many people in tech and engineering struggling to find a job more than ever. Even qualified students with internships and high GPA are struggling to find a job. Not only that but many tech companies have big layoffs so there is more competition. It sucks that this happens right when I am about to graduate. tbh I personally don't like college and am sick of it at this point. I don't really want to pursue a master's but I also don't want to be jobless for 1-2 years after graduating and waste time(I have a feeling this will happen to me). The pros of doing the combined BS and MS is that I don't have to take the GRE(I think that's what it's called, the grad school SAT), and it's only for one year. I also don't have to pay for it since it counts as undergrad tuition so financial aid will cover it."
zm5qkh,3,2022-12-14,Therapy didn’t help me,throwaway948272895,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/zm5qkh/therapy_didnt_help_me/,"I have been working on my mental health for about 3+ years now, maybe more, and I have desperately been trying to make this work for myself. After looking at so many videos of different doctors, including dr.k, talking about disorders, depression, anxiety, and everything under the sun, I’ve found that although there have been a few occasional tips that are useful, I’m just unfixable. I’ve gone to therapy for about 6 months now, and my therapist has helped me with absolutely nothing. They usually don’t  remember what I’ve told them before, and their only method seems to be to try and turn everything I say into a good thing. I feel I’ve wasted my money to talk to wall. 

I’m very depressed, I’m very sad, I can’t keep myself from having suicidal thoughts for at least a few days. I have all kinds of disorders from being abused, neglected, and brainwashed in a family that could barely even afford the few luxuries they owned. I’ve pushed all my pain down with video game addiction and dissociating into my studies. I’ve somehow managed to get a graduate degree, but it genuinely feels like a waste of my time. I could get jobs easily, but I can’t get myself to do any of my work. I’ve been in an internship for about 6 months and I’ve hardly done anything. I doubt they’ll hire me after seeing I’m incapable of even writing a couple pages of work.

I’ve tried very hard to do the work they’ve given me, but I just can’t. It just feels to painful to do anything at this point. I’ve sunk so many hours in trying to make myself better and nothing is working. I work out multiple times a week, I am social when I can be, I practice everything I’ve learned online, and I go to therapy, but none of it is making me feel any better. I’m thinking of dropping my therapist today. I would get a different one, but if even the famous ones on the internet can’t help me, what’s the point of looking for one to say the things I’ve already heard before. 

I wish I could just feel normal. I try so damn hard to just feel normal and it doesn’t fucking work. I don’t care that I could be getting money at a really good job right now, I can barely get myself out of bed. I’ve been sleeping 12+ hours a day more than 50% of the days this year, and about an equal amount of times, the first words I think or say is “I fucking hate my life. I wish I was dead.” I’ve regretted not finding better methods of suicide when I was younger, and I’ve been seriously trying to plan my exit. The only reason I made it this far was because people were so sure I’d feel better after school or at a job, but I feel worse knowing it was a lie.

If you’ve gone through anything like this and have ways to feel better please let me know. I’ve already tried alcohol, and other drugs. Video games don’t make me happy. The only way I can even stop feeling bad is when I sleep and just delay my thoughts, although often it’s hard to sleep when my thoughts are so loud and hurtful."
zm5vpg,1,2022-12-14,Can I still work for big brands even if I only did internships for small brands (15 people max) ?,shilohcrossing,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zm5vpg/can_i_still_work_for_big_brands_even_if_i_only/,"I would like to become a product manager for a big brand part of LVMH or Kering but I only did a few internships: three of them were for well known brands but didn’t last long. One of them was for a small french brand which is trying to open more stores in france. 
And the last one, the one I’m doing, used to be a brand that was a little bit popular but now it’s not anymore, but I’m a product manager assistant so I know I’m gonna learn a lot. 

But I do worry because all of my friends work for big brands and I’m afraid that with my experiences I wouldn’t be able to work for well known high fashion brands :/ 

Do you think the companies we interned for really matter in the long run? Do well known brands actually care about our experience and do not look at if we did an internship at Dior or nah ? 

Thanks in advance for your replies !"
zm5zmx,2,2022-12-14,I want to be a SWE but I love ML/DL... is there a way to do both ?,CelKyo,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/zm5zmx/i_want_to_be_a_swe_but_i_love_mldl_is_there_a_way/,"I'm starting my end-of-study internship in about 2 months, as a SWE. I'm certain that's what I want to do.

However, my degree is very math heavy and I love it too. I love stats, data science but I **do not** want to be a Data Scientist, I want to write good code and build meaningful stuff (not import python modules). I was determined to abandon all the ML etc for my upcoming career, but a recent project where I had to create a neural network from scratch (hence, write good code and build meaningful stuff) made me love it again.

I know this is a very unclear question, and I appreciate any feedback : is there a way for people like me to be a SWE without giving up on math and all the stuff involved?"

I am currently a high school senior applying to universities atm for Biology major looking to go to medical school. Some of them including Rutgers, Umass, Northeastern, WashU, etc. I was doing some thinking lately and have noticed that attending instate would possibly outweigh the positives of ""better schools"" OOS. Like for example I am going to compare my situation at Rutgers and Northeastern.

&amp;#x200B;

Rutgers-NB

Instate Tuition

Close to home / prob going to not stay in droms

Family has lots of connections in hospitals around the area and has pretty great chances at getting internships, shadowing opportunities, etc

Some friends attending there next yr

\-----------------

Northeastern

OOS Tuition

Lots of great hospitals around the area for internships and volunteering

heard Northeastern has great pathway to Harvard Medical School Internships

love Boston as a city very cool

Great social scene / many other colleges around area

&amp;#x200B;

I just want other people's opinions of this situation. Thank you."

I shot by shot, and somehow this recruiting season I ended up with some offers. However, now I need help deciding between them. Although I have four offers, I am mostly deciding between Splunk and Nvidia (but for the sake of accuracy, I have all four of them listed in the poll just in case).

Here's a breakdown of pros/cons for each company:

Axon: 

PROS:

* Remote (neutral honestly)
* $47hr
* The team really likes me, as quoted from their offer email: ""you did a phenomenal job during our interviews""

CONS:

* Not as invested in the company/interested in the work
* I do want an in person experience
* I will have to reneg cause I accepted this offer early on

Oracle: 

PROS:

* In person
* $41/hr
* good intern -&gt; full time conversion
* Work is interesting (security part of SWE)

CONS:

* I would have to go to Austin, TX for this (ew texas :) )
* lowest pay of my offers
* would have to reneg, cause they only gave me 48 hours to sign offer

Splunk: 

PROS:

* In person, can live at home
* $48/hr + $6000 ""relocation"" (I get relocation even though I live at home)
* I love the company and what they do
* i like their work culture, as everyone I talked to there has been lovely

CONS:

* Unsure how often interns get converted to full time
* my role would focus on testing SW, but I'm not as interested in the testing side

Nvidia: 

PROS:

* i might be able to meet my lord and savior jensen
* in person, i can live at home
* $49hr + $550/week stipend (12 weeks)
* I know they have a good intern -&gt; full time conversion
* The work is interesting, as it's security based and helping create tools for other teams in nvidia

CONS:

* I would need to code in python even though Im not as familiar with python
* I'm concerned about the work/life balance, since I've heard a lot of nvidians have to work hard

Since I am a current junior, I want to work hard to try to get a full-time offer from whatever company I end up interning at. I would love to hear everyones opinions!!

zm7wzq,0,2022-12-14,Why do they make it so impossible to become a teacher?,GabbyTheLegend,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/zm7wzq/why_do_they_make_it_so_impossible_to_become_a/,"So I have a year and a half left until I get my degree and the stress is already piling on top of me.

For some context I’m getting my degree in elementary education with a early childhood endorsements in the state of Wyoming. I’m still trying to decide if I want to be a preschool teacher or an elementary school teacher. 

Next semester I start doing my internship for my early childhood endorsement. I was excited for just a moment because I work at a preschool so I asked my professor for that class if I could use one of the teachers at the place that I work at as my mentor teacher. The issue is that my mentor teacher has to have a bachelors degree in early childhood. None of the people that I work with have their bachelors though. They all have their CDA’s. 

I don’t understand why a CDA doesn’t count but now I have to find another place to do it at. the main issue is that I start my practicum for student teaching in the fall so I’m trying to save up as much as I can. Another thing that 
Bums me out is that I finally got an assistant teaching position where I work and I’m going to lose it. 

The internship is going to take 15 hours of my week away that I could be making money that goes into my savings account for student teaching!

On top of all this I’m having to figure out everything for my student teaching. Where am I going to live? Where am I going to do my student teaching at? Is it going to be at a city that I can find housing in? What am I going to do if I run out of money? 

I have been a big ball of stress for the last two weeks straight. I’ve broke. Out in stress acne like you wouldn’t imagine. I don’t know what to do! 

Does anyone have any advice to give as to how they got through their student teaching? Any advice that might ease my anxiety would be much appreciated!!"

I had initially started with Python around the end of 2020, but I couldn’t understand the Google coursera Python course, so I tried some tutorial videos on YouTube which did help somewhat, but I couldn’t do much else other than write “hello world”  I did try FreeCodeCamp for around 6 mos. until the beginning of the year when a friend of mine recommended JavaScript. I initially found JavaScript to be interesting at first especially considering how I could use it for Machine Learning (it’s why I was initially interested in Python), but I’m finding the 70hr Udemy course I got to be a slog and I can’t code in the language outside of following along in the tutorial. It also doesn’t help that my current job basically requires me to do around 2.5 jobs since they effectively have me running the place while paying me less than everyone else there (I did apply for the management job since I was doing management work since August but I have to wait until the new year before they’ll formally give me an offer) which leaves me mentally exhausted. I’m just wondering if I should either look at a bootcamp at this point, or start applying for internships or just forget about getting a CS job altogether"
zmabk9,5,2022-12-14,Are these red flags?,nancybotwinnn,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/zmabk9/are_these_red_flags/,"Hi everyone, so I’m a 23 year old data engineer. I work for a software company that is a late stage start up. 

I have worked for this company since my junior summer internship in college. I have been here in total 2 years now, and I do enjoy working for the company, but something’s have happened in the org that have made me feel a little uneasy, and being that this is my first job out of college I don’t have a lot of perspective on what is normal vs what is a red flag.

So I personally have never had any truly bad experiences at this company, I have met some of my best friends and have enjoyed myself these last 2 years.

My concerns:

Firstly, the company is rapidly changing. The execs want to IPO and so we r hiring lots of new people, and cutting slack where we can to optimize the business. Recently we had our first ever lay offs in our 10 years of business.

I have heard rumors of our office and people operations employees being very toxic and apparently we have a few former employees suing us for the way they were treated. I have not personally experienced this and have had a positive experience making relationships, but I am not on their side of the business.

Rather than promoting high performing employees to manager roles, recently they have just been bringing in outside talent, and it seems increasingly harder to move up in rank

The most concerning one to me, a lot of really great employees, some who have been here for 3 months, some who have been here 3 years, have left the org and there seems to always be some kind of drama with it.

Overall, there seems to have been a big shift in company culture in the last bit, and while I have not experienced anything bad, I know those who have, and it concerns me."
zmaoeq,3,2022-12-14,Can I land a GIS Analyst/Dev role after obtaining a GIS grad certificate?,Classic_Garbage3291,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/zmaoeq/can_i_land_a_gis_analystdev_role_after_obtaining/,"I'm a natural resource specialist with a bachelors in Environmental Science, but I'm hoping to transition into the GIS field. I've never held a GIS tech role, but due to my line of work, I have quite a few years of GIS experience as we use it immensely. Although the agency I work for still uses ArcGIS Desktop/ArcMap, I've jumped into learning FOSS, ArcGIS Pro, AGOL, and even a little bit of scripting/Python. 

I've found that some of my favorite work responsibilities involve GIS &amp; data analysis, so I've decided to pursue a GIS graduate certificate (specifically in programming &amp; web development) with an option to get my Master’s in Data Science. 

I'm hoping to finish the certificate in about a year, and I was wondering which GIS positions I could qualify for with a bachelors, 4+ years of GIS experience, and a GIS grad certificate? I hope to one-day become a GIS developer, but I'd be happy with a specialist or analyst role and gradually work my way up to that! 

I was also curious what others think about GIS internships and tech roles (as there are several of these positions open in my area). Do you think I meet the qualifications for these?"

* What key questions should I ask the hiring manager/my potential supervisor?
* What should I look out for in terms of work culture/their data infrastructure/size of the teams etc.
* Any other things I should look at before accepting a particular job?

Cheers guys, wish everyone a happy Thursday!"

I (m19), am a Computer Science major averaging a 67.2 in government 2306. I consulted the syllabus, and it stated that I am failing?? I believe that this is because I missed both the first test and the final exam. I contacted my professor about this, and I hope he lets me make it up because I can not get an internship without a good GPA.

Would greatly appreciate to have career advice?

I am majoring in Finance with a concentration in investment analysis and will be graduating in May 2023. I am 26 year old.

I did an internship with Raymond James this summer in the Mutual Fund and ETF research team. And current doing an internship at a SearchFund company as an unpaid private equity intern. 

I have been talking to my friends who are studying data engineering, which made me realize that I like technology and technical skills, and it also would suit me best since English is my second language. I have been in touch with my finance professor to see if I should do an M.S. in computer science to start my career over. He told me not to because he saw more people regret pursuing a master's and Ph.D. than getting a job and making a slow transition. 

I am currently enrolled in a data science BootCamp and taking five classes. I am fresh to computer science. 

I wonder what possible ways for me to land a data engineering job or something data related to making a smooth transition since I will graduate in May of 2023.

Thank you."
zmdvd6,3,2022-12-15,Should I bother applying for an MBA program?,PhantomDiclonius,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/zmdvd6/should_i_bother_applying_for_an_mba_program/," 

Hello everyone. To be honest, I’m a bit of a mess right now and am trying to get my life together. I entered college back in 2010 as a computer science major but I couldn’t get passed the programming classes so I ended up switching my major to business administration with a concentration in information systems. I eventually graduated in 2015 but to be honest, I really didn’t enjoy my time in the major and dreaded the idea of taking the GRE/GMAT and apply to continue to study the subject in a graduate program. I ended up finishing the undergraduate program mostly because my parents forced me to finish college. However I did get to study abroad in Japan which I really enjoyed. Aside from that though, I was able to scrape by with a 3.08 GPA. Since graduating from college in 2015 I’ve just been working mediocre entry-level jobs such as fast food and warehouses. I’ve tried applying for better positions but it’s so hard to find a good job. Whenever I find a job that requires a bachelors degree I’m unqualified for it because I don’t have 5 years experience in whatever they want. And the few times that I am interviewed for a position, I’m always told that they’ve moved onto another candidate. I have Asperger’s Syndrome which is a social disorder so it can sometimes be a challenge for me to communicate in interviews. It’s also a learning disability so I had to work twice as hard as the average college student.

Aside from my mediocre jobs though, these past 7 years I’ve tried various other ways to make money and build skills such as selling art, live-streaming on YouTube and Twitch, Editing videos/images with Adobe Photoshop and Premiere Pro, Dropshipping, 3D-Modeling, studying Japanese to teach English in Japan, investing in the stock market and cryptocurrency, and I’ve even tried going back to school at my local community college to try getting a bachelors degree in computer science a second time to fulfill my lifelong dream of becoming a video game designer but everything ends in failure for me.

I feel like a failure right now. I have a bachelors degree but I’m 30 years old still living with my parents. I’m also currently unemployed, I quit my warehouse job last month because I gave my 2-weeks notice after unfortunately falling for a remote job scam and being tricked into handling over my personal information. I’ve been job hunting like crazy ever since and have had nothing call me back aside from commission jobs and low-paying fast-food jobs, everyone else just rejects me. After falling so low I’ve been considering going back to school to get an MBA but I’m scared to death of the idea of paying $100,000+ and not finishing the program because it’s too difficult for me to handle. Like I said, I barely scraped by my undergrad program with a 3.08 GPA and I only have about $19,000 in my bank at the moment. I can’t afford an MBA program without taking out loans (which I was fortunate to not have to do with my undergrad program because I got a scholarship and lived close enough to commute to campus).

I feel like my 7 years of experimenting that I did after college was my way of running away from the dreadful idea of continuing my study of business administration at an even more difficult level. I tried everything and succeeded at nothing. But again the high price of an MBA program terrifies me but I feel at this point, it might be necessary in order to get a real career. I have heard that online MBA programs are cheaper but I feel that might put me at a disadvantage as I won’t have campus resources to help me due to my learning condition. And this is all just assuming if I’m able to even get accepted into a program. I haven’t even considered the GRE/GMAT, Letters of Req, Essays, and especially work experience I’d need to include on my application. All I have for work experience is fast food, warehouse, and a 3-month radio station internship from college. I never considered looking into MBA programs until now not just because of the workload and high price, but because I figured that I’m not good enough to even apply for one in the first place.

TL;DR I am struggling to find a job and am considering applying for an MBA program but am terrified by the high price and thought of failing."

I took up law after class 12 as I have a family background in law with my parents and sister having studied law, so it came as a natural suggestion from them. Also I see doing law as a great backup, as you are self employed as a practitioner. 

However I as of now am feeling OKAYish about law, I have done a few internships and seen the work in a first hand experience at the local district and High Courts and I am not feeling too good or excited about it. I see most of the people in this field, even notable names are doing it only for the sole purpose of earning money and lack motivation to learn more or be excited towards it.

People rarely care about learning more in this field. They are not excited and happy about it. Most are super stressed, unhappy working from 5am to 12 am in the night, rarely spending time with family and still earning about ~ Rs.1 Lakh/month from it

Now my story : 

I have always been interested in Computers since I was a kid, but the only good way to make it big in CS in India is Class 12 -&gt; JEE -&gt; CS Engineering from good college. I have heard other ways like degree of BCA or bootcamps are not worth it in employers eyes and get 1/2 salary of CS engineer grads. I did not go the JEE way as I am weak at Chemistry and Maths and felt I might perform poorly.

However, I do have a liking towards Tech and as my friend suggested I did learn web development on my own through courses. I am also passionate about business would love to try my hands at it.

It is not the case that i hate law, but feel OKAYish, however CS and Businesses (specially tech) excite me.

Now I still have good 2 years in front of me in my law degree wherein I can still explore more into any field. Beyond which I would necessarily have to start working in law itself. 

Therefore I am looking for suggestions based on my situation as to what should I do further. Any help would be greatly appreciated 😊

Then 2020 happened and with all the stress surrounding college, switching to virtual classes, the news, and just the fact that I felt pretty nervous about college, I fell behind hard and ended up dropping out. Shortly after that (end of 2020, early 2021) I took an online webdev bootcamp in udemy and learned all about html, css, javascript, nodejs, etc. I've taken a few other courses since then and I'm currently taking one on Go, but the thing is I've also been searching for a job for like half a year now and have been unsuccessful. I've been told ""you don't need a CS degree to be a programmer"" on the internet for a long time but pretty much every job I've applied to has denied my application. I'm stuck in that classic loophole where jobs want me to have experience but I can't gain experience without getting a job. And I've never really worked on a big project before, only some static websites. I tried looking into internships but pretty much all of them require that I either have a degree (not a CS one, just a degree), or be a student (I should note I live in Puerto Rico and there aren't that many tech jobs here, my plan was always to eventually move to the US after I get enough money to relocate). Then there are other problems that I know I have such as being introverted, having bad social skills, lack of self-discipline, impostor syndrome, etc. So I've been seriously considering attempting a CS degree again only if because a CS degree might even out my playing field and college might help me overcome the other problems I've mentioned."
zmnraw,1,2022-12-15,"Considering to do a Ph.D. in international relations at 34 in Belgium/the Netherlands, BUT...!",louis062016,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/zmnraw/considering_to_do_a_phd_in_international/,"Hello, 

Ever since graduating with a MA in European Studies in 2011, I've been thinking about doing a Ph.D. I've always loved university environments, from when I first toured Cambridge University at age 16 through my time studying at universities I've attended in Europe and abroad. I feel so energetic just being there. I've been told I'm the teacher type (which I could see myself doing, specifically at a university), and I think I would love to earn my money undertaking research, publishing, teaching, attending conferences, etc. If I would win the lottery, I'd travel with my family for fun and research/write/surround myself with books for purpose. I've tried all sorts of other careers and I've never felt at home or happy with the work. I feel like if I don't do this, I'd always regret not trying.

Previously, my financial/family situation didn't allow me to undertake this intense \~5-year project while making NO money etc. But now, financially we might just make it work. That being said, I'm extremely insecure. I cannot recollect the number of times I've reached out to people to ask them for informational interviews, only to feel too insecure to move ahead. I have so many thoughts that hold me back:

1. Is my picture too romantic? I don't even know what the reality of doing a Ph.D. is like, what are the downsides? 
2. Related to that, I have a family with young kids so that's a fact, but don't other people with kids combine busy, hectic jobs with deadlines, too? Genuinely interested: how bad does it get? 
3. My knowledge feels stale and I feel like I forgot a lot. How do I bridge the gap?
4. How do I get back to working and thinking academically after working at such a 'tactical' level all this time? Writing newsletters vs. a thesis? Would employers see me as equipped for the job if I get a Ph.D., after working operationally for so long?
5. Related to the previous question, how would employers view my 'colorful' resume (several relevant internships but no publications to my name, working in IT for a couple of years, then freelancing as a copywriter, and now working as a communications officer)? The purpose of the Ph.D. would be preferably to pursue a career in academia, perhaps someday work as a researcher/adviser in a think tank. 
6. Am I too old? How could I compete as say, a postdoc, at age 40  (am now 34), with the kind of 23-year-olds that have finished 5 internships by the time they were 19 and are currently running for president?!
7. What if I can't find a relevant job at all after I complete the Ph.D.? We're hopping from one global crisis to the next, job insecurity abound, and if I'd again fail in getting the job I want I'd feel like an even bigger loser. All the effort of getting a Ph.D. and then ending up as a comms adviser again (nothing wrong with comms, it's just that I want to do something else), only set back by 5 years. :/ (P.S. working as a comms adviser in a university setting no, too confronting/depressing.)
8. Is it a bad sign that I don't have a specific research idea yet, as I'm now just considering whether to do a Ph.D. or not? I previously contacted a potential supervisor, and he said only to do a Ph.D. in case of a Burrrning research question, whereas I was thinking I would explore and research a topic through the Ph.D. and then teach/expand on that knowledge later on in my career. Again, too naive?!
9. Is it a bad sign that, besides raising our two kids and working in unfulfilling jobs, I haven't had the energy to follow developments in the field I'd love to work in? 
10. On top of that, my former BA thesis adviser told me that only high-potentials (ambitious internships/work, publications, etc.) get into paid Ph.D. programs (not in those words, but that's what she meant, also subtly pointing out that I don't fall in that category, \*note taken\* LOL). What does that mean, I couldn't teach as an unpaid Ph.D.?!

I wonder if after so many thoughts anyone is left reading, but would love your thoughts/insights on ANY of my questions! :) 

Thank you, thank you, thank you."

My brother however thinks that doing mbbs from nepal or bangaladesh is a better idea since he believes that there is no scope in bds. My father used to say the same thing too

My brother is doing his mbbs from nepal and said that it can be a good Choice and that we can consider it

I think doing mbbs from nepal or any other country is a better way for future

I dont have any particular intrest in any field in my life so i am fine with both

Fees is not gonna be that big of issue

From what i know

Pro and cons of each

BDS - 

pros - better mental health , lower stress and a slightly lower course time

Cons- it is oversaturated, people in india do not care about dental health that much , starting salary is low in clinics and that it is hard to suceed even with MDS

MBBS- 

Pros - better wage, government jobs have more positions for mbbs compared to Dental, 

Cons- worse mental health due to load , PG is really hard and can be a barrier, FMGes have to clear thier country licensing exam and do a extra year in internship in India"

The intern pay is exactly the same for both hourly pay and the stipend. I'm going to be graduating next year though, so I want to take into account the full-time roles for both of these companies as well. Also, I have already accepted the Yext offer, so I would need to reneg to accept Samsara.

My reasons for taking Samsara would be that it's a cooler company than Yext, and is working on more interesting things. Also, their new grad pay is higher (\~185k vs 166k). Additionally, I worked at Yext last year so Samsara would be a brand-new experience for me. Samsara is also more like a start-up and I would likely be given a chance to work on some cool stuff there.

My reasons for taking Yext would be that I would be working on a completely different team that changes me from front-end focused to fully back-end focus, which is what I want. I'm not sure what I would be doing at Samsara, meaning I could be stuck with a really bad team. Also, I just love New York. It's one of my favorite places and I have some friends going there from college. Even though San Fransisco is great, I'm not sure how much I would enjoy it there.

I want to learn about computers, but CIT is a business degree so it doesn't count. 

I have to do online classes, want to do CS but ""what? Online degrees are useless! College is all about networking and internships!"" 

I already have a degree in a non computer field, but who pays for a degree just to be an intern and network with people who see themselves as God's among men? 

I want to learn, couldn't I just build projects and do bug bounties etc and use those to cover for a lack of internships? I'm interested in creating software and cybersecurity mostly. 

Got told I need to quit my ""unrelated"" job and go look for internships. 

I'm a felon as well and it's not so simple for me. So idk. I'm thinking of just giving up on my dreams. It's just impossible to do anything in this world with all these restrictions and obsession with looks, money,  etc."
zms6r1,44,2022-12-15,Passed A+,YeahMann,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/zms6r1/passed_a/,"I scheduled both the 1101 and 1102 for yesterday afternoon. I failed the 1101 on my first try, which really bummed me out and made me doubt myself a little. But, I rallied and passed the 1102 shortly after. I decided to retake the 1101 this morning and passed, completing my certification. 

As far as past experience goes, I have a bachelor's degree with a major in IT which definitely had some overlap, and I held an internship last summer that gave me some rudimentary hands-on experience.

Takebacks:

I could have studied more. I spent about 1-2 hours per day for the past 2 weeks using Professor Messer videos (godsend) and free practice tests that I found online. I could have scored higher if I had given myself more time, but a pass is a pass and I wanted this cert to help with my job search.

Once I failed the first one, I had a better idea of the question structure and I think that helped with the consequent attempts. Also, I had a lot of repeated questions on my second attempt of 1101 (PBQs were the exact same).

The amount of printer questions was very surprising - make sure you know how each different printer operates and what parts may be responsible for a specific issue. Also, the wording on some of the questions really sucked - a lot of multiple choice where 2 answers are obviously wrong, and the other 2 are both good options, and you are prompted to choose the 'best'. This had me second guessing a lot of my responses.

Any questions are welcome."

I have no previous internships either, just some undergraduate research in discrete event simulation. 

Should I be applying for internships or entry level positions at this point? 
Also what type of roles (generalist, game design, etc.)? 
Lastly would it be better to try getting a software dev role outside of the game industry at this point and trying again later with more experience?"

I recently started working at a relatively small company this week. The first days consisted of me meeting the team and learning the different programs we use. I asked for a task and got one. I was told to review scripts and try to improve them. The thing is, I was never told how to “improve” anything, since all of the codes work perfectly fine. The codes are in a language I am not familiar with and all of my teammates know this. I spent hours learning how to set up my environment, since they never explained how to. I constantly feel like I’m teaching myself the basics that they assume I already know. I never received any formal training and the company doesn’t use any documentations, so I can’t even refer to anything.  

To be completely frank, I had no idea what my role is as an intern since I was not given any exceptions. The task that I received so far is vague and does not have a deadline. I was recently asked what I do and I couldn’t even explain it to a coworker because I don’t even know. I feel dumb and overwhelmed because everyone around me seems to understand what they are doing, but I just don’t seem to get it.

Is this how SE internships suppose to be? Am I suppose to just wait around until I’m assigned a project?"

I have applied to many companies, got to the AC for Sky (failed sadly) and have high hopes for Lloyds Banking(45k pa).

Wanted to ask if you guys can share your experiences/knowledge of what companies have good graduate schemes or work environments for graduates. Or what companies to avoid at all costs.

Currently, I do not have any dev work experience or internship, but try to avoid applying for jobs that pay under 35k in London. My view is if a company is not willing to pay me at least 35k in London, they are likely not a good place to grow and won't be valued. That being said, if a given company provides a good opportunity to grow I am willing to get lower pay.

I would love to hear from any expats working in France in the tech industry (especially at Station F or under the French Tech visa).

I'm currently a computer science master's student living in the UK; I've lived here my entire life and am thoroughly bored, as well as pretty jealous of my international student friends. I have a strong first class degree from Oxbridge and then obviously this master's, which I'm doing pretty well in too. My main areas of interest are natural language processing, data science, and also 'people-facing' tech roles like product management and sales engineering (I have 1 year of experience in product and sales roles at tech startups from working during my degrees). I would hope that with my education, experience in people-facing tech roles and technical skills themselves, I have a pretty valuable skillset for an immigrant?

I want to move to France because it's close to my family and culturally familiar while still being a change of scene; I have C1 French, consume a lot of French media and dated a guy studying in France for a while lol so I visited him and got pretty familiar with his uni (he's at ENS-PSL). I would like to move as close to October 2023 as possible.

Here are a few plans I could see:
- an M2 in NLP or cognitive science, since I only have an M1 equivalent so far. This is my preferred option and I have already applied to ENS-PSL and Paris Cité. If anyone has advice on options *outside* Paris in the areas of natural language processing or computational cognitive modelling, that would be fantastic. (There is still the question of whether to go into a job or a PhD after the M2 -- I guess this depends on what happens during my stage, but do you think either is a safer option for visas?)
- a lab internship followed by a PhD (contrat doctoral). I am in touch with one lab in Paris that works in my field, so this could be possible. I would probably rather get a job directly than do a PhD, however (although I did love researching during my undergrad and cognitive machine learning is a fascinating field which I won't really get to go into if I don't pursue academia).
- a job at a startup via the French Tech visa. I would love to do this but really don't know how to distinguish myself from French and EU candidates who don't require visas in my applications.
- joining an accelerator programme like Entrepreneur First. This is the wildcard option -- I do want to found a startup, but was always thinking I'd do it after a few years of experience. But maybe this route is easier to get a visa through than a job?

I could alternatively get a tech job in the UK and get some experience first, but I would prefer to move to France as young as I possibly can so that I don't get tied down here by relationship or other commitments."

First, thanks for hearing me out, I really appreciate your time and in helping me out.

I'm a new employee at this small-sized company. Started +- 4 months ago. First project was to design a simple PCB, which I designed, triple checked, did design review with mentors, and asked colleague to check as well. No one saw the mistake. 

Since I was the designer got blamed (I'm not saying I shouldn't be - I agree with the assessment). In short, PCB is still usable, but the features I've added are gone.

Feel like shit right now, wondering if I should quit the job, maybe is too much for me to handle. A few other remarks:

. Very lucky getting this job. I feel like they have given me a chance, since my interview was a disaster.

. I'm pretty much the ""intern"" of the whole company.

. Working from home.

I'm not on Reddit much these days, but have been feeling very discouraged and shitty lately, mostly about my lack of a job. I mostly just want to get it off my chest, so I appreciate you reading. If you have any advice or thoughts, those would be appreciated! (also, I'm sorry it's so long!)

Let's take it in timeline form, shall we?

March - May 2020: I finish up my senior year of college at home (thanks Covid!). It goes fine, but I haven't started applying to jobs or thinking about my next move. I'm a journalist, with interest and experience in publishing. Job hunting kind of scares me, honestly. Most of my internships were with small organizations, and I never had to embark on a long hunt for an internship. Also, Covid hits. I barely leave the house.

June - August 2020: A professor asks me to continue a project I was working on through the summer. I agree, and it goes fine. The summer passes.

September - December 2020: The first project ends, I'm asked to do another one. I agree. I start to job hunt - very sporadically. I have a few interviews, but nobody bites.

January - June 2021: I start a freelance job. A lot of my time is eaten up by this, so my job hunt remains sporadic, but I have a few more interviews. I also start to write essays online.

June - December 2021: Around September, I have a hiccup with the freelancing, and I stop job hunting completely so I can focus on getting better with that. I don't send any applications the whole rest of the year. I do start going to therapy, and am encouraged to sign up with a bookclub and writing group. Those help, in regards to seeing people on a regular basis other than family members and the local baristas.

January  - August 2022: In April, I start to job hunt again, mainly using LinkedIn. This turns out to be a bad idea, as I finally come to understand by August. I was applying for jobs that on the surface seemed like what I was trained in, but aren't really. I bemoan the waste. I start another freelance job in June. In July, I am offered a job (huzzah!). Unfortunately, I can't take it because I don't have a driver's license for health reasons.

August 2022 - Now: I'm still job hunting. Not very quickly, haven't had that many interviews, but I'm still doing it. I'm now able to get a license and am learning to drive, it's going okay. I have depth perception issues, and that's not helpful at all, but I am getting better. Therapy ended because my therapist left the company. Toward the end of my time there, I didn't know what to talk about, and conversations ended up being about the positive stuff on the surface that wasn't worth diving into. ""I went to the bookstore, and bought something!"" That kind of thing. I was honestly relieved to have a break, but now I'm wondering if I should get back to it and find someone else who can actually help.

I don't have a lot of friends. One friend I text with regularly, and I have two friends I see in person every so often. They are both struggling too, so conversations can occasionally get awkward. I work at home, and don't go out much because I can never decide what to do. Sometimes, I take myself for coffee or shopping for baking ingredients. Occasionally, I think about taking a dance class, but I haven't signed up yet. I do yoga and weight training classes, but they're with my parents, which doesn't really help the whole independence thing.

I used to be a good student, but now when working at home, I get horrifically distracted in a way I never used to. Everything workwise seems to take longer than it used to, even stuff I usually like doing. I'm behind on many freelance projects because I can't seem to find the motivation. I have finished up some stuff this week, which feels great, but in general, I get really distracted then feel bad about it. I use the internet for research, and can't seem to get myself off wikipedia or tvtropes rabbit holes. I keep telling myself to get better with this but I'm not really sure how to do that.

I'm not even sure exactly what I'm looking for, honestly. I'm just so tired, and I haven't even really gotten anywhere yet. I know I need to apply to jobs more regularly. Maybe I should go to a conference? That's a little scary too, but I'm coming up on three years of being out of college (24yo now) and I feel like the past few years have sort of been a waste. I live at home, and it's alright, but some part of me feels degenerated back down to when I was in high school; I feel shyer and not as independent as I'd like to be. I'm currently a freelancer, and it's fine, but I know I'm not enough of a hustler that I can make it a full-time career. I think I'd like to go to grad school, but I don't know what I'd study, really. I'm living at home, and I feel like I'm waiting for something, but I don't really know what. I feel like there's this decision of what my next move is that's been barrelling down the tracks to me for the past few years, and I still don't know what to do, and I kind of hate myself for it.

If you've made it this far, I appreciate you reading all the way to the end, and would appreciate any thoughts or advice. Happy Thursday. :)"
zn1a1t,70,2022-12-15,[WA] Employee at former internship harassed me after I left,pixiestix897,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/zn1a1t/wa_employee_at_former_internship_harassed_me/,"I'm studying CS and this summer I had a software engineering internship at a well-known tech company. I had a great experience and learned a lot, and I received a full-time return offer.

But a few weeks I after my internship ended, someone from the team messaged me on LinkedIn. He said he had an interest in my minor (computational biology) and asked me if I wanted to grab a coffee to chat about it. Honestly, I got a bad vibe from him when I interacted with him during the internship, so I politely declined. He said no problem and that was that.

Then the next week he messages me again, and says this weekend he's visiting a friend near my school and asked if I wanted to grab a coffee just to catch up, and that he could give me some career advice if I wanted. I politely decline again. This time he didn't react well, and told me I came off as arrogant and should act more humble because I'm not that good, and then tells me all the ways he think I was incompetent during my internship. He framed this as ""constructive feedback"". I didn't reply. Two days later he messages me again and says he hopes I'm aware he can get my offer revoked and it will depend on how generous he's feeling.

Can I report this harrassment anonymously to the company? I am returning there as a full-time employee next year so I don't want to burn any bridges. How should I handle this?"

I have a DS920+ with working WOL, but now I want to access it outside of my network (WOW). I get that I have to use port forwarding, to get that magic packet to my NAS. 

But on my router I can only enter the intern and extern ports (probably 9) and one IP: 192.168.1.255 but my router says this IP is invalid. I read that I have to forward it to this address because I need to send the package to all the IP's in my network until it finds a match. I also understand (I think), that I need to send it to the IP and MAC of my router.

I'm learning constantly about these new things, so I hope someone understands my question and could help me. Or if it's even possible with this router.

My question is: How to set this up?

Please let me know if I gave wrong or incomplete info, I thank you all in advance!"

Common App:   The lessons we take from obstacles we encounter can be fundamental to later success. Recount a time when you faced a challenge, setback, or failure. How did it affect you, and what did you learn from the experience? 

Talked about my struggle to get elected as student gov president, faced problems due to being 2 years younger than my peers, not knowing anyone at the school while the majority of students knew each other and having a lack of leadership experience due to being homeschooled. Overall a 7.5/10

Supplement: Unusual circumstances in my life

Talked about my experience studying at a homeschool centre. About the abundance of mentally disabled kids present, and the lack of resources, teachers and motivated students. The main point was that even though the centre had a lot of flaws, the flaws ended up turning me into a more emotionally mature person after I graduated. Overall at 8.5/10.

**Essays**: Really weird essay about my photography as a way to imagine pasts and present. I would rate it an 9/10, unique topic and well-written.

Supplements connect being Black with science, but in a very well thought out way. I and everyone I showed loved these, maybe 9/10.

**LORs:**

10-11th grade CS teacher: In addition to being super involved with my ECs, he's a former English teacher and I talk books with him constantly.

11th grade English teacher: Taught a Mexican/African American studies focused English class, but I was like one of two Black kids in his class. We gave each other hip-hop recommendations and we often traded books--I introduced him to Octavia Butler and afro-futurism, and the TASS summer camp I did was about afro-futurism!

Counselor - We're pretty close and meet all the time.

Supplement recs - I got two recs from my TASS professors (both study literature), one from Cornell and one from URochester. Both went to Princeton for grad school (not that that matters).

**Schools:**

I graduated with a &gt; 3.5 GPA, no internships though. I do not care about working at a cool or hip tech company. I do not care about making a lot of money(I want health insurance). I do not want to work for a company that: 1.) makes surveillance software
2.) is a military or intelligence contractor
3.) fintech/web3/crypto

Fuck me for thinking this wasn't too much to ask. I'm having an incredibly hard time finding openings I'm qualified for at companies I can get behind. I'm becoming increasingly exhausted, demotivated, jaded, etc just trying to find potential opportunities. As someone who doesn't know what they want/what theyre good at, but knows exactly what they *dont* want...What are my options? What do I need to be doing differently?"

I recently got an interview scheduled with the facilities department at my university after connecting with a guy who works there because of a separate internship I'm doing. He had me contact the director, and I've got an interview scheduled about a month from now. The thing is, I'm barely ending my first semester and am fresh out of high school so I'm not entirely sure how much experience they're expecting me to have. I did send in a resume, but the only ""jobs"" I've had so far are basically community service jobs, including the internship I'm in right now. Not that I didn't have to work for these, but they have no engineering of any kind involved in them and outside of that, I don't have a background in engineering either. I'm currently majoring in mechanical engineering and only became interested in it around my senior year of high school and by then, it was too late to start joining higher division math and science classes so now I'm giving it my all in college. I've already joined a couple of clubs (Robotics, Solar, etc), but still have no real skills to show for it. Right now I'm on winter break so I'm putting all my effort into learning Excel and Python since it sounds like they work with data a lot. I am also looking up common job interview questions to prepare. It will probably be obvious that I'm very inexperienced, but I'm hoping they'll understand and will be more interested in my willingness to learn and do the work rather than my hard skills right now. I guess what I'm looking for is suggestions for how to prepare, and things I should learn or brush up on before interview day. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

zn5be5,3,2022-12-15,Any tips for a soon-to-be (junior) team lead?,csbutcantmath,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/zn5be5/any_tips_for_a_soontobe_junior_team_lead/,"I'm not an experienced dev by any means. I've only been at my current company for 10 months, and the only experience I have before this was an 8 month internship at a small startup.

Recently my manager asked me (for the 2nd time) if I was interested in becoming a team lead. They've been trying to grow the department and have already hired external team leads without much success. The first person left after a month of being with us, and the second person got fired after having too many conflicts with our team. So they wanted to go back to internal promotion.

My manager said my strengths are that I get along with everyone, that I communicate well, that I enforce good practices like taking notes in meetings and making sure everyone's voices are heard. I am also interested in going into management, but not this early in my career since on a technical level, I'm basically the most junior dev in the entire department (5 teams, roughly 30 engineers in total).

I also haven't finished my undergrad yet since I'm self funding it and basically ran out of money right after my 3rd year. I'm still making progress, but have only been able to take 1 course per semester since I've started working so it'll probably take another 3-4 years before I complete it. All that's to say I'm not sure if there'll be added responsibility that comes with the team lead title and if I'll have the headspace to be a good leader while completing school.

That being said, I do also see this as a nice opportunity, and said I'd be interested in shadowing my manager for a bit. That part got added in my annual review with HR, and apparently other team leads are also on board, so I guess it's semi-official now.

What are some advice you would give to a new team lead?

Thanks!"
zn5q3e,2,2022-12-15,which one to choose IT OPERATIONS /NETWORKING /Data science ?,garp206125,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/zn5q3e/which_one_to_choose_it_operations_networking_data/,"
I'll enter into final year of my bachelor's of science programme. I am doing a computer science degree with focus on computer systems and networks. As of now I am confused for which field I should start preparing myself. During the university I have studied networking, telecommunications, programming and will study more about computer systems next year. 

I have a summer internship experience as a operation manager/scrum master in IT. I also got introduced to DevOps from here. 

 So I am really confused where exactly I should start. I have a experience in operations and i did well during my internship but i was reading on the internet that operations don't really have good scope down the line( please correct me if I'm wrong). 

Almost all the people I know are working as Data scientist, or in field of AI , machine Learning. So should I just pursue it because this field is currently offering lot of jobs. Or should I go into Networking or choose to become a DevOps engineer. These all fields have different roles and career path. But I really don't know which one to choose. What if I ended up choosing a wrong one (I meant if I didn't liked it afterwards, I am saying it in my personal context, I don't mean that some of these career paths are wrong).  Am I a idiot for still not knowing where to go, because all the people I saw on LinkedIn are passionate about something and here I am still have no idea what the hell to do."

I know python and Java , I need to build something over the break to up my chances at an internship but I don’t know what to do. I don’t even know where to start, should I be doing front or back end? What language? What should I build? 



Feels like every time I start something I’m not really learning moreso just following a tutorial. Also feels like everything is just website construction related, what other paths are there. What to do?"

This is a new company and I’m still trying to maintain a good impression. I went out of my way to avoid social situations at my last company and it definitely had a negative affect on my day to day just because I was terrified of pursuing a close professional relationship (I don’t know why but a close professional relationship is so intimidating to me).

So I was completely dreading this Christmas party. I had a knot in my stomach on Monday morning knowing it was approaching and couldn’t focus on anything all day on Tuesday. Wednesday (day of the party) was just as bad mentally for me, but I pushed myself through it, picked up my wife, and introduced her to as many people as I could during the party. It felt like every time I introduced her to a co worker I rushed my sentences and was really nervous. Luckily at dinner we sat on a table across from some younger interns that I was comfortable and confident around. But the first 90% of time we were at the party was pure torture because I am not charismatic at all. 

I was incredibly depressed and defeated on the drive home because all I could think was that I was going to be the same “awkward loser” that I was at my previous company.

Fast forward to this morning - an older guy who’s an assistant that I work with, let’s call him Tom, and really like sits in a cubicle because he’s changed his career recently. The CEO of our company was making his rounds like he does every morning, said hi to me, and then struck up a conversation with Tom and wanted to know how the party was last night. Tom basically said “it was fun! But I wasn’t there long”, and my boss said “yeah I didn’t see you there for long”, and Tom said “I’m not a very social guy. I’m good with people but like to keep them at an arms length”. My boss genuinely said “that’s okay! I don’t blame you at all, the point of these parties is to have an opportunity for the field guys to meet the office guys”. 

Tom admitting his reluctance to social situations made me feel really good. I admire that attitude and confidence and needed that desperately to accept the person that I am"

**Letters of Recommendation**

(8/10)- Art Teacher would regularly call me over to give advice to students or to just have my opinion. Very close relationship, and they mentioned spending extra time on my letter. Engaged in casual conversations regularly, but I always had a serious attitude when regarding work.

(7/10)- Calc Teacher. They are generally well liked by students but only agreed to write letters for a select few. Regularly talk to them in casual conversation, but also an active participant in class.

(7/10)- Boss. Glowing rec about special interactions with students. 

**Interviews**

(*Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)*

(7/10)- Nailed all of the interview questions and talked about my artwork. Although their major is different from my intended major, I was able to gain knowledge about double majoring. Funnily enough their roommate has the same interests as me. 

**Essays**

*My common app was about my experiences working at my family's store, and how I learned to be perceptive from watching shoplifters. I spent 2 weeks working on my supplements, and was told that I creatively answered the prompts by other people. For why major, I wrote about creating art, and having to innovate in a situation like an engineer.* 

**Decisions**

*Acceptances:*

* Rice University (ED)

 **Additional Information:** 

At my school, the typical AP course load is 2-3 per year because we have mandatory arts classes built into our curriculum.

I think one of Rice's core values is community, so I geared a lot of my writing towards my qualitative impact on specific people because I didn't have any impressive achievements. My goal was to come off as an externally sensitive person. Considering how small Rice is, my personal voice here must've really struck them. 

I applied under the Visual and Dramatic Arts Major, so I submitted a respectable portfolio. It included technical drawings, creative pieces, and paintings, and it is definitely good enough for less selective art colleges. Rice doesn't admit by major, so I will be picking up some sort of engineering. 

Not sure if it was included in my school profile, but I live in an urban area where my daily commute is 3hrs round trip, so I had less time for ecs and school. 

I think it was really hard to gauge my qualifications because most people don't come from an arts magnet school, but I found Rice to be my ticket to the stem world. When looking at the CDS, an overwhelming majority of admits had a test score, and I felt really discouraged.  It was really hard to find other people in a situation similar to mine, so I hope that this is a beacon of hope for the next person."
zn6wbw,2,2022-12-16,Should I bite the bullet and transfer schools?,eruhhimamess44,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/zn6wbw/should_i_bite_the_bullet_and_transfer_schools/,"I know college is not amazing for everyone, and I know I am not alone in how I am feeling. I just cannot turn to my parents or family for advice, so I hope that some people will be willing to share some advice/wisdom because I am at my wits end turning the thoughts around in my head.

I am currently a sophomore at college. I have made good grades, am on the e-board of one of the most popular clubs on campus, am in the honors program, and have been accepted into a selective program within the honors program. None of that is important because I still feel stuck. I go to my in-state school because I chose it. However, I chose this school because it was the cheapest option and the easiest pathway to a degree as I am low-income and first gen. It was my last choice.

I have made a lot of friends and networked with professors and professionals. I have a professor who is willing to help me apply for internships, and he is going to recommend me for one in D.C.

I have tried pursuing studying abroad (which is something I really want to do), but the university is not much help (it notoriously makes it hard for students). I have been sent on a wild goose chase to figure out who to talk to actually make it happen.

I know I have pursued a lot of things. However, a lot of what I do now parallels what I do in high school, which is something I did not want. I wanted to explore more. I worked hard in high school to get out of my state to receive better education as my state is one of the lowest-ranking states for education (and everything else). I feel like I am just stuck in purgatory trying to get out again and that I am losing my youth to it.

I have tried to engage with all the stuff going on on campus (as there are tens of thousands of people), but I hate that it is so big. I would rather be at a smaller school with more opportunities for my field and for studying abroad and expanding my worldview, but I feel dread at starting over because that means everything I built here to try to be content with myself and my position has meant nothing.

I am very grateful that I have to opportunity to attend college and receive financial aid and do all these wonderful things. I recognize my privilege and reflect on it every day. I have tried to shake this feeling, and I just can't. I know that part of it stems from elitism because I come from a competitive high school and going to a state school is frowned upon and ridiculed. Just today, I visited my high school with some friends, and I would be ignored completely or negative comments would be made when I would tell teachers where I ended up. I have even gotten this from family. I have had strangers twice laugh in my face when I told them where I go. I want to drive them wrong too. I want to prove that I am still of value and that I can take my degree from this school and do great things and achieve so much. However, I am also not happy with the quality of life my school provides. I want out."

I’m a second year law student preparing for executive in June 2023.(I know I should’ve started last year but I had a very demanding job in digital marketing which I needed to stay financially afloat)

Anyways, I attempted CSEET without really thinking about it because I thought that it’s only an addition to my law degree which will ultimately help me in get a better package and in my LLM applications. But I’ve realised that CS in itself is a whole career path which can be equally rewarding to law. 

Earlier I was thinking that I’ll do internships while preparing for executive and professional, but today I read about the 21 month articleship which is compulsory in order to become a practicing CS.

My question is, should I prioritise law or CS?(my preference would be law or rather litigation but I’m looking for a practical approach that helps me be financially independent)

Does a Law Firm consider the Articleship as experience?

I am new to the subreddit but I figured this would be a pretty good place to ask this question. If you read this post and think a different subreddit would be more applicable please let me know! Any help is greatly appreciated. 

Anyways, I have just finished my first semester at college and have really been enjoying computer science. My college has an open curriculum so I took Comp sci 101, psych 101, econ 100, and a history class. I am pretty positive I want to major in computer science as I have become very fond of it and genuinely enjoy going to class and completing projects. 

My main question is that is there a way I could find an internship after only a year of college for the summer? After this year, I’ll have a basic understanding of both python and C++ but I am not sure if it is enough to get hired anywhere. I go to a pretty academically rigorous college and have a pretty good GPA (not sure about how finals went but we’ll see) so I am hoping that might be helpful. 

I am not really sure where to look into this type of stuff and would definitely appreciate some help in this regard. Thanks! :)"

2. The interview was cut short. Suppose to be 30 minutes but they came late (zoom interview ) it was 14-15 minutes at max 

3. I asked when can I hear back from you and they said January is when the interns will start but we will email you at the end of December so you will hear back at the end of December. 


4. They told me the exact duties of the job 


5. I told them my weakness is my leadership skills and how I am more hands on and then 

When I asked what their ideal candidates are they told me people who are willing to learn and work on their leadership skills.



Did I get the job??? I think I did really bad for some reason. Like I felt so stupid 


They also hinted that they were understaffed too"

I'm a 23 M looking to apply R2 for the Fall 2023 course. My GPA is 7.8/10 from a Tier 2 College (Non IIT) and I graduated with distinction with a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering. I know the GPA is a bit low but I dealt with depression and BPD and worked through it and I managed to end my last semester with an SGPA of 10.

I just have the GMAT online today and got an unofficial score of 730 (Q49/V40). While waiting for the official score I would atleast wants to narrow down my choices.

WE: 2 years at Goldman Sachs in Operations. If it means anything, I converted to full time after an internship where I was the top performer. Recently quit my job and my last day will be in Jan.

ECs: Participation in debates, elocutions and Model UNs throughout school. Was part of the leadership team of the Literature club in my college. If considered as ECs, I've got multiple gold medals in Olympiads - English, Math and Cyber.

Reason for MBA: I never really wanted to work as a software developer but took it because having an in depth understanding of tech would come useful in any field. At GS, I felt like I hit my ceiling as to how much I can learn and even growth didn't really add many new opportunities. Plus I do not wish to be typecasted by working in Operations for too long so I wanted to move on ASAP.

My Targets are UCLA Anderson, Yale SOM and Duke Fuqua. Will also keep Tepper and Emory Goizueta as relatively safer options.

So am I in the right ballpark or am I way off? Thanks for reading and for your help!"

I ended up with getting a degree in business finance but at the end of school it was not something that I could see myself doing in the future.  During college I did not have enough time to do any type of internships as I was involved in division 1 athletics on two different teams.  Upon graduating college I went back to my seasonal job and went back to school to get additional certification as an EMT.  In off season I worked in the maritime industry doing sales and retail as well as athletic training for a local club.  After the pandemic, I was really not happy with my current job and decided recently to quit.  Now I have been applying to jobs for a couple months with very little success.  Have had a few interviews but have not had a single job offer.  I am just getting so discouraged.  I have ten plus years working for the same company on top of that a college degree and experience elsewhere and I am feeling as though its all been in vain.  It is making me feel as though I have no actual job skills.  I am only looking for an entry level jobs and at this point the pay is becoming less and less important.  Is there any advice out there for me?"

\- Part-time CS major graduating in 2024.

\- Was offered a full-time dev position (full stack web dev) a few months ago and have been working in the role.  It is a local company.

\- Also have a Summer 2023 internship offer from a Fortune 500 company.

\- Goal: applying for (and get) new grad positions upon graduation in 2024, preferably with FAANG.

&amp;#x200B;

The job is going well and I am learning a lot.  And the pay is decent.  However, it is a small, no-name company and I wonder if doing a summer internship at a Fortune 500 would make me a more competitive candidate for new grad positions.  I cannot do both concurrently so I will have to quit my dev job if I were to go for the internship.  What do you all think?

znhbd7,148,2022-12-16,Job searching journey of a final year FASS student,phandamquan,nus,https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/znhbd7/job_searching_journey_of_a_final_year_fass_student/,"December is the month when many students start applying for internships/full-time jobs. As a FASS student who just graduated this semester, I have gone through the job searching journey in the last few months. I recalled when I started searching for full-time jobs, there were not many in-depth posts on r/nus about this topic (especially for FASS students), so I thought I just write a detailed review for other students to refer to. Hopefully, this post will be useful to many people!

**1. Background**

I’m an international student joining FASS in August 2019 and graduated in November 2022 with an Honours degree with a double major in Geography and Political Science. Upon joining NUS, I took the Tuition Grant that required me to work 3 years in a Singapore entity after graduation. I also took some student loans from DBS and OCBC that I need to repay after graduation. This background means I have more pressure to quickly find a full-time job in Singapore to fulfil the Tuition Grant requirement and repay my debt.

When I started my full-time job applications, my CAP was 4.56, and I had the experience of doing 4 internships, 3 part-time jobs, a UROP module and a final year research project during my years in NUS. Nevertheless, I only mentioned 2-3 internship experiences and my final year research project in my resume and during the interviews as they were the most relevant.

**2. Job-searching journey**

Before I start my job-searching journey, I created a detailed CV where I elaborate on all my experience from year 1 to year 4. From that detailed CV, I created six resumes catering to different positions that I focus on, most of which are business research analyst positions.

I started my job-searching process on 12/07/2022, accelerated it from August and finished the process on 22/11/2022 when I secured a decent job offer. I mostly used LinkedIn to look for positions. Sometimes I used Talent Connect, My Careers Future, Facebook, NUS CFG emails, etc. to look for jobs as well, but LinkedIn was my main platform.

In total, I applied to 264 positions, 31 of which invited me to participate in the first round of interviews/assessments. After 3 rounds of interviews and assessments, I gained three job offers, and I failed the rest of them due to bad performance, incomplete assessment and administrative hindrances that prevented the employer from hiring foreigners.

**3. Reflection**

The recruitment process for hiring a full-time worker seems to be much stricter than hiring an intern. In my previous years, I only had 20-30 applications for each “internship hunting” season to secure one offer. For each internship position, I only attended 1-2 interviews, the questions during those interviews were quite simple, and the interview only took about 30 minutes to one hour. Yet when I looked for full-time jobs, I had to do various writing tests, presentation tests, case study- and scenario-based questions during interviews that usually last from one hour to three hours. Questions during the interviews were more complicated, which required me to elaborate on the thinking process that I gained from previous work/project experience and convincingly link it to the job description.

Because of the more demanding requirement, I spent much more time preparing for interviews/assessments than I anticipated. I researched the businesses/projects that the employers were doing, writing some critical analyses on the job processes of my previous internships. I also thought about hard questions that can appear and answering them in ways that demonstrate my efforts in researching the job and demonstrate the relevance of my previous experience. Additionally, I also looked up the LinkedIn profiles of my interviewers to see their expertise, so I could anticipate which type of questions they may ask and which questions they are comfortable answering.

Nevertheless, no matter how detailed I prepared, I always faced questions that I didn’t prepare that required me to improvise quickly. For those questions, I had to quickly recall my previous experience and see if there were relevant points that I could make to answer those questions. If I could not find any relevant experience, I had to stretch other experiences to answer the interviewer’s questions, which were less convincing and made me answer in a nervous tone that failed. When I found a relevant experience, I answered in a more structured way with a more relaxing tone, which made the answers sound more convincing.

**4. Memorable moments**

I had some interviews where the interviewers started asking me irrelevant questions after asking about my experience. For example, they asked me “Why did you come to Singapore? What do your parents do? Do you have other siblings?”. Initially, I was uncomfortable answering these too-personal and irrelevant questions. But later on, I think they asked those questions because they felt I could not answer their previous questions convincingly. They had already decided not to hire me and then proceeded with more personal questions that anyone could answer to relax the atmosphere.

Another memorable moment was my interview with a manager who also grew up in my hometown. Every time I answered her questions, she kept saying “Can you be more specific?”. It made me realise my problem of not answering the question directly and specifically enough, which helped me realise the characteristics of my hometown’s culture. My hometown is known for having a culture that avoids direct questions, refrains from providing direct answers, and favours the practice of “skirting” around problems to avoid touching on sensitive issues and avoid hurting other people’s self-esteem. This culture is good when a person is faced with politically sensitive questions and he/she cannot reveal his/her true thoughts, but it may not be appropriate in the job-searching context when employers prefer direct answers to save time.

**5. Final thoughts**

My case cannot represent all NUS students. Some people don’t even have to search for a job because they received a return offer from the place where they interned before, others are very talented when they received offers for most of the positions they applied to. But there are also other people struggling to find a job due to the lack of skills, experience, and stiff competition where hundreds or thousands of people apply for the same position.

In my hometown, many people consider NUS to be a top-tier, global university, so NUS students will face no difficulties in finding jobs. After four months of job searching, it appears that having the “brand” of graduating from a top university doesn’t make me have an easy time finding jobs. The degrees of difficulties depend on many factors: the academic majors, manpower shortage, political-economic situations, etc. and most importantly my experience and competency.

I'm pretty proud of my Columbia supplements. They were the first ones I wrote, so they weren't as good as some of the RD supplements I wrote for other schools. I really liked my media lists, I love reading, so I was happy to bring that into my application.

So some background, I graduated from university in May of this year and I'm a 22 year old guy. I have been working at a small life insurance back office/ brokerage for around two years. I started as an intern and eventually got offered a full-time position. I have gotten to know all my coworkers pretty well and I am well liked in the office. My boss is pretty laid back, as a young adult, I look up to him and admire the business and success he created from the ground up. The company is great, with occasional parties and good benefits.

With that being said, there are some downfalls to my job. Often times I find myself with not much to do (which could be a good thing to some) but my strong work ethic cannot stand sitting around waiting for work I can complete in under an hour multiple times a day. I also find myself annoyed with my 40 min daily commute to and from the office. Lastly, I am not satisfied with how much I am earning. I still live with my parents and would like to live in a new city or at least move out in the next year or so. 

Next, with my free time at work, I found myself applying for a few jobs. One caught my eye, it is a business development representative role at a software company. My friend's older brother works there and seems to do well for himself. This role is remote and the company sells to businesses that interest me like golf courses and athletic clubs. Travel is also a solid attribute of the role. Long story short, I made it to the second interview and I feel as if I am one of the top candidates in this role out of 85 others.

My question for y'all is, what should I do? My original career goal was to stay in the insurance/finance industry and become an advisor of some sort. My current job gave me a solid bonus this year and is treating us all to a nice dinner next week. What do I make of this? I don't want to burn bridges with my current place of employment, but I feel like this BDR role could definitely rival my current job especially if the pay is more and is remote.

I am an intern working in London and want to make a constructive, rewarding future for myself, rather than thinking about it sitting here.

I work as a Software Dev but, I don’t do much ‘development’ per se in my current role, so I am trying to find opportunities at work where I can develop my programming skills. 

I believe I can do it, but through lack of a great mentor, my environment, my own [bad] habits do cause issues. However, I’m constantly working on these issues, and don’t find them as bad as I describe them. 

I want to ask if there are any entrepreneurs who can mentor me, or coach me or even just provide some useful advice that I can take with me and utilise whilst I am moving through my twenties. 

I think life is more than just accepting a stable job (though I like it) and settling for less, I think my energy can be better used to challenge myself greatly and be that person for myself that always sets a high standard, whilst being humble and attentive to people."

During my final university year I took an internship in banking industry which ended with no full time offer and not so pleasant feedback about some aspects of my performance. 

After that I’ve been working for more than 1.5 years in another bigger bank, in a very related role gaining some new experience considering products and stuff. 

Recently the first bank had a job opening which very much matches my experience and skills and I would like to apply because 
a) the corporate culture there is great and the place I am working right now is a bit toxic
b) I am pretty sure I can expect a decent pay bumb 

The problem is the new role is with the same team I had been an intern in before, and I haven’t been in any kind of contact with them since parting because it was so painful to accept that they didn’t see me as a part of their team. 

How should I approach applying to them one more time? Should I write a message to the senior guy in the team after 1.5 years of no contact asking him to consider me for the role? Wouldn’t it look a bit inappropriate since I didn’t write a word all that time? Or should I just apply the regular way through official recruiting process (their HR team)? Or am I just overthinking the whole thing?"

znt5t5,2,2022-12-16,What job should I look for?,GravitysFallen,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/znt5t5/what_job_should_i_look_for/,"I’ll start this off by saying that I need to leave my current job, but won’t do it until I have another job lined up, and finding another job is tearing me apart right now. Also this is long and I’ll give the best tldr I can 

Current job, started may 10th 2022: working in the oil fields (graduated college and had no idea what I wanted to do, but knew I could make a lot of money while figuring it out), my job title itself is Line Boss on a frac site, to summarize what I personally do, there are around 10 or so different companies on site, and I have to keep them up to date on what’s going on at certain points of fracking so that everyone knows when they need to do their jobs. Aside from that, I am also responsible for training all the new hires as I’m the only person on my crew that is not the supervisor or our treater (second behind supervisor)  that knows how to properly run all of our equipment. On some jobs, I am also responsible for making sure my crew knows when they need to perform certain actions as well as assisting them in any issues they have when something goes wrong (things go wrong A LOT, so I have to help my guys out on their equipment often to make sure we get the job done correctly). I have quite a few more responsibilities in my role as well, however; if you’ve never been on a frac site it will all just sound like a bunch of jargon so I’ll leave it out.   

What kind of job I am looking for? Still don’t have an exact industry that I KNOW I want to work in, but I want to continue to stay on roles of leadership as I truly believe all of my guys love working with me since I’m always out there in the shitty weather with them, getting muddy, and greasy just like they are, while my 2 higher ups sit in a truck all day doing nothing. I’ve also had multiple new members to my crew tell me that they enjoyed learning the equipment with me as I covered it very thoroughly and was good at explaining how and why the machines work the way they do. 

The part that differs a bit, is I don’t need to be a position of leadership, nor do I care where I work  I really only care about money, this job is miserable, I work 105-110 hour weeks, 2 weeks on and 1 week off, and as the line boss, I have to walk up and down 150 feet of iron with 10k psi on it, so if one thing goes wrong, I could die at any moment, not to mention this company has apparently never heard of OSHA. Now I know this community and people are going to flip shit when they hear 110 hour work weeks, but I really don’t care about that, I just want to come home to my house everyday. 

Now what I went to college for, was industrial distribution and system informations through the school of engineering at A&amp;M. Started in computer science, made it through data structures and algorithms then decided I couldn’t force myself to do the work for those classes anymore, so I changed majors, however I’m not against continuing to improve on my programming, just had 0 drive while I was in school. 

The overall of the major is a split focus between mechanical/electrical engineering and business to business relations. 

Mechanical side: physics, material science, junior and senior level mechanics courses 

Electrical side: physics as well, PLCs (building and programming them) a lot of circuits in general both with ac and dc motors
 
Business side: sales, business to business relations, data analysis through powerbi and python, management, six sigma, quality assurance, logistics, purchasing, forecasting, statistics, business law, accounting, then multiple different information systems 

It seems a lot more focused on business, but the balance was that we had the same core as the rest of engineering school, so all of my core was still programming and math related courses. 

Now I would not mind working mechanical or electrical engineering jobs and I’m pretty comfortable that I would be more than capable of performing, but since my major isn’t specifically for those roles that I don’t know if I would have a chance getting a job in either of those titles. So I have kind of ruled that out as an option. 

 because of how big that program is at my school, there’s around 100 companies that recruit directly from my major, but typically only if you had an internship with them, and I made the mistake of being a full time student year round instead of taking an internship. So I screwed myself out there. I had a few interviews with some of those companies and they always chose someone that had an internship with them over me, so I feel pretty hopeless there as well. 

Where I’ve been applying to since then? Pretty much any job from 5k less than what I make now to anything that makes more, in the same industry as me and any other job I see in the pay range, and I cannot even get an interview. I think it’s because my resume and I am going to pay one of the big resume writer websites to work with me to build one because obviously whatever I made on my own isn’t working. Mentioning pay, I am disgustingly underpaid here for the amount of work I do and all of the responsibilities I have as 80% of what I do should be my supervisors job and not mine, but it’s better than not having a job and I enjoy spending time with my brothers on the crew. 

From here, as mentioned before, im going to work with a resume writing company to get mine as well written as possible, and then start trying to connect with recruiters that will help me through the applications as well since im apparently doing no favors for myself. I also probably have friends from college that I could reach out to for letters of recommendations to potentially work with the same companies they do, but I guess I have some sort of I need to do shit on my own complex that makes me not want to do that? Which I know is completely stupid. 

But from here I don’t know what else I should be doing, I don’t know where I SHOULD be looking for jobs at, or how to get into another industry I have no experience in, I don’t know how to explain on a 1 page resume all of the skills and knowledge I gained from my major in college, and life in general, I don’t even know how to find a recruiter, but I’ll be researching more into that. And as much as I love my parents, I have a military dad, and a mom who’s worked the same job for 40 years, neither of which went to college, so they aren’t really a great first hand source of information on this topic 

Any advice at all is welcomed and I’d be glad to hear it because im extremely lost 



TLDR: cannot stay at current job, need new job before quitting, have a degree through school of engineering at A&amp;M, not a specified engineering major, more focused on business management in engineering related fields. Do not care what job I work as long as I come home every night and make 80k+, willing to drop down to 65/70 if I can move up and out of position in reasonable time. Suck at applying for jobs and need advice on finding recruiter and what industries to even look for jobs in. 


I know this is very loaded with a lot of information, but any questions y’all have, feel free to ask and I’ll update things under his point"
znt7t7,1,2022-12-16,Internship: Pay vs. company name/experience?,a2c_alt2,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/znt7t7/internship_pay_vs_company_nameexperience/,"I'm a junior applying for my last internship (but my first SWE one), and am lucky enough to have offers from two companies, but I can't figure out which one I should prioritize. The first is Walmart, at their HQ in Arkansas, and they're offering me $30/hr + corporate housing. I go to school and live in NYC, so Arkansas would be a little out of the way and I wouldn't see any friends the whole summer. On the other hand I feel like Walmart Global Tech probably has some pull or at least some solid name recognition on my resume for next year when I apply for new grad roles.

The other company is Hashicorp, which would be fully remote, and pay ~$40/hr. This would let me stay in the city over the summer and I wouldn't be in the middle of nowhere. But I also lowkey hate the idea of waking up everyday just to walk two feet over to my desk to ""go to work"" in my microscopic bedroom with a window that faces a brick wall. I could get a desk at a wework and still make more than Walmart, but in general, I don't like the idea of remote work at all, and feel like I'd be doing a lot less learning and networking compared to an in-person opportunity. While the company promotes its remote culture, and claims it doesn't hinder their productivity at all, I'm a little wary of it, especially as an intern who'd have to learn much more than a normal engineer. I also feel like Hashicorp somehow has less prestige/recognition than Walmart, and might not look as good on my resume, despite being a pretty big and fast-growing company. It's also not recession-proof like Walmart is.

I want to take the position that will advance me the most for new grad next year, but I also want to make enough money to get a nicer apartment and help pay for school, and I want to balance all that with mental health (seeing friends and working in my bedroom all day vs. working in an office and not seeing friends). What would you do in my situation?"

Talked about my struggle to get elected as student gov president, faced problems due to being 2 years younger than my peers, not knowing anyone at the school while the majority of students knew each other and having a lack of leadership experience due to being homeschooled. Overall a 7.5/10

Supplement: Unusual circumstances in my life

Talked about my experience studying at a homeschool centre. About the abundance of mentally disabled kids present, and the lack of resources, teachers and motivated students. The main point was that even though the centre had a lot of flaws, the flaws ended up turning me into a more emotionally mature person after I graduated. Overall at 8.5/10.

For context, I am a sophomore studying computer science at a state school. I had 1 previous internship which was remote at a relatively mid-sized company at $25/hour. This year I got offers from both Garmin and Paramount, and am conflicted between the two. Here are some details about the two:

Garmin:

* In person (Kansas City Office)
* Housing included
* Good intern culture
* More relevant work
* $30/hour (lower pay)

Paramount:

* Remote
* More prestigious?
* $38/hour (higher pay)

Right now,  I am learning towards Garmin, especially since I was remote last summer as well. I've heard that being in person is super rewarding in terms of making friends, learning more, and growing as a person.

I would take time and finish it BUT i am on scholarship and loudly depend on it. I’d like to graduate on time and not in debt.

I am planing on going forth with it and majoring in an interdisciplinary studies of both computer science and digital arts - since these are two fields that thoroughly enjoy. I would choose the name for the major so It’ll definitely say both cs and da. I’m now seeing many posts that an IC is a “useless” degree and now i’m terrified. I have brokephobia and cannot imagine how i’d be to be jobless after graduation. I’ve held AMAZING internships relating to CS and see many more coming.

Help. CS is already an interdisciplinary field so I have some hope but guys.. i really need advice. I’ve talked to my advisor and professor and they all think this would be a good fit for me .. but what do you all think? Will I get a job? Will my degree be worthless?

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, I was doing a CS project alone without any of my group members contributing. My mom saw me and said I should practice for my final and someone should do my project for me. I tried to indicate to her that I want do my project alone, but my mom insisted that I should get someone do it for me. She called my uncle who was on the other side of the world to do for me. This really bugged me. Now my mom says I always ask for help. What should I say to her?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!

**Extracurriculars/Activities**

1. President of my school's game development club in 10th, 11th, and 12th grade -- I grew the club from \~10 members to \~50, and I helped teams make award-winning games. Although the numbers aren't incredibly impressive on paper, I'm super genuinely proud of my club members and spreading my passion for game development!
2. Vice President of my school's mid-size TSA club
3. Swim captain, Varsity 4 years
4. Video game/software development hobbyist -- Led predominantly male teams in creating video games/software for fun, self-learned coding and 3D modelling for it
5. Co-author/co-illustrator of a children's story -- published on Amazon
6. Intern at a Stanford startup -- attracted 500k+ views, 80k+ likes, and 20k+ signups through TikTok
7. Animated short film creator -- Invited by a Harvard biotech startup to create an animated short about COVID vaccines. Gained 60k+ views total
8. Intern at a startup VR/AR agency -- codes &amp; 3D models
9. Social media influencer on TikTok and YouTube -- posts pretty shameless fanart of anime &amp; video games, gained over 150k followers/\~4 million likes on TikTok and \~1 million views/10k subscribers on YouTube
10. Club swimming since 6th grade -- qualified for Districts and was an alternate for State

1. TSA Nationals: Children's Stories #1, Software Development #3
2. Won a regional game dev competition
3. Won a state game dev competition multiple times
4. USACO Silver
5. National Merit Semifinalist

**Letters of Recommendation**

I think my letters of rec were a big factor for why I got in, and I'm super grateful for the teachers that wrote me them.

1. School IB Visual Arts teacher (11/10) -- She described me as one of the best students and artists she'd ever come across and was a huge support in creating my children's story. We had a close relationship and she was super enthusiastic about everything I did and I can't thank her enough!!
2. School IB Physics teacher (10/10) -- We had a close relationship and I definitely shone bright in her class. She became my favorite teacher of all time and helped me discover a love for physics, and I remember having a bunch of inside jokes with her and filling up her whiteboard with huge physics-related drawings.
3. Stanford startup mentor (8/10) -- I definitely didn't shine as much while working with him since I was working on college apps at the same time and I was a virtual/remote intern, but he wrote it after a TikTok I had made for his company went viral, so it was definitely not bad :)

**Interviews**

My interview went pretty well -- I felt like I came off a bit too strong since I was nervous (he was taking notes the whole time which scared the hell out of me) but I think I showed my personality and passion for creation well. He was pretty stoic/unreactive so I couldn't tell what he was thinking but he cracked a joke in his follow-up email and seemed pretty impressed which made me feel better!

**Essays**

I also think my essays were a big factor in my admission! I'm still really happy with my personal statement.

* Personal statement: I took a huuuge risk, hahaha. I wrote about how I got obsessed with furries and fursuit dancing in middle school (even mentioning how furries are famous for strange fetishes &amp; cringeworthy behavior), spontaneously made an entire fursuit, and then danced in it in front of the entire school. I connected the whole thing to discovering a love for the process of creation, spontaneity, and learning new skills. I used a lot of humor and self-deprecation but also confidence and I think my voice shone through! Also, I put a link to a picture of the fursuit in my additional info section LOL
* Supplementals: I wrote about loving teamwork, entrepreneurship, swim, etc. and I definitely think my voice was strong.

**Art Portfolio**

I also had a supplementary art portfolio with 8 paintings and 2 sculptures, which I think was a big boost.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

Accepted into Stanford REA!! This has been my dream college for as long as I can remember. I'm so grateful to everyone who supported me, especially my teachers, friends, and parents.

I definitely didn't have a clear ""spike"" in the sense that most people have but I think it manifested in a general clear love for creation &amp; entrepreneurship. A lot of people have said my personality really fits Stanford so being risky, unique, and playful with my essays was definitely a big boost. Overall I'm so lucky and honored to be accepted into my dream school... it still doesn't feel real and I'm gonna be spending the next couple of months processing this!!"

Then, the recruiter told me **I PASSED the technical interviews** and the next and final step is **30 min** interview with engineering manager. We scheduled it for the next day (Thursday, the week before the deadline). The interview went great again. He knew one employee that worked in the same team I did in my previous internship, and we even stayed 25-30 minutes longer to chat that it was allocated for the interview. We also talked about life in the city where that position is, and in the end I was fully expecting an offer since everything went great.

Well, couple of days later, they missed my deadline (Tuesday) so I had to accept another offer that I received before, and I was thinking to accept Databricks' offer too and do two internships. Fast forward to Friday, I received a rejection and I'm pretty sure they just rejected me because they missed the deadline and knew I accepted that offer. I asked the recruiter about feedback, and she said my second technical didn't go as good as the first one, but the thing is that it did go great - in fact even better than the first one. Let's say even if what the recruiter said was true, remember that they told me I passed the technical interviews before the final round with eng. manager, so rejecting after letting me pass previously is a very weird experience!"

So I had been given a chance to take a hackerrank test with JPMorgan Chase for an entry level position as a software engineer. I took this test about month ago and I have not heard anything back. I had an algorithm that worked for both but maybe they were slow algorithms. I want to know if the hiring freeze has anything to do with it because I had applied to Lockheed Martin and the state of Colorado a month ago and recently just got a response back from both of those companies. I'm wondering if they have yet to get back to me still because I've taken a hackerrank a while back for an internship with Walmart and was given a response of denial a few days after. Is there something in industry that I'm missing?"

**Essays/LORs/Interviews:**

uc piqs: these def had the most substance but thats prob because i didnt need to write any supplements :) 9/10

upenn: felt like i put a lot of effort into this so getting the axe really motivated me to shotgun the rest of my apps at 11:50pm the night of (felt like a 10/10 probably was a 6/10)

uchicago: very lame but kinda quirky? connected badminton and how ppl belittle it to how people simplify the process of baking pie 7.5/10

cornell: nail tech mommy inspired me to go into business, really casual 8/10

usc: terrible i cannot do their version of quirky 5.75/10

stanford: worst essay to date probably. the roommate essay drained me. 5.5/10

rest of them: really unmemorable tbh, but some of them spoke to the AOs so maybe they were okay

**LORs:**

business teacher / deca advisor : i had to write this myself. her draft was very generic, but my writing was still probably mid 6/10

ap bio teacher : dk why i asked her. i only had her during zoom but she is a great writer 7.6/10

counselor : she's relatively new and did not know me very well 6.5?/10

all my letters were probably mid or worse so i dont think they helped me get in at all but if it was a deciding factor... it probably got my app tossed rip

**Interviews:**

mit: -999999999999999999/10 interviewer came 15 mins late after rescheduling and called my application ""too broad"" bc he did not see the business focus. also asked why i would go to mit for bus/econ when sloan is right there. i have major beef w this man why'd he tell me that the number one students of each country apply here not just valedictorians like i dont know that. but anyways 

princeton : very chill dude i feel. both of his kids went to pton and we talked about fried chicken. 7/10

harvard: she was very non-reactive so it was kinda awk. definitely me filling in the silence while she started at me and took notes. but we both like hotpot so 6.5/10

berkeley gmp: hirevue vibes its not a real interview its recorded but it was super rushed and i submitted it 5 mins after the deadline 7.5/10

georgetown: fresh grad very nice but she thought i was applying ed and i was very much not so that was awkward bc i was too scared to correct her 8/10

i cant remember any interviews off the top of my head so if i had any others they were just mid

**Additional Information:**

okay so maybe it won't be ur very best friend but i think it worked out fine in my case (ymmv unfortunately). my details r really vague because lots of my former and current classmates lurk on here but if you have any questions feel free to ask and i'll do my best to help lol

the college app season was definitely interesting for me, but i don't think i spent too much time on the actual apps since i shotgunned. my main reason for shotgunning so many schools was my upenn rejection because it was the only school i actually spent more than 2 hours on. i even asked my friends at wharton to proofread and edit my entire app so after my efforts went to waste i said f it we ball

my uc piqs were not even a thought in my head until like the 29th so don't even worry about rushed piqs. i wrote 2 piqs for the 2 nights prior to the due date and i ended up fine but the uc piqs do give more flexibility to express who u really are as a person imo. 

i didn't do too much research into my schools bc i started apps really late into the night and din't have time to find unique resources to write about so i def recommend u find a theme to follow at each school like sustainability, etc

shotgunning was my way of clearing out the college app process but i do regret a lot of my apps as they could have been much better and potentially been an acceptance instead of a rejection :P take ur time (or dont) and do what is best for you because i am merely a college student who knows nothing about college admissions. 

this was very messy and not well written so i apologize if some of this sounds wonky, but i wanted to give some perspective from the other side of college decisions/apps as an ed applicant who got rejected twice before rd :)"

**Interviews**

None

**Essays**

Personal Statement - I wrote about my internship with the Detroit Planning and Development Department as a ninth grader. Kinda went through the route of being naive, exposed to the blight and poverty of Midtown as the rust belt era took over, and how I'm working now through policy and education to try to bring back the industrial powerhouse Detroit once was. I wanted to focus more on equipping everyone with the tools to help themselves rather than be some kind of savior (idk if that makes sense). Reviewed by my advisor, counselor, essay reviewer, and private college consultant.

Supplements: I wrote about my interest in F1, and how drivers start super young, which I related to giving children a lot of chances to explore many areas as soon as possible. I wrote about getting my private pilot license. Mentioned Eric Hanushek at the Hoover Institute (affiliated with Stanford), whose work in educational economics influenced my recommendations to the Executive Office of the Governor. Expanded more on many of my activities. Finally, I wrote my gap year supplement about how I lived independently for the first time and the lessons I learned on policy-making from my internship at the EOG.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Rejections:*

* *Stanford (REA)*

I apologize if any part of this is incomprehensible. I saw my rejection yesterday and couldn't sleep. I spoke to my counselor four hours before my decision, and she said this app is as strong as possible for me. I was deferred last year in the early round (with an app I thought was worse), so I wonder why I'm so uncompetitive. Again, I'm on two hours of sleep, so I apologize for grammar mistakes and misspellings.

I am currently a first year CS Student in a UK university, but I'm originally from Italy.

My final goal is to live and work in Switzerland as a Software Engineer, preferably in the German-speaking cities.

There are 2 reasons why I don't know where to get my Master's degree:

The first one is that in the UK I need just 1 year, instead of 2 years from a Swiss university.

Secondly I don't speak Swiss-german, but I can get a standard-German module in my current uni, even though I know that they're not the same, I don't know if it's gonna be helpful or just a waste of time.

&amp;#x200B;

What makes me want to study in Switzerland is the possibility to find friends and build my network from uni instead of going there later in life, start learning Swiss-german while keep studying in English and use the university connections to find internships.

zoch5w,0,2022-12-17,Is renting in Toronto a good enough financial trade off for my [25F] mental health?,Lonely17986,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/zoch5w/is_renting_in_toronto_a_good_enough_financial/,"Looking for some logical advice from a financial and mental perspective, and though this would be the best place to post. I've had probably the worst year of my life; New job (better pay but more demanding and learning curve), got into a car accident that got totalled (no one hurt or involved and months later got a replacement car), sister moved away (was a big part of my life and now i'm stuck miserable alone at home), no friends (all the people in uni i knew live out far and i have days where no one reaches out to me), single. I didn't grow up learning how to properly socialize, and parents distanced me from cousins/neighbours/friends. So now, I'm in a place where I have a good career trajectory, but no social skills or social life. COVID times didn't help at all, so now I'm 25 and feel like my life is just moving past me while I isolate in my room. 

I'm debating on moving to Toronto short term, even for a year for my own improvement in social life, and dating life since it's not going anywhere while I stay in Kitchener. Problem is I don't know if it'll help or not or if the rent/inflation/cost of living will be worth it. I'm just absolutely miserable at home, my parents make me anxious and stress and sad, I don't talk to them bc they trigger unhappy feelings to me, and i have no support anymore at home. I just wake up, work, and go to bed. Dating in KW hasn't been going well either, but i tend to connect more with people in GTA, but for some reason think KW is too far away to pursue anything with me. I think it's silly to drop rent in such an expensive place, but toronto is where i'll find people my age and always have things to do. I've lived there short term for internships and had so much fun. I was there this week for work (I wfh mostly but go in a few times) and it put so much less stress on me and was nice to get away from home. But I also wonder whether it's better to stay in KW, suck it up, and just save my money in hopes to buy a house or rental property in KW. Here's my financial/career situation:

1. On track to getting my CPA in about a year; have a math/business degree
2. Not crazy about my work bc it can mentally drain me, but salary is $80.6k in finance
3. I paid off all student debt already, have no debt rn
4. Because I lived home during uni and with WFH, I pretty much will have $100k saved up by end of 2022, some in savings account, investments and emergency fund. 

I'm just at a loss. I am so miserable at home, but I know grass is always greener, and maybe it's all in my head. i just hate that there's no way to improve my social/relationship life, and also i barely go into office to get socialization either. But then i don't want to miss out on an opportunity to buy property in the coming year in KW it's favourable. I'm also working through therapy, which is about $140 per session, which, clearly will impact my savings ability too, but it's something i need to truly work on. Advice?"

&amp;#x200B;

I built it with C and Assembly following a textbook. I don't know much besides Python for almost a year now, and have dabbled in a lot of other stuff, and I would say I am good at computers.

I am in two classes as well for CS, but, I graduate in one more year, but I want to get an internship for this summer or fall/winter/spring/summer next year.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know too much LC I am not that great at it, I was doing it a bit and learned how to do some of the problems, and I think I can still give a solution for some of them, but, I stopped doing it to do this, and I want to use this to get a job, how can I do this?"

Ultimately i know 100% i want to end up in PM eventually. What do you recommend? I feel like my education background can allow me to get directly into PM as new grad but lmk if i should. Also, feel free to enlighten me on which career i should pursue, which one would take me further in the long run, which may be less/more stressful"

I will begin my work with a table like this:

Here I have some product numbers (column 1) and I need to take the ""Error Message I"" (column 3) for each product number, but with the highest Position (column 2). For example, for product 1234567 I need to take the error message I from the position 7 which is ""X"" in this case.

Every error in error message I should be ""translated"" into some other string like this:

And the text I get for each product number here should be then shown in the second table here:

[https://ibb.co/j58gwdD](https://ibb.co/j58gwdD)

&amp;#x200B;

Additional info:

\- I'm exporting data for the first table from SAP so I can do all sorts of sorting

\- Highest positions are not the same for every product number

\- Error message I is in German and needs to be translated to English and translation in the SAP is already done and that's why I need the step II where we ""translate"" X into ""Word1"" like on the second screenshot. So here I can have some formula that takes only the first word of a German sentence and immediately knows what to paste in the second table.

For example if the error in German says ""Kartofel Berlin Oliver Kahn"", we can only take the first word and immediately know which English counterpart should stand in the second table.

It would be perfect if all this could be done in as few steps as possible since it is intended for beginners and interns to use.

I hope I managed to explain well enough :)

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance for your help!

* *Econ Teacher:* 9.5/10. she read her rec letter out to me and it was so nice!!! she also called me ""eclectic"" in her rec, which is probably her way of saying ""absolutely insane"" but AOs don't need to know that ;)
* *French Teacher:* i'd say 8/10? i've had her since 10th grade, so she knows me very well, and she's called me ""an angel who brightens her day."" however, in what was a truly horrifying conversation, she implied that i supported child marriage so 😭 i honestly have no clue what her rec was like

**Interviews**

* had mine over zoom &amp; it was absolutely mortifying. never have i rambled so much. half the sentences that came out of my mouth didn't make sense.  i literally said ""not to quote walt whitman but also to quote walk whitman.""

**Additional Information:**

my school restricts how many APS kids can take -- freshmen aren't allowed to take any, and sophomores can only take one AP class. i was able to take AP Physics 1 in my freshman year due to my math track, but i was still restricted to only one AP class sophomore year. this limitation might've affected how my AO evaluated my course rigor, but hard to be sure

zom4co,0,2022-12-17,Is it even worth it to get into software development anymore?,help_meoutbois,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/zom4co/is_it_even_worth_it_to_get_into_software/,"I've begun to work through the Odin Project to teach myself programming. After that I had planned on learning more languages like Python, Java, SQL, Ruby, etc. I started for two main reasons. One was because I found out that I genuinely enjoy it. The other was because I want to break into the industry at some point. I have begun to think about whether I'd like to try breaking into software engineering by going completely self-taught, joining a boot camp, or going back to college for a bachelor's degree.  

To get to the gist of my question I'm wondering if I should even bother starting due to the whole ChatGPT controversy. So far I've seen two camps form. One says not to worry about AI, and tools like ChatGPT replacing software developer jobs. The other camp says we should be worried, especially for the next few years (as AI develops exponentially). Both sides have compelling points, and I can't decide whether I should pursue this career I want, or if I should choose something else.

 I'm worried that by the point I have invested lots of time, and/or money (whether it be through self-taught, boot camp, or college), AI will have wiped out many junior dev positions, at which point only the absolute cream of the crop (graduates from ivies with connections + prestigious internships) will have any chance at making it.  Feels like this ship has sailed for me which sucks because I was really enjoying learning coding, and I had hopes of eventually becoming a software engineer. Any thoughts or words of wisdom?"

**Letters of Recommendation**

(*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*

AP Physics teacher: 6/10. I did well in his class, but I hardly ever participated in class and wasn't very close to him. However, I wrote a pretty good brag sheet/questionnaire, so that might've helped.

AP World teacher: 5/10. I did well in her class, but turned in pretty much every assignment late (often by a lot, like 1 month), and never paid attention or participated in class. I think she liked me, but I wasn't very close to her or a stand-out student.

Counselor: 5-6/10. I got a new counselor at the start of my senior year, and I've talked to her for a grand total of 2 minutes. However, I wrote her a very detailed 7-page doc for the questionnaire.

PI of research lab: 8/10. The PI is the person who originally responded to my cold-email asking for a research position, and according to my mentor, he was ""very impressed"" by me. The PI also told me that he wrote a ""very strong"" letter,

**Interviews**

(*Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)*

MIT Interview: 4/10. I didn't connect too well with my interviewer and I answered some of the questions poorly, but I don't think there were any major red flags.

**Essays**

(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*

Personal statement: 7.5-8/10. I wrote about how biking helped me develop several of my core values, and tied that in with some of my important ECs. My essay was rated a 4/5 by my college counselor (who is very experienced and has worked in UPenn admissions), and a 7.5/10 by u/scholargrade.

MIT essays:

""What do you do for fun"" essay: Definitely my best MIT supp. Wrote about my love for a unique hobby I've done since I was a child. Rated 4.5/5 by my college counselor.

""Describe your world"" essay: Pretty standard tbh. Wrote about how my hometown and school community. Rated 3.75/5 by my college counselor.

""Community contribution"" essay: Wrote about how I worked with a variety of different people to build up my nonprofit. Rated 4/5 by my college counselor.

""Challenge"" essay: Somewhat cliche topic, wrote about how I resolved a massive conflict in an important group project. Rated 3.5/5 by my college counselor.

**Additional Information:** Included a link to my nonprofit website

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* MIT (EA) --&gt; will probably attend!
* In-state safety

*Pending:*

* UC Berkeley EECS (RD)
* UIUC (EA)
* Georgia Tech (EA)
* UVA (EA)
* Purdue (EA)
* UMD (EA)
* UNC (EA)
* Harvard (RD)
* Stanford (RD)

*Waitlists/Rejections:*

* UChicago (EA); deferred --&gt; withdrawn

**Reflections/takeways:**

1. DON'T ROMANTICIZE COLLEGE ESSAYS. Your essays don't have to be a unique work of art that provides a window into your heart and soul; they just have to successfully convey personal qualities (that you may or may not actually have) which will make AOs want to admit you. Don't think of the college admissions process as a chance to show your true self to AOs; think of it as an audition where you are an actor, and you want to portray your character in the best possible light. In a similar vein...
2. Aim for excellence, not authenticity or passion. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fqo68j/aos_cant_actually_detect_authenticity_or_passion/) always gets reposted every one in a while, and it's one of my favorite posts on the sub, because it dispels the narrative pushed on A2C that genuine passion is the key to a good school and that AOs can see through things you do just for college apps. In fact, the most important extracurriculars on my list (research and nonprofits) were done primarily for college apps, and I have no regrets doing them, as many people I know with just olympiads + minor ECs got rejected across the board.
3. Your essays don't have to ""stand out"" or ""be unique"". People on r/applyingtocollege constantly emphasize the need to stand out from the pool by being unique/quirky (e.g. the Costco essay), but my college counselor's approach (which I agree with) is to instead focus on writing strong, compelling essays that showcase your personal qualities, even if they don't stand out as much. Which brings me to my next point...
4. If you are a ""stereotypical"" Asian male in CS like me, MAKE SURE TO EMPHASIZE COLLABORATION, TEAMWORK, AND INTERPERSONAL INTERACTION IN YOUR ESSAYS!!! This is one of the most important points my college counselor constantly impressed on me, and I think definitely could've made the difference in me getting into MIT. I literally had something about teamwork/connecting with others in every single one of my essays, which I think was important as to avoid being perceived as an ""Asian STEM robot"".
5. Interviews are not that important unless it's an edge case (which confirms the sentiments some other people have expressed). I had a very mid interview with a school that supposedly greatly value interviews, and I still got in.
6. And most importantly... DON'T BLINDLY TAKE ANYONE'S WORD ABOUT THE ADMISSIONS PROCESS. Take what I'm saying with a grain of salt- I am not an admissions officer, and I've only gotten into two schools so far. Even take admissions officers' words with a grain of salt- AOs *constantly* sugarcoat and mislead applicants and avoid revealing ugly truths. Take the CDS and university websites with a grain of salt- those are marketing materials, not the rubric used in the reading room.
7. I'll edit this post when I hear back from the rest of my schools, and I'll make sure to read my admissions file of whichever college I end up at (probably MIT)."
zomjqb,4,2022-12-17,How often do companies nowadays ask about your grades?,FunnyTman,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/zomjqb/how_often_do_companies_nowadays_ask_about_your/,Had an interview for an internship recently. I scored one of the highest in my class and the interviewers weren’t impressed and said “You do know your grades will catch up to you in the future”. I thought software engineering companies don’t really care about your grades as long as you produce good work and are able to communicate well? They also seem to worry about my grades at college will go down when I work for them. It seems abit odd that they care so much about my grades then what I can provide and learn. It’s an internship after all. It’s a very small software company. Is this a bad sign?
zonbpc,2,2022-12-17,How frowned upon would it be to ask to end a 6 month co-op 3 weeks early to start a summer internship?,beter_buill,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/zonbpc/how_frowned_upon_would_it_be_to_ask_to_end_a_6/,"I’m a junior MechE and I’ve got a co-op lined up for next semester from mid Jan to late June and a summer internship. There’s quite a bit of overlap between the two positions and I would need to end the co-op 3 weeks early. 

Would it be a bad idea to ask to end the co-op early? For more context, the co-op is at a great big pharma company doing really interesting work and the summer internship is at a less great (still solid) chemical manufacturing company doing more generic work. 

It would be great to be able to do both just so I can get more industry experience before I graduate and also the money would be really nice.

Any advice/thoughts would be appreciated."
zoodpm,5,2022-12-17,"Remember, employers don't care about your well-being. Do what you need to care for yourself.",Illustrious_Tank_356,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/zoodpm/remember_employers_dont_care_about_your_wellbeing/,"A lot of people probably know this already, but as I hang out here it looks like quite a lot of questions or problems have a root cause of a lot of attachments to a job.

Remember, you and your employer(s) have a transactional relationship. Your employer pays you for your skills, your professionalism, and your effort. You are not paid to be disrespected, bullied, to lose sleep, etc. Any extra attachments like something bullshit like loyalty, is highly unnecessary.

Before you dismiss me as simply being cynical, let me share my experience (could get long though feel free to stop reading here). I have a ok-ish long career in IT industry having worked at multiple places averaging about 3 years each place.

TLDR: I worked in 8 jobs in IT, and everyone of them had some layoffs during my time there, often at no fault to those who were laid off. Job security is a myth. Employees loyalty is bullshit. Just do what's best for yourself as you are not responsible for anyone except yourself and your loved one.

Job 1: this place I actually worked as intern back in school, and I liked this place and they liked me, so after I graduated I joined the same team I was on. There were many people who worked here for 5/7/10+ years and honestly a rare scene in the IT industry. People here do often give their 110% or 120% (we don't get paid OT). People genuinely care and want to do a good job here, and I did too. There was this one case where we had a project that due to bad management, schedule fell way behind. It got to the point we had to try to finish 4 months of work in 5 weeks. There were a lot of OTs from everyone including myself, and we ended up pulling through and did the impossible (in management's own words). Senior management and executives even sent out emails saying how much they appreciate having us and we are truly the most valuable assets they have.
Fast forward 6 weeks, and almost everyone from the engineering team who worked on that project (basically everyone) were laid off, except the leads which got moved to project management, me, and another of my fellow engineer. It was a layoff of 30+ people for a company of around 90 people. I would always remember that day when I literally see these men and women who never complained during all the hard work, cried as they got escorted out by HR. It's also my first rude awakening that employers ultimately don't give a hoot about you. Since that day I was moved to another team, but I only give enough effort to get by work as I don't feel this company worths my 120% effort anymore. A few months later one of my friends who got laid off approached me if I wanted to make a move, and I did.

Job 2: Awesome company and awesome culture all around. Great people, great middle management. This is one of the most efficient place I worked at. People just dive to work and focus on getting things done. After my first year this place got acquired by a large US company. Although most people were kept there was still about 15% people got laid off, some I know personally and are very good workers. The reason of the layoff was removing ""redundancy"". Another small awakening that employers don't give a hoot and you are just a number. I stayed for another few years but as things go on, the large corp bureaucracy started creeping into the company's culture, and things became less and less fun. One of my previous coworkers reached out to me if I am interested in making a move. It was a good move for my career so I accepted.

Job 3: Pretty weird company. Some aspects I really love (like flexibility to wfh before it was cool), but some stuff I absolutely hate (employer nickel and diming, high bureaucracy for a company of the size). I worked there for some time before I took a 4 month parental leave as I had a new baby. 2 months into my leave my boss contacted me (the guy who referred me), and said company just had a round of mass layoff and he was fired, and told me to check out where I stand. I was kept. After speaking with some people, it seems like the reason for this round of layoff was due to some stupid political fighting between upper management, that some guy wanted to grab more power and was successful, so he decided to cleanse all those who doesn't like taking shit from him. I was approached by some recruiters during the same time and learned I was quite underpaid (especially after the layoff a promised promotion of mine was gone with the wind). I started interviewing and eventually had a new gig, leaving the circus of job 3 as is.

Job 4: Super cool people and cool culture. I love every minute I was in this place. After I joined 2 weeks though, the company decided to shut down the office where I am at. Many people got worried; some even seem to about to cry (like job 1 these people stayed loyal to the company for ages). I saw this and told my new friends not to worry, as I know many recruiters and they will find a new job in a heartbeat. I even told them I won't be surprised they will start receiving a lot of calls from recruiters. And I was right! The first person landing a new gig got it just 2 days after the announcement. Every lunch gathering were people talking about interviews and sharing how many calls they got. The exodus was so fast that those clowns (a.k.a. executives) who were all ""take it or leave it"" back in the all-hands meeting had to change course quickly, like increasing the stay bonus and even have to make remote work offers to people, as they were losing so much engineering know-hows at lightning speed. It was really amusing how out of touch these clowns could be. I only stayed another month ish before landing a new gig.

Job 5: Not a fun place. People here are pretty old and you can tell bureaucracy is everywhere. People just try to do their work to get by. However this company is supposed to be extremely stable as they are a huge corp (Fortune 50 working with Fortune 5 clients), and there are many people that stay here forever. But for my time there they also did 2 rounds of small layoffs, each round affecting several hundred people. Reasons was due to slow season so they need the layoff to ensure profitability. Once I am done with my stuff here, I was out.

Job 6: Not a fun place. Spoiler I got fired here. The minute I joined people were extremely unhelpful. No one seems to be able to help for basic things like I need access to a system. Because I couldn't access the system a lot of things I couldn't do, so I focused on improving the current architecture, making things more stable and implemented auto reporting. After a month ish I was called into a room, saying I am not providing enough value so they are going to let me go. I won't go into the details but for what I do, doing what I did was actually much harder than what they found ""valuable"". Oh well.

Job 7: Great place. Great people. Very good culture. Aside from Job 1 and Job 2 this is the only recent place I actually made some legit friends who I want to talk to and hang out with outside of work. During my time here though the pandemic hits and the gong show began. Many people I knew across different departments were ""temporarily laid off"" in March, saying they are set to return in June. By June temporarily layoff became permanent. Among the people laid off, one of them is my friend who worked in this company for 30 fucking years. I always joked telling people that W is going to be the indicator. If he got laid off, you know nobody is safe. Turned out I was right again. I stayed for another year until my contract is done. All in all great place, but no matter how great it is they still don't give a hoot about their employees well being.

Job 8: Current gig. Going okay so far. No layoff yet. However this is a startup and things have been bad for start-up. Layoff would be inevitable if company cannot secure funding soon.

So yeah, as this year draws to close, and as the economy continues sliding in a recession, you need to look after you own well-being. If you need to change your job, do it. You want to take on an extra job, do it. Job security is a lie; you are the only one who can ensure you are secure. Loyalty is horseshit; it's a fucking one way street that employers have 0 loyalty to you. 

I will close with a quote from my favorite entrepreneur Daniel Chong from Hong Kong. He is a successful CEO/founder of multiple companies:
""Marrying to your job is the dumbest thing you can do. Being CEO is my part time job; my full time job is being a good person."""

**Letters of Recommendation**

*(Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*

AP Statistics Teacher (8/10) - I had a solid relationship with them, did well in their class, and had a lot of interesting conversations not related to school with them. They also tend to not write many recommendations and are known for writing good ones so I'm guessing it turned out really well.

AP Lang Teacher (7.5/10) - Similar situation, I had a great relationship with them and loved working with them to figure out things in the class. I bet it turned out pretty well.

HS Swim Coach (10/10) - I am very close with my coach who I've had for 4 years. I think their recommendation showed a side of my natural leadership and teamwork that wasn't really highlighted in my essays. I submitted their recommendation anywhere where I could submit a supplemental letter.

Choir Director (10/10) - I am also very close with my director who has known me for about 6 years now. I submitted their letter with my music portfolio to Stanford and MIT.
​

**Interviews**

Stanford (6/10) - I was very nervous after my interview. It was pretty chill and okay, we talked for about an hour, but I don't really feel like the interviewer learned much about me. They were very talkative and I didn't get to say everything I wanted to. I guess it didn't end up affecting my admissions that much though.

**Essays**

Personal Statement - I kinda wrote a argument for diversity of thought. I started talking about my love for singing and then looped it into parallel with engineering/CS and how they compliment each other. I had a lot of concrete examples and commentary on the world as well. It's not really what people typically think of (there's no overarching theme or pattern), its more like a thesis and an argument, but I think it turned out really well.

Stanford - These were some of my favorite essays I wrote, but also some of the riskiest. I didn't touch on my major much at all, hoping my ECs and personal statement would cover it. I mainly talked about my love for space (just a random passion), my random habits, some elaboration on my home-server EC, and some commentary on the state of the world. I wasn't sure if this was going to work but it really paid off.

**Music Portfolio**

I submitted a portfolio to Stanford and MIT of two songs I prepared for the music faculty to review. I thought they turned out pretty well and showed off different parts of my voice. I did get a little scared, because I submitted it to a small local scholarship and wasn't even invited to the second round of review. But I guess Stanford either loved it or the rest of my application offset it somehow.


**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* Stanford REA!
* Texas A&amp;M University
* University of Alabama

*Pending:*

* Carnegie Mellon
* Cornell
* Georgia Tech
* MIT
* North Carolina State University
* Northeastern
* UT Austin
* USC
* Cal Poly SLO

**Additional Information:**

I was absolutely shocked at my result especially seeing so many (in my eyes) more qualified applicants being rejected. My takeaway is that Stanford must have a strong eye for authenticity and passion. While that may be a crazy research project or international competition, they can see it in a lot of every-day ""normal"" activities too."
zoqdiw,302,2022-12-17,For everyone struggling to find a job...,maskedwithaface,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/zoqdiw/for_everyone_struggling_to_find_a_job/,"Just wanted to give you the reality of the situation we're living in. The job market is terrible at the moment. Not just the tech industry but in general. Companies are always going to need you - a Software Engineer - but it's important to remember that with all the layoffs that's recently happened, you have a few tens of thousands of talented competitors to compete with (and these are just from the popular companies I'm talking about). 

You're not getting a callback (no pun intended) not because there's something wrong with your resume, or because you didn't take an internship or two or because you're lacking a degree yet have a few years of experience or whatever else. You're not getting a callback simply because the competition is intense and you are, just simply; unlucky. 

Things are going to get back up again and you'll realise getting a job isn't as hard as it's felt for the last few months. 

This is definitely one of the worst times to have been job-hunting whatever the profession, and as Software Engineers, a lot of hiring managers/recruiters are being instructed or are instructing themselves to focus on taking less chances with people they'd normally be fine taking chances with. 

Wanted to write this post since I've been seeing a few posts and a lot of comments recently all with the trend of, ""What's wrong with me?"" And there's probably a lot wrong with you but that's not the issue right now. There's just a lot going on and everyone, including you, is simply unlucky. 

Edit to add: As a few commenters mentioned, also try to remember that we're in the last quarter of the year. Companies are in PTO season and hiring slows down at this time of the year. Keep your chin up

Keep applying and you'll get there eventually."

sleepy sleep...

There you are! Now what? \[Filter to source reference and reincorporate\] Put the sauce back in the pasta you say, sure!

Gosh, so much is leaking out, oh there's so many holes, quick what do book say for holy leakage! \[Block and scrape damaged/contaminated tissue while finding/sealing major channels. Infuse filtered utility fluid into major channels and ensure leaks are stopped.\] That's alot.

So, cover what i can reach and spurt the goo into the smooth parts with a lot of goo, can do. Just have to reach around with some feelers to see if pressure is even everywhere, what comes in must come out and all.

Gosh, they're still moving so much, and oxygenation is going down, at least there's no more big leaks, at least not where the brain is...i think... \[Oxygenation level may vary depending on species but if it is dropping actively the creature may not be getting the amount it needs from its respiratory system.\] Stands to reason, \[There may be other factors at play though, such as activity level, cranial circulation, intercellular toxin and Bogothan poetry, please check for circulatory regularity, activity level, cellular chemistry and environmental hazards to properly determine your course of action.\]

Hmmm... a lot a lot...circulation is okay, i should check on the pumper while i'm here, environment is pretty okay, what about- \[Checking intercellular chemistry takes sampling or observing a variety of tissues across the body and subjecting them to slight variations on the utility fluid composition, monitoring for positive and negative results.\]

Okay the hart is going to need some work, they shouldn't come with holes that big. Cellular samples, oh right oxygen, uh just bypass the heart for now, bypass all the damaged tubing and suspend in a thinned fluid mixture for now. Right oxygen, wait butterfly, NO-

""...nd just so you know noone's ever finding you, that sludge you landed on is nanocite from across the empire, lovingly tended to by the likes of YOU, ha ahahahaha"" The door at the top of the glass chamber slammed shut with a crystalline clink and lit up the silo with static on its rounded edges.

Already he could feel his armor did little against the exotic munitions they had, and it certainly didn't stop the seeping in of the cold metallic consumers. They roughly injected themselves into every bleeding new hole and tore them all bigger, he gasped and writhed but found his body loosing strength fast.

Looking to the side he saw he was almost half subsumed into it, looking down the bullet holes bled black through his useless armor. Pain danced on him like it had just been dared to stand up the hungover beatdown from last week, it was winning. Ice shot threw him from every angle at first, then it started scoring and running him through as he felt his legs and fingers grow tingly. Turning onto his side and starting to pant he reached down and pulled out his wallet, opening to see the picture of his mate and clutch, feeling at once full and empty, hot and cold, pressure and relief.

""Looks like I'm coming home early Mereet"" he couldn't tell if he was getting choked up or if it was the nanocite sludge in his neck, but he couldn't get enough air and in his last moment he decided he might as well cry.

\[Welcome to the cerebral/nanocite interface, as a new host of XB-503D I.M.N.D.A.P. variant you may experience a range of painful symptoms as your nanocite acclimates to and repairs you.

*What...humans? Didn't they get invaded? They must have glassed themselves with this stuff, it's practically a war crime all on its own. What's is saying about...my heart?*

The airy purple interface went on and on about this and that, pain and suffering, Bogothan poetry, bodily reassembly and a myriad of other things inspector Taduth didn't care about, his vision was closing in and limbs weren't responding, what was wet or cold no longer registered over the blank fuzz of nothingness. For awhile, he thought we was dead, dying, going to die, at least mortally wounded, he was on his way out right?

He must have looked like a stray pet stuffed itself with glittering tar to stem its own bleeding.

He felt like it at least, or did he?

Suddenly he felt a lurch in his chest, an unbearable fullness then a pop, and... *ker-thump-ump* 

There was a gasp as Taduth hunched over onto his elbows as a little voice in his neck squealed in delight and made him feel warm on the inside while pins and needles lanced though him again.

'it's ALIVE' came the little jingling voice from inside...something about it told him everything would be alright.

\---

That inspector had a story to him, not like the normal corporate lackeys and underpaid interns who ended up asking questions, not that it mattered to Nazim, he knew about the docks and he couldn't know about the docks. Apparently some of the transfers from the city had gotten theatrical about the matter and shot up the nanocite silo, the one that just got a batch of humie stock put in it.

Dangerous stuff, even more than normal.

That's why and who the three seated in his office where there for. Dangerous does not always mean easily mishandled, of immediately hazardous though, which is what the big glass canister of muted black sludge was for.

""Do you know why you're here?"" Nazim asked without turning. The view of the whole operation really was something to see.

""Here 'bout the detective."" Came one of their voices, gruff city accent pulling through a smaller ethic lilt.

""Astute but no."" Nazim informed the idiot.

""Was it leaving our post?"" naïve almost coastal accent came, but was also wrong. He shook his head.

""I bet my dad is absolutely furious about this whole fiasco, Did we take the wrong guns?"" Indeed the spoiled brat had, in fact, taken whatever guns they felt like and somehow had gotten into his personal stock of sluggers. But that didn't warrant this.

Nazim took a deep breath and let his tuber accent fly to the fore, ""Three for three and not a single nut among or between your ears and legs had any sorta feeling at all that Cracking open, then Shooting Into a silo containing nanocite is a bad idea.""

*How do these city kids survive anything?* He thought to himself.

""To be fair the dude survived worse."" the coastal kid chimed back, the ethnic one coming in with his own take,

""And those containers aren't marked for us to know what was in them,""

""Yeah I had to look through dad's notes just to find the bin where the good stuff was."" came the brat with a wonderful nugget.

""And you needed My guns to gain egress from My guards, to access the most hazardous material known to all civilization."" Nazim could practically hear their nodding as he watched submarines covertly unload cargo from the water landing spaceship above.

He turned from the lil spotlights and shadowy hulls dancing around in the water to the three troublemakers on the other side of his expensive imported desk. Mahogany being rare even in its native space, the foreign and luxurious nature of the wood going entirely over the heads of the near teenagers he leveled his gaze at.

One flinched back, and even then only slightly. The brat had taken to scooting in and starting to shave his claws into the desk.

A glance had his personal guard yank the boy's chair back and rip the knife from his hand. The following outrage was silenced by a hearty slap that nearly bulled the teen out of his chair.

His friends sat straighter, and stock still after that.

""Believe it or not, people with stories tend to have people following those stories, people who will bring company, dig and snoop around until they find their friend, who is currently in a silo of contraband so banned it is prescribed to be disposed of with fission bombs. Your dad is my underling and given your behavior as fit for the role as you are to replace him!"" Nazim ground his fists against the near pearlescent woodgrain and the brat looked scandalized, the other two looked ready to plead their souls to leave the room.

But no one spoke.

The office sat in the sound of the ocean for a brief few seconds before Nazim turned again, and rounded the desk.

""My guns I can forgive, they are Very fun to shoot. Your shift is largely ceremonial, its there so you abandon it and we slap you for it. Your dear old dad is there to bluster and look like the end of the chain for the spice gang in your town, all to cover this."" He put his hand on the canister.

Nazim picked up the heavy glass capsule and turned to face the three in the chairs. ""This is something bigger than me, you, or anyone in this town is ever gonna be. Because someone took a nanocite...""

He unscrewed the cap and turned the glass over, slowly sliding the contents out to land as an almost solid brick on the carpet, only then did it start to spring to life.

""...and made it a pet.""

**Extracurriculars:**  (in no order)

Internship with Cloud based IT solutions company (not that well known but has some big name clients)

member at Junior Economics club (more of just a listen to experts club)

DECA VP of career /co-founder- had to create it this year so we are still planning what to do.

TA/ Sub teacher for Top prep academy - Alot of SAT math help and middle school assistance/ tutoring, some tasks were paid and others were volunteer

Peer mentor at my school

Acolyte at my church for 7 years but I was technically directing the team most the time to help my pastor with the mass

PC builder - i recycle old computers and give them back to friends and family to use

I also put personal investor and said i was part of a team for business competitions (no good results) to fill up my activities list but Ik its not looking that great

Badminton Club co-founder/treasurer - founded it since we had a lack of any form of sports

Veritas Literary Magazine Chief Editor - just our schools magazine

Chess Club Secretary

**Essays/LORs/Other:**

Personal statement: 8/10, its good in its narrative to talk my status and how I was kept away from being known that i was undocu and figuring out ways to deal and then try to find ways to find something meaningful to do despite many programs locking me out.

Recs: 7/10, teachers arent the best of writers but I have good bonds with my college gov teacher, calc teacher and my stat teacher

i applied Notre Dame Mendoza REA and got rejected but I did add some more to my application (albeit not much) :P and my supps for that school i think was pretty good so my ECs were too lacking

**Schools:** RD: Babson, Columbia, Cornell(maybe CAS economics), NYU Stern/CAS, Dartmouth, Emory, Lehigh, Tufts, Vandy(my parents asked me to), WashU

(I also need an ED2 school and stern and washU are the ones im considering)

im probably being too ambitious still in spite of my rejection, but I really need a reality check or something, need potentially some other schools to apply to as well if its not worth it applying to some the schools i mentioned"
zor8nh,14,2022-12-18,What Am I Worth? And How Should I Ask For It?,Glittering-Bake-2589,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/zor8nh/what_am_i_worth_and_how_should_i_ask_for_it/,"So I’m currently about to start my senior year of college. I am set to graduate in December of 2023 and will finish school in a total of 4 years. My major is a Bachelors of Science of Cybersecurity.

Here is my work history and my future work history by the time I graduate:

Start of Freshman year (January 2020)- Worked at Geek Squad (basically public help desk) for 1.5 years. During this time, I learned basic PC troubleshooting and computer repairs.

Middle of Sophomore year (June 2021)- Leveraged into an IT Specialist position at a bank security company. I worked here for 1 year. I worked in their Managed Services department for a year. I learned Powershell scripting, some Python, and a lot more IT and Windows Server stuff.

Middle of Junior year (June 2022)- Started a Summer internship doing cloud engineering and sysadmin work. I learned a lot about Linux, VMWare, Azure, and more advanced Powershell scripting.

Start of 2nd Semester of Junior year (September 2022)- Started a Fall internship doing Cyber Security controls auditing. Learned a ton about high-level security controls and more scripting.

Start of Senior year (January 2023)- I’ll return to the company that I interned for during the Summer as an Associate Engineer Co-Op for the Spring. I’ll be converting on-prem clients over to their Managed Services provider.

Summer of Senior year (June 2023)- Cybersecurity Analyst intern at a construction company.

Last semester of Senior year (September 2023)- Return as a cybersecurity audit intern for the company I just finished up with.

I’ve already been offered a full-time position for January 2024 by the audit company for $60,000 a year. The company culture is good, I could eventually pivot over to penetration testing, and it would be a company that I could stay with for a while.

However, I think I’m worth at least $80,000/$90,000 based on all the experience I have. I’m not a generic new grad. My degree is easy because most stuff I learned on the job. My degree is purely for résumé purposes.

What do you think I’m worth? My people skills are fantastic, I usually have multiple internship offers to choose from, and I have a ton of experience already.

And how do I go about asking for a counter offer from the audit company?

Thanks so much!

Edit:

Location is Springfield, Missouri and pretty LCoL."
zordew,0,2022-12-18,Fuqua( no $) vs Foster ($60K),nascentself,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/zordew/fuqua_no_vs_foster_60k/,"Hi,

I am an international applicant (Indian) and really fortunate to be in this position. I am currently leaning towards Fuqua because of the brand, prestige, more Alums, overall quality of the cohort ( no offensive to Foster but ranking and prestige attracts talent) and overall safer carrier outcomes for internationals (Strong in both Tech and consulting). 

I hope I could get some thoughts or insights that I haven't considered myself.

Profile:

27M,

Undergrad- Engineering in Electronics and Communication (B.Tech)

Work Experience- 1.5 years as Systems Engineer in a wealth Management firm then 4 years in Managerial roles ( think sales/operations) at small Agri-commodity firm.

Gmat- 740 (Q50, V40)

Post-MBA goals ( In order of Preference) - 1. Tech PM  2. Consulting ( Prefer MBB but not bust mentality) 3. Other Tech roles

**Some things to consider:**

Post-Mba goals- I am aiming for Tech Pm roles but don't have the relevant background experience. I am trying for Pre-Mba tech PM internships, not sure how much that'll help. My aim will be getting Pm internships in B-school then aim for Tech Pm roles in any major Tech Company. But considering I don't have relevant background experience and the recent Tech crunch, I feel it will be better to have consulting open as a strong Plan B given consulting companies are background agnostic. So, basically I'll be recruiting for both Tech and consulting.

Post-Mba location- I don't have any strong opinion or preference for any location. I am happy to work in any location in the US. I also don't plan to come back to India at least for the next 6-7 years.

Finance- I don't have much savings and will go for loans for the COA (Cost of Attendance) for both schools. Now the COA at foster comes out to roughly 160K+ for the 2 years and for Fuqua 210K+. Given the 60K scholarship, Foster will cost me around 100K, so I'll be paying an extra 110K for Fuqua and given the current interest rates for international students, it is pretty nerve wracking.

Scholarship Negotiation: I recently got promoted. I am hoping to first use Fuqua admit and promotion to see if I could get more scholarship from Foster and then probably ask Fuqua if it budges on the no scholarship decision. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tl:dr- Am I stupid to consider spending an extra 110K at high interest loans just for brand, prestige and bigger network?

Roblox:

* Pro : TC is high asf (262K first yr and 225K recurring) , can choose any team, engineering culture seems like a great place to learn

**Additional Information:**

Going into this cycle, I was extremely nervous about my chances at *any* top school -- I honestly hadn't given college apps much thought and never went crazy with my ECs like others at my school, on this sub, or r/chanceme. Additionally, being a Bay Area Asian male applying for CS (okay, well technically Dartmouth doesn't admit you into a major, but still) and hearing the horror stories of previous years made me seriously doubt my chances at a top school.

It's funny looking back at the common response to the many r/ApplyingToCollege posts worrying over how other applicants were seemingly academic prodigies: that most admits to top schools were just normal high schoolers who had strong grades and decent activities, but nothing with crazy national or international impact.

At the time, I dismissed this response for two reasons: one, I was from an insanely competitive Bay Area high school, where half of my classmates hired private counselors; I didn't and lacked the guidance and expert-crafted narrative that my peers were afforded (honestly, the guidance part is a bit overrated; A2C was an immensely useful resource, more so than any quadruple-digit-charging counselor). Second, I felt that I didn't stand out in any particular way. The same anxiety-riddled question would constantly pop up in and out of my head: *how would I differentiate myself from my peers*?

Seeing my classmates and other applicants with crazy research papers and near-perfect grades in more rigorous courseloads didn't help my confidence either. While I won't know exactly what got me in (at least not until I go on campus and view my admissions file), I think it was probably a combination of my essays, peer rec, and being genuine with a lot of what I did. I won't say that I didn't do some things for college apps sake, but the vast majority of my application was representative of what I really enjoyed -- Boy Scouts, working out, etc.

Final thoughts: Admissions officers aren't lying when they say that you should mainly do and write about things you actually *care* about, not what you think will make you stand out or seem ""intellectual"". If anything, I truly believe that being raw and real with your application IS what makes you stand out from the crowd of 4.0/1600/research+nonprofit+olympiad winners that apply to these top schools. I hope my application is a good example of that."
zouk33,1,2022-12-18,Best way to make myself stand out when i start looking at jobs overseas?,coris15,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/zouk33/best_way_to_make_myself_stand_out_when_i_start/,"This is a long, convoluted story so I will try my best to simplify it. I have applied for and am currently waiting (8-12 months) for my Hungarian citizenship through family descent. I did this because I would like to leave the US and start my life living in somewhere in the EU after college. At the same time as this, I am about to be on hopefully my last semester of college and graduating with a degree in Information Systems. 

Currently, I work at my colleges IT department as an ""Intern"", but starting in the next couple of months before I graduate, a full time Desktop Support Admin position is opening up in my department that my boss and pretty much everyone else is gunning for me. I still have to go through the interview process, but my boss is going to be the chair of the search, and he has made is intentions clear on hiring me full time.

In my head, my plan was going to be this. (hopefully) accept the position as the Desktop Support Admin, graduate from College, and as soon as my Hungarian citizenship papers come in, begin looking for work overseas in the EU in some kind of Desktop Support or ideally Sysadmin position.

My concerns are from reading a wide variety of posts on reddit about the difficulty of finding positions of work, especially in the tech field. I worry that with the difficulty of finding work, just coming out of college, and the fact that I would be coming from overseas, companies will be reluctant to hire me. I really want to have the best possible shot of this plan working out, so I was wondering if there is anything I can do in the meantime to bump up my 'attractiveness'?

I already have Jamf level 200 certification as well as AZ-900, and my workplace has already paid for a Network+ voucher, I just need to take it."

zozx1b,1,2022-12-18,I need an advice on studying Medicine.,Heliment_Anais,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/zozx1b/i_need_an_advice_on_studying_medicine/,"Ok. This is going to be a long post because I honestly don’t know if this is the right community or where to start.

I’m doing a pathway to medicine through Swansea University. The course is four years and is Genetics (following in my cousin’s - the original Heliment Anais - footsteps (relevant later)). 

I don’t know where to start so I’ll start from the beginning. I was always taught to have high expectations of others but mainly myself. If I had a goal, I was to be serious about achieving it and work hard towards it systematically, and for many years I’ve tried. 

Originally I’m from Poland, I’ve always loved my city but never had any positives to say about the country or countrymen. I knew studying abroad was my way out and with the help from my cousin I applied to several universities in UK with my main being Liverpool and my backup being Swansea. 

I landed in Swansea and had decided to not only get a diploma but actually push further than my predecessor and attend Medicine. 

I am now in my second year, couple of failures on my way - mainly two assignments on 50-60% - but I have been able to talk with one of my professors about a possible internship opportunity which I hope to seize. I have also started talking with several medicine students (during events) on the process of application and GAMSAT. 

But I came here to ask if I actually should apply for medicine. 

I know I have it in me to get into it. I have begun my studies but I have doubts. List:

- My family is in medicine and I know people who went on to become medical professionals. A lot of those people, if not all of them became assholes. I’m pretty sure it’s due to the strains of the job; 

- I’m afraid of the time required to become a specialist. It’s basically twelve years for some specialisations; 

- I’m no longer sure what drives me. At this point I have no real under of my own motivation. I’m starting to feel as if I’m doing this just because I was taught to get as high as I can;

I have already talked with my cousin but he doesn’t have any real answers, instead telling me to judge for myself. 

What should I do?"

Overall, looking back, I’m surprised but also not surprised I got in. I’m more shocked that I somehow was able to accomplish all of this. It seems really out there looking back. I really had to hone in my communication skills and make big connections in the political world at a young age. There is this interesting post on A2C about the “avalanche” or “snowball” effect and I think that is truly what happened to me. Local political work would turn regional, then national, then international, and the same with my other activities. I think this was successful because I knew I wanted Harvard since 8th grade, and was very intentional about making sure one activity would smoothly lead to the next. At the same time, I was also able to really deeply explore my passions. That said, it was really stressful and I sacrificed a lot to get here. Looking back through, it was worth it for me personally because I have big ambitions for the future and know Harvard will help me get there.

Whether you got in or not to your early school, best of luck RD! And I am very excited to have a relaxing winter break free from stress."

It’s the next day now, and I’m realistic about the result. My life isn’t over, but I can’t say I like how I feel.

I think a large part of my disappointment is from big expectations, as I kind of “expected” to get in. MIT’s been my dream school since freshman year, and I’ve been working towards it since. My grades and essays are good, my ACT is a 34 but my math is a 28, and my ECs were god-tier (2 paid IT internships, IT volunteer at the homeless shelter, competitive mixed martial arts, and research for a year and a half). I underestimated how competitive these applications are, not to mention being an asian male in comp sci.

I was daydreaming about telling all my teachers, mentors, family, and friends about my new school and hearing their pride and excitement. I can’t go into my old bio teacher’s classroom and say “GUESS WHERE I’M GOING TO COLLEGE”. I can’t begin falling in love with a school and almost feel bitter towards those who can. And worst of all, I have to submit 8 other applications I haven’t started.

Obviously, the name brand of having a top company on their resume would give someone a substantial boost but does the fact that it is designed for freshmen lose a lot of its weight? Would it be better in the eyes of recruiters for someone to have a normal SWE internship at a company on par with the level of those mentioned?"

I'm so TIRED of people undermining my achievements and chalking up my successes to being black. I am literally the only person at my school who isn't white or asian and whilst everyone else got 'good luck's and 'you've got this' when they said what school they were applying to, I got groans and eye rolls and was told that my 'hooks' (being a black bisexual first gen in stem) would get me in.

Do you know how it feels to be told by someone you considered a friend that you should 'throw the SAT' to increase their chances since you were both applying to the same ED?

How it feels to not have ANYBODY to relate to on the internet or at school because literally everyone else can bond over being asian and hated by the admissions process because of that, they get to shit on you for it?

I get that being a URM plays a factor in admissions processes but that does NOT make it ok to bully and undermine BIPOC students's acceptances, especially when you don't even know how much of an effect it had on them, I do not think me being black 'decided' whether or not I was making it to Harvard, I know it did not decide whether or not many other black or latino students got into Harvard and it didn't decide whether or not a majority of other black students have gotten into the Ivy League or HYPSM.

I'm so sick of this bullshit and being told that I don't deserve anything because I have such an 'advantage' as if I didn't work my ass off to get my score on the SAT or work hard to get my internships or finish my research project or anything. I don't even want to fucking go to college anymore if this is what I'm dealing with, I don't want to be at a school where everyone thinks I don't deserve to be there. And I can't tell anyone else at my school this and I know nobody cares about this in general because the demographics on this subreddit and in the 'college community' is skewed asf, feels like I'm the only person here who isn't a Bay Area asian or white guy in CS whose parents just casually make 250k."

Hoping for some advice on summer internships as a sophomore right now. Choosing between UiPath SWE, Snap SWE, Google STEP, and UberSTAR. Not sure if I want to do an introductory program like Google STEP and UberSTAR but the names at both of those companies could be important for return offers/next years recruitment (also thinking of switching to PM next summer instead of continuing with SWE). Also not sure between Snap and UiPath - compensation is very similar, companies are around the same size, both are actual SWE internships. But Snap is definitely more well-known (but it doesn’t seem to be doing as well now) and UiPath is less well-known but seems to have a pretty bright future. Things I want to get out of my internship this summer is (1) learn what it is like being a software engineer and having high impact projects (2) decide whether I want to do SWE or PM next summer (3) poise myself well to get a SWE or PM at a big tech company next year."

zpa58o,120,2022-12-18,"Got rejected by MIT EA, parents giving me silent treatment and keep bringing up my SAT score",Worldly-Inflation-53,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/zpa58o/got_rejected_by_mit_ea_parents_giving_me_silent/,"I just want to cry and scream at everything. I know that getting rejected from MIT isn't the end of the world, but the aftermath of it is what hurts the most. I got my rejection letter and just laughed it off, but then I found that 3 of my friends got in and others got deferred but not flat out rejected. My parents are so mad at me that they refuse to talk to me unless it is them telling me about how I wasted all their time, money, resources, didn't study enough, ruined my life, or some offhanded comment about my OCD and SAT score. I just want a hug right now. Everyone else I know at my school who applied claimed to be deferred or accepted. My school has a limit of 15 applications, so I was only able to apply to about 14 schools that mattered most. However, I haven't heard back from any other ED school yet while all my classmates are getting into Cornell, Caltech, Stanford, Uchicago, and at least something better than community college and I feel like I won't get accepted into any school anywhere. I forgot to apply to one school that I had a small chance of getting into, but the deadline passed and I don't know what to do. If I go to community college my parents will kick me out and never support me again. I accidentally submitted 3 college apps with a small typo in my activities, and now I feel like I've jeopardized everything. I have never been allowed to get a job or drive, I don't know how I will survive and support myself on the streets. 

I'm just so hurt and angry. Why did I go to stem school in the first place?? Why do my parents feel like their feelings are the only ones that matter? I am still working on 6 more applications and now I just feel hopeless. My sat score was 1450+ but I never was able to cross 1500, so I knew MIT or any good school already felt hopeless from the start. I had an internship last summer, did a Stanford and MIT summer program, am currently writing a research paper with a mentor, worked on an app, and I did a bunch of other things that I thought would make me good enough. I thought I was accomplished. I have also done a decent amount of volunteering, am a club leader, and partake in extra activities such as orchestra and art that I have done for years. I thought that my STEM school experience would help me but it feels like I did nothing useful for the two years I went because it feels like everyone else around me has better grades, ECs, connections, internships, and does everything better than me. I just feel so useless and terrible that I couldn't repay my parents. They are able to financially support me and my studies but I have done nothing useful to show for it, and now I am gonna get rejected from every college and then kicked out and then die and I don't know what I am doing here. I thought I did everything I could but I was never enough. I thought my essays were nice but who wants a loser wannabe computer scientist and artist without a portfolio and not enough experience in anything?? I don't deserve to have worked on a research project nor do I deserve such a good education anywhere. I'm never gonna amount to anything good in my life and it's all my fault. I wish I did better on the sat and that I didn't get one C in a class and that I wasn't such a failure to my family and among my prodigy peers. I've been struggling with OCD for the past 4 years and I wasn't allowed to get treatment for it, and it messed me up when it came to living in a dorm for school and going back home and travelling. I don't even know what I am doing half the time. I don't even feel like I am gonna have a future at this rate. I know I shouldn't be so negative but it feels like this, it really does. I know going to Reddit is a stupid and terrible idea but where else can I just vent???"

zpanfb,338,2022-12-18,Me (30M) and my girlfriend (30F) broke up after she moved for a work opportunity and now she wants me to pay for all the shipping fees for her things,thrwaway135792468,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/zpanfb/me_30m_and_my_girlfriend_30f_broke_up_after_she/,"She moved to a different state so she could take her dream job earlier this year. She was then fired from said job after they found empty cans of alcohol in her locker and some interns she was training reported that they smelt alcohol on her breath while at work. This had been something we had been working on for the last 2 years, specifically since lockdown, where her drinking definitely increased. I thought she had made a lot of progress but I ended up breaking up with her after she was fired when I realized she was not accepting responsibility for her choices or actions.

Fast forward 2 months and she has just gotten out of a 30 day rehab and is currently 35 days sober. I still do not want to take her back because I do not trust her to keep her promises at this point. She wants me to ship all of her things to her parents' house in a completely different state because that's where she lives now. She also says she can't help pay for the shipping because she doesn't have a job and that she spent most of her savings on the rehab treatment. I'm already paying for her car insurance, paid to fly her cat back out to her, and I'm getting stretched thin with the mortgage and car payments. Is there any legal action she can take against me if I don't ship her things without her monetary support?"

**Letters of Recommendation**

AP Calculus BC Teacher - 9/10 - He rarely writes letters of recommendation, and hates most of his students, but he liked me for some reason, so I asked him for a letter of rec. Research teacher also helped him write it and made sure it was good. He spent a lot of time on it, so I think it was really good.  
Foreign Language Teacher - 7/10 - Our class is very close, since we've been together for a while, and she understands my personality very well. Not as great because she had to write quite a few, and not core to my interests (although I want to minor in that language :)) 

**Interviews**

Penn Interview - Interviewer was very nice, but it was hard because it was on Zoom. He honestly talked circles around me and I left the interview feeling confused, and like it didn't go well.

MIT Interview - Interview was amazing! It lasted for an hour and a half, it was in person, and I felt like I made a really strong bond with my interviewer. He also sent me a bunch of videos afterwards that he thought that I would like.

**Essays**

Main Essay - 9.5/10 - I spent many hours on that essay, and workshopped it with my mom and my cousin (both are professional writers) for a while. I wrote about being tall, and how that affected the way that I interpreted other people's reactions to me and my actions.

Supplements - Wrote about Taylor Swift, being a camp counselor, research, being religious, being gay, many things.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* Binghamton
* Penn ED

*Deferrals*:

* MIT (withdrew before, but they didn't process in time or something).

**Additional Information**

I think that the most important part of my application was that I showed a lot of personality and dedication. I spent a lot of time involving myself with religion and that one NPO, which I think showed that I really cared about specific causes. I think at the end of the day, my legacy also helped me out, but wasn't the deciding factor. The most important part is to put work into essays and show that you go beyond someone that works hard, but someone that can contribute to the community and be a person on campus^(TM).

zpf5te,0,2022-12-18,Concerns about retaking GRE for mscs,swlee98,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/zpf5te/concerns_about_retaking_gre_for_mscs/,"For my background, I am an international student entering junior year next semester (my major is mathematics). Additionally, my current undergraduate is in the top 20 schools in the US. 

After about 2 months of preparation using gregmat+, I took the GRE yesterday for the first time and got 325 (157V 168Q unofficial). I reckon that my awa would be around 4.0-4.5, as I consistently got 5.0 with ScoreItNow before taking the test. Standardized testing seems to be my weakness overall. 

I am planning to apply for a master's program in computer science, and I was wondering if the above score might hurt my chance of getting admission to top programs in cs, including Stanford and MIT. 

For additional information, I currently have a 4.0 GPA, working experience as a TA in the math department for two semesters, and extracurricular activities in a math club. I am planning to take part in a research project and internship during my junior and senior years. 

Should I retake the GRE later before applying for the master's program, or is it better to focus on other aspects like research and internship experience?"

I’m a junior that is looking to major in computer science and was looking at UMD as one of my top options since it is instate and it is really good for computer science 

I was wondering how likely I would be to get into computer science given what I’ve currently done:

4.86 GPA on a 5.0 scale at my school
A 1550 SAT(770 English and 780 math)
1560 SAT superscore(770 English and 790 math)
Instructor at the Kumon Institute of Education(also finished the program there)
Intern at an IT solutions company 
4 honor societies(cofounder of one of them at my school)
And a few after school clubs on top of that

Tldr: what can I improve on this project? Is it good for an entry level .net candidate who is only a little over a year into programming? What other projects should I add to my portfolio?

I made this project as a web app for the internship that I am currently in. I'm nearing graduation next month with my associates, and have been applying to jobs as well; anything from Jr to ""mid"" level. I haven't gotten anything back yet, although I am still only a week or so into applying. 

This app was made for the VP of my internship and is going to be used to replace the excel spreadsheet that is being used as the master DB, so it will actually be getting used. 

Please tell me what you think of this project. Do you think this is worthy of Jr. Level experience? Why or why not? What can i improve? 

Also, what other projects should I consider doing to put on my portfolio? 

I am in an internship now, but I've been getting shut down because I only listed my internship experience (a few weeks at best) for past experience, even though I've been learning c# for a little over a year and change now. I just want to know if I'm getting shut down due to lack of coding abilities or simply because I don't have enough physical working experience, or also because I just don't have my bachelors since most companies are asking for that as well. 

Any and all feedback appreciated!"

I have a very high near 100 GPA (100 scale not 4.0) because I went to a relatively easier high school in NY. Scored a 760 EVBRW and 660 Math SAT after too attempts (1420 composite). My composite is decent but my math falls below the schools 25% line as I missed out on a lot of core algebra 1 and 2 instruction due to COVID. I did study for the SAT on Khan Academy but after my 2nd attempt realized my pattern recognition in math is poor compared to others (I don't always recognize HOW to solve a problem even when I know/learned the process).

I attend a small HS which I rank 1 in but unfortunately does not have honors classes due to its small size. 

Have taken 2 AP courses/tests last year, 5 on APUSH, 4 on AP LANG. Currently taking AP Gov, AP LIT, and AP Calc AB

I have decent ECs that include leadership in several clubs, programs and internships but fall short compared to those that have written research papers or created apps etc. Still revising my essay about diversity in engineering, which is one of NYU's core values. Considering writing a supplement on the pressure from my parents as a first gen college student in the US. Would appreciate any answers and advice, please feel free to ask for more info if helpful, never created one of these posts before."

I applied for MS CS
 
My profile: 
GRE 315 (Q161, V154) 
TOEFL 113 
CGPA: 9.42 from a tier 3 college (SPPU) 
1 Research paper in an IEEE conference and a best paper award.
3 internships, rn working full time as a software engineer. 
A couple of good projects as well. and worked in my college's robotics club for 2 years. 

I applied to ASU on around Dec 3 via Kaplan. My Application was in review on Dec 7, got my Reject on Dec 18. 

Ik my profile ain't strong as other students who got an admit, or rejects lol. Kinda saw it coming seeing the recent posts but still sucks that the first decision which came from unis was a reject. 

I think (again, my speculation!) that it might be because of the tier 3 college. A lot of people are similar or better profiles are getting a reject because of this. Only the Admissions department knows. lol. 

Anyway will look forward towards my other applications, lessee what is to unfold in this admission cycle. 

Stay safe (also sane) lads and don't you dare go hollow."

Majors: chemical/mechanical engineering (maybe material science and engineering )

ECs

Everything I am about to state happened in the last 365 days.

.I did a three month non paid part time internship at a chemicals company. 

.Was in a nationwide research competition with over 100,000 applicants. Made it to the finals with just 75 people remaining and won two prizes. The competition from start to end lasted about 6 months.

. I am a non paid intern of one year at one of my country’s best colleges where I work as a lab assistant for a distinguished professor. I roughly have over 400 hours in the lab.

.I worked on two different really high level research projects at the college I am interning at. I will state them bellow 👇

-spectrochemical analysis of food dye using laser induced breakdown spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy.
-study of moringa oleifera leaves as an antibacterial and anticancer agent using advanced laser induced breakdown spectroscopy technique.
( both still not published as it takes months or sometimes years to publish a research paper but I had my professor write me a letter of recommendation as proof)

.while doing research on food dye, I’ve found some local brands harboring toxic elements like Arsenic and high concentrations of lead (I triple checked my results via LIBS and even used other advanced methods like ICP-AES for confirmation) and raised awareness in my household and other family households and they all completely got rid of all products including food dye manufactured by those brands.

.My friend and I organized nonprofit sessions where we helped over 15 students from our school on the same competition we were in (the research competition). We even managed to help some of them get in touch with professors from different colleges in my city to help them with their projects. The sessions lasted for a couple of weeks.

.I went on an educational trip to the UK with the same organization that held the competition that I was in (only 21 people from the finalists received this prize).

.GSSC (GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY SPACE CHALLENGE) semi finalist.

-part of the science club at my school.

- I also work as a delivery driver.

-volunteered at a 3 day event. A total of 27 hours.

-volunteered in helping clean up the beach. ( I’ll go more into detail on the common app)


LORs

2- average LORs from teachers (math and chemistry)

1- good LOR from English teacher

1- very good LOR from counselor

1- very strong LOR from the distinguished professor I worked for.

Total of 5 LOR


Honors 

-student of the year award from my school.

-received a special plaque from my city’s minister of education.

-received a certificate from my high school for my good grades.

-another certificate from the research competition themselves.

-trophy for my involvement in the research competition (received from another competition still confused as to why).

-another certificate from oxmidca (the UK educational trip)

-Mawhiba alumni 


Academics 

I don’t have SAT/AP (financial issues and my school doesn’t provide either of those).
My CGPA is 99.28

No I don’t need financial aid I am full pay because I am going with my country’s “culture mission “ so they’ll pay full tuition.

Thanks for reading and good luck to anyone who’s applying!"

I have applied to a dozen internships of the past year with a few interviews but no real bites. I finally interviewed with a marketing company for a “web-development” internship. During the interview they were very vague and basically said they used Wordpress and that there was coding involved sort of? It’s an unpaid position for the upcoming semester and will count as an internship credit. They offered me the job and I figured I’d use it to get some experience for a better internship after it ended, but now I’m worried it’s not even worth doing. 

Is some experience better than none in this instance or is it just a meme? I’ve heard horror stories about struggling to get any sort of internship so maybe this is my ticket in. I just don’t want it to be useless in the end. My brother was a CS graduate that didn’t get an internship and is now struggling to get work 2 years after graduating. Please help!"

I've been a free intern in a company dealing mostly with c++, even though I don't really know the language (used google most of the time).  (The internship is from a university program, I get points to the degree for it.)  
I asked if I could stay at the company about a month ago for a paid student position.   
There is still no answer from HR team about it even though my manager does want me to stay and asks about it once a week.  
I have only  1 month left for the internship and seems like I won't continue there. as HR just don't give a clear answer. I'm sad because It took me a long time to learn the code base and the problem is, I can't write I know c++ on my CV since I don't really know it. I don't know what should I focus on now, I know some webdev and general langauges like Java, but don't know what should I focus on now to find a job.   
Most of the jobs are for fullstack engineers and require web projects\\ web related stuff so my internship doesn't help.  
On the other hand, going for the embbedded system, I don't really know a lot a side of basic c++ and some C and it may be harder to find job ?  
 but I did enjoy what I do in the company (software development on Linux)  


What should be my plan now for finding a job? does the internship even help me finding first job? this is my only internship (not from the US), and the market now is going down so I'm super scared not to find a job... I know a lot of people that got fired that have experience and companies that stopped hiring at all.  
btw the internship will last for 4 months total.

Any advice will help,

Thanks."

Recent mi am luat o certificare pe AWS (Developer associate) pentru care am invatat cateva luni bune si finally am luat-o. Firma la care lucrez (o corporatie mare si foarte cunoscuta) pune presiune pe certificari si managerii ne spun ca valoreaza foarte mult pentru mariri. De aici am si dedus ca maririle ar trebui sa fie foarte consistente, avand in vedere ca in general maririle default sunt de vreo 20%.


Am avut o discutie cu managerul si mi a pus ca pot obtine cam 20% marire si sa nu ma astept sa depasesc 10k lei. Poate varia mult. Inteleg perfect faptul ca si clientul decide asta, dar mi se pare gresit sa merg cu un procent asa mic catre client. Evident ca imi va da mai putin. Si honestly, e un salariu shitty pentru ce fac (front,back java si js, soon si cloud).

Am inceput sa intreb in stanga si in dreapta cat au mai primit altii. Unii 40% (aprox 3500 lei), altii 30% fara certificari si au cerut random. Am inceput sa ma simt shitty. Pe langa asta, in vara am tinut un internship pentru studenti pe AWS. A contat 0 pentru marirea asta, observ.


Ma gandesc ca maine sa abordez problema din nou, sa invoc motivele mentionate mai sus si sa aduc in discutie si internship ul tinut, pentru ca am muncit destul de mult sa fac slide uri pt ei.


Vi se pare normal sa primesti o marire de 20% dupa mai bn de un an? Si totusi de la o corporatie din afara? (Extrem de cunoscuta si veche si cred ca o stim toti daca am avut calculator in 2000 prin casa)."

Hello all,

First, my apologies if this post doesn't belong here, feel free to remove it and I will post somewhere hopefully more appropriate. 

Anyways, I am graduating in Spring 2023, and I originally had accepted a job offer with the company I was an intern with over this previous summer. (Let’s call it Company A). During my final two semesters in college I have continued working part time with Company A, as much as my schedule would allow, and it has been nice to stay in touch with the team and be able to work on software development instead of having to get a food or retail job to pay bills while I finish out school.

I still continued looking for jobs even after accepting the first offer, though, and I was lucky enough to pass an interview and get an offer (from let’s say Company B) that was nearly double the total compensation of my first offer, in addition to better benefits such as more PTO, full remote work (no hybrid), and better insurance offerings. I accepted this offer, of course, and plan on beginning my career at Company B. 

That brings me to my main question, which is how should I cut ties with Company A? As I stated, I am dependent upon them for a paycheck right now as I have bills, tuition, and monthly living expenses. One important thing to note is that my offer with Company A is set to begin essentially as soon as I graduate (in May), while the better offer with Company B doesn’t begin until July when I am able to start with their new grad cohort.

Would it even be an acceptable professional question for me to tell Company A that I have accepted a different offer, but would like to continue with my employment with them until that one begins? Or should I quit now and find a different job until my offer begins in July? Or, the third scenario I see (which I expect will be the most popular here) is to say nothing to my employer, start full time work with them, and then put in my 2 weeks after only a month of working with them full time and leave for Company B. 

Any thoughts or opinions on my situation are greatly appreciated, thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this!"

Hello all,

First, my apologies if this post doesn't belong here, feel free to remove it and I will post somewhere hopefully more appropriate. 

Anyways, I am graduating in Spring 2023, and I originally had accepted a job offer with the company I was an intern with over this previous summer. (Let’s call it Company A). During my final two semesters in college I have continued working part time with Company A, as much as my schedule would allow, and it has been nice to stay in touch with the team and be able to work on software development instead of having to get a food or retail job to pay bills while I finish out school.

I still continued looking for jobs even after accepting the first offer, though, and I was lucky enough to pass an interview and get an offer (from let’s say Company B) that was nearly double the total compensation of my first offer, in addition to better benefits such as more PTO, full remote work (no hybrid), and better insurance offerings. I accepted this offer, of course, and plan on beginning my career at Company B. 

That brings me to my main question, which is how should I cut ties with Company A? As I stated, I am dependent upon them for a paycheck right now as I have bills, tuition, and monthly living expenses. One important thing to note is that my offer with Company A is set to begin essentially as soon as I graduate (in May), while the better offer with Company B doesn’t begin until July when I am able to start with their new grad cohort.

Would it even be an acceptable professional question for me to tell Company A that I have accepted a different offer, but would like to continue with my employment with them until that one begins? Or should I quit now and find a different job until my offer begins in July? Or, the third scenario I see (which I expect will be the most popular here) is to say nothing to my employer, start full time work with them, and then put in my 2 weeks after only a month of working with them full time and leave for Company B. 

Any thoughts or opinions on my situation are greatly appreciated, thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this!"

**Additional Information:**

Navigating through the process as an international in CS and STEM, I was horrified at the difficulty and competition I was facing. I did not have insane awards like IOI nor founded startups or led international non-profit. Honestly, from the dozen of hours spending on r/ApplyingToCollege, r/chanceme, r/collegeresults, I would say the most important thing I learned is that US admissions is truly holistic. I think the thing that differentiated my from other applications is how focus my application is as my entire application revolves around a major environmental problem in my country. I do feel like that you need to show AOs that you truly care what you are doing and focus on the impact of your activities. I think that AOs find it hard to differentiate between CS applications since they see the same type of activities (internship, nonprofits, startups) so you really should try to differentiate yourselves by showcasing you are so much more than a EC/Awards robot. I do consider myself to be very lucky since I started taking this process seriously pretty late (junior year) and am thankful that my short commitment to most ECs (since I only started doing them sophomore / junior year) was not a detriment to my application.

In many ways its a great school, but it doesn't seem like a good fit for me academically or socially.

I'm leaning towards Grand Valley State University or Umich, potentially even UIC in Chicago because I have family there. I'm open to other schools in the midwest if anyone has recommendations. Right now i'm leaning towards GVSU because thats where I did my first degree and it would be quicker, but the area isn't known for tech. 

 The biggest factor for me is proximity to internships and networking opportunities, as well as a degree that will make me stand out reputation wise (apart from the work I put in myself)."

Demographics: Asian male from southern state, public school. First-generation low-income

Intended major(s): Environmental engineering for every school except CMU, which is Electrical and Computer engineering

Academics:

* SAT: 1580, 780 english and 800 math
* Class rank: 20/5786 (we are ranked out of the district)
* UW/W GPA: 4.0 UW, 4.71/5.00 W
* Coursework: 9 honors, 15 APs (11 5s and 4 4s), 8 IBs (7 for Chem SL)

Awards:

* 1st place in team personal finance competition, 12,000 participants and $10,000 prize
* 3rd place in team economics competition with 100 teams competing, $500 prize
* 4th place in Northwestern Economics Tournament EconBowl (I’m fine posting the name because we aren’t publicly listed)
* 1st place in FBLA nationals, $425 prize
* MIT fly-in program (didn’t report this one but just something to note)

Extracurriculars:

* Selective and free FGLI summer program (10% acceptance rate). Historically, most get into ivies/HYPSM. However, this is a mostly URM program, and I’m the cursed Asian male in STEM combo.
* Started phone repair business with $21k revenue and $11k profit
* Political activism internship for Burma, published blogs and a piece analyzing the BURMA Act (which was recently passed)
* FBLA state officer
* Political activism internship for Right to Repair, published letter to the editor about my experiences in the repair industry
* Curriculum developer for a successful economics education nonprofit (4000 members)
* Science Olympiad team captain, 4th and 5th in events at state
* Math club vice president
* DECA vice president
* NHS president
* 300 hours of volunteer tutoring

Essays: 7.5/10. I think most people on r/chanceme are overconfident on their essays and LORS, but imo I’m rating myself realistically here with the average applicant being a 5/10. I don’t think anyone should get a 10/10 people rate themselves way too high on here.

My personal statement was about the experience of seeing my parent’s Chinese restaurant close. I won’t go into detail about supps because I don’t want to risk anything, but I will say they tie together my business and political activism ECs to make a coherent story. I do address that I don’t have much direct STEM experience and try to show why political activism will still make me a better engineer.

LORS:

* English teacher (6.5/10): I got into my college access program with this one, so it must be decent. They definitely think I’m capable, but I’m not the top student in her class or anything. I got a 4 in AP Lit.
* Physics teacher (6.5/10): I was the only one to get a 5 in AP Physics 1, but I had him in 10th grade online. However, he is the Mu Alpha Theta sponsor, so I still talk to him. I was the only one to choose a physics EE from our school.
* Burma political activism director (8.5/10): I got to see it. It was long and went into detail about my work. Tied into the story I told in my supps very well too.
* Finance team coach (7/10): He was my AP Euro teacher during online school. He also got a share of our prize money as the coach. I led our finance team. I think this LOR addresses the issue I have with not having much top-level leadership. I’m only the president of one club and I’m not leading anyone in my top ECs.

Schools: Going all RD because I wanted to make my essays as good as possible.

* MIT RD
* Stanford RD
* Princeton RD
* UPenn RD
* Cornell RD
* Duke RD
* Carnegie Mellon RD

Red Flags: If it feels shady that's because it is!
-No prior experience necessary!
-""All you need is a positive attitude to succeed""
-Always hiring
-Opportunity for growth and management


_______________________________________________________________


I'm writing this post to talk about my 3 month experience at ""E.M.E"". I started off as a intern before getting promoted to ""Corporate trainer"".

LinkedIn to the company website: [https://www.linkedin.com/company/marketingeverywhere/](https://www.linkedin.com/company/marketingeverywhere/)

(Previously known as E.M.E)

Please heed my message and know what your getting yourself into!

I was expecting to work in a marketing firm instead they had me selling mobile phones in street for Assurance Wireless a government program that offers low income people cellphones

Here's how it works:

They go after recent college grads or undergraduates. They promise internship with no ""Prior experience necessary just a good attitude.

They try to recruit as many people as possible it's a numbers game because of the high turn over rate. Most people realize this is bullshit so they bounce right away. Their looking for the next sucker people who drink their kool-aide and buy into their opportunity and bright future. 

3 part interview process

Large group interview 10-20 people on zoom. The ""CEO"" or Hiring manager briefly discusses what the role entails very vague. Asked to fill out  

part 2: a interview with 2-3 people with a one of the ""Corporate trainers"" or ""Account executives"" asked to fill out survey

part 3: interview with the ""CEO""

&amp;#x200B;

If your selected they'll give you a honeypot call. Saying how the position is highly sought after and your least qualified as a candidate. They'll put you on hold for 1-2 minutes before they say congrats we'd like to give you a shot.   


They will try to pressure you to start immediately. It's a game of chicken. Your going to receive a text from a number with details where to meet. Usually at coffee shop near their office. You will meet with one of the employees where they get you to sign documents that cover their ass. 

What they are doing here is actually quite smart. Because technically it is not illegal but it sure as hell is highly unethical and dishonest. They will use you and if your no longer of any use they will cast you aside. 

&amp;#x200B;

They run team building exercises where you get to network with other people in the office. Usually people who are just as clueless as you are. But sometimes you'll get to ask questions from one the managers who apart of the pyramid scheme. And they'll give you some bullshit advice on how to rise through the ranks and land that sick manager position and open your own office. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pay and Commission: 

\-The gig is commissioned based you are not paid unless if you can sell phones.

\-They will not pay you until your 3rd week. 

\-You are ""guaranteed"" a $100 rate/day so long as you hit the sales criteria

&amp;#x200B;

Office culture and environment: A little brainwashing to get you ready

Morning atmospheres: Their going to teach you the sales pitch

A quick motivational pep talk from the manager



&amp;#x200B;

The job: 6 days a week Fulltime and 3 days a week for Part time

Going to low income or ethnic neighborhoods. 

Your going to be given a collapsible table and some merchandise (cellphones) 

Your going to be waving people down and get them to buy the phone 

All transactions are in cash because it can't be traced. Receipts are not given.

At the end of the day you will bring the cash back to the office where you hand off the money to the CEO. From their the money is deposited and you get your cut in your paycheck. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Side note: Keep in mind most of the people who are working in these companies are not bad people. They are people who have been mislead by dishonest human beings. People who are taking advantage of students who are in the job market. The real cocksuckers are the managers who deep down know that they are doing is just scamming people but continue to do so anyways."

I finally decided to make this post after hearing the millionth ""what the hell is your life"" rant from dear old mummy, but this time arguing back at her saying something along the lines of ""you made me like this."" But right, asian parents never reflect on themselves. But she's right about me being a useless nobody. 

Long story short. Typical Asian (single) mother, tore me down throughout entire life and I never felt I was good enough. To the point that I believed I didn't deserve many good things. To the point that I was afraid, and well I suppose lazy/apathetic, to take on the critical actions needed to become an independent adult. Instead I just slunk into videogames, but eventually to mobile games, believing it would be more controllable as a habit, but that's not working as I'm distracted daily by that and other distractions (Youtube, reddit, chess). 

In the end, where I am now, I am at home, in my room more or less 24/7, too afraid to look for a job or even an internship. I let my mother think (whatever to her imagination) I'm job hunting, studying for CFA level 2, reading get rich books (seriously, I'm just a fucking means to an end for her), being a ""positive, active \*man\*"", but of course that charade fades often and she goes back to insulting me and my position. I know. It's pathetic. I have been living in a bubble. I figured I would snap out of it and just get real, but I don't! It's just hard and overwhelming for me to start the path to moving out of here and functioning on my own. I constantly wonder how people do it. 

The problem for me, as I identify it, is I have \*zero\* clue what I want. I always admire other people, in this subreddit included, knowing what they want at least and working towards their goals, albeit against all that asian parent nonsense. Really. Good for all of you. More power to you all. Personally, I'm just overwhelmed by the possibilities, and being a ""gamer,"" I love making optimal decisions in a smaller controlled setting, but dread when there are too many unknowns, like life. I like to believe that ultimately I don't want to just work for myself, trying to make money and more of it- that I want to do good for a number of people, but that's obviously idealistic naivety right? Gotta secure yourself first, and with anything. But I'm just throwing that out there for possible ideas. Though again, I haven't even started looking for anything and don't really know the best approach.

Anyways for more background info I graduated college (Penn State main) with a BS in Finance, Economics and minors in math and stats, with 3.9 GPA. No internships though. I passed CFA level 1 exam after graduation. I worked many retail and food service jobs. I'm introverted in general, got severe anxiety about networking and interviews, but I seem to handle the social stuff well when the pressure's low (like those retail jobs). 

Sorry about the deluge of info. I know I'm just one of many, like the rest of you, so I don't want to divert too much attention from any of you. I just want some quick advice, points to resources I could use to help me, some general ideas of what I could do. 

So what are some of the things I should do? I know some is common sense, like find a job. Secure a living place. But I just don't know the logistics. It's so unnerving with all these choices. I guess I'd like ideas. 

But also, if I get out of here, what do I need to prepare? I remember reading critical documents (birth certificate, ss card, etc.), block contacts, etc. I suppose I can find this out myself, but I'd like a resource if you have one.

Thanks for reading. I just hope I can make meaning from any contributions I get."

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout the last 5 months, I have had approximately 12 final interviews/ final interview opportunities from places such as DeShaw, Linkedin, Palantir, or startups like Bubble. However, I seem to be failing some parts of the interviews and the market isn't helping as well - I got 4 final rounds canceled because the positions got filled, 7 final round rejects, and one offer rescind. I am really demotivated at this point and considering that I genuinely might not have a job this summer, which I do need for financial reasons. I think I have been doing modestly well on the technical rounds, but I do not know what to do at this point. Is anyone having a similar experience, I am doubting every decision I have been making until this point. 

For context, I have had 3 internship experiences, 2 with bigger companies so far and I am from a T10 school in regards to computer science (Cal).

Thanks."

Chem teacher: Had him for 2 years, participate often in class, he nominated me for the student of the quarter award

English teacher:  Uhh not sure I think he liked (?) me and I did well in the class but not fantastic I just desperately needed a humanities rec...

Research Mentor/Advisor:  From EC#7...Hopefully it was good...he kept on telling me I could get into any school I wanted to but apparently not lmao

**Interviews**

Eh 5/10.  He asked me a lot about my summer research then kept talking about how he felt like he didn't fit in during high school and he was smarter than everybody else and it felt like he was trying to make me say that I felt like I didn't fit in and I didn't vibe with my friends because I was more high achieving than them?  Lowkey turned me off from Harvard like what in the elitism?

**Essays**

5/10  -- average, definitely not ""OMG SO MEMORABLE""

EC essay:  talked about Women in STEM + how it helped me grow as a person/leader

Supplemental:  Love for history + interest in preserving stories, connected to my more humanities based ECs

CA:  journey w/ science, from immediate family being diagnosed w/ life-threatening illness to working in lab --&gt; how it made me want to become a physician-scientist

**Results**

Harvard:  Deferred

I wasn't really expecting to get in since some of y'all are insane but I posted on Chance Me a year ago and people kept on saying legacy W...I guess legacy not W lol....so yeah even if you have near-perfect stats and what i'd like to think are decent ECs &amp; essays you're not guaranteed anything (esp at Harvard lol)

zq3vfk,1,2022-12-19,"Working in a hospital and involved in all aspects of the IT industry, what can I do to advance?",DashSplatBang,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/zq3vfk/working_in_a_hospital_and_involved_in_all_aspects/,"Hi. Long time listener, first time caller... (tldr at the bottom) As the title says, I work IT in a hospital in a rural area and have been doing so since February of 2022. I graduated college in May 2022 with a bachelor's in ""Network Administration and Cybersecurity"" and an associate's in ""Web Development and Administration."" The latter is mostly an on-paper degree, because I only needed to add a few very low level coding classes to my bachelor's program to get it. Maybe I'm selling myself short, I don't know. 4.0 student. I am 37 years old.

Anyways, I started this job at the hospital as an ""Intern"" for a college credit, but it was actually just a full time job that counted as my internship credit. I was hired under the CIO who has been the sole tech guy here for 25 years, but after covid upgrades and additions they decided they needed another tech person. I was over the moon when he said he would train me in everything, but it turns out he has learned everything organically over the years with no formal training or meaning to the words ""best practice."" I'm approaching the ceiling of what he can teach me (in a general sense, there are always the little things) and for everything else it's ""submit a ticket"" to whatever device manufacturer we are dealing with. 

The good thing is that I have had my hands on everything under the sun here. Medical equipment, Aruba switches and APs (all managed by GUI), active directory/group policy, Sonicwall firewall port opening, Veeam backup and replication, the IP phone system, etc. There is also endpoint support for every monitor, scanner, computer, and printer that gets hung up that day, and also users' individual issues. (\~250 employees and endpoints) The problem is that I have little time to learn any one thing at the deep and granular level that I want to. When an issue comes up I have to re-learn that system rather than be the expert and just fix it. 

What I am asking: Right now I am a medium fish in a small pond, but in two years I am expected to move to a one million person city with my GF/future wife. I am currently in a golden handcuffs position with few options for job change because of the ruralness of it all (2500 person town). How do I gain skills that will help me stand out when I move to a place with a lot of competition? I have been a production manager in the past and have never stagnated at a job, but this is my start in the tech industry. I will take any and all advice and appreciate every word of it. Thank you for your time.

TL;DR - Working in a hospital as a jack of all trades and no time to be a master of one. I'm 37 and have a mortgage and chores on top of the 40hr/week job. What can I do to increase specific skills and which ones would be most valuable to learn? The goal is to go for an on-prem job but with the ability to wfh here and there if possible."
zq47zw,6,2022-12-19,Pressure to work free hours: I´m an intern and already sick of the job,theimpostoronme,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/zq47zw/pressure_to_work_free_hours_im_an_intern_and/,"So, early this year i got my first job as an intern in a communication consulting firm. It´s been 6 months and I really like the work and my coworkers. They are quite nice and we have a good time together.

Unfortunately, I can´t say the same about my coordinator. Since the first day she has treated me with an arrogant demeanor. She says I´m a child - I´m 24 - and doesn´t listen to what I have to say. The reason is always on her side. 4 months in, she told me, giggling, that if it was her choice, I wouldn´t have gotten the job. Likewise, she talks to me in a superior way, as if I know nothing and even rolls her eyes when I enter her room to ask a question on work.

This really gets me sad, but there is another thing that really - really - gets me in the nerves. She is every time bragging about the work she does outside work hours and ends with the phrase ""you see, our work is not a 9 to 6pm work"". One day she ordered me to go to a client's event after my scheduled time. The hours were never paid. Today she even screamed with me because she says I have to filtrate the news about clients in the weekends.

My coworkers leave always one hour - at least - before the working time. They all have stories about that night they stayed 'till 2am doing a project for a client. 

There is this unconscious pressure to do more hours than contratualized - my contract specifies 8 hours a day. I don't want to do it, as I value my free hours - to read, to write, to master an instrument. But I really question myself if I'm just not ambitious enough. I really can't understand what makes a person work so much. I'm too cynic for it. Maybe it's a generational thing.

Sorry for the rant, but it is really bugging my mind. Today I came home and cried, because I really don't want to be like my coworkers in the future and work so much time. My contract will be renewed and I really can't grasp if that's great or really bad. Seriously. What do you think of all this?"

I get paid pretty good and all but I hardly do much work. I’m working for 8h daily and I hardly work for 4h at max. Is this common? I always get a bad feeling if I sit around at home doing nothing sometimes. My manager isn’t complaining either, he didn’t notice anything unusual about my productivity. This internship is 6 months long and I’m 3 months in and I kind of get bored out."

Could someone answer some questions and help me out?

Interview is at a small hedge fund in New York for an SWE internship. I’m currently a junior in college.

For 2 hour long interviews, are they generally only 2 hours of coding? They asked me to come into their office for a ‘coding exercise’ and that’s all I got from the email.

Are they going to give me just leetcode questions? If so, are there usually mediums, easies, or hards? And how many?

I’ve only solved about 35 easy and ~5 medium so I don’t have a lot of leetcode practice. Are there any fundamentals I should definitely learn? I know there’s a long list of stuff I should know but I was wondering if one or two things stand out particularly.

Should I prepare for behavioural and resume questions too?

Are there any etiquettes I should be aware of? Dress in suit and pants?

What should I carry with me? A folder with my resume and my laptop? Or neither? I’d rather not wear a backpack over my blazer.

I had my final round interview a little under a month ago and am still yet to hear back from them. I sent a follow-up e-mail around two weeks ago, which I did not receive a reply to.

The possibilities are: 1) I got the OG ghost 2) They are trying to pick a class of interns from all final-rounders and are just finishing off the interviews 3) I am on some sort of waitlist, pending a final decision mid-January.

I don't think I would get ghosted: the HR person was extremely prompt in all three rounds of my process. I also scoured Glassdoor and LinkedIn and no one -apparently- has posted about a London internship outcome yet, only US-ROI-Singapore positions. (Not-so-bad news?)

So my question is: do you know of anyone who's received an offer from Virtu for their London office? And which of the three possibilities would you most emphasise? Many thanks in advance!"

Having never taken one of these, I have a lot of anxiety especially because I wasn’t able to prep due to final exams. Could someone share their experiences and help me out?

Interview is 2 hours at a small hedge fund for an SWE internship. I’m currently a junior in college.

For 2 hour long interviews, are they generally only 2 hours of coding? They asked me to come into their office for a ‘coding exercise’ and that’s all I got from the email.

Are they going to give me just leetcode questions? If so, are there usually mediums, easies, or hards? And how many?

I don’t have a lot of leetcode practice. Is there any mode of thinking I should be portraying since it’s likely I will struggle with the questions.

Should I prepare for behavioural and resume questions too?

Are there any etiquettes I should be aware of?

What should I carry with me? A folder with my resume? Notepad and pen? I’d rather not wear a backpack over my blazer.

Any advice is appreciated."

English teacher (8/10): I participated a lot in this class and I've had her for two years (11-12 grade). She said she was only writing a couple letters this year, and that she would definitely save one of her spots for me. I would say that we have a pretty good relationship.

I will POTENTIALLY be at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in the Markets group, possibly under SOMA, for summer 2023 as a junior intern. I am still applying to places for algo/quant trading and data science internships, but my position at the Fed is guaranteed.

My parents insist that I stick to this job as they contend that it is a safe bet given we are experiencing uncertain times, and the conditions may continue to prevail. I was wondering how difficult would it be to apply for New Grad roles at HFT firms and alike if I was to complete my internship there, or even taken up on the rotational analyst role upon graduation. Would the barrier to entry be too high for me to enter Private Equity firms, etc?

If anything, I am thinking about going for my Masters during my time at the Fed to have a second chance at breaking into aforementioned firms. "

I'm not sure what to do at this point, I originally took a job that promised model based embedded development, but as it's been over a year and I'm working on solely industrial control cabinets my hopes have been dashed.

My resume isn't bad, but I've been going through interviews since September, and the way my interviews go is that I get past the screen, pass the technical interview, and make it past the panel, and then I get the dreaded ""we've decided to head in different directions"" email.  


I'm sure part of it is because I'm entry level, and most places are looking for 1-3 years of experience

I'm pretty much coming with maybe half a year of actual experience from a small internship, with my senior design project, and also TAing a Junior Level Embedded course, and I still am unable to find a job.

Has anyone else been in my shoes before concerning this? I'm just afraid my current experience is going to eventually overshadow my past experience and I'll never be able to leave.

It seems like it is sometimes appropriate to apply for jobs when you meet some but not all of the qualifications, according to articles such as [this one](https://hbr.org/2019/05/you-dont-need-to-meet-every-qualification-to-apply-for-a-job).

How many of the qualifications from each list should I meet before considering myself qualified enough to apply for the job? Is it necessary to meet every qualification listed as ""required""? What if I only meet a few of the ""preferred"" qualifications? Thank you!"

So I thought I'd post here. I'm not sure where to start. I'm looking for a career in software development, but I'm not sure how to proceed. I have no work experience, have a BS in Biology, and have taken a few courses at my local university in CS. Things like Python, C, C++, Java OOP. Most of these were beginner courses, except the Java one. I also took a data structures course, but I didn't pass that one. It was something I wanted to retake.

Thing is, i was pursuing a second BS in Computer Engineering, but I didn't want to take out loans anymore. Without that BS in CS or CE, and no internships, how do I proceed about applying to jobs? I need to work, so I'm not sure what to do.

I can post my resume here, but honestly, I think it's pretty bad.

I think it's just that I don't have any confidence when it comes to applying for these jobs. My programming knowledge is beginner level. The most I know is OOP and the beginning of data structures like dynamic arrays.

I don't know if this the right subreddit, but I just thought I'd ask. How should I proceed? Also, I just wanted to thank everyone in advance for any help you guys can provide. I appreciate it.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Thanks so much guys for responding. I'm just trying to move on with my life and I would like to get my career started. I'll post my resume here. If you guys want, you can take a look at it. Let me know if there's anything I could do. I am checking out youtube videos for tutorials. I should probably focus on one language at this time, instead of jumping between C and Java. I was trying to follow my school's curriculum, but through self learning, but that may not be ideal."

zqnc1s,4,2022-12-20,Reworked my entire SOP,Interesting-Click-30,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/zqnc1s/reworked_my_entire_sop/,"I truly indulge in my father’s philosophy about consistency, honesty and hard work being the most essential virtues to live by, if followed correctly can shape your life towards endless possibilities. Have you ever wondered how much of a technological shift would have occurred if Windows was never created? To assess this I switched to technologically advanced but difficult to grasp, Linux Operating System(OS). As per my anticipation, Linux was able to completely utilize my system’s resources efficiently, because of its customizable nature, which made me realize how an inadequate Operating System can limit performance of even an advanced hardware infused setup.

I spent months on Linux and though it has more resource allocation capabilities, even the slightest tribulation in a process can cause the entire system to freeze or unable to boot up; stability issues. This propelled me in the direction to study more about this topic and create a unique OS which is a hybrid of multiprocessor OS and multiprogramming OS, which could revolutionize the way we work, lessening hardware requirements, and providing complete resource allocation hence increasing efficiency by over 30%.

In order for me to dive into the depths of the ocean of Operating Systems, I would like to learn first-hand from Dr. Michael Waterman. Not only, he teaches Computer Science in depth but also,  he co-developed a research paper on Smith-Waterman algorithm for sequence comparison which traditionally is used for biological sequence alignment, however it can be transgressed into an algorithm to detect signal processes for my created OS which can give quintessential clarity about the efficiency of my model. In addition to that, I intend to take on an extra class offered by  USC  “Operating Systems - CSCI 402”, as a result I would have the opportunity to really scrutinize every miniscule error and eliminate them to perfect my hybrid OS. Moreover, I have been piqued by the internship possibilities provided by SATG in USC to help students, which I would love to be a part of for the reason that this would provide me hands-on experience and teach me to solve a problem practically, rather than a rudimentary approach.

I worked for Fluid controls Pvt. Ltd. affiliated to my college which was a manufacturing company for industry-grade parts and provides services. They approached me for making an application that is easily compatible with multiple language users, and mainly targeted towards the farmers of India. In this project I learned to make and model a real-time photographic scanner, 3d designing and animations, chatbots and multiple solutions in case farmers cannot comprehend these visual aids. This pioneering application required higher knowledge of AI, ML and package management. Furthermore, I have dexterity towards competitions and quizzes, I have participated in multiple Hackathons and online coding competitions, consequently I have acquired various awards and first prize in the Polkadot hackathon for my weed remover project. Not only that but also I am currently associated with a startup named Tutors Arena and it's about an indigenous idea to help students prospecting for a new tutor in order to increase their skills and talent. I used html, css, javascript, JsNode, DBMS and many more technologies to create  this online system. This was a very enthralling project and had to comprehend multiple things to bring this project to fruition.

The course will help me acquire knowledge in my field which would help me a lot in future, with my job as an engineer. I personally feel that studying from your university would help me attain self-confidence, have international exposure and help me attain my goal to formulate a hybrid OS from two different categories. I am sure the varied-culture in the university where students come from across the globe would be present would be an added advantage for me and would definitely grill me to perfection. I am thankful to be a part of this journey and I would work conscientiously if the opportunity arises."

Lucrez de la inceputul anului(primul job ca developer) la un start-up cu produs propriu unde ma ocup de task-uri atat pe frontend(Vuejs, no framework) cat si pe backend(PHP, Symfony, Mysql).

Inainte de asta am facut un internship de 2 luni pe Symfony.

Sunt self-taught, fara facultate, doar liceul absolvit.

Toate taskurile de care m-am ocupat le-am facut in mare parte by my own, cu management/ajutor/interventii spre deloc din partea team leadului sau a altor colegi. Suntem o echipa foarte mica, firma mica.De exepmlu:Am lucrat la un task(pe care l-am prelungit eu destul de mult, fara sa am probleme cu managementul) care de la o chestie micut a ajuns a intru in fiecare componenta din FE si sa optimizez/ajustez/schimb chestii deoarece se comporta la functionalitate si arata la UI ca si cum ar fi fost facut de cineva care acum incepe sa invete FE si s-a uitat si el la 2-3 tutoriale pe Youtube.In timp ce ma ocupam de asta am gasit o multime de bug-uri pe care le-am rezolvat complementar atat pe backend cat si pe frontend si am facut multe pull requesturi pana cand sa se poata declara good enough. La 90%+ din aceste pull request-uri team-leadul a dat direct merge in master fara sa comenteze la ce-am facut ceea ce mie mi se pare dubios.  Codul scris de mine a avut niste bug-uri marunte de ex am uitat sa import o librarie in 1 componenta sau niste strings am uitat sa le traduc, chestii de genul pe care tot eu le-am descoperit si le-am facut fix ulterior.

Mare parte din frontend a fost facut quick and dirty, sa functioneze ok la demo dar daca vezi ce e in spate ne este ideal. Tocmai de aceea am facut mai multe fixuri in task-ul descris mai sus.

Si alte bug-uri pe care le-am raportat daca nu ma ocupam eu de ele nu se ocupa nimeni, numai daca era o chestie care ar putea aparea in timpul unui demo(s-a rezolvat ceva super mega specific si doar pe backend, ca pe frontend nu este vreme de asa ceva).

Pe langa asta eu ma ocup sa-l ajut in mare parte din cazuri pe un coleg care e junior si nu este la acelasi nivel cu mine momentan. Nu ma deranjeaza asta deoarece imi solidific si eu cunostiintele mai bine si imi exersez abilitatile de mentor dar ma asteptam ca by default seniorul sa fie cel care aloca cel mai mult timp pentru asta si care se va ocupa mai mult de el.

A si sa nu uit, multe din task-urile facute de colegul meu junior au fost defapt facute de mine intr-un range de proportie de 50%-80%. Stateam in calluri cu el sa facem pair programming si daca nu fortam eu si nu ii dictam de multe orin, explicandui in acelasi timp ce facem si raspunzandui la intrebari am fi stat 1 sapatamana pe un crud complet frontend backend.

Din tot contextul asta mi se pare ca eu ma dezvolt numai ca invat eu de la un task la alul chestii si ca firma si team leadul(singurul senior din echipa) nu au o contributie in asta.  Nu simt ca am suport, ci mai degraba doar cand e super ultra mega important se aloca timp de discutii. in rest doar pe chat.  Nu ma astept si nici nu vreau sa am n'spe mii de caluri pe zi dar zici ca eu sunt firma care face outsourcing si ei sunt clientul meu si trebuie sa scot chestii de la ei cu forta gen specs mai clare sau cel putin complete etc.

Red flags pentru mine:

1. Nu se fac teste deloc;
2. Nu exista documentatie la codebase;
3. Task-urile sunt definite foarte vag sau incomplet si cand pui intrebari de clarificare de multe ori se raspunde vag/generix, fara prea mult context si pe repede inainte, fara prea multa rabdare.
4. 90% din pull request-urile facute de mine sunt merg-uite in master de catre team lead fara nici un comentariu(aplic best practices, clean code, standards dat totusi ma astept sa fie chestii de imbunantatit),

Mi se pare ca ar fi benefic pentru mine sa-mi schimb job-ul pentru a gasi un mediu si un context care sa ma ajute sa invat si sa ma dezvolt mai mult decat cel in care ma aflu acum. Also nu am beneficii.

Aveti la voi in firma ceva pozitii la care as avea sanse?

Daca nu aveti recomandari de job-uri, ce parere aveti de situatie in care ma aflu?"

ECs

Everything I am about to state happened in the last 365 days.

.I did a three month non paid part time internship at a chemicals company. 

.Was in a nationwide research competition with over 100,000 applicants. Made it to the finals with just 75 people remaining and won two prizes. The competition from start to end lasted about 6 months.

. I am a non paid intern of one year at one of my country’s best colleges where I work as a lab assistant for a distinguished professor. I roughly have over 400 hours in the lab.

.I worked on two different really high level research projects at the college I am interning at. I will state them bellow 👇

-spectrochemical analysis of food dye using laser induced breakdown spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy.
-study of moringa oleifera leaves as an antibacterial and anticancer agent using advanced laser induced breakdown spectroscopy technique.
( both still not published as it takes months or sometimes years to publish a research paper but I had my professor write me a letter of recommendation as proof)

.while doing research on food dye, I’ve found some local brands harboring toxic elements like Arsenic and high concentrations of lead (I triple checked my results via LIBS and even used other advanced methods like ICP-AES for confirmation) and raised awareness in my household and other family households and they all completely got rid of all products including food dye manufactured by those brands.

.My friend and I organized nonprofit sessions where we helped over 15 students from our school on the same competition we were in (the research competition). We even managed to help some of them get in touch with professors from different colleges in my city to help them with their projects. The sessions lasted for a couple of weeks.

.I went on an educational trip to the UK with the same organization that held the competition that I was in (only 21 people from the finalists received this prize).

.GSSC (GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY SPACE CHALLENGE) semi finalist.

-part of the science club at my school.

- I also work as a delivery driver.

-volunteered at a 3 day event. A total of 27 hours.

-volunteered in helping clean up the beach. ( I’ll go more into detail on the common app)


LORs

2- average LORs from teachers (math and chemistry)

1- good LOR from English teacher

1- very good LOR from counselor

1- very strong LOR from the distinguished professor I worked for.

Total of 5 LOR


Honors 

-student of the year award from my school.

-received a special plaque from my city’s minister of education.

-received a certificate from my high school for my good grades.

-another certificate from the research competition themselves.

-trophy for my involvement in the research competition (received from another competition still confused as to why).

-another certificate from oxmidca (the UK educational trip)

-Mawhiba alumni 


Academics 

I don’t have SAT/AP (financial issues and my school doesn’t provide either of those).
My CGPA is 99.28

No I don’t need financial aid I am full pay because I am going with my country’s “culture mission “ so they’ll pay full tuition.

Here are some tips and strategies to help you in your job search:  


1. Start by defining your career goals and the types of jobs you want to apply for. This will help you focus your job search and tailor your resume and cover letter to specific roles.
2. Network, network, network! Connect with people in your industry, attend job fairs and career events, and join professional organizations. These connections can help you learn about job openings and get your foot in the door.
3. Use job search engines and job boards to find open positions. Be sure to tailor your resume and cover letter to each job you apply for, highlighting relevant skills and experiences.

7. Keep an open mind and be flexible. Consider internships, temporary or contract work, or part-time positions as stepping stones to your dream job.
8. Be persistent and keep applying. It can be discouraging, but it's important to keep applying and interviewing until you find the right fit.

Good luck with your job search!"

End goal is to end up somewhere in the Cybersecurity field either as a Cybersecurity Analyst, Incident Response Analyst/Management, or as a Penetration Tester.

So with this all in mind (including the skills I'll gain from my internship), should I just skip doing my Net+ and try to focus more towards cybersec certs since that's the route I wanna go, or is it REALLY important that I get the net+ beforehand as foundation (I just wanna know if it's worth my time and money or not for what I wanna do)?

Ive heard that the net+ and sec+ has some overlap, so doing net+ first might make sec+ easier, but I've also heard that it's not impossible to to sec+ first and net+ later (if I wanna do that).

Thanks."

Here's a rundown of my CV:

+ A diploma in digital business (Austrian school system, equivalent to a technical college degree, 5 years)

+ A 3-month IT internship at a manufacturing company as a developer

+ 2 years of experience as a front-end developer working on websites for an agency (working student, 50%)

+ 1.5 years of experience as a back-end developer working on Industry 4.0 projects (like automating the whole production process of a manufacturer) for another agency (again working student, 70%)

I've also got my PSM 1 and 2 certifications and am finishing up my bachelor's degree in computer science.

Even though I enjoy coding and have a strong interest in tech, I've found that being a developer doesn't really fit my strengths and preferences. I'm a good listener, excel in one-on-one conversations, and love teaching and supporting others. I really identify with servant leadership and want to help others succeed.

After researching scrum, I stumbled upon the Scrum Master role and realized it's exactly what I'm looking for. At my previous jobs, the Scrum Master duties were split between the project manager and the senior developer, so I didn't even know this was a real job. 

However, most Scrum Master positions need you to have experience as a Scrum Master or project manager, which I don't have. Still, I've learned that some consulting firms offer Scrum Master trainee positions with lots of training and guidance. I think my current experience and skills make me a good fit for these.

I'm excited about the possibility of lots of travel, working with different teams and companies, and constantly learning and adapting. While the long hours that consulting firms are known for aren't really my thing, I think the benefits outweigh that drawback for a few years. Plus, there are good exit options depending on the consulting firm.

What do you think about that? I'd appreciate your thoughts and insights."

I’m a 3rd year computer science major and math minor that’s a lot more interested in theoretical CS than its more applied aspects. 

A lot of the internships out there for CS don’t appeal much to me, and I plan on going to graduate school for CS, and for this I probably need to have a sense of what CS or math research actually looks like to see if I will enjoy this career.

I know about REUs, but it’s been surprisingly tough finding CS REUs about more theoretical topics (theory of computation, complexity theory, formal language theory, algorithmic analysis, etc.). 

The non-theory CS REUs are interesting, but 
should I just look into math REUs and go from there at this point?"

**Letters of Recommendation**

APUSH teacher (8/10): interesting guy, but always had really sweet things to say to me and somehow always found out about my poetry wins and congratulated me. told me i reminded him of another student who got into an ivy league and told me he saw me getting into one as well.

AP LANG teacher (9/10) all english teachers like me LMAOA. she describes me as someone my classmates look up to and says i remind her of her daughter.

**Interviews**

(*Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)*

UPenn (10/10): ok y'all i was so stressed about this interview bc it was so laid back and it felt really short, but my interviewer sent me an email saying that ""my positive attitude, resilience, and hard work are a testament to who i am and the great things he's sure i'll go on to achieve"" and that he believed that i deserved to go to penn. also, he gave me the highest rating possible in his interview summary.

(i should also mention that upenn was my last ranked school lMAOAOA but i really thought i'd match here because i was recruited by the kelly writers house and guaranteed admissions advocacy, and the founder of adroit journal wrote me a recommendation letter)

**Essays**

(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*

biographical essay (10/10): i wrote about my struggle with honesty as both a slam poet and a child in a physically and emotionally abusive environment. it was very hard to write &amp; share with others, but everyone received it really well and i told some of my friends about my past via the essay! a few teared up

topical essay (6/10): idk i'm very nitpicky and i thought i could have made it more refined. i wrote about my affinity for rule-breaking as a kid and how that led to my love of the legal field.

proudest moment (7.5/10): talked about my impact on a community member via my mental health org

short answers (6/10): nothing special

my supplements mostly gave context to my ECs. one of my brown supps was about my jamaican culture + father's day w/ an abusive father, and my umiami supp was SO CUTE it was about my health issues but there was a little joke about the toilets at UM at the end bc i be throwing up HELLA. oh and my uchicago essay was about my silence in response to a racist ass ex-friend of mine

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

questbridge allows you to rank up to 15 schools (from favorite school to least favorite) and the highest school on your list that accepts you is the school that you ""match"" with. the match is binding (like early decision) and we found out on december 1st who we matched with. i ranked 7 schools (columbia, yale, brown, stanford, usc, uchicago, upenn).

*Acceptances:*

* Columbia University (Matched)

i don't know if i got into any other college b/c of how QB works, but most people assume that they got into any college they ranked after their match college (i really think i got into upenn tho idk)

**Additional Information:**

i almost didn't do questbridge because i didn't think my stats were good enough for top schools. i initially planned on applying to UF and UM as my reach schools and praying i'd get in. i'm still absolutely shocked and honored at the opportunity to attend columbia! it's been my dream school for years. 

also, leaving my unsafe household and finally being able to live like normal people my age was something i've been praying for my whole life. it's so hard to heal in the same environment that broke you, and while i know NYC will be a culture shock, it'll be super refreshing to get away and help out my family once i'm financially stable.

that being said, definitely shoot your shot at top schools, and don't underestimate yourself! for those of you who view college apps as an escape from a toxic household, i love you and support you fully. i'd love to help anyone else still going thru the application process :)

&amp;#x200B;

oh and if you got into columbia please HMU i need columbia besties &lt;3"

Would like to move closer to DS. Don't hate my job, but losing patience. Feel like I've trapped myself and lost touch with my DS skillset. Considering building portfolio via Kaggle or similar, while job searching. Need advice on how to transition back.**  


Hey all, need some advice.  I'm early into my career, but I'm trying to figure out how to go forward from here.  A little bit of background. I have a BS &amp; MS in essentially information/computer science (not quite as theory/math heavy as CS, more application focused, but I digress), with emphasis in machine learning/AI for business problems. Basically, my knowledge might be more in line with advanced analytics (applying  existing models to new business domains) vs 'data science' (researching/making novel models), although I'm open and willing to be in the math heavy research side if the opportunity presents itself.   


My first work experience was as a data science intern on an internal consulting team were I was helping to build models and solve problems using data from various other teams in the business (where I was hoping to be with my current job). I was there for a year before leaving to try something on the business side of things (big mistake, hated that).  This is the type of work I enjoy doing the most.  


Fast forward a couple internships and I'm at my current job. I've been here for a couple years now (first full time position) as a 'data scientist'. I was here originally as an intern but converted. The original intention of the team, and my role, was to do data science/ML work in the traditional sense. Unfortunately, me and the other data scientists don't do DS work. My role has essentially transformed into a data engineering role, where I handle ETL pipelines for the reports that the BI folks on the team do. This isn't to say that I don't find value in my work and I do use related skills, like SQL. I don't hate it. But, it's frustrating that the one ML project proposal we've come up with keeps getting pushed back.. The 'promise' that was made a couple years ago just isn't happening, and it's impacting my motivation a lot. I think its time to move on.  


But here's my problem. I'm worried that my skillset has moved away from the type of work I want to be doing. I worry that I've locked myself into a data engineering career. This wouldn't be a bad thing if  I was an engineer working directly with ML pipelines. Then I would at least have some exposure. Even though my title and job description *is* that of a 'traditional' data scientist, I have no recent projects to speak on.  My resume isn't as impressive it should be for a data scientist 4 years into their career (counting internships).   


What should I do? I'm scared that the transition back to more explicit DS work will come with a pay cut (going from mid-level position back to entry-level), because  I have no recent projects. My core skills (Python, R, etc.) are weaker than they should be from not using them as much. My initial plan is to retouch on those skills and poke around on Kaggle, even the toy datasets, to show something. Otherwise, I've considered trying to get an IBM or Google DS certificate, but this feels like a waste considering I have a master's degree and grad certification in ML/AI. What are your thoughts?"

zr5f86,16,2022-12-20,Undergrad Research Experience,mziycfh,quant,https://www.reddit.com/r/quant/comments/zr5f86/undergrad_research_experience/,"I'm a sophomore looking to land a trader/researcher intern next year. I have two math research opportunities next semester but I'm not sure which one looks better on my resume/is better in general. Option (1): a semester long research related to stochastic processes; Option (2): two or three small research projects, topics varying from a large range that I can choose from. Both includes some coding, and look fairly interesting to me.

My thought: (1) is more in-depth and can definitely give me something that I can talk about for 10 minutes, and it's also quite related to quant skills, imo; (2) allows me to choose my favorite topics and is more low-stakes (what if it turns out I don't like the first option?), and can take up more space on my resume (I have very limited experience to write on my resume so this is kinda important, imo).

Any suggestion would much be appreciated!"

zr5p3v,0,2022-12-20,Received an offer but waitlisted by another (better) company,ermagawsh,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/zr5p3v/received_an_offer_but_waitlisted_by_another/,"I recently got through an interview process with a pretty big company and it looks good, I’m happy to take it as my internship role. 

However earlier in the year I passed the interviews for a FAANG (you may be able to guess which one) and I was given verbal confirmation and told that I will be contacted with next steps, but then they announced their hiring freeze and told me that they can’t guarantee an offer, but may reach out to me soon.

Of course the FAANG is better paying and has better career prospects so I would love to take them if they do reach out to me, so I was wondering if it’s okay to sign the contract at the company who has given me an offer, but then if the FAANG reaches out I could take their offer? Are there any implications to doing this?

Perhaps I should just be happy with the offer I have, and not risk the faang withdrawing their offer again leaving me left with nothing…"

zr8tld,34,2022-12-20,My Experience Searching For A Data Science Internship,CarsonPayne1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/zr8tld/my_experience_searching_for_a_data_science/,"I thought I would make this post because I imagine that a lot of this sub is in a similar position to mine while searching for an internship in college.

First to start off, here is a bit about what is on my resume:

* Junior at a university with decent credibility. Studying statistics with a data science emphasis. 4.0 GPA.
* Worked as a data consulting intern last summer at a large accounting firm doing a lot of data engineering-type work. Used mostly SQL and python.
* Other work experience is as an advertising analyst for a large church, a linear algebra teaching assistant, and a data analyst at a start-up accounting firm.
* I listed R, Python, SQL, and Linux as languages I am proficient in. Also mentioned advanced statistics, mathematics, french fluency, and some soft skills.
* Some activities I listed were: data science club leadership, personal projects, and case competitions.

I would guess that I applied to around 120 internships. 10 of these were through career fairs and the rest online. Most of the positions that I applied to online were based in NYC or DC as well as remote options. I looked mostly for internships through ZipRecruiter, handshake, and LinkedIn. I also only applied to jobs that didn't state that they wouldn't accept CPT.

So here are my results:

* I did around 15 pre-recorded interviews as well as maybe 5 coding assessments.
* I heard back from around 30 companies saying that they were not interested.
* I interviewed with 5 companies.
* Ultimately, I received an offer from 4 companies for an internship.

Experience with each offer (from least to most exciting to me):

* The least exciting was with an advertising agency working as an ""analyst"". I just applied for the position through their website. For the pre-interview, they had me send in some basic analysis from some e-commerce data. I did one interview with a recruiter and he tested my basic problem-solving acumen. I then was asked to do 4 more interviews that covered a lot of topics but technical skills were not one of them. I received an offer for their Chicago office for $20/hour without relocation benefits. I think the biggest pro of this company was that it had a great culture. I definitely thought I could have enjoyed this job but it wasn't what I am looking for now to gain more data science experience. Ultimately, I didn't choose this internship because I felt like I would not get strong technical development. None of the people who even interviewed me knew how to code and some asked me what data science is. I also asked the recruiter how much I could expect to get paid if offered a full-time job and he said $60k which is significantly lower than I would hope for.
* The next offer came from a campus recruiting event at my university. The company is a large manufacturer of air conditioners. They interviewed me on campus and asked a lot of technical and problem-solving questions. I then did one more interview over zoom that asked about my SQL skills. I was offered $22 an hour, subsidized housing, and paid relocation. Although it was a good offer, I choose not to accept it for a few reasons. It was based in an area of the country where I was not interested in living and where I have no family or connections. Also, the work and company culture were not very interesting. I think I would have done a lot of menial data engineering tasks that would not have pushed my technical development.
* (These last two offers were difficult to choose between because I liked them both a lot) I applied to an event for a large bank on their website. I did a really simple coding assessment and they contacted me saying that I was accepted to the event. They flew me across the country and I participated in a hack-a-thon. It was really fun and throughout the event, each team had mentors that were senior data scientists that gave advice to the teams while also assessing our skills. A few months later, I got a call saying they would like to know my location preference, and then the next day I had an offer. They said that this offer was a result of my performance in the hack-a-thon. They are paying $45 an hour as well as a $2500 relocation bonus. The internship would be focused specifically on data science and artificial intelligence. I think I would definitely have grown in technical skills doing this job but after reading online some people's experiences at this workplace, it seemed that besides the fact that they paid well, people did not really enjoy working for this bank. I also already did a fintech internship so I think trying out a different industry would be really beneficial. I was excited to move across the country for the summer to do this internship but after not being offered any corporate housing, it was difficult to find affordable short-term leases. I definitely would have gone with this internship if I didn't get the other more lucrative opportunity.
* The offer I ultimately decided to accept came from applying online to a large healthcare provider. I did not hear back from them for a long time but then out of the blue, I got a call asking if I could interview the next day. I did a 40-minute call with a data scientist that tested a lot of my technical skills from coding to statistics. I then was told that I made it to the final round of interviews and did three back-to-back interviews in a two-hour period. The first was a more in-depth technical assessment with another senior data scientist, the second was a problem-solving interview by a manager, and the third was a behavior assessment by another senior data scientist. Almost immediately following the interviews, I was called by the recruiter and given an offer. It was a completely remote data science internship for $47 an hour. I really like the idea of working in the healthcare industry and a lot of the people I met at the company were really friendly. In all the interviews they gave me lots of time to ask questions and it sounded like the company culture was really healthy. I think the only con I had for this opportunity is that for starting out in a technical field, I feel like being able to work in person would help me gain more concrete experience. I overcame this thought, however, after talking to one of the team managers who assured me that I would be challenged and given tasks where I could grow my skillset. I also think that the flexibility of being able to work remotely and not have to relocate helped me make this decision.

The most fun question I was asked during the interviews was, how many golf balls could fit in a school bus? I have also received emails from companies asking if I would like to interview with them for other data science internships but since I accepted the healthcare provider's offer, I have declined to interview. This means that there could have potentially been more interviews and offers. 

I hope that sharing my experience can help other people as they try to find internships while still in university. I spent about a half an hour a day applying to 100+ positions over the past few months but all the offers definitely made it worth it. Good luck with your internship searches!"

I had previously did a 6-month internship at one of the biggest quick-commerce startup in India, but unfortunately they went into a hiring freeze, so did not get a PPO. I also qualified for BrowserStack's 3rd round of interview, but they also froze hiring in the middle for everyone.

For my skills, I have solid knowledge of MERN Stack and SpringBoot, and I give utmost care to code quality and modularity. This can be enhanced by the fact that Im currently also leading a project in my current company to refactor the entire codebase to be more modular and well documented, and to remove dead code from the entire codebase.

As for my achievements, I created the most visited page, the Product Description Page, as well as the most used feature, the Search feature, from scratch alone for the aforementioned quick-commerce startup. This most-visited claim was according to that company's analytics. I also managed to implement a feature to reduce the initial bundle size of the website by a significant amount.

Here's my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q6t1SW6fCiSc_N4qbbuqbCE_5qALBxCA/view?usp=sharing), [Github](https://github.com/FaizBShah) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/faiz-shah-0b5955189/)

It will be nice if you could either refer me for some position in your company, or tell me about some opportunities.

Thanks, and have a nice day!!!"
zrd0do,2,2022-12-21,Do people commit suicide for less then i suffer ? Am i strong for being alive ? I want to give up? What do you think ?,Electronic-Theme-301,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/zrd0do/do_people_commit_suicide_for_less_then_i_suffer/,"I suffered many psychological traumas throughout my life. I have several health problems. I've never had an affective relationship and only one close friend my working life is another disaster. I will explain one by one: 

- Most notable traumas: 

1. I don't remember, but when I was a baby there was a caregiver who mistreated me and shook me to stop crying. My mom caught her and fired her. 

2. At the age of 11 I liked a girl in the classroom. I sat next to her one day and she left crying and never came back. The whole class was looking at me like I had done something wrong. 

3. at the age of 12, I was at a friend's house, in the pool and I took off my shorts in a game. My classmate spread rumors to everyone at school. It ruined my reputation. 

4. When I was 12 years old, a classmate tried to kill me by sticking a pencil in my neck. I ended up in the emergency room and he was kicked out. He did this motivated by envy, because I was a good student and was ""stealing his friends"". And also as revenge for a fight in which he tried to beat me on the way out of school, but since I did Aikido and Muay-Thay I beat him and his two friends. I got some sequela caused by the blood loss but fully recovered in 6 months and still managed to get approved that year. 

5. At the age of 15, a girl declared herself to me in the middle of the classroom. Some colleagues liked her and got jealous and tried to hit me... I defended myself and one of them was beaten again, but they lied in the direction and showed the bruises. There were no witnesses on my side so the word was 3 to 1, I was punished by the school. I was already so insecure that I couldn't talk to the girl and I regretted it later.... 

6. At the age of 24, I went through successive rejections of job openings in a short period of time. 

7. When I was 25 years old, I had an accident that left me with chronic pain (I comment in another section). 

Health problems: 

1. In my premature birth I suffered neonatal anoxia (fetal distress), in which my brain lacked oxygen and it was necessary to have a cesarean section. Despite this, my grade was still 7. 

2. In childhood I had growth problems and the pediatrician chose not to use hormones. My height today is 1.65 meters. Also got diagnosed with mild autism, but at the same time high intellectual abilities.

3. At the age of 17, I suffered a hearing trauma after a very loud speaker at a high school band concert. I had hearing loss in one ear an tinittus for many years.

4. At the age of 22 I was diagnosed with keratoconus and my vision began to deteriorate abruptly.

5. At the age of 25 i felt I fell out of a window and broke my knee. I was so depressed that I didn't go to the hospital. I developed chronic pain which I have been living with for 3 years.

6. At the age of 26 I was diagnosed with Social Phobia. Complex post-traumatic stress disorder and avoidant personality. Also severe unipolar depressive disorder.

7.At the age of 27 I started to have high blood pressure. Im using medication.

Woking life:

1. i started Studying law. But I had an existential crisis in the middle and switched to psychology. I didn't get internships due to my social interaction difficulties i got rejected many times. I graduated and had no emotional conditions to work as psychogist (obviously).

2.  I am currently unemployed. But I intend to go to another college (Medicine)

Social life:

1. I was never able to make friends, with the exception of one. Well.... That's basically it. People just don't like me.

Romantic life:

1. I was rejected by a girl at a party when I was 15. She said I was weird and ended up hooking up with someone else at the party.

2.  I was never able to get close to any girl for 10 years due to my fear of rejection and avoidant personality.

3. At 27 I was cured of my personality, social phobia. I met a girl on tinder. She said she thought I was autistic and ghosted me the next day.

4. I asked that friend of mine to introduce me to a girl. He introduced me, she was looking for someone too... but she just didn't find me interesting.

Well, thats it, I never had any intimate relationship."
zrd5c7,88,2022-12-21,Roadmap to careers in cybersecurity and cloud engineering,sold_myfortune,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/zrd5c7/roadmap_to_careers_in_cybersecurity_and_cloud/,"**Please note I am not personally affiliated with any of the knowledge resources I recommend.  I receive no compensation from anyone for anything, I'm merely trying to help people who are at the very beginning of their IT career journey.  I try to recommend free resources wherever possible.**

&amp;#x200B;

This plan is cybersecurity focused but can be adapted to most non-developer career paths. It is mainly intended for people trying to start an IT career with mostly free or very cheap resources available on the internet. It's inspired by a good friend of mine who dropped out of high school to go to work in IT, never attended any college but now works as a cloud architect for NASA. People thought he would be a bum in the street. These days he mainly works from home but if he does go to the office he drives his shiny new Tesla to get there.

EDIT: Many people have asked for a pathway to **cloud engineering**. The best one I've found is in [this post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/xa87x9/sys_admin_to_cloud_possible/).

To start a career in cybersecurity you should be aiming to eventually get a position as a **Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst**. [A SOC analyst position](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5bIhaZOSys&amp;ab_channel=EyeonTech) gives you some insight into a whole range of different information security problems and practices. You'll see incoming recon and attacks, your org's defenses and responses, and the attacker's counter responses. You'll get experience using a [SIEM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAaRA4ctRL4&amp;ab_channel=CyberGrayMatter). You'll become familiar with all of the tools in place and start to figure out what works and what doesn't. You'll learn the workflow of a security team and what the more senior engineers do to protect the enterprise. SOC analyst jobs are not entry level [(see this discussion)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityCareerAdvice/comments/s319l5/entry_level_cyber_security_jobs_are_not_entry/) but rather a mid-level career goal. After a couple of years in the SOC, you'll probably have a much better idea about your own interests and the path you want to pursue in your career.

Here's how you get there:

Step 0 (optional): If you have absolutely no tech experience whatsoever you may first have to try to get a job in retail or the service industry that is technology adjacent. Such jobs would include GeekSquad at Best Buy, cell phone sales or technician at a provider like Verizon or T-mobile, cabling and rack and stack at a commercial data center (smart hands) or video game repair and servicing at an arcade. My first job after college was in data processing for a cell phone billing company. I did QA for huge stacks of paper cell phone bills. It was awful. I got fired when they caught me using company resources to look for a better job. It was good enough to help me get my second job which was helpdesk at a large ISP.

Step 1: Get the CompTia A+ (optional) and **Network+ certifications**. You MUST understand IPv4 networking inside and out, I can't stress that enough. Professor Messer videos are great and free: [Professor Messer A+ series,](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG49S3nxzAnnOmvg5UGVenB_qQgsh01uC) [Professor Messer Network+ series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG49S3nxzAnlCJiCrOYuRYb6cne864a7G)

[Berry Smith's video series on subnetting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yz3FV8WliU)

Mike Meyers has about the best all in one Network + book out right now, you can get that from [Amazon for about $40](https://www.amazon.com/CompTIA-Network-Certification-N10-008-Comptia/dp/1264269056). You can also check out Mike Meyers' channel on Youtube, he has a lot of Network+ videos as well.


Step 2: Start learning **some basic Linux**. The majority of non-desktop business computing is done on a unix type platform, this will not change anytime soon.

The [Bandit Wargame](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) is an excellent exercise to start learning concepts and commands.

For Linux Systems Administration, I'd highly recommend ""Unix and Linux System Administration Handbook"" by Evi Nemeth, et al. The information is presented in a way that is comprehensible to regular people. You can get a [used copy of the fourth edition for about $10.00](https://www.amazon.com/UNIX-Linux-System-Administration-Handbook/dp/0131480057/ref=sr_1_3?crid=O6HE618TLM8X&amp;keywords=evi+nemeth&amp;qid=1661595001&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=evi+nemeth%2Cstripbooks%2C49&amp;sr=1-3). The second edition got me through my first three jobs back in the day.

[Tecmint.com,](https://www.tecmint.com/free-online-linux-learning-guide-for-beginners/) [Linuxpath.org](https://linuxpath.org/), and [Acloudguru.com](https://acloudguru.com/) also have great resources for learning Linux.

[CompTia also has a Linux+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/linux) cert if you want to take it to the next level.


Step 3: Start looking for **helpdesk or tech support jobs** online. You have to do a year or two here to get some practical experience. If you've had great student internships or you have military experience there's a good chance you'll be able to skip this step. If you don't have that or any previous IT experience then starting at the bottom is pretty much unavoidable. If you can, use your local community college career center to get some help with a job search or maybe an internship. This is also a good time to take a programming class or two. Community colleges are great for that, Mark Zuckerberg learned to program at one before Harvard and he did pretty ok. The helpdesk job may only pay $20 - $25 an hour or a bit more but it's only for a year, then up and out. A lot of people get stuck at this helpdesk stage for six, seven, eight years and it's a career killer. One of the things I did right was to minimize my time on helpdesk, I was only there for nine months. After that I made the jump directly to a UNIX sysadmin job at a small government contractor. Come up with a gameplan for your advancement and work it. DON'T GET STUCK ON HELPDESK.


Step 4: Get the [**Security+ certification**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG49S3nxzAnnjucQ18QzbCrv-er2zH7d9) while you're looking for your first tech support job or shortly after. Every IT job has a security component now so think of it like basic training in the military.  This is also a good time to start building increased awareness of contemporary information security issues.  Some top resources:

[Archived webcasts from the SANS Institute](https://www.sans.org/webcasts/)

[Archived webcasts from Black Hills Information Society](https://www.youtube.com/@BlackHillsInformationSecurity/videos)

[Social Media Recommendations in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/zc9iaq/im_looking_for_some_recommendations_of_who_to/)


Step 5: Once you get that helpdesk job, **try to do every security related task you can**. Ask the senior engineers questions when you get a chance and if they are working maintenance windows ask to shadow them as they work. Eventually they may start giving you some of the more routine tasks and you can add those to your resume.

Step 6: **Attend** [**Bsides conferences**](http://www.securitybsides.com/w/page/12194156/FrontPage) (very cheap), there is almost certainly one within a couple hours of you.

Step 7: Try to join a **local hackers group** similar to [NoVA Hackers](https://novahackers.com/) or [Dallas Hackers](https://www.meetup.com/dallas-hackers-association/).

Step 8: **Network with everyone you can** at security conferences and in your hackers group. Professional networking is extremely important and if you want to be a Red Teamer (and that's most of you, right?) it's absolutely necessary. Pentesters are a tight-knit bunch where everyone knows everyone. The best way in to this highly selective group is to know your shit, then act like [Case in Neuromancer](https://williamgibson.fandom.com/wiki/Case), find yourself a [Dixie Flatline](https://williamgibson.fandom.com/wiki/Dixie_Flatline) and impress the hell out of them.

Step 9: After you get those certs and some technical work experience, apply for every SOC position you can. It might be difficult to move, but you might have to consider moving to a tech hub because that's where the jobs are. Seattle, San Francisco and NYC are all outrageously expensive so consider some up and coming tech cities like Dallas, Raleigh NC, Nashville or Austin. Mastercard's infosec dept. is out of St. Louis now. KPMG has a huge facility in Orlando. Post-pandemic there are a lot more WFH jobs available so if you don't want to move concentrate on those, though it might take a bit longer.

Step 10: Take a [Cloud training class similar to this one by Adrian Cantrill](https://learn.cantrill.io/p/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c03) if you can. At $40 for the class the financial risk is minimal and learning a lot about cloud is becoming essential for technical IT workers.  The course is 75 hours and assumes pretty much no prior technical knowledge beyond basic computer literacy.  With the freebie cloud projects Cantrill posts it's closer to 100 hours, that's a ridiculous value. For people who are interested in focusing more on cloud than cybersecurity there is a lot of good info [in this post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/xa87x9/sys_admin_to_cloud_possible/)

Step 11: Keep applying until you get that SOC analyst job. Make sure your resume has lots of keywords on it that reference your certs, technical skills, tech you've used, etc. This is to beat automated scanners and ensure that your resume is actually seen by a person. When you finally get that SOC job go out and celebrate.

Guess what, you're an infosec professional!

A SOC analyst job should pay between $60K and $75K. You'll stay there for a year to eighteen months and get a couple more advanced certifications like CCNA and/or OSCP, then leave for a new job making $80 to $100K. After four or five years in the tech/cybersecurity industry with some focus and hard work you should be at $100K+. From there you should be able to map out your own path to $200K, $300K, whatever.

The program above is mainly for people that are starting from absolute scratch and using no resources beyond the Internet. If you're actually in some sort of formal program I'd also highly recommend at least one programming class, preferably in python. Being able to automate tasks is an invaluable skill as a SOC analyst and will set you apart from those that can't.

Something to keep in mind is the salary level you're shooting for. $100K still puts you in the top twenty percent of salaried workers in the US and the top ten percent of workers on the planet. Companies do not give these jobs away. You have to prove yourself over and over. It's tough, but probably not nearly as tough as being a first responder, ER nurse, long haul trucker, or inner city fifth grade teacher. You can do it if you simply refuse to quit. Good luck!

zrdkvu,2,2022-12-21,Taking paycuts for the first job but then renegotiating salary afterwards.,Tarneks,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/zrdkvu/taking_paycuts_for_the_first_job_but_then/,"Context: i took a position for a managerial/data science role. Since it was my first position the title is very good since I’ll essentially manage a project and report to a senior manager who will teach me what’s necessary. However due to the risk I was told that id have to take a paycut. Based on the salary average for data scientist is 105,000 in the company and i have seen in other sources that entry level ds take 100,000.

Thus on average I am taking around a 15,000 paycut despite my education.

Is it ever possible for me to get a salary to the company average after the first contract? The contract was 10 months and the director said they will raise it after the contract is done. 

Thus my question, how much should I expect as a raise and when should I make a decision to move or stay given the experience. 

Background and experience:
1 year work experience in internships and coops

Masters degree in DS &amp; analytics.

My expectation was around 95-97 then raise to 105.

I have seen DA get paid 99.5 for basic SQL reporting and a bump to 105-120 when they become a senior. This is with way less responsibility and stress. 

Would appreciate advice :)"

I’m currently a sophomore undergrad in an engineering school and I’m having trouble deciding on what to major in. My goal is to become either a software engineer or computer engineer at a big tech/computer company such as NVIDIA. 

So far I’ve been really enjoying my computer science courses and been loving the aspects of programming. I’ve even been able to secure a software engineering internship for the summer. However, a part of me feels like I could accomplish my goals as an electrical engineering major, as well as have more opportunities to explore when I graduate (I could also call myself an engineer). I also have strong interest in computer hardware. But the other part of me really enjoys the CS major topics and classes a bit more, so it has left me at a crossroads. 

I would totally major in computer engineering, but my university is not ABET accredited in computer engineering, it is however accredited in EE.

zrorvw,20,2022-12-21,Overwhelmed by Enterprise IT,Status_Bet_5331,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/zrorvw/overwhelmed_by_enterprise_it/,"Hello everyone, long time fan of this subreddit and I come before you today asking for some advice. A little background I graduated college last spring  and landed a internship at a pretty large company working in enterprise IT. I made it clear that I had little experience in IT but would prove I could be a fast learner. Fast forward to now I have been hired on as a Enterprise Architect and have 3 cloud certifications. I have currently only been working 5 months at this company since my internship. I am very overwhelmed and continue to be given more responsibility as my role grows. I struggle the most with the business side of Enterprise IT, there are so many meetings and so many people you have to work and communicate with. I'm wondering if this is the job for me and if I need to transition to a less business forward IT role. Also I reliaze IT is alot of communication, but this is next level compared to other jobs I have had in the past. Reminder not even a year out of college and I am a introvert, I enjoy IT and problem solving. I love being given a problem or more mundane IT work like creating buildbooks or building servers in the cloud. It's the constant meetings involving different network builds, migrations, and acquisitions can be extremely draining. Anyone one have advice? Just wondering if this is the job enviorment for me and I just need to tough it out or if there is another role that may fit me better. An example I've seen is cloud engineer or am I having the grass is greener syndrome.

Update: Wow didn't except so many people to leave comments. I want to clear a few things up without going to in depth. I am not making as much money as alot of people think. The title I was given was suppose to be a Jr role, but I am the first intern hired for IT at the company. Pretty much a guinea pig to see what an internship program would look like and to represent what the company wants to develop moving forward. I was given the title with everyone in IT knowing I was the newbie who is learning. Thank you to everyone who left advice, it was extremely helpful and eye opening. I don't know anyone in IT so I don't really have a concept of what level I am currently working at. It's one thing to have your manager say you skipped 10 years of working and another to hear it from those actually working those 10 years. I am very blessed for this opportunity and will continue to work to the best of my ability. Despite being an introvert I have amazing people skills which helped me get the role in the first place, those who gave suggestions on how to decompress I appreciate the most. Introverts can be social and charismatic we just need time to reset once the day is done. I also have student debt and am working to get out of it. I applied to around 400 job postings (had to make a new email to handle it) when I graduated and was able to land the job I have now somehow. Also thankyou for the career advice, I don't know if this is the field for me. But I will give it as much time as I can. Again thankyou to everyone."

I recently took CIS 3003 which was incredibly easy and let me do it all online at my own pace, so I'm hoping for another one just like it. Does anyone have any advice?"

Only issue is that I got an offer from google (Guaranteed) when I was about half way through my internship. Obviously I accepted google’s offer (don’t wanna setup a silly poll) but don’t wanna burn bridges with a company that is making some quite good progress. 

But my question is would you accept their offer and renege around April or May or would you renege their offer and hope google doesn’t rescind theirs.

Edit: These are both internship offers if you’re wondering"

Some stuff about me that may influence the decision:

* I  am an international student and I have seen stories of the big tech in  Sydney only hiring PRs or citizens, so I do value connections and  industry experience.  

   * How would the uni facilitate the connection between international and domestic students?
* The distance from my place to both unis is negligible in this discussion.

Some opinions/stuff that I have found are:

* unsw trimesters are worse? (shorter time to do assignments, 3 tests a year, hard to get internships?)
* unsw better compsci/engineering societies (better for building professional connections)
* usyd better campus life
* usyd  pretentious, private school people (don't think that is going to be so  prevalent in the compsci related people) vs unsw public, selective  people (probably a stereotype)
* unsw somehow got better industry involvement?
* usyd shared pools for free electives

Thanks."
zrtc59,2,2022-12-21,Engineering Job Search with Pending Offer/Clearance,nuckingfoob6969,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zrtc59/engineering_job_search_with_pending_offerclearance/,"
I graduate in May 2023 with an engineering degree and have been searching for a job once I graduate. I currently intern at a company making good money and they have told me they plan on making me an offer closer to graduation. 

They do not know this yet, but I have accepted an offer from another company for Summer 2023. This job would force me to relocate and also requires a security clearance, which is processing already. 

My question is, do I continue to job search during my last semester? The offer I accepted is a fine offer but nothing extraordinary. I accepted it as a way to get my feet wet right out of school with a good company, but i’d really prefer not to relocate. Would it be wrong to continue to job search while this company is sponsoring me for a clearance? If I were to accept another offer, would my clearance remain or be cancelled? I would expect that company to not consider me for hiring ever again, but are there other fallout consequences? Does anyone have experience in this? I know we all say to take the best offer for ourselves but I’d like to hear from people who may have experienced this or known others who have. 

Thanks"

Hey everybody!

I’m an undergrad student in an IT program. I got an offer to intern at a startup in Bay Area over the summer about a month ago, I accepted it and signed the contract pretty much right away.

This week, I got an offer from one of my professors to work with him on a research project over the summer instead. I’m leaning towards academia a lot more so I’m tempted to accept the position.

My internship contract says both parties are free to terminate employment at any time but I feel a little bit guilty because it’s a fairly competitive position and they’ve stopped hiring.

I’m wondering if anyone has any advice! Would it be really bad if I backed out of the internship? If I were to back out, how do I tell them and deal with stuff like LinkedIn connections from that company?

Thank you all in advance!"

So I have been stuck in a horrible call center job for the past 3 years; I absolutely hate this job; a few years ago decided to finish college to be able to leave this job, I finally graduated from Information technology management in June, and since then have been applying to more than 300 jobs and I am still stuck in this Job being miserable everyday this job has even led me to have suicidal thoughts , yes Ive had countless interviews but they always want someone with more expereicen; I had no internships bcs I was working i this same job while studing and I live on my own cant stop working or take a paycut im already paycheck to paycheck the only experience I have is in B2C sales callcenter. I need please advice in two things.

1. my degree its pretty broad and Im having a hard time knowing what direction to take, I basically just have diferent resumes depending on the Job, from business development (Sales) to cloud computing, and Im appying to every single job I found Im just desperate to get out of this job, now I now a lot of people will say a degree doesnt garantee a job bla bla bla, and yes Ive gottan a could computer practitioner cert, did an SQL bootcamp, Swift IOS app developer bootcamp and Python bootcamp. have done some personal projects to talk about in the interviers but still nothing. So anyway how the hell I am supposed to know what direction to take having such a broad knoledge and degree, I dont want to speciallyce in anything and then realizing I wanna go other route.

2. should I keep getting certs about difent topics to see If I land a job where any of those skills work ?

thank you in advance and sorry If I sound a lil negative Ive had some pretty rough weeks"

zrvydv,1,2022-12-21,Advice for a recent college graduate who majored in Computer Science and Statistics looking to start a career in data? How does job security look?,OGlogicgate,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/zrvydv/advice_for_a_recent_college_graduate_who_majored/,"Hello, I graduated from university (not elite but notable) this semester with a major in Computer Science and Statistics. My internship experience is limited to front end development but as I was accruing credits towards my statistics major over the past year and a half and taking a course on machine learning, I've decided that I want to go into the field of data science. Unfortunately I don't have any internship experience in the field but after alot of consideration, a career in data science seems to be what I have the most interest in.

Through my coursework and projects I've had alot of exposure to python and data and ml frameworks, namely numpy and pyTorch. I also have experience in SQL and backend query languages.  

My question is, what should I focus on doing to make myself a more appealing candidate to get into the field of data science? Are there any certificate programs like the TensorFlow developer certificate that would help in me getting a job in this field? I should note that I had my fair share of personal issues in college and that my gpa is a 2.7 which really concerns me about my chances.

I apologize if this question is too open-ended or lacks basic research on my part, I've been struggling on what career I wanna go into and just recently decided I want to orient myself towards data science. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Also, as a side if you can touch a little bit on what job security looks like in the field I would greatly appreciate it. I've been paying attention to the openAI language model and like I'm sure many others, was frightened by what it could do. I understand there's no way it could replace a data scientist in it's current state however who knows what it can do in future iterations? How likely is it that large language models like chatGPT will either replace or displace a large percentage of data scientists in the field?"

So I have been stuck in a horrible call center job for the past 3 years; I absolutely hate this job; a few years ago decided to finish college to be able to leave this job, I finally graduated from Information technology management in June, and since then have been applying to more than 300 jobs and I am still stuck in this Job being miserable everyday this job has even led me to have suicidal thoughts , yes Ive had countless interviews but they always want someone with more expereicen; I had no internships bcs I was working i this same job while studing and I live on my own cant stop working or take a paycut im already paycheck to paycheck the only experience I have is in B2C sales callcenter. I need please advice in two things.

1. my degree its pretty broad and Im having a hard time knowing what direction to take, I basically just have diferent resumes depending on the Job, from business development (Sales) to cloud computing, and Im appying to every single job I found Im just desperate to get out of this job, now I now a lot of people will say a degree doesnt garantee a job bla bla bla, and yes Ive gottan a could computer practitioner cert, did an SQL bootcamp, Swift IOS app developer bootcamp and Python bootcamp. have done some personal projects to talk about in the interviers but still nothing. So anyway how the hell I am supposed to know what direction to take having such a broad knoledge and degree, I dont want to speciallyce in anything and then realizing I wanna go other route.
2. should I keep getting certs about difent topics to see If I land a job where any of those skills work ?

thank you in advance and sorry If I sound a lil negative Ive had some pretty rough weeks"

*Venlil Prime, 12 July 2136*

Governor Tarva of the Venlil was having a *really busy* day. First the outer defence sensors had detected some bizarre readings, including some exotic particles that Federation scientists had only theorised existed. These could only have been drawn from the quantum foam of the universe itself, but in addition to *dark matter*, had simply burst into existence for a fraction of a second a day’s flight from Venlil Prime. In its wake had been left an unidentified ship, a gleaming bladed spire perhaps the size of a small Federation merchant vessel. The ship had then accelerated towards Venlil Prime at a third-again as fast as any known ship could have done, and using a form of propulsion unknown to the Federation. Suffice it to say, Tarva and the rest of the Venlil government had been dragged out of bed and forced to come up with a plan. And to so while fending of journalists and reporters from every news service on the planet, after some Security Services intern leaked the report *within two minutes of the ship appearing*.

So far, the consensus was that this was some new, uncontacted species, likely one embarking upon its first excursion beyond their solar system. In which case, they must be warned of the Arxur threat and inducted into the Federation at once. Any new technologies, such as this seemingly untraceable form of FTL, would be of unimaginable use to the Federation, especially any that could be weaponised. If those particles could be focused into a beam, or the quantum energy the ship utilised could be released as some sort of explosion…. In any case, a message had been sent to the nearest Federation member, the Gojid Union, and to the Kolshians. Hopefully, a delegation from the wider Federation would arrive within a week or so, with the Gojid arriving sooner to begin the new species’ acclimatisation to the idea of an interspecies war. The Nevok and Fissans would likely trample each other trying to monopolise the new technology, while the Krakotl would push for the development of new weapons. All of that would come later. For now, Tarva was preparing to head a delegation to meet with the new aliens when they landed, once they had got in contact via video. She was sitting at her desk, writing up a speech to deliver after communications were opened, while brainstorming ideas for what to say at the various state functions that would follow First Contact. The screen in her office was showing some fringe-science conspiracy nut shouting over the objections of several more qualified analysts and commentators. 

“Yes, I know that no species built warships until the war started! I know that there are no indications of laser emitters or plasma railguns! But the ship looks like a goddess-dammed blade mated with a screwdriver, it is *covered* in spikes, and parts of its hull look like hypothetical particle-accelerator weapons. At the very least this species has some questionable tastes.” 

Tarva was chuckling when General Kam burst in. He was clearly flustered, his ears trembling like leaves in a storm, his tail lashing the air. Behind him came one of the science advisors in a similar state of agitation. “Governor, I just rrr-received the latest reports from the ttt-team analysing those weird readings” he stuttered out “They, well…” Kam turned to the advisor, who grudgingly took over the explanation.

“The form of FTL this ship used, it *interacts* with hyperspace without actually entering it. We went through the readings from the hyper-scanners, nanosecond by nanosecond, and the trace, it was faint and wonky, but…” He seemed to steel himself for a second. “It leads to *Earth*.” Tarva stared at them for a second. Then she stood up. “The humans survived?” Kams’ tail swished in confirmation. “We can’t call the Gojid for help?” Kam looked at the floor. “They would never arrive in time, and even if they could, that ship could be carrying enough firepower to take out the entire fleet. I’ve seen some of the speculations on how this new tech could be weaponised”.

Tarva shuddered at the thought of what this predatory warship could wreak upon her people. “Right, then the only option left is to send a message to the Federation giving a full explanation of what is happening, they deserve to know what is coming for them. Perhaps they can formulate some sort of response. Then, we broadcast our surrender to the human vessel…” A message icon appeared on Tarva’s desk terminal. The human vessel was transmitting a message to Venlil Prime, and as per emergency protocols, the call was being forwarded to Tarva’s office. Kam gave her a wry look. “It would seem the predators have pre-empted our surrender”.

Tarva opened the transmission on the office’s main screen. The face that greeted her was not the one she had anticipated. Short sky-blue fur covered a flat, muzzle-less head, with pointed ears protruding from the sides. The lower face was dominated by a slight bulge with three narrow slits running from top to bottom. There was no sign of jaws or a mouth, how did this thing eat? Goddess, how did it even *talk*? The two large forward-facing eyes were consistent with a predator, but two additional eyes looked out on different directions from a pair of moving stalks that now shifted to look directly at Tarva.

*‘Greetings’* the voice came from the room speakers. ‘*I am Communications Officer Marons-Seldiath-Cosskilion of the Inter-Species Union Exploratory Vessel* *Covenant of Aftran**. We are here of a mission of peaceful exploration. Please respond.’*

Tarva was stunned. Those stalk-eyes, they allowed this creature to look in any direction it needed. Surely these were prey creatures, not the dangerous predators she had expected. Something else occurred to her. “I am Governor Tarva of the Venlil Republic. Forgive me, but did you say Inter-Species Union?” she asked tentatively. Was it possible, was there another group of sapients like the Federation, a league of established interstellar species who could turn the tide against the Arxur? The blue creature raised two delicate, seven fingered hands towards the screen. *‘Indeed, the crew of this vessel consists of seven different space-faring races, out of a total membership of nineteen. My own species, the Andalites, are founding members, and have contributed much of the technology that makes up the ship itself’* the Communications Officer paused *‘However, I believe that my captain would be best suited to explain’.* He/she(?) extended a hand towards the edge of the screen, their right stalk eye pointing in the same direction. Tarva watched with interest. The forward eyes were disconcerting, but made sense. Those nimble, multi-fingered hands were clearly designed for precise, delicate work, and surely greater depth perception would only enhance the results, while the stalk eyes watched for threats. Then Marons moved aside while another creature took their place, and Tarva’s blood ran cold. Brown skin, a wide primate mouth, and forward-facing eyes. On the screen stood a human, the predatory nightmare from which Tarva thought her people had been spared. *‘Greetings Governor, I am Captain (Expeditionary Corps) Noah Williams, representing the Federation of Human Systems. We recognise the tremendous shock that you are experiencing with the discovery that you are not alone in the universe’.* Tarva and Kam stared blankly. What was this human talking about? *‘I assure you, we come in peace, on a mission of exploration aimed at charting all habitable systems in this region of space. If you will permit it, I and some of my fellow crew members will journey down to your world once our ship is in orbit, where we can meet in person and discuss this in more depth.’* Tarva rushed through the options in her mind. Could they refuse? No, the predators would just drop their pretence of desiring peace and bombard her world from orbit. If they allowed the ship to land, then could they capture it? At the very least, they could lure the humans into a sense of false security, buying time for the special forces team to muster and contain them. Kam clearly thought the same, and gave her a tail swish of confirmation. Tarva looked straight at the screen. “Yes captain, I believe that would suit both parties. I hereby give you permission to land on Venlil Prime. Coordinates for the landing zone will follow shortly.”

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An hour later Tarva and a handful of other Venlil were standing in the cold, watching as the human vessel descended from the sky towards the large park Tarva had chosen as the rendezvous. Up close it looked more terrifying than ever, a cluster of swords intersecting a core of gothic architecture. Thoughts of what the human had said in its broadcast whirled through her head. It had said that it represented the Human Federation? Surely a space-faring species would be more unified than that, although it was likely the most a species as violent and tribal as the humans could manage. As for the other species aboard the vessel, they were clearly slaves and cattle for the humans. The flying armoury halted abruptly, looming over the assembled greeting party. Tarva looked at Kam with apprehension. Wasn’t the ship going to land? Then a smaller craft detached from somewhere underneath the central mass of the ship, and gracefully soared down to where the Venlil waited. The ship was sleek, aerodynamic, shaped like a great silver bird of prey. It touched down a dozen metres from them. A hatch opened and out came the most fearsome creature Tarva had ever seem. 

At least the height of an Arxur, its reptilian form was covered in a fine covering of green-brown scales, with a line of green-black spikes running from the tip of its tail up to its neck. Large taloned feet buried themselves in the soil, reminding Tarva even more of the Arxur. Great sickle blades the same colour as the spikes sprouted from every joint and lined the forearms and shins. Tarva *knew* that those protrusions could cut any species in the Federation in half with one blow. But the worst part was the head. Mounted on a serpentine neck with three thorn-like horns jutting forward and a beak that would make a Krakotl envious, searing red eyes swept over the creatures surroundings before settling on the Venlil. One of the aides was clearly close to fainting, tottering on his spindly legs. What was this creature? Was it allied with the humans? Could predators even have allies? The bladed monstrosity turned back to the shuttle. A gruff, rasping voice issued from its beak. “Safe. No warriors. Come”. Tarva just about managed not to faint, as five more beings strode from the ship. First came two humans, the one calling itself Noah and another, slighter one. Both were wearing a skin-tight garment of dark blue that showed every contour of their predatory bodies. The next being out of the hatch made Tarva stare in incredulity. It was the ‘Andalite’, Marons and for the first time Tarva could see the entirety of the assumed prey creature. The blue-furred torso with its two small arms was mounted atop a horizontal lower body with four hooved legs that looked ideal for fleeing from pursuing predators, lending Marons an air of swift, graceful *power*. But their tail…. Easily twice the length of the rest of the body, it stood arched behind Marons’ shoulder as if prepared to strike. The curved blade on the end triggered the same instincts within Tarva as the humans binocular eyes: ***threat***. Here was a species that likely had never needed to flee from its predators, who could split any attacker open as easily as the Arxur tore apart Venlil pups, and yet this one clearly served the humans. By the Goddess, they had their backs to Marons, providing ample opportunity for the blue sapient to strike, and yet the blow never came. Following the quadruped was one of the most bizarre creatures Tarva had ever seen. Four arms, one muscular pair ending in meaty four-fingered hands with curved claws on the tips, a more slender pair with seven fingers each, all four bearing a curved blade near the wrist. A pair of cloven hooves attached to wiry legs that somehow made Tarva deeply uneasy. The head was almost as strange as the Andalites, with what looked to be a rectangular beak instead of lips and four eyes swivelling independently to view the entire area. Like the Andalite, it was clearly a prey animal. An orange and black pelt covered the entirety of this strange creature. The final occupant of the craft was a grey and brown quadruped that reminded Tarva of a Mazic. Slim three-toed legs led up to a diagonal, near upright body, with an ovoid head that ended in a short cropping beak and a pair of prehensile trunks that each further divided into four finger-like tendrils. The sideways eyes indicated a prey species, and yet the being walked forward with a confidence Tarva would never have associated with a species enslaved by the humans. 

The strange procession came to a halt a handful of paces from the assembled Venlil. The human called Noah took another step forward, placing itself in front of the others. “Greetings Governor, thank you for inviting us to your world”. It gestured to its fellow aliens. “With me are Sara, our Chief Biologist” the slighter human nodded in acknowledgement. Tarva could not help but translate: Assessor of Cattle Suitability. “Communications Officer Marons of the Andalite Electorate”. Electorate? What would a slave species be voting on? “Security Officer Vas Dalar of the Hork-Bajir Great Speaking\\?/Forest”. The bladed alien this time. What was that hiccup with the translator? How could a word mean both ‘act of speaking/debate’ and ‘large collection of trees’? Why would a clearly predatory species refer to their government as trees anyway? “Beltan 28A of the YPM”. Now that sounded like a slave name, but why would the humans give away their desapienisation of this orange creature if they wanted to deceive the Venlil? And what did YPM *mean*, anyway? “And finally, Cultural Examiner Roo-Shan-Top-Shrie of the United Kelvar Sapients” The grey and brown quadruped gestured with its trunks. And what did that mean, United ***Kelvar***Sapients? There was no way that an obvious counterpart to the Federation would assist the predators with their deceit. Perhaps the humans had conquered them? ‘Noah’ turned back to Tarva. “Now, shall we get out of the cold, and I can give you a better explanation of who we are”.

So the two groups began their walk across the park, taking the most direct route towards shelter. Tarva found herself walking beside the hulking creature the human Noah had referred to as a ‘Hork-Bajir’. They were passing one of the various ornamental trees when Vas Dalar reached up with one clawed hand and pried off a piece of bark. They crammed it into their beak, chewed for a few seconds, and then swallowed. “Good bark”. The great horned head turned to Tarva. “Great resource for trade with Hork Bajir. Shipments of food-bark for Inter-Species Union technology, perhaps shipments of seeds to Hork-Bajir cold-world colonies”. Tarva could only stare. Was this species…prey? But then the same question of why the Andalites served the humans applied to the Hork-Bajir, ten times over! Tarva considered her response. “Tell me, Vas Dalar” she asked hesitantly “how did your people meet the humans”. Vas Dalar shrugged their massive shoulders. “Hork-Bajir living peacefully on homeworld, harvesting bark of tall Fit-Fit, hiding from beasts of Father Deep. Yeerks come, take homeworld, make Hork-Bajir slaves”. Tarva waved her tail in acknowledgement. So the human tribe called ‘Yeerks’ had enslaved the Hork-Bajir, likely so far back that they now accepted it. But Vas continued. “Yeerks come to Earth, try to make the humans slaves. Humans fight back, free Hork-Bajir, drive off Yeerks. Hork-Bajir take back homeworld, build weapons and ships, will never be slaves again.” That stunned Tarva into silence. There was a *third* predator species out there, one that had already enslaved at least one other species? But why would the humans free this prey species, much less allow them to build fleets of warships? 

A handful of paces away, Kam asked Marons a question that had been on the minds of every Venlil present. “Tell me, is your spacecraft a military vessel? As a member of my peoples’ navy, I naturally have to ask if your ship is armed…” The Andalites’ response shocked them, in more ways than one. *&lt;Of course ‘**Covenant of Aftran’* *is armed, General&gt;*. That voice…it was in their heads! Not a spoken response, but somehow…transmitted into their brains? Surely the humans would be unable to hear Marons response. Now they could get the answers they needed, for no prey species would willingly aid a predator. And now they had confirmation that the supposed scientific vessel was a warship! *&lt;The universe is a very dangerous place. There are hostile species, rogue comets and other hazards that make interstellar travel inherently unsafe. But do not fear. Our ship is not considered to be a warship, as its primary armament only delivers 60 kilotons per second&gt;*. Tarva and Kam both exchanged a look of horror. That was nuclear grade weaponry, and the ship was not considered a warship? The plasma-railguns mounted on Federation ships were much weaker than that, and if it was per *second* instead of per *shot*… Kam turned back to Marons. “How powerful would a military grade…weapon be?” *&lt;Most human warships carry one to four ‘burner’ particle cannons with a yield of 40 megatons per second or higher, with an average sustained fire duration of 36 seconds. There are more powerful versions of course, some capable of cracking continental plates, but ships carrying that level of firepower are rare.&gt;* Tarva nearly fainted in horror. Human vessels had multiple weapons capable of unleashing destruction on-par with Federation anti-matter bombs in continuous beams, and likely had shields with similar tolerances. How was the Federation going to stop them? “Why would they build weapons with that kind of power?” Kam demanded. Marons looked at him in a way that seemed to communicate puzzlement. *&lt;As I said, the galaxy is a dangerous place. All species need to defend themselves from those dangers. And besides, the humans simply reverse-engineered our shredder technology. Our weapons are more powerful, proportionately, and their smaller size allows us to mount more per ship&gt;* The Andalite curled its tail in a gesture that seemed laden with meaning. *&lt;The humans are fine allies. They may be weak, fragile creatures, but they have a drive and a commitment to justice that makes them key players in galactic politics. In honour, they are easily our equals&gt;* All four eyes turned to the humans. *&lt;Their history may be bloody and chaotic, but then all species have fought wars in their past. And the relative recentness of those conflicts means that they remember truths of war our warrior class has forgotten&gt;* The stalk eyes turned back to Kam. *&lt;You are new to the interstellar community, General. We know from your lack of orbital infrastructure and the absence of any zero-space radiation other than our own that you have only just begun exploring space, but understand, we mean you no harm&gt;*.

Tarva was mulling over Marons words, trying to understand exactly what the Andalite had meant, when Sara called the group to a halt, pointing to one of the trees. Perched atop one of the highest branches was a nezar, its twin tails writhing in agitation, the bright green tufts of fur on the ends weaving erratic pattens through the air. The human turned to Marons. “It would seem that we have our first fauna to analyse”. What now? Did the human want a *snack*? “Marons, if you would?”. The Andalite nodded and walked a little way from the rest of the group. And then they *changed*. The stalk eyes retracted into the head, which in turn began to bulge outward, a razor-sharp skewering beak growing from where a mouth would be on any other creature. The torso shrank into the lower body as the arms grew long and thinned out into feathered wings. Marons reared back on his hind legs, which split into talons, while his forward legs divided into another two pairs of wings. And all the while he shrank. Within a minute, a blue and red predatory bird with six wings and a vicious stabbing beak stood where a quadruped prey sapient had before. The…monster took off and flew at the nezar, which leapt to the next tree and tried to flee. Tarva turned to Sara. “What…how…?”

The human bared its teeth. “Don’t worry, he’s not going to hurt it. Marons’ just going to use his Kafit morph to capture the creature, then he’ll bring it back for Captain Williams to acquire”. Tarva did not understand any of that. “But, how?” Sara looked at her in an almost…pitying way. “Andalite morphing technology allows people to change their forms using the DNA of other species. It allows us to experience how that creatures’ mind works and, some would say, get to understand the ‘soul’ of the ecosystem in which that species lives. There’s a tradition that you acquire a morph on each planet you visit, and since there are rules about acquiring sapient species…”. The human shrugged. “This will allow us to gain a better understanding of your species, and the general…essence, of your world. We’ll need a larger sample size of species, sea life, large predators and so forth, but that should be enough for us to comprehend your planet without needing to acquire a Venlil”. Tarva stared off into the distance, as Marons returned with the nazar gripped in his talons. Warlike shape-shifting prey animals that had no compunctions about taking the forms of predators, bladed monsters with a tragic history, and predators who used some sort of genetic engineering tech to *empathise* with other species? And on top of that, had weaker weapons than the neighbouring prey species, freed slaves, and expected a civilised species to have preserved their predators?

Just what had the universe dropped on her this time?"

\- havent read them but:

\- One of the veterinarian doctors I currently work with. I'm always attentive and asking questions, so I think it'll be good

\- My counselor - Only known her since Junior year, but she knows a good bit about me

**Essays**

\-I think I'm a pretty good writer, but nothing insane

\- probably an 8/10

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD) SO FAR**

*Acceptances:*

* University of Tennessee (EA) 

*Rejections:*

&amp;#x200B;

**CHANCE ME FOR: (in order of preference)**

University of Miami

North Carolina State University

University of North Carolina Chapel Hill

&amp;#x200B;

For the NC Schools, I'm planning on writing in the extra info that I was born and raised in North Carolina for 16 years, even though I'm technically not a resident, I'm still a North Carolinian (not sure if this will matter but who knows)

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for all your help guys!"

zs0i1z,0,2022-12-21,Doing an internship at Cisco after a consulting internship -- is this allowed / conflict of interest?,ilovechemistry8,Cisco,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cisco/comments/zs0i1z/doing_an_internship_at_cisco_after_a_consulting/,"Hi, I got offered a consulting internship at a Big 4 for Summer 2023 in addition to a Strategy/Business Analyst internship at Cisco for Summer 2023 as well, but it starts the same week I end my consulting internship (there's a week or two of overlap). Does this pose a problem? Do I have to disclose this to the Big 4 or Cisco?

Both offer letters for Cisco and the Big 4 say I can't be in another role that's competitive with each respective company, but what exactly does ""competitive"" mean? Like just direct competitors like other Big 4s and consulting firms / other tech companies? If my client at the Big 4 isn't Cisco, then is it okay?"

Now that I’m back in the office I’ve been giving chats when students and such when they reach out.

Inevitably the question always comes up what would you recommend I do to get a role like yours / to get in the industry? 

Problem is I don’t have any secret sauce, I applied to a job posting in school, got the job and the rest is history so I never really have much advice for them beyond just telling them to keep networking.

Any advice on what I could say that would make for a more substantial answer?"

I’m a sophomore and I didn’t do anything the summer after my freshman year, so I was hoping this summer would be my chance to gain industry experience but it’s not looking good. Feeling pretty hopeless as now it’s pretty late and getting an internship is pretty much out of the picture."

Pros for WashU

- Tempurpedic Beds
- Nice campus
- Top 20
- All Seasons
- Pretty scenery
- Midwestern Kindness
- Food!
- Closer to home (10 hr drive LOL)

Cons

-Cold Af in the winter.
- MISSOURI
- Don't really like STL

-Not much diversity
- They just started being need blind so A LOT of rich kids...


Pros for Harvey Mudd
- Goated CS program
- SoCal!!
- Nice weather
- Nice suburb
- The Claremont Colleges
- Focused on STEM
-Good Internship Opportunities

Cons
- Dorms aren't as nice as WashU .. as far as I've seen
- Far from home (24 hour drive)
- Full of Nerds And Virgins (from what I've heard)



Feel free to add more pros or cons for each college. I really need help picking one lol. As of right now I'm leaning more towards WashU...."
zs3g4r,3,2022-12-21,What should I do?,the0fun,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/zs3g4r/what_should_i_do/,"Dear Freinds, I seek advice very urgently. \~ GPA 3.7 .I have problems in choosing my university and staying alive. To fully understand the situation you have to read the ""background"" story.

&amp;#x200B;

Background: I'm Pole living in my country. At the beggining of my high school I've decided to switch my school to home schooling. I had very good grades which would allow me to study at the best highschools in my country, but instead I went home schooling. WHY? because high school wasted so much time that it was unimaginable for me to stay in this shit. That's at least what I thought at this time. 3 years passed very fast and I have learned many things (not strongly connected to school though). At the end of high school my GPA was around 3.7 - that was May 2022 when I graduated. But my matura exam which is considered during applying to university didn't go very well. So I couldn't study at the best unis in Poland. I allways wanted to emigrate from this country that's why in the second year of my high school I researched for possible schoolarships outside my country. I also wanted to find kind of financing (my family is very poor) so I took my chance and applied for schoolarship in China - which I was awarded this year. But I forgot that my major will be thaught in chinese and I'm very bad in learning new languages so I had resign If I didn't want to spent my next 5 years learning chinese. - I have HSK2 though. To study there in english I need IELTS 6.5 which is a bit above my current level and the deadline for the schoolarship is at the end of January 2023. I'm aslo not sure whether it's a good idea to deal 4  years of my life to study there. - I want to study finance.

The perspectives in my country are very low. We have many ecconomical and corruption problems and most public unis sucks. I have few paths I can take this year.

1. Re-apply for CSC schoolarship praying they will not care about my english (I want to educate myself well though, and make as many internships as possible - which can be difficult in china). My uni would be most likely Shangai university.
2. Go to a bad polish uni which suck dick
3. Try to apply to Reading uni in the UK. I have a family there so they would probably help me, but my english and matura exam are too low to apply there. I also would have to take a student loan ( 9k punds per year)
4. Study hard this whole year, re-take matura exam in 2024 praying it will go well and get accepted to a relatively good uni - I'm also re-taking matura exam this year (studing around 7 hours per day, but it's fun)
5. Pay for a tuition to ESCP Business School campus in PL which is around 17k PLN (3648,34 EUR) per year. I don't have this amount of money and my parents also don't. In theory it might be possible to do but I would have o live in a car for 3 years and pray that some company will take me for internship (it's really hard to get one and it's common to pay the emplyer to take you). Also my dad would have to start working 8 hours per day (he is already retired high specialised worker but his life was tough, really tough so we are still poor)

&amp;#x200B;

The point I want to get in my life is to just live in a good western country working in the field I like.

For the last 2 months (after giving up on china) I'm heavily depressed. I take medicines from psychiatrist. I was seriously considering ending my life in a nice clinic in Netherland. I feel that I wasted my whole 3 years of high school - I'm INTJ. I had little contact with other people and lost my point to which I should aim during studing in high school. I aslo figured out that learning without teachers guidence is much more hard and sometimes impossible. I could use my time better and this is driving me crazy. I left public school to once again find time for my hobbies and I wanted to self improve - to feel responsible for my own life. And now it looks like I will end up here for ever. My friends make great things and what do I do? nothing. I feel childish and dump. I have a surface knowledge in many fields but not any specialised one.

&amp;#x200B;

I seek opinions and guidence. If you have questions ask them. Thank you."
zs3gja,42,2022-12-21,List of Interview Tips.,Juicyjackson,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/zs3gja/list_of_interview_tips/,"I have done plenty of interviews, and I see a lot of people struggling in them. There are multiple things that the interviewer is looking for during an interview, not just if you can solve the problem, or answer the questions, they are looking at your behavior, whether can you speak and explain yourself properly, are you crazy(literally), can you work well with others, tons of things.

&amp;#x200B;

So here are a good amount of tips I can give you.

* Show emotion, and don't just answer questions like a robot, nobody wants to work with a robot that all they can do is solve problems. Smile, laugh, chuckle if appropriate, etc.
* Explain yourself clearly and explain your thought process, and try your best to not use filler words ""like"", ""umm"", etc.
* Use the STAR method for behavioral questions, lay out the Situation, Explain the Task, Describe how you acted, and explain the result of that action.
* If you don't know something, just be honest, but put a spin on it ""I honestly haven't had much experience with that, but I am willing and eager to learn more about it at this internship""
* Come up with lots of questions to ask at the end when they ask, this will show that you really want the interview, and did research about the position.
* Seem like you are excited about the interview, participate as much as you can.
* Be Polite, ask the interviewer how their day is going, introduce yourself, and say thank you at the end.
* Ask them to restate the question if you dont understand the question, always understand the question 100% before answering.
* Dress professionally if it's a video or in-person interview, I know, it's tech, people go to the office in Sweat pants, and a beat-up T-Shirt, but you can give yourself a leg up by dressing nice, taking a shower, doing your hair nice, etc, this also may make you feel more confident.
* Be confident in yourself, I know it can be hard to be confident when you are new to the field and are being interviewed by someone with 20+ years in the field. You will do better if you are confident.
* Speak up, dont just mumble your way through an interview, this may come off as you not knowing something, not being confident, not wanting the position, etc."

zs4ztk,2,2022-12-21,Whats the best place to find internships for rising grad students?,Unusual-Outcome7366,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/zs4ztk/whats_the_best_place_to_find_internships_for/,"I'll be graduating with a cs degree and a math degree in May 2023, I've applied to PhD programs in math and based off professors I've talked to, I'll probably get in somewhere (might not be the best grad program).  I'm looking for a good way to make money during the summer; during my summers as an undergrad I would either intern or do an REU.  I would assume there are less internship opportunities for grad students, but I believe there should still be some.  My main 2 questions are:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Would companies still be willing to hire me if I want to do math during grad school instead of cs?
2. How do I find internships geared towards grad students?

zs5wyx,0,2022-12-21,Delay the Starting Date of My Internship,ooooois,DevelEire,https://www.reddit.com/r/DevelEire/comments/zs5wyx/delay_the_starting_date_of_my_internship/,"Hi all, I recently got an internship offer from an America company. Signed the contract two weeks ago and the starting date is march 1. I’m not an EU citizen so I’ll need a visa. I recently graduated and will be granted a 1G, my current visa expired on the 30 of Dec 2022. I knew I’ll need my 1G before this internship start, I immediately submitted my renewal few days after I received my offer letter. 

As the renewal process take weeks usually and the current estimated timeframe for renewal is 8 to 9 weeks. Look like I’ll get it before my internship begin. 

So worst case scenario, if I didn’t receive my renewal before mid February, I would need to contact them and let them know my situation by asking delay my internship starting date. (They only hired 1 internship position)

I guess my question is are they going to allow the date of my internship push back 2-3 weeks? I never negotiate the starting date, they inform me if 1 of march is good for me and I agreed upon. If I ever need to make the contact, should I contact my recruiter from the company or the on boarding team or my future manager (I have received an on-boarding request from the company, submitting bank info, legal name, passport verification, etc)

I see that similar posts have been done in the past but there are some updates to the Microsoft relocation/housing policies. They are now doing $10,000 lump sum housing and they are not providing corporate car rentals anymore. Although they aren’t providing corporate car rentals anymore, they said that you can still get a discounted rental with their contract with Avis. I’m not sure if that discounted rate is similar to the cost of a corporate rental or much higher but here were my options I was thinking for housing:

1. Take corporate housing (It says you’re not guaranteed to have a kitchen but that’s something I’m pretty set on having). From what I’ve read it seems everyone gets put in a hotel for the first couple weeks and then some people get to stay and others get moved to UW dorms. Past interns, do these dorms have kitchens?

2. Take lump sum and try to find a UW student apt to sublet from. I’ve read that Microsoft has a shuttle from UW so this would allow me to just hop on the shuttle and possibly also pocket some of the housing money and save money on things like laundry. 

3. Take lump sum and find housing closer to Redmond. I’ve looked into this on Airbnb and this seems hard to come by and quite expensive. 

Past and current interns what would you recommend / plan on doing? Does public transport in Seattle run out to Redmond? I’m trying to figure out if a car is a should get or not necessary. TYIA !"

zs7wfs,1,2022-12-21,Internship now? Or later?,boolinschool,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/zs7wfs/internship_now_or_later/,"
Hey all..

I’m currently in an associate degree program for computer science and am going to finish at the end of 2023. I understand an associate degree isn’t great compared to a bachelors, and I know ideally you get an internship the summer before graduating with a bachelors, however I do work full time and my degree is actually being paid for through my employer which puts me in kind of a bind in terms of trying to find an internship in the middle of taking classes like people traditionally do. I do have a previous bachelors degree in biology, which likely does not hold any weight. 

My options are basically to finish this associates and try to get an internship to get my foot in the door in this field, which would basically remove myself from being able to earn my bachelors degree using funding from my employer. So I would be stuck with just having the associates degree if I went that route. Or alternatively, should I just put my head down and finish the bachelors and ignore any internships or opportunities until that is finished? Struggling to decide which I should aim for. 

To me, I feel I would benefit more from actual experience (i.e internship) rather than classes although I know both are beneficial. I also am aware of the current job market and the struggles people are having finding internships even with a bachelors degree, so finding an internship may be near impossible with just the associates anyway…

Any thoughts/advice would be greatly appreciated!"

As a school I love UChicago; I toured the campus and talked to a lot of students and the school seems like a near perfect fit for me. The problem is that MIT has been my #1 dream school from day one, for many reasons (irrelevant here). As a result, although it's improbable, I really, really want to avoid a scenario where I'm accepted ED to UChicago but also to MIT and am forced to turn down an MIT offer for UChicago, in which case I'd spend the next four years at UChicago completely miserable. I wanted to ask this sub for advice on what to do, based on the strength of my application. Should I switch to ED2 UChicago and take the risk, or should I remain in the RD pool and take my chances? My stats are listed below:

**Intended major:** Chemistry/biochemistry

**GPA:** 4.0 UW (probably 3.95 after this year), school doesn't do weighted

**SAT:** 1570 (790 M, 780 EBRW)

**PSAT:** 1490 (740 M, 750 EBRW), qualified for nat merit

**AP tests taken:** 12 after this year

**Volunteering:** Gold pres award, participation in and founding of benefit concerts, volunteer orgs, etc

**Awards:** Top 47 in the national chem olympiad (high honors), \~16000 participate per year;

AIME qual 4 years in a row starting freshman year, 1000 out of \~150000 taking prelim round get in each year;

AMC 12 Distinction senior year with a score of 108 (distinction was like 103.5 this year or something idr)

Lots of solo piano awards, some at nat level, + some awards won by my piano trio;

Finalist at GMTK game jam;

Mathworks math competition first round finalist;

A bunch of random school awards lmao

**Activities:** Internships at two startups, one full time and paid, another part time and paid, both related to biotech;

Internship at stanford on biochem but that went kinda badly;

Minor research paper on bioinformatics, results weren’t very good but were backed by a prof reference letter and 6 months of work to get to that point. For contributions to the project my name will be included on the company product's patent;

Piano and chamber obviously.

**Camps:** UCSC COSMOS sophomore year and AwesomeMath freshman year

Everything in my life has gone upside down because I focused too much on my college grades and internship. It really took everything away from me, you can consider this as a severe burnout after over working myself.

My girlfriend, the love of my life broke up with me a while back because I wasn’t able to give her much attention and didn’t get time for us to work on the problems we faced. I genuinely loved her with all my heart but she’s gone because of me. My friends who were my roomates, all of them just kicked me out of my apartment. I mean I still have a 1 month notice but they kind of teamed up against me due to some other reasons. I have no friends at all, nobody to talk to. I did get my internship in the end and passed in all of my courses while my friends have failed in a few but it all feels meaningless. It’s worthless for me now.

I just want my life back. If there is any god, I ask for forgiveness. I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m not suicidal at all because I love my family and they mean a lot to me. I’m just incredibly alone as an immigrant in a new country where all my social life was my roomates and college friends. My girlfriend of 3 years gave up on me, I feel like giving up on myself too. Whenever I wake up, I just break down emotionally by the weight of everything that’s going on. I overthink a lot and I quit my part time job due to depression. I don’t have enough money to see a therapist. This could just be a self note to me years down the line and I hope I’m in a better position because living like this really sucks. I used to love eating food and am losing weight now because I just don’t like eating anymore. I used to love watching movies but I can’t focus on them anymore because the weight of reality keeps settling in.

I’m grateful for everything I have but I don’t know why I’m suffering so much, and that also so alone."
zscdda,2,2022-12-21,Currently have a some recruiters reaching out to me for Senior SDE positions. Is it okay to ask recruiters for a downlevel?,poomaker,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/zscdda/currently_have_a_some_recruiters_reaching_out_to/,"I’ve currently had some recruiters reach out to me, asking me to interview for some Senior SDE positions. I have about 6.5 YOE (two 3 month internships, 5 years at a big tech company, and 1 year at a startup where I’m working currently).

The reason I would want to ask for a downlevel from Senior SDE to SDE 2/3 would be that I don’t really have any leadership experience. I kinda coasted along at my 5 yr big tech stint ,and was happy to be an IC and finish whatever sprint tasks were assigned to me. I didn’t take any initiative there to go above and beyond that. However, I decided to get serious about my career about a year ago when I joined my current start up. Unfortunately, the place is quite chaotic and management is poorly organised, and I haven’t really got any opportunities for any sort of leadership/mentorship opportunities here despite me explicitly requesting them. I’ve been completely siloed and had to work as an IC throughout my stint here. Consequently quickly gaining any sort of leadership experience here is not an option, as I’d leave to leave this place ASAP.

My worry is that if I interview for a Senior SDE position, at some point I’ll be asked about a time when I lead/architected a large project, and I don’t really have an answer for that. I get that some people stretch the truth a little in these behavioural interviews, but I feel like any answer in the affirmative would be almost a complete fabrication, and I want to avoid that route as much as possible.

What would you recommend that someone like me does in this position? Can I just flat out ask a recruiter who reaches out that I would like to interview as an SDE 2 or 3 instead of a senior positon? How would I even phrase such a request? And would that count against me down the line during offer negotiations?

That's not very difficult to wrote code for and the following code works, but it takes *way* too long to finish, probably because I wrote it very C-style.  

When it comes to implementing simple algorithms like this I sort of default to doing it that way, and I'm not really sure how to change my mindset to make my code more ""Pythonic"".  I learned Python mainly from several data science courses where we learned statistical coding, after I'd already spent months learning low-level C programming in depth as part of firmware engineering internship.  I've been trying to increase my skills in statistical coding by doing different DS coding projects in Python and R, using online tutorials as starting points, but that hasn't really seemed to help me much with actually writing mote idiomatic code, since DS projects rely very heavily on calls to 3rd party library functions and those libraries usually have their own conventions and syntax.

Any advice, either for how to improve my code below so it runs faster (as I'm sure more idiomatic code would run faster) and/or for how to write more ""pythonic"" code in general?

The role description is pretty open-ended, in that it just requires a general Master's level understanding of Machine Learning/Math Optimization/Signal Processing, depending on the track.
Since I have around 6-7 days before the interview, I want to be well prepared for it. I searched online for interview experiences of former candidates, to get knowledge on the specifics, but didn't have much luck.
So, I would love to hear your experience with the internship process at Bell Labs, specifically, the domains covered in the interview, the type of questions (whether asked about your own research work/projects or had on-screen coding), the number of interview rounds, how you prepared for it (if you did), along with any other information you might find worth mentioning, or any advice you might have to give, anecdotal or otherwise.
I'll be sure to add more details in my post if required. 
Also, to give more context, I'm a Computer Engineering Master's student, with coursework centered around Machine Learning, and prior research experience (≈1 year) in Deep Learning."

zsin62,4,2022-12-22,After college (engineering majors),Gebynum,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/zsin62/after_college_engineering_majors/,I know I’m a thinking little far ahead but I’m a electrical engineering freshman. I’m curious on how is life straight after graduating with your engineering degree from graduates. How long did it take to land your first job? Did you get the job while in the middle of senior year so when you graduate instantly have somewhere to go? I’m definitely curious for those he didn’t land any internships and how was job searching? And if you did land a internship how that help? Did a employer point out oh you worked this internship so and so. Did you get your first job from the same company of the internship? Job searching after college is I guess a little fear and excitement.
zsjh88,9,2022-12-22,Is there any hope for someone like me? I'm stuck in a rut and see no way of getting out of it.,every_tatti,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/zsjh88/is_there_any_hope_for_someone_like_me_im_stuck_in/,"23M, graduated in 2021. This has easily been the shittiest year of my life,and I find myself more lost thah ever now. 

I was always a very good student and worked really hard during my college,got good grades etc etc. Was never really into engineering but rather more into fields like marketing. Got an internship with a marketing firm right after college, with a promise of it being converted into full time. The experience was ok, but the company never fulfilled their promise as I later got to know they just needed interns for a particular project to be completed.

Then a slew of family issues and personal problems ensued, from me having to undergo a surgery to many other things.

Now here I find myself with 2022 coming to an end. Im tired of applying to jobs. Hardly anyone is even reverting back now because of my gap. I really want to pursue marketing and learn and grow in the field and I know i can work hard and am capable for it, but I just can't find any opportunities anymore. Moreover obviously others keep pestering me regarding what I'm doing,why I am such a loser etc etc. Most of my friends who were average in studies got into random jobs nd have atleast some experience now. Im an only child too, so there's even more expectations from me. 


I have lost energy now. Im stuck in groundhog day. Everyday all I do is wake up,lay in bed and scroll my mobile or stare at the ceiling. I can feel my brain rotting. I literally haven't gotten out of my room since a week now, and it's become common for me. I'm getting all sorts of bad thoughts too. Losing all interest in my hobbies too because of my current state. I just don't see a point anymore. I don't even have any friends where I live,i desperately want to shift to Bangalore. I just never envisaged that I would become such a huge pile of shit and my life would become like this. Im just stuck in a rut and dunno how or if i can get out of it. Im just so desperate now. I don't see any light at the end of the tunnel, feel like this is it. Such a friggin loser. Don't even have anyone to vent to, so thought about venting here. Sorry for bothering."

Can I talk with someone experienced over what is the best choice?,Cultural_Evidence128,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/zska4p/i_have_a_choice_between_two_internships_can_i/,"Basically the title, I am finishing my studies and I found two companies that would hire me for an 6-month internship, which are trial periods because they hire you at the end if all goes well.

It's not completely career-defining, but still pretty important so I'd like some insights from someone who knows what I should look for.

Both are the same type of data service companies, they put you on a project for a few months and you solve it and go to the next client and repeat. 

Firm A is twice as big (2k5 vs 1k2 people) and is related to a big tech company where I live.

I had a better contact with firm B during interviews and they seem to pay a little better during career.

On firm A, I'd go directly on a client project and on firm B I'd do a research project and then a client project.

The salary is the same for both internship but firm A has a little bit more advantages.

So if anybody has an advice, i'm listening."

So I'm 21 and in my last year of my CS degree . I've done 2 software internships and some IT jobs (part-time helpdesk to part-time Asset Management Analyst) and I ended up getting promoted to our operations team full-time as a IT operations analyst (65k base + 10% bonus, Atlanta). The company currently I'm working for is a pretty large fintech company.

My current responsibilities are Monitoring/incident reporting, some linux based stuff and level 2 tech support

The role I'm in now is nice, pays the bills, has a lot of internal growth but doesn't seem to further my career tooo much. In all honesty I didn't expect to get a role that's full-time in IT so most of my career research has been in software development. As a result, I just don't really know what's out there too much.

From my initial googling the best bet is to go for some certs, then leverage the experience + certs for a higher paying role/raise, but I'm not sure what roles or certs to even really aim for money/careerwise. The other options that interest me is sales or devops but when looking into them I've heard those roles are really difficult to get into.

Edit: Was at a helpdesk for about a year, then It asset management for about 6 months."

I want to go to a big school that’s in the city, with lots of internships and connections. I’m also planning on going to grad school abroad so maybe a school that’s a little more known so I can get in?

I want to study abroad (maybe even work abroad) and do co-ops/internships.

zsmhwn,4,2022-12-22,"Should I apply for INTERNSHIPS or do SELF STUDY(learning, leetcode, development, projects, open source)?",Neopacificus,developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/zsmhwn/should_i_apply_for_internships_or_do_self/,"I am currently in 7th semester ending of B.E in ECE and have landed on two ON-Campus offers. 

One is a package of 4.5 lpa in WITCH like company and have no idea into what role I will be getting. 

Another is 7 lpa package in IT and Consultancy company where they use tools of another big company to provide solutions. The role here is Associate Consultant(which I don't like based on what they explained).

According to our college policy we can only take two offers in hand and then we cannot participate in placement process. So therefore I want to apply for off campus placements.

The thing is I would be competing not only against a lot more ppl from all over India but also against the experienced ppl which I cannot beat. So therefore I thought that a GOOD internship would be great for my Resume and would get me a long way which I think everybody here would agree with me.

But I am not skilled enough to be at a level where I can get GOOD internships. I have already done a hardware level internship based on embedded systems and IOT but it is not SDE internship (which I want to pursue going further). Basically I have recently started leetcode(stopped currently due to lot of college work near the end of semester)and therefore I don't know most data structures and Algos. I also don't have any development related projects as I don't know how and where to start development. I want to pursue JAVA development as I know very basics of JAVA and it is my primary language. I will expand upon learning other languages later.

In 8th semester we have to attend college only two days a week. So my plan was to try and get an internship to do in that period and struggle (as I don't know enough concepts) but now I got to know that we don't have much time as we need to publish report for major project and there is activity points which we need to get. I know that its possible to do the internship while doing all those things but I would be sacrificing self learning of the concepts from scratch.

Basically now I thought that if I can sacrifice internship for self learning by doing leetcode, development, good projects and open source wouldn't that be great for applying off campus placements. 

So therefore here I am and please give me your opinion as an experienced senior as to what I can do from here onwards to crack off campus placements. Also suggest me any resources that can help to learn Development in java.

Time is of essence for me now as I can go for off campus placements near the end of 8th sem when I would be much knowledgeable due to self learning. So I need to crack within that time.

zspcg5,1,2022-12-22,"I need advice on if I should become a social worker with first/current offer, or wait for potential offer from current employer?",Dynasty__93,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/zspcg5/i_need_advice_on_if_i_should_become_a_social/,"I graduated college in 2016 with a BA in criminal justice. I have been a correctional officer now for over 6 years with the state. I somewhat like my job, but things are going south (they are beginning to force us to go to other institutions hundreds of miles away because of critical staff shortages across the state). Overall I do like my job, you get to basically write your own check \[lots of overtime, both when you want it and when you don't want it\]. I will be making between $90k - $100k this year alone. Then again I also spent countless days this year working double shifts at the institution.

More recently the state I live/work in has opened up the option for people who have a bachelor's in fields like criminal justice to become social workers rather quickly. You apply for a certificate \[which I did\], once you are proven to have received a bachelor's you get your 2 year training certificate \[which I recently did\]. During the 2 year window you need to complete a handful of courses through an online university and also in the 2 year window you need to complete either (a) 1 year of social work employment that includes 400 hours of face-to-face client contact OR (b) an internship of 400 hours. Both options (a) and (b) require your supervisor to have a bachelor's or master's in social work.

Very recently I applied, interviewed and just yesterday got a job offer for a child protective services social work position. If I was to take this job I would be completing one of the two requirements easily within the 2 year timeframe (1 year of social work employment).

My ORIGINAL intent was to become a social worker because I think more like a social worker than a correctional officer and also because there are tons of social work openings where a guy that I have been seeing lives... About 3 hours away. The intent was to start this program and move south and get a place not necessarily with but closer to my man and see where things go in the relationship. I had assumed because I would be going from one employer to another that uses the same state retirement system that all of my sick leave I have earned over 6.5 years would come with me ... Wrong. If I left my job (with the state) then my sick leave (which is hundreds of hours) would be gone. Tbh I do not want that. I think it would be wise to turn this job offer down, and try to get a social work job that is closer to my man and also is with the state, not a county level job, and possibly even working with inmates in a prison since I am used to that.

For the past 6.5 years I have lived with a relative, literally in their basement. If I continued working where I do now as a correctional officer I could make another $75k between now and next November (next November would be the last month for me to start my 1 year of employment). For those that do not know social workers do not make much, it would be a pay decrease and tbh I think it would only make sense to make the move if (a) I stayed with the state to not loose my sick leave and (b) moved in with my man to split the cost of living that would greatly soften the blow of the pay decrease/lack of overtime.

I just feel stuck right now. The last thing I want to do is just say yes to the job offer to only rescind the job offer days later. I am 29 years old, should I just take the dive and become a CPS social worker? Or should I not jump into anything right now and focus on building my relationship with my man and also focus more on staying with my current employer (the state) and become a social worker with the state prison system (which like most places is hiring like mad right now). The one nice thing about if I was to get offered a job as a social worker with the state is that if it did not pan out I could easily just reinstate as a correctional officer and with no sick leave or any seniority lost. If I accept this current county offer I loose all of my sick leave and also loose 1 day of seniority for every 1 day out of state service. The elephant in the room is that I currently have a job offer from the county. I can always hope I get a job offer from the state."

If I were to finish my B.S. in something wildly different and change careers, now's the time. Is it reasonable to think that there will be a role of ""Software Engineer"" 3 years from now that someone like myself could get into with just a B.S in Computer Science and maybe an internship? Or will the market be so specialized and no-code will take over the grunt-work that typical devs do currently? I am just worried its a bit too late to go into this degree program when technically I could be self-taught, but self-taught engineers are so over saturated currently I really want to stand out from the crowd. Just wanna make sure I'm not entering this market too late as a student, I could certainly be self taught but the likelihood of me landing anything within 3 years is slim, so it makes more sense (to me) to have a degree to show for that time at least."

I've researched the topic and have come up with this list of potential reasons and why I don't think they're applicable in my situation.


Reason | Counter
---|---
You're fresh out of college, it should take 3-6 months to feel acquainted with the system you're working on. | 6 months have passed. I've been on numerous on-call assignments to learn to system at breadth, and have developed features across the stack (FE and BE).
You lack fundamental CS knowledge and are just now grasping the fundamentals | I did well in my CS degree program, I've had several internships, and a few personal projects. I should have at least as much experience and fundamental knowledge as my peers.
It's just imposter syndrome. You're doing better than you think. | Despite how I feel, I am also objectively less performant than my peers. My code contribution stats are lower, I launch features less often, I take longer to triage on-call issues, and even design documents take me longer to send for review.
You're too focused on perfection instead of delivering value. | Maybe... but you would think this strive for perfection leads to higher quality products than my peers. I don't think this is the case.
You're burnt out. | I doubt it. I take my work-life balance very seriously and never over-commit to my job. I also follow productivity practices like taking small breaks here and there.
You lack meaningful work. | Again, I doubt it. While the work is slightly open-ended, the end-result (impact) is always clear and there's never a lack of things to do.

I guess I'm just wondering if I'm still in the realm of ""this is normal, just keep going"" or if I'm starting to venture into ""that's odd, get help"" and in that case, what might be missing."

So I just finished an internship recently and through it, I was able to get a referral for a position at another company that works with the one which retained me as an intern. 

I am still finishing up my degree and I have only one mandatory course left next semester, which is also when my new job starts. I really also wanted to take an elective course which does require a fair bit of reading each week (both courses are masters level courses). 

What I am worried about is that these courses will impact my performance at my new job. The company that hired me treated me very well during the recruitment process and they made me a very generous offer that went above what I was asking for in terms of salary. So in return, I want to give them my absolute best in terms of performance. 

The question then is, has anyone been in this situation ? Is it possible to pull off two courses while having a full time job and not having any impact on said full time job ?"

Overall the tech side of interview went ok, however i didn't code anything (is it strange?) they asked me about some projects, and since i don't have any written in Java (just some front-end systems written written with my friends), i told them unfortunately i don't have any to show. I was almost sure i did not get the position, however after about 2 weeks they called me back that they are happy to offer me a internship position and asked me whether im still open for this job and if so they will send me some papers and then i would receive invitation for an official signing.  
At first i was so happy i got it but then i thought about it again and got scared i will embarrass myself since there are noticeable gaps in my java-knowledge and they will fire me after first month or smth. It's a pretty good company and i was thinking about working for them after i finish university - if i do bad now, do you think they will remember it and it's gonna be over for me?

I have many credits from university. My grades were very good. Zero internships and zero work experience.

I am considering either finishing my degree or going the self-taught route. Based on my research, a degree helps immensely with getting, not necessarily passing, interviews. I want to keep my options open, i.e. getting past HR/resume-filters and possibly going to grad school. It seems the entry level market is brutal and a degree helps a lot.

I will likely graduate when I am 26, almost 27. Is this a problem?

There are a few options:

* City College of New York 
* University at Buffalo (tens of thousands of dollars of debt)
* A few private universities (if I get accepted....)
* Western Governor's University (faster - I'll probably finish at 24 or 25, might be able to work at the same time) 

I'm curious about the quality of the programs, reputation, networking opportunities, and internship/job placement.

Also wondering if a degree will affect my prospects in certain subfields more than others (data engineering, embedded, ML, applications dev).

I did [AI Planet's (formerly DPhi) Data Engineering bootcamp](https://aiplanet.com/bootcamps/data-engineering), so I'm pretty familiar with the DE stack. I'm not sure I'll get interviews with only this and projects, and I don't want to run out of companies to apply to.

At this point I want a degree, but I must consider time and money."

Hey guys, please please please can somebody help me?
My last graduation years were terrible because COVID happened and besides that still had to deal with distance learning, having to educate a small children at home while trying do get the chance of doing a internship, so in last August I got my bachelor's degree in Graphic Design feeling like a failure. 
My internship were terrible did a lot of really bad work, in a really bad office without any graphic designer to guide me and feeling like I was going anywhere.
After receiving my bachelor's degree started aplicating to every single job applications that show up in my work field and got lots of rejected applications and then I thought about trying something as a  'trainee' (think in English it's called internship as well). End up finding EY's consulting opportunities and applied, (saw on their website that they get graphic designers for that field as well) and got a rejection on that too but they send me an email asking if I would like to try something in the tech area. So by that moment i was feeling really desesperate and said ""Yes please!"" (Had bills to pay,, children to take care, so please hire me!).
Last week got a offer to work on tech delivery - GRC without even knowing what it is or what I'll have to do. Please someone who works with it or had a little bit of knowledge about it could please share a little bit with me? That's any chance that a could change from tech delivery to consulting in any moment? And my stupidest question of all is my day one is on 09/01 never worked on a office before and didn't even know that EY was one of the Big4 (neither what that means) so please again what I'm supposed to wear?"

I transferred schools, moved out on my own with a roommate, started cooking on my own, started going to the gym 3+ times a week, and found new hobbies like rock climbing and dancing. I've done a lot for myself this past year but there are things I still want to fix within myself.

Before this self-improvement phase, all I pretty much did was study and play video games. I probably have like 15k+ hours on all of my video games combined. I really enjoy the hobby at times but I really don't want to continue with it because I feel like it doesn't do anything productive for my daily life. Most of the new hobbies and interests I have developed have characteristics that allow them to be very beneficial for my life, such as improving my physical health, getting to meet new people, and increasing my knowledge of the world. However, I feel like video games have virtually no benefit to my life other than wasting my time in the present to create some dopamine boost.

My winter break started recently and I have some urges to play some games but I also realize I have a lot to do. I wanna do productive things keep hitting the gym, working at my software dev internship, studying programming, reading books, etc. However, I'm just not always in the mood for these productive activities.

I am curious to hear anyone else's thoughts on this perspective. I realize it might not be a very healthy attitude but it is currently the way I see my situation and I'm quite unhappy about it."

* Drawing Teacher (Optional): 8/10 - She's known me for four years, and even though I'm definitely not excellent at art, she told me that she talks in the letter about how I don't compromise on my interests for taking another AP class and how I tackle challenges head-on.

**Interviews:**

* Yale: 7.5/10 - Lasted 80 minutes, but I felt like it was the interviewer talking most of the time because he wouldn't really let me speak. Felt super informational, but interviewer did mention that I seemed ""intelligent, methodical, and someone who would mesh well with Yale's campus"".

- promotion from ng program is 18 months vs 2 yrs in jpmc
- will probably save more in lower CoL

Cons:
- already signed offer with JPMC so will probably burn that bridge
- no friend group in st. louis
- state tax (4.5%)

I’m interested in moving to the bay area for a tech company in 1-2 yrs and feel like either offer can get me there. Which offer would you take?

Would appreciate your insight on this. Currently, I am in my first semester of Masters in a Software Development degree in a public applied sciences university (Hochschule) in Germany.

I have to get a paying internship or job to support my stay here while I study in 6 months (by the end of the next semester). Ideally, I'd like it to be related to computer science of course.

I was able to figure out what platforms I can look for jobs/internships on (XING, my university career support etc). Thank you so much for the amazing FAQ wiki here!

However, I am not sure how I can utilize the time I have right now so that I have better chances. Here are the steps I am currently taking:

* I am currently A1 to A2 in German. So I am focusing on learning it to a B1 level. But this is proving to be difficult for me and requires a lot of time. I asssume this would help me, but correct me if I'm wrong.
* Not doing any leetcode or interview focused practice. No real reason other than I feel it doesn't make sense right now.
* I am taking on more courses now, to free up room later on in the next semester to look for jobs.

Any suggestions on what I could focus on would be GREATLY appreciated. It sucks not knowing if the direction you're moving in is right."

Not allowed to do any chores (all done for me) until late high school. Clothes all prepared for me and ironed for me until late high school. I was constantly told to study or be busy all the time since I was a kid, even during vacations or breaks. Often this entailed not only schoolwork but extra homework, cram school stuff, extra summer ""studying"", and practicing three instruments every single day. Constantly screamed at and physically and verbally abused while doing all of those things and called ""stupid"" and ""not good enough"". Given a laundry list of tasks to complete while mom went off to work every day during summer vacation, and yelled at/abused if I didn't finish them or if I made mistakes. No play dates of spending time with friends outside of school other than my mom's acquaintances' children (which didn't last and we didn't even became friends because it was just us doing activities forced onto us by our parents like extracurricular classes and practices, which mom spent staying along the sidelines yelling and screaming the entire time). In middle school, mom would keep tabs on every person I interacted with and wanted to know every single detail about them. In high school, mom would try to pick me up after every single extracurricular activity exactly once it ended because she wanted to ""save time"" to ""take me home"" so that I could ""do homework"". She screamed or flipped out if I did anything else (screamed at me once for being a ""bastard"" the entire car ride home, not even because I went somewhere else but because the approved extracurricular activity I did ended 20 minutes late). Thus, she completely eliminated any opportunities for me to commute home on my own with friends or time where I could talk to peers. She would sabotage, scream, be dismissive, or just not allow any plans that involved me having a life and doing anything other than going to school, going to the approved extracurricular activities she made sure to pick me up from, and going home to do homework. Often excluded and not allowed to do any get-togethers with any people my age outside of home. Not allowed to do any internships or extracurriculars outside of school because it involved ""commuting"" and was a ""waste of time"". When I had an interest or started an activity I enjoyed, mom would quickly turn it into a task by setting constant deadlines and goals I needed to meet, otherwise I got yelled and screamed at. I only did activities she approved of, and when I picked ones she didn't like at school she yelled and screamed until she got me to not do them. Was extremely deprived of any extracurricular experiences and things most of my peers already experienced by that time. Now same family blame me for being ""sheltered"" and ""having no life skills"", and want me to be an ""adult"" and figure out how to socialize on my own, even suggesting that I should start dating. On the other hand, they still treat me like a kid in a lot of other ways and try to make career, class, and school/extracurricular decisions for me. Going to a commuter school where I live at home has made it worse.

But this time, I'm setting up boundaries, not letting abusive family and relatives into my life, maintaining limited relations with mom (who I still have to live with). Tell mom white lies/half truths about by day-to-day to give myself the flexibility to manage my schedule how I want it. This winter break, instead of feeling guilty about not being productive every single minute, I am going to use for what it's there for: to take a break. I deserve it, and I know doing so is setting my own self up for success. I'm learning to not feel guilty about living for myself, enjoying the moment for myself, just bumming out and doing things I like for myself during a BREAK. I'm learning to comfortable in myself, do things I like, and figure out what I'm passionate about. AM can go suck it. 19 years taken away, and it's almost like I just started learning how to be a kid and enjoy life now..."

I’m in my last year of my masters program for clinical MH counseling. I was planning to start practicum in summer 2023. I currently work in child welfare at a contract agency that also has a therapy program. I was in contact with the therapist supervisor late this spring/early summer as I wanted to do my P/I there since I was already working there. We communicated a lot and they seemed very receptive and excited for me to have this opportunity as a solid employee in their CW program. 

In October, my school changed up programming and decided to only offer certain classes in certain semesters. It’s an online program. This would have put my grad date out farther, and I wasn’t about that, so my advisor agreed to let me do practicum in the spring. As soon as this was agreed to, I let my agency’s therapy supervisor know. I was also given an extension to turn in paperwork until Dec 15. 

There was one therapist that was going to do it for me in the agency but found she hadn’t had enough years of licensure. This was closer to the Nov 30 original application date, and at this time, I told my agency I had an extension for the paperwork. 

One week before the extension date, I got a call from the therapy supervisor telling me another therapist was willing to do it, but they’d have to compensate her for overseeing me, and therefore, they wanted me to sign a contract stating I would stay on for two years as a counselor after licensure. The supervisor made it all about money and how they “wanted to invest in me.” The contracts weren’t even drawn up yet, and the therapist who would oversee me hadn’t totally committed. The whole thing seemed like a red flag. They still haven’t sent out any contract to me. Fortunately, my school was understanding of the situation and gave me another deadline extension for Jan 5. 

I am now scrambling to find another opportunity. I’m really insulted by the fact that they didn’t decide this until last minute when I gave them more than timely notice I think. I have worked at the agency for almost 3 years now, and I get told over and over again what a good employee I am. They wouldn’t be paying me for my time doing the internship, and I think I got screwed over, which is hurtful considering what time I have put into my work. 

Is asking for a contract normal? Another agency asked that I at least consider working for them because of the large commitment it is to have an intern. To me, I think it’s bad enough you are not paid. But is this the norm now in this field? How am I supposed to commit to something if I don’t even know if I’ll align with their agency? I was also told no guarantees that I’d be hired. 

I am considering looking for different employment because it’s hard to fathom working at a place that has treated the situation so poorly, but there’s that doubt in my mind that I am overreacting. Feedback would be welcomed."

This vicious cycle continues until I get tired and hate everything.

After graduation I started to work in my friend's personal company over prototyping some stuff and there I did some Arduino projects, but he wasn't serious as much as he said and it turned out to be a waste of time. The next two years I was doing mostly office works &gt;!(as for conscription)!&lt;.

Now that I'm looking for a job I don't know what field I should pursue. My thesis involved some machine learning tasks which I liked it cause I felt I'm doing some scientific inference and I really like science. I thought data science might be a suitable field for me but after I read some posts in r/datascience I got a little disappointed. They were mostly saying it requires domain knowledge, business thinking, etc. which made me think I won't be able to succeed in this field.

Sorry if this post is getting too long, but I wanted to mention every related thing. So what do you think I should do? Should I look for unpaid internships to make up for my lack of experience?

This config file contains username and passwords of databases. For now, we are storing these files on our server and move them to tomcat at the time of deploying via jenkins, which is not a secure way.

I was thinking of introducing hashicorp vault and integrate it with Jenkins. So the flow would be:

&amp;#x200B;

get secret from vault at the time of build &gt; parse config file using python (to update credentials) &gt; deploy it to tomcat 

&amp;#x200B;

Please tell me if this is the right way of doing it or if there are other better ways?"

ztuj4a,2,2022-12-23,Recommend some target/reach schools for a prospective Political Science + Middle Eastern Studies double major!!,needyblanket,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/ztuj4a/recommend_some_targetreach_schools_for_a/,"I'm a junior, but my college counselor gave a list of 50+ schools that aren't necessarily polisci/MES focused, and I'm supposed to be whittling it down to 10-15, and then also finding some colleges outside her list that I like, but I'm terrible at it. I keep finding something to like about every school and don't want to cut the list down, so I'd appreciate any suggestions of schools where I would be a competitive applicant, and that would be good for my major so I can focus on them.

**Demographics:** Mixed-race (Indian/Jewish) / Female / Upper-middle class / Semi-competitive (1-2 kids to OOS T20s each year, 10 to UCLA and UC Berkeley) public school in the East Bay of CA / Significantly above average in graduating class of about 250

**Hooks:** Princeton legacy (dad) donates consistently but not enough to be significant, LGBTQ+, also legacy at Yale Law and born at Yale if those are hooks?

**Intended Major(s):** Double Major in Middle Eastern Studies + Political Science, with the career goal of doing diplomatic or humanitarian work (focusing on literacy and women's rights) in the Middle East

**ACT/SAT/SAT II:** Taking it in March, consistently scoring 1550+ on practice tests for the last 2 months so barring a freak head injury I should be good, using the Black Book, College Panda, and Erica Meltzer

**UW/W GPA and Rank:** 3.96 UW (one B+ in accelerated math), School doesn't rank, only allowed to take APs starting junior year so no official W GPA yet

**Coursework:** Taking AP Spanish (skipped a level), AP ES, AP Comp Gov, English Honors (highest level), US History (no AP offered sadly), Journalism, and DE Calculus (the accelerated math program at my HS got too toxic). Next year – AP Art History, AP Physics, AP Lit, Advanced Journalism, Gov/Econ (1 class, mandatory), and then DE Calc and a cool class called ""Middle Eastern Political Interference from the Renaissance to the Present""

**Awards:** My weakest area imo...

1. Girls State delegate (1st ever from my school, alr confirmed by district lead)
2. Fellowship with nationwide teen social justice org
3. 3rd place JV at a small online national invitational for debate
4. Honorable Delegate at a statewide MUN conference
5. Merit Scholarship Awardee + Global Ambassador + National Conference Panelist for this study abroad program (it was pay-to-play so not that selective lol)
6. submitting poetry and short stories to a few teen lit mags, that's up in the air though

**Extracurriculars (note: \[will be\] is because I'm the only junior in leadership or one of two juniors in a co-led club):**

Leadership member for 3 years in an anti-racism student group working on education. Co-wrote a presentation shown to 7th grade health classes annually, reaching 600 students in the next two years, planned weekly meetings on social issues, organized student forums, coordinated with teachers and organized students to continue annual anti-racism presentations in 5th grade classrooms, reaching over 1800 students (9th-12th) 

Organized a city-wide walkathon raising over $3200 to help fund a NGO's app that protected Iranian women from government phone hacking, still working with the same Amnesty Intl-affiliated nonprofit to create a mini-documentary interviewing students about why they are in solidarity with Iran, will be distributed to some small international Iranian and Middle Eastern progressive news programs (11th, 12th)

\[will be\] Co-president of Speech and Debate club, first elected as debate captain as a freshman. School could not afford a debate class/coach, so the leadership team balances both jobs. Usually debated novice to work with freshmen who didn't have partners. (9th-12th)

Co-president/founding member of school chapter for nonprofit feeding unhoused people, lead monthly bake-a-thons of 150 cookies (1350 total made/year) to go in food packages, organized student volunteers + clothing drives and fundraisers. Organizing a charity concert with local bands to raise money as well. (10th-12th)

Made a poetry curriculum focusing on diverse poets, will be implemented in all fourth and fifth-grade classrooms in the district reaching 600 students/year (11th)

Working with middle-school students and the local middle school librarian to create lists of book recommendations with mini-reviews for elementary students struggling with reading, will be an official District Literacy Project reaching 2200+ middle and elementary schoolers (10th-12th)

Interviewed and worked with first-gen students + counseling department, and wrote an ""ultimate guide"" to course selection, tests, available activities and other resources at my school for first-gen families. Earned a PTSA grant for it, soon to be permanently available in high school and middle school counseling dept. (10th-12th)

\[will be\] Co-president of Model United Nations, once again the club had no coach but an advisor and not-great funding, organized meetings, applied for PTA grants, organized fundraisers/club fairs (will have done 10-12th)

Managing Editor on the school newspaper, Editor in Chief next year, oversee a staff of 50+ students (11th-12th)

Worked with students at a T40 school on the East Coast to create an online tool for marginalized women to access reproductive care, used by a national women’s health campaign and another national reproductive justice nonprofit (10th-12th)

Research with a T20 professor on depictions of women Iranian literature over the 20th century and how their depictions changed alongside the political regime’s policing of women, may write a paper but probably won’t be published before admissions. (11th Summer, 12th Fall)

Ran a letter-writing campaign to my congresswoman at my school that collected 500+ letters raising awareness about imprisoned Iranian journalists and got to meet with her office (11th)

Will be doing an internship with Natl Uyghur Org working to help write requests for advocacy in the Middle East (11th Spring + Summer, 12th fall)

Research next summer w/same professor on how China's Silk Road policy conflicts the solidarity policies that many Middle Eastern countries have with Islamic diaspora groups, and how it's harmed the Uyghur people (11th Summer)

**Essays/LORs/Other:** n/a currently

**Schools:** Pretty sure I'll do Princeton REA because of legacy advantage, and I love the campus, plus I'm friends with some students there and it seems like a great fit from what they've said. I also like Williams and Brown but doubt I'll even get on the waitlist lol."

So I just started my internship and I realised how having good excel VBA skills can really make our lives easier, automating all the boring everyday routined excel stuff. 

Does anyone know of any good excel VBA courses; I don’t mind paying a small amount for something so lasting and useful.

Those courses in youtube seems to go super slowly, yet after watching hours of them, I tend to be unable to apply any of it.

Also, any advice on how you guys self-learn excel VBA is also really appreciated.

Thank you !!"
ztvt9g,6,2022-12-23,Questions about interning / working as a Master’s Student in Computer Science,Competitive-Space651,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/ztvt9g/questions_about_interning_working_as_a_masters/,"Hello everyone, I’m new to Reddit so let me know if I need to edit anything to make it better. 

I graduated with a degree in CS from a very low rated school in May, because of this I was only able to get internships at small companies that no one has heard of (I had one my junior to senior summer and one the summer after I graduated). Because of that I wanted to get a master’s to give myself a better chance to work at a good company. I am now attending A&amp;M in their Master’s of Computer Science program and I am not sure what to do in terms on internships.

To better explain that, majority of applications I send into internships I feel are filled out incorrectly because there’s usually only one spot to put education or there won’t be a place for me to make it clear that I am still in my Master’s program. And typically companies list that they are looking for undergraduate students when they post their job listing. 

I was trying to consider other options, possibly such as applying for part time positions or contract work if that could have a higher possibility of me getting a job at a well known company. What is y’all’s thoughts on this?

My main reason for choosing masters school was to get a job at a higher more well known company."
ztx259,10,2022-12-23,Advice for Entry level SOC Analyst,Divy_l,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/ztx259/advice_for_entry_level_soc_analyst/,"Little Background about me: I am  Junior at George Mason University getting a Degree in Information Technology with a concentration  in Cybersecurity. I will be graduating in May of 2024. I also took a Cybersecurity Class while I was in High School for 1 year, where they taught us the Fundamentals of the Cybersecurity and also prepared us for CompTIA A+, CompTIA ITF and CompTIA Server+. I missed passing my A+ by 20 points, but I did pass the Server+ and ITF.  I am also currently doing an internship (Support role) for the Voice Engineering Department (Solving basic IT tickets).

I have applied to almost 170+ cybersecurity internship(still applying) for next year but half of them never respond and the other half either I get rejected or will do 1 interview or ask to answer bunch of question in a word doc and then ignore and never respond back (I am assuming that's because I don't have enough skills or they are finding way better candidates than me).

**My Goal is to get a Full time Entry Level SOC analyst position once I graduate in May of 2024.**

**What I am doing to prepare for the SOC Analyst role?**

1. Currently studying for the Security + Certification
2. Currently doing TryHackMe and HackTheBox Academy modules to get the Fundamentals and the Cyber Advent event on TryHackMe (teaches you about different part of cybersecurity with hands on stuff)
3. Once I get the Security +, I planning to learn the Fundamentals of the Splunk, learn Bash Scripting, Python and Wireshark and maybe learn the PCI Framework Threat Analysis model or Cyber Kill Chain frameworks. I know basics of Python, Wireshark, and linux but I believe that won't be enough knowledge for this role.
4. I also watch time-to-time ethical hacking courses on YouTube by ""CyberMentor"", just to understand the basics of tools like burp suite, metasploit, neusses, and namp. Which also helps me understand about linux as well.

**The most common skills I found based of all the jobs positing form Google and Linkedln:**

* SIEM(SPLUNK) Experience and analyze log data
* Incident Response experience
* Scripting (Python, Bash, or Power shell)
* Responsible for security vulnerability management, incident response
* Applied experience of threat analysis model/frameworks such Cyber Kill Chain, MITRE ATT&amp;CK, Diamond Model, Pyramid of Pain etc
* Investigate intrusion attempts and perform in-depth analysis of exploits.
* Experience with Wireshark
* Security +, CISSP

# I was wondering if you guys can provide more details on what else I should do/improve my chances of getting an Entry Level SOC Analyst role?"

ztxmkz,5,2022-12-23,rant: how to help my parents feel better about me living with my foreign bf away from my home city?,Serious_foodie_8505,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/ztxmkz/rant_how_to_help_my_parents_feel_better_about_me/,"So I'm (F27) going to stay with my long-distance white bf (M28) for a few months in a different country. Due to his job, it's not realistic to expect him to find a job in my hometown. I kept this from my parents for as long as possible due to anxiety. I will leave in 2 weeks with my bf. My bf was nice enough to agree to come to my hometown to spend time with my family and help me with flying to his country. We met and dated in person for 1 year when he did an internship in my hometown and 4 years+ long-distance. My bf and parents met in person for the first time 4 months ago. My parents told me they are 200% against us being together. And if I was to move away from my hometown, they (mostly my mom saying this) would take it as not having a daughter anymore if we ever get married and moved away. My mom said she would have my brother translate her concerns into English for my bf. Should I even bring my bf to my home before I leave? I feel like this is a very uncomfortable conversation, but maybe my bf can handle it...

From my parents' perspective, I understand that there are issues with a language barrier, not knowing my bf's family, different cultures, and me not being around to take care of them. My younger brother has a well-paid job, and in my opinion, is very capable of taking care of our parents, and of course, I will do my best to contribute too. But my mom tells me that my brother's body and mind are ""weak"" and that he can't even take care of himself - so he won't be able to take care of them. And says he will take care of his gf's parents when they get older. She thinks my brother will fail to take care of 4 seniors in the future.

My mom blames me for not telling her about my relationship with my bf since the beginning. I didn't tell them because they would disapprove and force me to break up with him 100%. So why would I tell my parents about my relationship if I know they will force me to break up? Aren't they a bit too naive to expect me to do this?

I personally feel bad for not being able to take care of my parents personally as they get older. But my affection for them diminishes as my mom cries and yells at me about how naive and ungrateful I am because they dedicated their lives to raising me.

TLDR: I'm leaving to live with my LDR white bf for a few months to get to know each other before moving in long term in the future. And my parents (mostly mom) are freaking out because there's a potential I will not live in my hometown. Says she will consider not having a daughter anymore if I get married and move away. What can I do to help them feel better? I'm not considering ending my relationship."

4. *Assorted robotics awards, most significant is 1st in state+worlds top 10 seeding*
5. *National Merit Semifinalist*

**Letters of Recommendation**

I find rating LOR's a bit weird (since I haven't seen them), but I'll do my best! Take this w/ a massive chunk of salt.

Teacher 1, APUSH: I really feel that this was a strong letter, as this teacher and I had extensive conversations about modern US politics, and she recommended me as a reference for other students to come to for help with coursework/other political questions. 8/10 at worst if I had to guess, but probably closer to a 9 or 10.

Teacher 2, Calc BC: I asked him for a rec mostly due to my low grade in the class, as I hoped that a letter from the teacher could help outweigh the cons of applying to CS with a B in a fundamental math course. The letter itself was probably mediocre (as we didn't really have a noteworthy relationship beyond required content), but I think he could definitely speak to my hardwork/dedication to doing well in the class, and how my grade was not a reflection of my understanding of the material. 5 or 6/10 if I had to guess.

Boy Scout Scoutmaster: Very strong relationship with him, as he has seen my grow as a person since 4th grade. He said he would touch on my many diverse academic interests (politics/cs engineering), but also discuss in depth my emotions/interests that weren't conveyed in other parts of my application (like my love of nature for example). Probably a solid 7-9/10.

**Interviews**

Interview for ED school: honestly, it was wasn't great lol. We just didn't seem to connect very well; our interests were completely different, and I struggled to understand some of the references she was making to her said interests (and vice versa). She seemed like an amazing person that I could be great friends with, but in a limited time interview setting, we just didn't get too far.

**Essays**

Personal Statement: I spent a lot of time on this... I started writing in like May, and kept refining drafts. At one point (between early August to mid September), I switched topics, but decided to go back to my original idea, but with a fresh lens. I don't feel comfortable sharing my topic publically (as it's a bit personal), but feel free to dm if you are interested!

Why School Supplement: This one also took many edits and draft revisions, but I was very proud of it at the end. I really think I showed both why the school was great for me, as well as why I would be a great addition to the school's community.

Other supplements (for other schools): I didn't spend much time on these, as I was trying to create a really good supplement for my ED school (it only has 1). This was likely a mistake in hindsight, as if I had been rejected ED, then I would kinda be screwed lol. Don't do this, and make sure all your supplements are fire.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

&gt;!Northwestern University: !&lt;*Accepted for Engineering/CS (will also try adding a poli sci major/minor)*

Withdrew apps from other schools.

**Additional Information:**

Ok here are my tips. ***READ THIS SECTION (or at least the bolded stuff)!!!!***

*Grades*: **They matter, but 1 or 2 Bs (even in your subject area) may not be the end of the world**. Everyone said I had no shot at a t10 school because of my B in BC calc, but it worked out! The rest of your app just had to be stronger if you don't have straight As.

*Test Scores*: **Study your butt off for the SAT/ACT**, because I really think a high score (1530+, 35+) will set you apart, especially with test-optional and all that. Worst case scenario, you don't do great, but you might as well shoot high. Look at the pinned post on my profile from a year ago about how I went from a 1120 to my 1550 (made a typo in the post title lol).

*ECs/Awards*: I think this is by far the **most important part of your application**. Everyone says to ""do stuff that you enjoy,"" and that's true, but also do stuff that is unique from other stuff you do... basically, **use your ecs to tell a story about who you are**. Also, mid-ecs with *amazing* activity descriptions will be likely better than stellar ecs with terrible activity descriptions. I personally spent a lot of time making my activities list pristine, and I think it definitely helped tell a story about me. **Make sure to think about each activity in relation to your whole application when writing descriptions, not just the activity itself.**

*Essays:* Similar to the activities list, **this is your chance to be unique**. Write about whatever you want, but make sure it says something about you! Lmk if you want more detail about how I wrote/brainstormed my essays.

*LORs:* Don't begin junior year having 2 teachers in mind for letters... instead, try building strong relationships with all of your teachers, and then naturally determine the best picks to cover your personality later.

\--

***CLOSING THOUGHTS***:

Obviously, nobody knows *exactly* what got them accepted, however for me, I really do think that my **activities list and essays are what set me apart**.

Though my stats/grades were ok for the most part, I knew (prior to applying to NU) that the lower grades in technical courses would hurt me. Due to this, I focused a lot on showing why I was a unique person via the creative parts of my application, basically trying to make myself irresistible to AOs.

Additionally, **I talked a lot about my dual interest in politics and technology, and how I want to combine them in the future**, which I think is reflected by my activities list quite well and made me unique from other people. **Overall, I'm very happy with the way things turned out; let me know in the comments/dms if you have any questions!**

zu3owv,0,2022-12-24,Which Business School Is Better For Tech Entrepreneurship? HBS (Harvard Business School) Or MIT Sloan?,MussleGeeYem,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/zu3owv/which_business_school_is_better_for_tech/,"I just recently finished my Bachelor's of Science degree in Computer Science with a stellar GPA, and I would like to inquire more information about business school because I have had entrepreneurial ambitions ever since I was a young child. Also, I have done three CS and IT internships so far. Since I have lived in Boston for 10 years and would want to stay in Boston, I have narrowed down to several universities: Harvard Business School, MIT Sloan (two target/reach choices), BU Questrom, Northeastern, Tufts, Babson, UMass Boston, Hult International Business School (backup schools).

With me being an aspiring tech entrepreneur wanting to someday start a tech startup, what business schools would be the best between Harvard Business School and MIT Sloan? Also, what are your opinions on the other universities whether or not it'd be good or should I skip some, knowing that one of the main reasons why I am planning to attend business school is due to the connection opportunities at many MBA programs?

For example, many tech companies were founded by a group of people, including Apple, Google, Microsoft, FaceBook, Tesla, Uber, Airbnb, Doordash, Instacart, Zipcar, Twitter, Whatsapp, Snapchat, Robinhood, DocuSign, Adobe, Salesforce, Cisco, and countless others, and for some of these companies, the founders gained connection either through university, internship, or even a job."

Freshman at College Beginning Transfer Application (Need advice!),sihyunl2,TransferToTop25,https://www.reddit.com/r/TransferToTop25/comments/zu3sg2/hardworking_freshman_at_college_beginning/,"So yea, as stated in the title, I'm a first year in college and I would like some advice with the transfer process. I'm open to DMs too.  I'll be applying as bio major (or something close to that) and I'm an Asian male if that matters. I have some questions listed at the bottom (yeap I know.. pretty long post)

In terms of academics, I think I worked pretty hard in high school and in college. I've attended a very competitive public high school in the bay area (LOTS of smart people, no grade inflation) and I'm fairly confident that my stats alone are on target even for T10 schools.

To give a brief perspective about my academic stats: 35 ACT, 3.98/4.33 GPA in high school (one B+ in freshman yr), 10 APs and a score of 5 on 8 exams (including bio, chem, calc bc, compSci A, etc..).  
Stats in College (just got grades back lol): 4.0/4.0 GPA and I took 18 credit hours this semester.   
(Total of \~60 credit hours if you count AP credits)

So yea I'm pretty confident with my stats but then it's the ECs that sort of makes me worry. I think that this was a weaker part of my application that ultimately resulted in many rejections during HS. I have SOME ECs that are ""above average"" from HS (eg: attended a very selective STEM summer program, not one of those pay to attend lol) but most others are just pretty ""average"" Asian ECs (volunteering, club positions, etc).

I think that I've focused heavily on my academics during HS so I've really tried to get more engaged in ECs in college. Unfortunately, and I know this sounds like an excuse, but as a freshman, it was really hard to get engaged in those high tier ECs that people here talk about (eg: publishing research, establishing a club, selective internships, etc). I've asked about 20 professors for research positions next semester but they all said no (mainly since the profs don't take freshmen/no room) and I've also failed to get into any club positions (I've realized that connections w/ current club leaders are pretty important to get any positions lol). With that being said, I still tried to get involved as much as possible as a freshman. I'm pretty active in 2 clubs and I was able to get an on-campus job too. I've also got a bio professor who I am pretty close with (I go to office hours a lot and she knows me well) so I'm hoping that the LOR will be decent.

Anyway, thanks everyone for reading this super long post. As you can all see, I'm pretty paranoid about this whole process... I've picked out some colleges listed below.

**College list**: GaTech, UMich, USC, Vanderbilt, Northwestern, Cornell, NYU, CMU

Basically, I have two questions:  
1. Are there any impactful/recommended ECs that I can do in the spring semester? If not, am I good enough with these current ECs considering that I am a freshman still adjusting?  
2. How does my college list look? Pls give any college recommendations if any

I'm open to any other suggestions too."

* Do the two mobile app projects share too much overlap where it would be better to just outright replace it with one of my other circuit projects that has more substance?

I am currently a junior standing as a computer science major, with roughly 3 semesters (including summer) before I graduate, which is around Spring 2024. My current GPA is around 3.353 as a major GPA with 3.9 as my cumulative GPA.  

However, I don't have any experience other than a help desk position I picked up during freshman year, and I've been working a part time job as a security officer ever since. 

I have applied to roughly 310 applications, all of whom I wasn't able to get a response back, got expired, or I wasn't able to find anything worthwhile. I am planning on applying like crazy and tailor my resume this coming January, so hopefully that can change.

However, I've also been thinking of a new opportunity that I have heard that sound like an REU/research opportunity for a professor with around two-three other students. I do know that if I choose to take this option, I will be delaying my graduation to Fall 2024 instead, which may or may not be a good time depending on the market. So I'm wondering if I should take this option, as it sound good to me, and sort of an internship.

On the other side, I have an opportunity to graduate earlier at Spring 2024, which I will have no internships nor experience other than the help desk and security role that I have. I know that this option will help me save a lot of $$$, but at the expense of opportunities. So I'm wondering which option should I do - delay my graduation in chance that I can find an internship, or graduate early and search for new graduate positions as soon as possible?"
zu6hkv,1,2022-12-24,I feel like I never really got to grieve,GuessIWillDrown,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/zu6hkv/i_feel_like_i_never_really_got_to_grieve/,"My cat passed away five months ago, and mostly I’m fine, but now and then, I find myself bursting into tears and unable to stop crying about it at random moments. Guess what I’m doing right now in my room at 4 am. I have her ashes in a wooden box. I hold the box with me while I go to sleep sometimes. It’s not the same, but I guess I still feel like she’s there and wants love. I’m not sure if it’s grief or my usual thing of assigning human emotions to/empathizing with inanimate objects.

I go to college and am currently in my second year. Last year, because I couldn’t bring my cat with me to college, my mother mostly took care of her. I only live an hour away from my parents’ house, luckily, so I still got to see my cat every other weekend or so. And honestly, it was one of the main reasons I went back most of the time. I love my parents, but I find that I can’t live with my mother for more than a few days before I want to leave. I love my mother and my father. But there’s a lot that they did while growing up that hurt me. They’ve gotten a lot better now that I mostly live outside of their house.

Another reason I felt that I was mainly coming home to see my cat was because, for a couple of years before college, my mother would very often tell me how she couldn’t wait for me to go to college so that I wouldn’t live at her house anymore. So that she didn’t have to take care of me anymore. By the last few months of high school, this was something that was said very frequently. It made me feel like a burden. An unwanted nuisance.

Anyway, I feel a bit strange for saying this, but sometimes I felt like my cat was my best friend. I was 12 when I got her. I was the weird kid growing up (ADHD, and I’ve suspected autism for several years now, which might explain my parents’ behaviors towards me over the years), so I didn’t have many friends. I also grew up extremely sheltered, with my mother being a helicopter parent, and the rural neighborhood I lived in was mostly filled with retired folk. So, I didn’t have much of a social life outside of school. My father was emotionally unavailable. When he got his dogs, he ended up spending far more time with them than he did with me. Though, that wasn’t much of a difference since he didn’t interact with me much prior to getting his dogs. We live in the same house.

But my cat was a reliable friend. She liked me. She liked sitting with me while I drew or played games. I talked to her at night sometimes. I knew she didn’t understand me, of course, but I would practice conversations with her or just vent to her, and she’d sit there and purr. She didn’t mind me holding her or hugging her. She didn’t mind that I was the weird kid, and it made little me happy. I liked to brush her and play with her. She liked it too. There was still the occasional bath struggle, but I took all the scratches and rewarded her bravery with treats.

I was doing an internship at my college when I got the call that my cat needed to be euthanized. Lymphoma. She’d gotten sick a few days before, and I knew about it because my mother had told me she was going to the vet. I don’t know why, but even though it seemed like a minor illness at first, I think I knew she would die from the moment I was told she was a little sick.

At that point, my mother had been around my cat far more often than I had because I was busy with schoolwork and my internship. That, and something awful that had happened a few months prior, did a number on my mother’s mental health. My mother was a wreck when my cat passed. I mostly tried to stay strong because I wanted to let my mother grieve. And I guess part of me didn’t think grieving to others would do anything for me except make them uncomfortable. And I wanted to let my mother grieve as well.

I have a history of sh and thoughts about ending my life, and there were a lot of times last year in college when I came close. I never followed through in part because of my cat. Which sounds silly, I guess. But yeah.

The day after my cat’s passing, my father called me while I was driving. The conversation isn’t really important. Most of it could be summed up to my father telling me he was considering getting another cat for my mother because she was such a mess about my cat. I don’t remember much of the conversation, but one thing did stick with me.

“Your mother is obviously grieving a lot more than you since she’s been around your cat more than you, and you’ve been at college.”

I didn’t get any support. Apparently, I didn’t need it— at least not as much as my mother, who, before I was a college student, would snap at me in annoyance to stop talking about my cat when I gushed about her doing something cute. It’s not like I really expected a lot of support from my dad, regardless, but I didn’t expect him to say something that would hurt me so much.

With my cat gone, I feel almost unsafe at home. I still get nervous when I hear my mother’s annoyed tone of voice. Just as soon as I feel comfortable being in the living area of the house where my mother and father tend to be, I want to go hide in my room again to avoid potentially annoying her with my presence. My cat helped me feel welcome. In a way, it felt like she sort of shielded me from my parents’ emotions by being near me.

I feel resentful of my mother’s grief. I don’t at all think she shouldn’t be able to grieve, and I understand it. But I still resent it. She got to grieve. And just because I had to go away to study, my grief became unimportant.

It bothers me so much because before I went to college, she hardly cared about my cat. There were countless times when I asked her to please close the door to the garage when the garage was open so that my cat wouldn’t run out. It became an argument every single time that ended with “well, you should just watch the door” or “don’t let her out if you can’t watch her” when I can’t look at the door every second. It was only during college that they installed something that automatically closed the door because my mother **finally** understood my worry and panic when my cat was nowhere to be found in the house.

I hate it because I resent her for how she acted/acts, and I no longer have comfort in my parents’ house. I grew up constantly hearing how difficult it was to raise me because I was an “ADHD child,” because I sometimes got a low B among my straight A’s, and because I couldn’t sit still for eight hours straight as an elementary schooler. Constantly hearing how lazy I am. Being told I was dramatic. Never allowed to display my anger or annoyance but always displayed anger and annoyance to. Being trapped in the car for a 30-minute drive while my mother screamed at me for forgetting to unload the dishwasher or staying up late. Being ignored for days for everything except necessities if I upset my mother. Me tiptoeing around corners of the house to go unnoticed if I thought my mother’s footsteps were too fast and hard or my dad was stomping a little too much. Seeing my dad yell at or hit his dogs if they got on his nerves too much. Knowing that if I left a plate in the sink or a wrapper out of the bin that it would invite attention to me. The name-calling.

But back then, even if the atmosphere of the house felt hostile and unwelcoming to me, my cat felt like a comforting presence. I could hide with her in my room, and everything would be okay. I would be okay.

It’s December now. Christmas Eve. We don’t celebrate Christmas, really, but we participate in gift-giving as its tradition.

I came back from college for the holidays. My relationship with my mother is better. She’s mentioned a couple of times that if I feel that she’s ever done anything wrong in raising me, I can tell her and that she’s really sorry. Obviously, I don’t tell her, but I let her know it’s okay. Sometimes I feel like it’s not okay, but there isn’t really anything that can be done about it now.

Our relationship is better, but if I live in the same house as her for more than a few days, I feel the tension return. I stay in my room to avoid it, mostly.

I came back from college for the holidays. My cat isn’t here. I didn’t get to grieve her out loud much. And I wish I had come back to my parents’ house more often just to see her. I miss her little greeting chirps. I miss her silly tail flicks. I miss watching the dogs get excited to see her. I miss rubbing her head and belly. I miss cuddling with her. I miss having her fur on my shirts and blankets. I miss having that comforting presence in this house. Sweet little fuzzball.

She isn’t here. I feel worse than alone in this house.

I’m not entirely sure why I’m posting this. I guess part of it is so I can grieve outside of myself. But if anyone wants to talk to me, I’d like it very much. Thank you, I appreciate it if you’ve made it this far."
zu6td1,4,2022-12-24,Returning to IT/Cyber after giving up due to toxicity,clicklangecho,cybersecurity,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/zu6td1/returning_to_itcyber_after_giving_up_due_to/,"TLDR at bottom, sorry for length and venting 

I went to a community college after wasting my early/mid 20s and I finally got tired of working in the food service industry. It was blood, sweat, and tears doing night classes while working full time but I managed to graduate at the exact beginning of quarantine in May 2020. It is just an associate degree, but very specifically a Cybersecurity degree from a recognized/respected program. A decent chunk of my classmates went the defense contractor route but I had doubts about passing a polygraph so I never went for it. Had a 3.4 gpa and graduated with a Security+ and ISACA’s Cybersecurity Fundamentals certificate, as well as two additional certificates issued by the school itself. I completed the coursework for A+ and Network+ but couldn’t afford to take the tests at the time.
I also had a paid summer internship at the school doing small time cloud development projects, worked their help desk for a semester, and I was also as active as possible in related extracurriculars like university-level CTF competitions and getting elected into an officer position in the IT club. I genuinely loved the work and couldn’t wait for the future even though my non-existent free time prevented me from networking outside the school with most of my classmates. System hardening was my favorite and I dreamed of a Blue Team career.

I got hired two months before my graduation date by a cloud startup MSP. I was so desperate for a foothold in the industry I ignored all the red flags. The following six months were so bad I sincerely wanted to jump into oncoming traffic. 60 hour weeks every two weeks, 13 hour shifts with no overtime as a minimum wage hourly employee. literally ZERO training was provided, and there was only ever one person per shift in a 24/7 support environment. This was also not a tier 1 role as I was expected to do everything from AD account provisioning, all aspects of desktop support, things like data restoration, virtual domain management, even feeble attempts at incident response when a client got hit with ransomware. I was responsible for supporting and maintaining infrastructure for close to 10 different businesses. Every second of every day was miserable but I thought I was “paying my dues”. I managed to absorb all the information I could and learned from every failed project, every unsolved support request, and every new technology I came across until I finally snapped and quit after having my first honest to god panic attack. 

Fortunately I quickly got offered another Tier 1 role contracted out to a less-popular Federal agency. Still horrible pay but it was no longer minimum wage and had a small amount of prestige cuz government. This role was not really a tier 1 either and a lot of the work would now be considered Tier 2/access control. Primarily dealt with PKI/certificates, file permissions, AD accounts, VPN and MDM stuff while fielding the phone for desktop support issues. I had an okay amount of mentoring this time and I enjoyed working with my fellow contractors. While I had issues with the unrealistic workload expectations like doing a remote session over the phone while doing a different remote session with someone else via chat. This was a daily occurrence. the dealbreaker was incredibly hostile and borderline abusive treatment from the actual Federal employees. It is not an exaggeration to say they hated us contractors. I didn’t even think workplaces that toxic actually existed. We were routinely insulted, the women on the team were sexually harassed and had their personal cell numbers leaked, and we were regularly used as the scapegoat for the failings of the Federal IT teams after being set up for failure. The agency who contracted us out refused to make any waves since the contract was up for renewal so once again I quit after 6 months.

This time I fell into a deep depression since I had worked so, so hard to get into this industry only to have it leave me an empty shell of a person.  I moved back in with my folks and took a full year off to deal with my destroyed mental health. Swore I would never even think about IT again.

Decided to try a new career out and got hired at a very large finance company. I studied hard and earned a bunch of new certifications/licenses related to investing and insurance. The reason I only lasted 6 months at this job is pretty simple. I was misled about the nature of the work and it turned out to be mostly selling snake oil. Anybody here tasked with selling annuities knows what I’m talking about.

It has now been a few months since then, and I feel incredibly lost, aimless, and hopeless. I genuinely miss the actual work part of IT/Cyber but its been long enough that I’ve forgotten a lot of the specific technical information like power shell syntax, what port number has which function, how to quickly navigate AD, just things of that nature.

I took a look on LinkedIn and could not believe the sheer number of job postings for cyber that have popped up in the last two years. I live near a HCOL city so that definitely is a part of it but there has to be at least 15 jobs per fresh graduate. Two common positions I think I may be qualified for are IAM or Cybersecurity Analyst. The requirements and salaries are all over the place and most likely made up by uninformed HR managers so it’s hard for me to tell what’s realistic and what is not. For instance i came across  a security analyst position at a bank offering 100k base with the only listed qualifications as “0-2 years experience, CISSP preferred ”

I desperately want to get back into the industry but I am really worried about having to explain the job hopping, resume gaps, and my brief trip into the world of finance. Not to mention how rusty my skill set has become convincing I’ll bomb any technical interview. At best they will think I’m lazy and couldn’t handle the job, at worst they will think I’m lying about how horrible my previous jobs were. Does the fact that I’ve never been fired from a job help my case at all? I also worked for the same restaurant for close to 5 years before graduating, and I have passed almost every non-polygraph background check at both the fed and individual state level including Public Trust.

TLDR;

I want to get back into cybersecurity after my first two jobs completely broke me to the point I took a year off and then switched to finance for 7 months. Is it possible for me to get a position that isn't a high-volume call center even though my resume is spotty and makes me  look like a job hopper? It is my DREAM to work a job for more than 6 months. I have an extremely diverse IT skillset with over two years paid experience and closer to 5 including all the unpaid hands-on training in school. I also have  multiple credentials in cybersecurity, finance, and insurance. 
 
I just really need some guidance on how to find a decent position with the experience I do have like IAM or Cybersecurity Analyst. I will do anything for a cyber position that does not include the phrase “First point of contact”. Also maybe some words of encouragement to stop this impostor syndrome and shut up the voice in my head telling me I’m the dumbest person who ever lived and I’m doomed to go back to waiting tables for the rest of my life.

I sincerely appreciate any guidance the seasoned professionals may be able to provide.

Edit: 
Here is the rundown of my resume. Furthermore, regarding the contractor position, I was told I was Tier 1, I was paid as Tier 1, the offer letter I signed states the position as Tier 2, and the position is currently listed on indeed as Tier 2 when it was Tier 1 when I applied. I don't know if that means I can honestly say I have Tier 2 experience on my resume but I'm really starting to think they scammed me.

I am also doing a payed internship using UiPath and quite a bit of Oracle Database. I work 20-25 hours per week. I am planning to go to Uni in some capacity, probably part-time. My internship lasts until my winter semester ends although my boss does wants to keep me around as he believes in RPA a lot and I am the only one able to do more than just simple CRUD queries on SQL.


For those who know about RPA and have studied CS, it can be seen as “meme programming”. It could also reflect badly on a CV since so few concepts overlap with any other field of software development. 

If I can’t find a better internship over the summer due to factors such the recession or my lack of experience, how bad is it for my career trajectory to stay in RPA for longer than a year?

How can I spin RPA in the best possible way to possible future employers? I am already planning on lying about using C# instead of VB.

Do I highlight my experience in Oracle, Jira and GitHub more than the RPA experience?"

My dilemma is if I make the move my parents would basically be un-involved and I will be on my own ( no support of any kind ). I am a bit afraid but at the same time now that I have a stable job and some references from past internships and I should be okay job-wise.

Please give me some advice on how I should budget, what to look for when renting? how do I rent? and if I wanted to move from Ontario to Calgary how best can I do it. 

Please anyone with experience or any kernel of advice I just need help w/ this phase of my life. 

Thank you for reading."

I have some bioinformatics research under my belt already and will probably concentrate in bioinformatics in my CS degree as well.
I’ve been applying to internships this semester and I’ve had trouble finding bioinformatics intern opportunities because they’re just not online. Whenever I do find them, they’re usually for postgrad students. As a result I’ve only been able to apply to around 5 or 6 bioinformatics internships and I’ve already been rejected all of them. At this stage I’m mostly applying to anything CS related but a bioinformatics internship would be nice. How should I be looking for these internships when it doesn’t seem like there’s a lot of postings online, and what do I need to have a chance of being accepted?"
zuenbu,3,2022-12-24,SOP in OMSCS Application?,EmberFires,OMSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/zuenbu/sop_in_omscs_application/,"I recently applied to the OMSA program, and I'm also applying to the OMSCS program now.

There was a section in the OMSA Application for the SOP under the 'Documents and Materials' section.

But there isn't one in OMSCS.

For OMSCS however, there are question fields under the 'Computer Science - MS - Online (OMSCS)' section. The questions are like 'Describe your CS-related academic experience' and 'Describe your CS-related internships, if any.'. There are a few more like this.

Is this the SOP? Or am i missing the SOP section in the application?

Thanks"

zufy9k,1,2022-12-24,Negotiating intern offer,risingscorpio123,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/zufy9k/negotiating_intern_offer/,"I’ve accepted an offer last month for a design intern role in SF.

This week I interviewed with another design agency NYC, and I like them more.

Since employment is at will, my plan is to renege SF offer and accept NYC.

Now, SF pays $35/hr, but NYC pays $28/hr. NYC offers more benefits as well and will pay for Visa to relocate.

Do you think I should use SF’s offer that I’ve accepted as leverage to try to increase my wage from $28 to ~$35?

Living in NYC is expensive, and the HR and I had a really great rapport and signalled pay is not final - so I feel upside to asking. But i dont want to disclose I’ve already accepted an offer, but rather frame it as an offer I’ve received.

My question: 

1. Do you think this a good idea/worth doing
2. Worried they’ll find out I’ve already accepted an offer - is there a way they’ll know unless i tell them?

Open to any advice on how to approach!"

I finished applying to grad schools, so If I get in, I’ll be going for an internship. But if I don’t get into a grad program (since nothing is guaranteed in grad school admissions), I’ll most likely be forced to take a full-time job. 

So would it be in my best interest to apply to both roles within the same company?

Normally, I would reach out to the recruiter, but many times they don’t respond or just hard to find (as we all know).

So what y’all thoughts?"

Are there any clubs that I can join to gain more experience? I would like to join one in this upcoming semester, but I can wait if they only recruit in the Fall. I’ve taken ONE technical course for my major (ME 302) and although I enjoyed what I learned, I want more practice incorporating it into some projects. 

for my background, I’m a freshman in MechE looking to go down the Mechatronics track. I am also doing the Elements of Computing Certificate! I would like to join a club that has a combination of all of these areas, but I’m okay if I can just gain some MechE experience. 

I am mostly interested in gaining hands-on and technical experience because a lot of the internships that I plan on applying to in the Fall all require a heavy CAD emphasis along with brushing on principles such as FEA and GD&amp;T. And while I learned some of these principles in ME 302, I still need practice with them."

**Standardized Testing**

* **ACT - 35 Super Score (35M, 35E, 34S, 36R)** 

**Extracurriculars/Activities**

1. **Reef keeping - Since 2016, I have been keeping ornamental marine fish, as well as propagating soft and stony coral species, trying to reduce the load taken from oceans**
2. Amateur Paleontology - Thousands of hours of research into fossils, as well as collecting thousands of specimens in the field, identifying them, as well as the geologic history of my area (I know decent amounts of most eras, but my specialty is Neogene marine fossils) I also have a collection, with specimens from almost everywhere on earth, from Chile to Belgium, and Kazahkstan to Indonesia. 
3. Aquaculture Internship - I interned with a figurehead of the marine ornamental aquaculture industry, a professor who achieved several world firsts in the field. 
4. Snorkeling in the ocean - I absolutely loved to snorkel in the ocean when I lived on the coast, observing reef fishes and coral in the wild. I was planning on becoming scuba certified before my family moved to Tennessee
5. Larval culture specialist - At the largest marine ornamental aquaculture facility in the country, I was one of 3 on the larval team (the most important and most difficult) that helped raise thousands of fish, reducing the stress on the ocean
6. Pizza host - I worked at a pizza place for 6 months as a host
7. Veterinary internship - Through a program at my school, I was able to do 100+ hours of work at a mid-sized veterinary clinic, assisting the doctors any way I could
8. Veterinary Assistant - After the school year was over, I was hired on as an official employee. I've gained tons of experience, from performing blood tests, to drawing blood, as well as shadowing doctors in practice. 
9. (I don't know if I'm going to list this, give me some feedback) Rubik's cubing - I'm able to solve a Rubik's Cube in roughly a minute
10. Family farm hand - My family, since moving to TN has started a small hobby farm with rabbits, goats, chickens, ducks, cows, and of course cats and dogs. I help out and learn as much as possible.

Currently in Computer Engineering, should I switch to Computer Science? 
----

Hi everyone, hope you all are enjoying your holidays and new years. 

I am currently in Computer Engineering, but I have realized that I would much rather prefer working as a Software Engineer or some software role rather than hardware after graduation. I have also worked a few internships in the past all related to software. Because of this, I find myself enjoying software related courses more as well.

Given this, would it be better to switch into Computer science at the state I am currently in (middle of 3rd year courses), or tough out Computer Engineering? 
Is there some reason to stay in Computer Engineering that  I am unaware of? (Maybe the usefulness of certain classes, e.g. Computer architecture)

Thanks!"

Background: I have a degree in biology, and during peak pandemic I decided I didn’t want to go to med school. 

Recently I finished a data analysis internship at FANG where I learned basic python and tableau. Post internship, I sharped both of those skills and have been studying SQL.

I recently got a job where I’ll be doing IT Analysis. I’ll be building computers and installing them in health care settings around the country, then analyzing the data we get. We will be using SQL, Hex, Tableau and basic python. 

I think this is a good halfway point into becoming a data analyst. Next year, I hope to be a full on data analyst.

Update: how I got the internship at FANG. I used to work Apple retail, and they have internships just for retail employees (in addition to non retail employees) to allow retail employees experience corporate and for corporate to find new talent. I applied through the internal portal. I applied to the “technical” group, and my resume was viewed by hundreds of technical managers at corporate. If there’s a fit, managers will reach out and then the interview process starts."

So i am nearing the end of my internship (1y left) in meanwhile i have been learning/working 100% cloud  and M365 in this company (managament &amp; security of those services).

It's amazing that i get the chance to be involved in different kind of project as intern while my peers who also are doing internship are doing common IT lazy stuff (changing HDD, reseting laptops etcc). For my age and education i have risen to the ranks and proven myself. 

So i am nearing the end of my internship and boss has given me the oppurnity to stay in the company. 

Currently benefits here are:
- Business class transportation for whole country (Bus and train)
- Phone plan 

Although is great here in terms of benefits and working conditions the problem is the salary. The boss is offering me just $60K while someone in my position after in internship gets over $80K (some even $90K)

Should i change the company and go somewhere else with better benefits and payment if boss refuses to pay a decent salary? 

I have fear to change companies because after my internship i want to start working normally and continue my education in IT (doing the IT bachelor) and another employee might not give me a chance to do that for a while because i need to show them that i am worth of a worker so they to invest on my education. 

For those who don't know in my country a company pays for your education and you sign a multi-year contract with them. In case you leave during this contract you have to pay that money back to them."

zuowbe,8,2022-12-24,College senior disillusioned with UX design. What do I do after graduation?,Neat-Comfort-6104,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/zuowbe/college_senior_disillusioned_with_ux_design_what/,"I’m a senior majoring in computer science. When I discovered UX design, I thought it would be a great post-grad path for me because I love design and psychology, and there’s no other creative career with as great pay, WLB, and stability that I’m aware of. I absolutely love learning about design principles in my free time and designing things from scratch in a school environment. 

However, I’ve been completely unfulfilled and unmotivated during my actual experiences working in UX design. I’ve done multiple product/UX design internships, 2 at FAANG companies, and all of them made me depressed and genuinely dread the future. My internship work felt so pointless and menial that I struggled to get myself to work. At the FAANGs, I looked at what the principal designers were working on, and I couldn’t imagine myself being satisfied with that scope of work in the future either (e.g. pouring months into designing a way for users to upload a certain type of post). I get a sinking feeling whenever I think about entering this field full-time – if I don’t like what people at the top of this ladder are doing, what’s the point in climbing it? Management, UX research, UX writing, SWE, PM seem like even worse fits for me.

Even if I got a much bigger scope at, say, a startup, I still dread spending 20+ years applying variations of the design process, aligning with other people, and navigating office politics. I crave more variety. As an introvert, meetings and working with other people also completely drain me by the end of each work day. 

It’s probably my youthful idealism, but I really want to work at the frontiers of technology and/or design and make major, noteworthy contributions to the field, like Douglas Englebart, Susan Kare, etc. I love learning and wish I could just read nonfiction all day and somehow apply it to improve the world. So my question is, What should I consider doing after graduation? (HCI PhD/research? Working at an agency/startup? Law school for tech policy? Game design?) 

The fear/paralysis I always run into is that it seems like any alternative to Design At a Big Tech Company means worse pay and/or work-life balance. So if I pursue an alternative, it’s got to make up for that by being more fulfilling or some other quality.

I must sound like an entitled Gen Zer who’s blown this way out of proportion. I just feel so lost and confused. I’ve read books like So Good They Can't Ignore You and Designing Your Life and talked to many mentors, but I still don’t know what to do. I’m willing to work extremely hard in my career; I just haven’t found what I want to aim my energy at. Any advice or insight would be much appreciated."

And I just got my first summer internship offer in Boston that pay $30/hour. I should feel lucky that I still got an offer during this chaos but. But well, I feel lost more. Please give me some guidance/advice if you have any.

The thing is... most of the friends that I know in my class, got offers that pay like $45-$75. I feel like I'm not good enough you know, walking around those people. Some of them don't even have good GPA, doing extracurricular activities, or doing LC that much compared to me. But they still ended up with a better offer. I truly am happy for them, but at the same time I also feel upset for myself. 

I still have like 3 OAs to finish the next couple days. I'm not sure if the company that gave me an offer would wait that long until I finished all the process with these companies. I'm thinking I may sign the offer and then renege later (if I ever get a better deal). But I feel so bad and I do love the culture at this company. The only problem is... they pay $30 for an internship, which is a good amount, but again, I have that imposter syndrome and I'm sorry 😞 Should I even try to keep waiting for the other companies after I sign with this place, or should I just stop and accept what I have? I mean... companies also renege us when they have to, we can do this as well, right?

I don't know who to talk to. So I put it on here. It may seem like a silly problem to you, and I may overthinking about it. But I want to hear if you have any guidance for me to quit thinking about this. 

I just don't know how to feel. Happy? Disappointed? Upset? Envy? Idk"

The issue is that I got a B on Calc 3, and it’s compounded by an A- in English. These grades give me an overall GPA of a 3.69.

My university is a T20 for CS, and it is known for having tough courses, especially in the math department.

I’m still not sure whether I’ll do transfer apps or not (I know my school is good); if I do decide to send in apps, how negatively will my GPA affect my chances of getting into a better school for CS (CMU, MIT, Stanford, Princeton)?

Also, I’m thinking of doing UG research, and there’s a sliver of a chance I’ll get an internship. Will ECs like these help my chances of getting into a good program even if my GPA isn’t a 3.8+ by the end of the second semester?

I am an Asian Male from a competitive public high school in the Northeast (sends \~7% of a graduating class of \~400 to Ivies, but keep in mind, around 70% of those accepted to Ivies are legacies). Unfortunately, I don't really have any hooks.

**Intended Major(s):** PoliSci/History

**SAT:** 1540 raw

**UW GPA:** 3.64 (My school doesn't do weighted nor class rank). This is the crux of my application: my freshman and sophomore year grades were not great due to extenuating circumstances caused by COVID. My junior year, I achieved a 4.15 UW (so just under half my classes were A+s, the rest As) with very rigorous coursework, and my senior year, first semester; a 4.0. I am expecting a 4.05 or 4.1 for my mid-year report.

**Coursework:** Generally, the highest courses that my school offers (with the exception of 11th grade English, which was 1 level underneath the highest, and my math track, which is also 1 level underneath the highest, i.e. as a senior, I am taking AB Calc instead of BC Calc). My school does not have the traditional AP Courses, and so this is the best description I can offer. Generally, this coursework is competitive enough for students looking at top schools; many students have gotten into JHU, Penn, Cornell, etc. with these classes.

**Awards:**

1. Highest Model UN Commendation at NHSMUN (the largest international Model UN conference)
2. County Finalist, State Mock Trial Competition
3. Scholastic Gold Key for Writing

A few other, less prestigious local awards.

**Extracurriculars:**

1. President/Head Attorney, Mock Trial Team
2. President, Mental Health Awareness Club
3. Member, Model UN team (Unfortunately, I was turned down for an officer position possibly because of my president position at the Mock Trial team)
4. Self-published a research paper on narcotics and the Reagan Administration
5. Internship at a State Assembly-Member's office
6. Founded a regional organization for mental health advocacy with my local Congressman
7. Regional Advisor for a national organization for mental health advocacy
8. Work Experience at a Local Ceramics Studio

A couple other, less important extracurriculars (another officer position at a less important club, participation in a few other clubs).

**Essays/LORs/Other:** I believe my essays are generally alright, and my Dean/Guidance Counselor and AP Eng. Lit equivalent and department head English teacher seem to generally like them. Several of my history and english teachers have said that I am an exceptional writer, so I hope this is reflected in my essays. My Dean/Guidance Counselor, who has been working at my school for 30+ years said that my LORs (my teachers send 'reviews' to my dean, they are not exactly my LORs, but they are similar) are some of the best he has ever seen. I had a good connection with my LOR teachers, and so I expect that they are quite good.

**Schools:** I applied to Cornell CAS ED, and was unfortunately rejected. I believe that this may not have to do entirely with my application, however, as every person from my school accepted to a private school at Cornell (not Hum Ec/ILR) was a stem major (around 10 people), and I applied as a government major. Other humanities applicants with very strong applications (4.0+ GPAs) were also rejected, probably for this reason. Of course I cannot be sure entirely, but I feel this information may be relevant. I am looking towards either JHU or Swarthmore for ED2, but cannot decide which to do. I will probably just choose the one I have a better chance at. Around 3 other people will ED2 to JHU from my school, all with higher GPAs than mine (3.8, 3.9, 4.0), however, 2 of the 3 will have worse ECs than me. It is likely that no one else will ED2 to Swarthmore.

As for other top schools, I am looking at UChicago, Penn, and Dartmouth with zero expectations.

What do you guys think of my application? Are my extracurriculars and honors competitive? Will my competitive junior and senior year grades be enough to compensate for my lackluster freshman and sophomore year grades? I elected to respond to the COVID essay on the Common App, and tried to explain some of my extenuating circumstances. Will this be enough for top schools? Thank you for taking the time to read my post, and any help would be greatly appreciated."

Also, I keep seeing companies want their interns to graduate in 2024 Spring/Summer or earlier, which would not be the case if I do CO-OP.

I thought that the deal advisory department will give me a jump in the career so I did an interview with the partner and passed it (was not easy), and then had to take a 4 hours exam (which took me longer).
Then they called from HR to tell me that the exam was “not bad but weak and you won’t be able to deal with the department”.
I’m devastated and all my confidence went down. I’ve never been told that I’m weak.

Where should I go now? I feel lost"

zuxjrd,72,2022-12-25,Academia or the industry as an software engineer after Ph.D. in the USA?,Furiousguy79,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/zuxjrd/academia_or_the_industry_as_an_software_engineer/,"Hi. I am a first year **international** Ph.D. student (CS Major) in USA with a focus on theory and applications of AI/ML in Healthcare. Before coming to the USA, I taught as a lecturer in the CS department of a college in my home country for 3.5 years.

My plan is to immigrate to either USA or Canada after my Ph.D. But I am quite confused about which career path to take. What I am seeing is that if I can join the academia, the salary will be quite low and there will be a truck-load of work to do every week: research goals, grading, mentoring etc. I am not sure how much I can handle all of those with the low paycheck with the inflation going. On the other hand, software engineering jobs are quite lucrative but I do not have any industry experience also I heard that there is not much job-security either.

The problem is, according to my supervisor, if I want to join the industry at the end,  I will need to look for SE internships during summer and if I want to join the academia, I will need to look out for research based internships/instructor-of-record position in my university. I want to make the most out of my summer. So what are the pros and cons of these two career paths regarding pay, job security, off-time?

*P.S. If anyone is wondering why I have started a Ph.D. because its easier for international students to get full funded in the USA if we apply to the Ph.D. program. We get stipend for working as TA plus don't have to give tuition fee. I plan to finish it though as I saw that companies hire Ph.Ds in research positions or ML engineer positions and such.*"
zuzbox,31,2022-12-25,Some feedback for software engineering internships,ProfessorPlum168,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/zuzbox/some_feedback_for_software_engineering_internships/,"So a while back there were a number of openings for various internships at my place of employment (very large company not based in the Bay Area), including a software engineering one in my division.  A number of you applied.  

There were 2 auto filters.  1) the person had to graduate sometime between December 2023 and June 2024, ie not a senior, not a sophomore, not a freshman.  I would say over 50% were filtered out because of this.  2) a GPA had to be present.  I believe this filtered out a lot of people. I’m not sure if this is the case at other companies, but I have to think a GPA is pretty necessary at a lot of places. 

So the particular manager was looking for specific evidence that the person 1) wanted to be a software engineer and 2) had good experience with Java.  This was why I hinted that the person should have been really good in CS61B.  However, I don’t think many, or any of you listed any specifics as to how you used Java in your projects and/or previous work.  I noticed that all resumes were written to fit on one page.  Hint:  no one looks at resumes on paper anymore.  You should highlight a few of your projects and work experience on these projects, even if it spills over to another page. Although don’t overdo it. I would say that it is also important to say at the top of your resume on what you want to be doing in your future, even if you have to have different versions of your resume.  Finally, some of you wrote things in an email that might have gone into details, but because of the specific nature of how resumes have to be reviewed (there’s a specific software application used for reviewing and making notes), this was not taken into consideration.  So another reason to put some details into your resume.

This process might be different from company to company, but I gotta think that many are reasonably close."

my school has the badge of the so-called ""golden school"" - is among the top 200 schools in the country.

I passed the final exams in extended physics and basic and extended mathematics (a rarity in my country) - these results would enable me to study in an individual program in physics, which annually accepts about 80 students and is the best program in physics in my part of Europe.

I graduated in 2013 from a top 15 school with an undergraduate business degree. I've been dealing with health issues that are difficult to treat (started in college but got progressively worse afterwards). After graduating, I've taken about 2 years worth of undergraduate computer science classes part time at a local state university (like 1 course a year). But I dropped out permanently in 2020 before I finished the second bachelor's degree. (Too expensive, wasn't good at it, didn't like it, and at the time didn't see the potential for me to work due to health issues so it didn't seem like a good use of money to keep paying for classes). I barely remember the coursework at this point.

My only work experience is a summer internship I did 12 years ago that I barely remember. I'm starting to see some progress healthwise. I'm still not there yet, but I have a slimmer of hope that maybe I could work in the future whereas before I had none.

What would my career options be like when/if I'm able to work in the future? Is my education worth anything since it's so long ago/forgotten?"

zvcshh,1,2022-12-25,Imposter syndrom or no,CardiologistEarly483,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/zvcshh/imposter_syndrom_or_no/,"I wonder what kind of person I am in real life.

Just to give you some background, I(M) am someone who did not have a normal childhood. I had a paranoid overprotective mother, a busy father, a bully middle brother and an unsociable older sister. I never got along with my sister and especially my brother. My parents convinced me that most relatives are like that and it's normal. I didn't have any experiences worth mentioning when I was a teenager due to my paranoid overprotective mother and I have stories that are very embarrassing about how she loses her mind and almost calls the cops just because I was late by half an hour when returning from school. 

Normally, in those situations, your brother/sister help you out and stand by your side. On the contrary, they kiss up to her and they are always against me, no matter what. They fight a lot also with each other and with my mother. My father is non-existent in those conflicts because he returns from work late and is already tired. 

In high school, I always felt like I lagged behind when it comes to growth. Oh yeah, I was also raised to be a pussy... there was a time when a bully, smaller than me in size, tried to look down on me and I made up the courage and beat him up. I was proud and went home and made the mistake of telling that to my mother and brother... They were furious at me as they feared that this bully will bring his friends next time and he will continue to annoy me everyday. My brother and sister mock me for the way I speak and they kind of make fun of the slightest quotes that aren't even funny ( my accent specifically is funny to my brother) and growing up like that, I found myself very self cautious and scared of talking or participating in class or in a group discussion because my classmates might make fun of me. We never went to places or hotels for vacations. We rarely leaved the city to go visit a relative or a friend. Even when friends invited me, my parents refused. My friendly and funny attitude made me have good relationships and good friends in high school but I truly felt that I wasn't up to my friends level of maturity and social experience. Of course I wasn't rock bottom too... 

The best decision in my life is moving out after finishing high school and starting my engineering studies. It was very hard to me because I have never lived by myself and kind of grew up attached to my comfort zone and almost grew up with the same personality as my mother, afraid of change, of experiences, paranoid and so on...

Now I'm 25 and moving abroad in one month. I'm working with a team of people from all around the world... again, this gap is showing up even more this time. However, I understand that there is nothing that I could have done better back when I was a kid, because I had no control and I was clueless and in an environment where they wouldn't allow me grow up. 

Sometimes, I remember all this stuff and I believe this is the syndrome imposter. Where I look down on myself and don't acknowledge myself. But in other times, I look back and I feel really proud that I resisted all of this and changed myself by myself. 

My spoiled middle brother works in my uncle's company and despite so many arguments and fights because of his short temper and messed up attitude ( also because of the toxic environment ), he almost got himself fired. Still he remained there in the company because of the good relationship between my father and uncle. He was never a responsible person and blamed every problem in work on my parents for suggesting to him to join my uncle's company, and before that, blamed them for registering him in a private university so he can study engineering ( because he couldn't get into a public university or study engineering with his grades ). 

My sister is married, but is a social failure. All what she did in her life is study, then work. She has no friends. She talks horribly to my mother and to me. She has a daughter that I feel sorry about sometimes because of her immature parenting. She couldn't live in the dorm and chose to still live with my parents when she was studying.

I, growing up watching these two freaks, decided to be the opposite. I moved to another city, and lived by myself ( something my brother and sister couldn't do when they were students ) and succeeded and got a high rank to join the second best computer science university in the country. Joined clubs, took on positions, worked as a part time board game graphic designer and studied engineering at the same time. Got my internships and worked in three different companies by myself, got them through my own researches and through LinkedIn. My father was trying to convince me to join my uncle's company but to his butt kissing attitude and my spoiled brother being there, I refused ( still have mixed feelings about it ). 

Now I got a job in a big company in Germany and I hope that I will keep doing good. This isn't how I used to think 4 or 5 years ago. I used to say that I'm stupid and unreliable. And I still say that to myself from time to time. However, remembering my small achievements until now, I feel at ease a little bit and take it easy on myself. 

I wish I had someone observing this and give me his thought and tell me how I'm doing. We can't see everything and sometimes we need a person, standing from another perspective, who can tell us how we are walking, how much we are progressing, how much our backs are carrying...

So there it is :) what do you guys think ?"

zvdvc6,2,2022-12-25,Life Checkpoint,yiply,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/zvdvc6/life_checkpoint/,"It's Christmas and I was just hit really suddenly with a need to write down and reflect on my thoughts and life; didn't know where to post it so I just chose here since it seemed to fit well enough so here we go. (btw first paragraph is kinda rambly, I promise the rest is more organized lol)

19M, Here I am lying on the floor of my room listening to a tragic song from my favorite franchise (Apocalypsis II from Ciconia no Naku Koro Ni), really realizing some of the emptiness and thankfulness I feel this Christmas. My day really can be broken up into two parts. From when I woke up until around 1 PM I enjoyed an unusually calm and pleasant Christmas with my family of 7. I got the few things I asked for, and really am quite satisfied with how most of my gifts were received. Then, the second half of the day began. I retreated to my room to try running the new Fifa 23 game I bought with money I received only to realize that my computer couldn't run it and I'd need a $300 external graphics card to be able to play it. This really upset me in a way I haven't felt in a while and I really don't understand why it upsets me so much. I've kind of spent the last couple of hours brooding to myself about this while wearing a veneer to my family that I am completely content. (I realize how stupidly childish this is, but it's my honest feelings).

I truly am grateful to my parents and feel kind of like a spoiled brat since they've provided me with a life I really don't believe I deserve. We live in a very well-off neighborhood and often eat out, which I kind of resent since I don't believe that I've earned any of the luxuries my parents provide me with, like paying for all my college expenses. My father works high up in one of the most valuable companies and is about to make the switch to a CEO at a smaller company in the coming year, all while being a college professor and pursuing a Ph.D. of course. He has a drive to succeed that I honestly struggle to see myself match, and am quite insecure about it.

I myself recently graduated valedictorian from a class of around 700, and am currently attending a top-5 college for my major, for which I just achieved a 4.0 in my first semester. Despite this, I feel like I dragged my way through school, exerting minimal effort and involving myself in just the activities that I thought were expected of me (mostly just varsity soccer). I kinda am still in disbelief that I go to the college that I do given this. As I've found since going to college, everyone around me is extremely motivated and I feel so out of place, even while knowing that many of my colleagues feel the same way. Since I've come home for this Winter break, I've achieved quite literally nothing and have been essentially a vegetable consuming braindead youtube shorts for probably a good 4 hours every day, reading, and playing video games for the rest of the time. I can't even muster up to motivation to engage in the hobbies by which I typically describe myself to others (speedrunning, speedcubing, soccer, etc.). I know I need to plan ahead for my future by searching out an internship for the summer, but can't motivate myself to do it. I'm quite scared about how my future will turn out, despite the guarantees I already have.

Maybe because of this, I also sit here by myself. I don't consider myself particularly attractive or unattractive, I have I think about an average face and above-average body, but have always struggled with acne. I have only once been in a relationship, but I can hardly call it that. It was in 8th-9th grade and only lasted a few months, but I cherished it during that time. Unfortunately, it fell apart though, partially due to my youth and immaturity at the time, and I have been wanting to get back into a relationship since then. So, about a month ago, I contacted the girl I was in that relationship with, and confessed my continued feelings for the first time, only to get flatly rejected. 

In high school and even in college, I have never struggled to gain male friends, and have many relationships I cherish, but I'm not sure that many of those friends cherish me back. I often get just close enough to get people's numbers, but anxiety and apathy keep me from connecting further, so it's probably more accurate to say I have many acquaintances, but few real friends. Although I have many male acquaintances I also wish to be friends with girls, but for whatever reason, in the casual way I usually go about friends, I've only ever gotten to really know a few of them, which is immensely frustrating to me.

So as I lay here on the floor of my room which is much too large, I really feel like an imposter in my own home. I understand that when I was born, and at many points throughout my life, I rolled many dice that all landed on six, but I know that I probably deserve all threes and fours, yet I seem to be enjoying life on the same level as if I had rolled only twos and threes. I have people around me, but no one I can talk to, all my relationships seem superficial. I understand that as far as problems go, mine are quite minor, but nonetheless, I recognize that they are all quite real. I just want to preface that I'm not suicidal or anything, but my family does have a history of anxiety and depression, for which I think I probably have some undiagnosed level of.

I've never really put down my thoughts in a way like this before, although I realize that I've known and recognized all these things before, it's nice to have them all in front of me in this way. If you feel inclined, feel free to share your thoughts. Hope you all enjoyed your Christmas."

Let me first say that I have graduated with an associates degree from my community college. My associates is in engineering science it is the hardest program at the school with only a 2% graduation rate, I finished with a 3.9 GPA and pretty much got accepted anywhere in the country. I chose a university with a good name and a good electrical engineering program, however, I must say my time in the community college was so much better. Classes at the university are not as challenging, professors don’t care as much, I learned more from my community college, made more connections, I was super close to my professors which helped me get internships at really respectable companies in fact I am still in contact with most of them. I don’t feel this connection at my university. Professors/TA’s really don’t care the ones that do are so rare. My engineering classes are a joke, in my community college I actually struggled a little bit. The campus was so much cleaner and nicer while my university campus really does suck. The only good thing about the university campus is that the food is good and there are places to go and spend time when not studying. I am really only posting this for the people who are bothered to go to a community college, I will just say this I learned so much more and I was prepared. Community college gave me the opportunity to work and learn, professors who actually care about your education, cheap tuition, made a lot of connections and friends whom I am still in contact with. Do not let the community college name fool you. I have met many people who did not go to a community college simply because of the name."

I (f21) am a college student living a few hours away from home. I do love my family, don’t get me wrong. But I feel like the only good they’ve ever done is put a roof over my head and the basics really. I know this makes me sound spoiled and entitled, and I hate it. We’ve done the family vacations, we’ve made so many memories, they have been there for me in theory when times were tough. But as long as I can remember I’ve always seeked support from anyone but them. 

I think most of these feelings come from my mom. I like to blame the generational curse, tail as old as time. The oldest daughter gets the most burden blah blah blah. But seriously, my mom is MEAN. I don’t know if she’s a narcissist or bipolar, or just straight up gives no fucks sometimes, but she is the furthest thing from what I picture a mother to be. Just very cold, solve your problems yourself, cares more about her career than her own children. Don’t get me wrong, like pop off and do your thing, but don’t just abandon us. She has fat shamed me my ENTIRE life, I am pretty overweight. At the end of the day I know the only person I can blame is myself for treating my body the way I do, but it’s a comfort thing. And where do I seek comfort from where I never get it? You guessed it. My dad is a good guy, just a huge source of anxiety for me. I feel bad for him. My parents don’t get along, they never have as long as I can remember really. I’ve never really gotten along with my sister, I mean we have our moments, but honestly she’s just so hard to talk to. She can be kind of mean and cold like my mom and we just don’t have anything in common. My brother is young, we’re cool but not like insanely close or anything. It breaks my heart but I know he would reach out if he truly needed me, same goes for my sister. 

My extended family is nice, I’ve always felt a little mistreated though. I’m pretty sensitive but I kinda feel like I’m usually the one picked on or taken for granted. It would be sad to lose them but I don’t think they would blame me. I think they would kind of understand based on years of me and my mom not getting along. 

It sucks because I am financially dependent on my parents right now. I had an internship over the summer that I quit my previous full time job for so I’ve needed extra support just with rent. I do work, I have two jobs, but I don’t make near than enough to support myself because they are minimum wage on campus jobs. My main priority was to focus on school and my grades were great! But I still got tons of shit for not having money. I can never win, it was Vice versa when I was working full time. I’ve been applying for jobs though, so hopefully I can find something and not rely on my parents anymore. I miss being independent I hate knowing they can hold that over my head, and trust me, they do.

I guess I just don’t know what to do. There’s so many more stories and reasonings as to why I want to do this I just know that I’m going to think a lot about it before I make any decisions."

***About me/my\_qualifications*****:** 

I am currently 17, in Kerala. I have fvucked up entrance coaching and I am now studying in 12th. 12th is almost over (finals in March). I'm getting excellent marks in studies currently (11th - 98.9% Kerala State Board). I wanna go abroad for studies. I am very passionate about programming and CS. Have taken part in many competitions, including district level programs and won certificates. I am looking forward to making projects, internships etc so that would increase my chances of getting admission abroad.

Since my financial situation is a bit off, I am not considering US but only UK and Canada. Why do I wanna go abroad? To get better opportunities as I understand how messed up the job market for CSE is in India, in lower tier colleges. Moreover, I have lived for 7 years in Saudi Arabia and travelled to many countries and I somewhat want to settle in a first world country.

***My doubts:***

1) Since my entrance coaching is fvucked up, I will probably have to choose 3rd tier state government colleges. Does this affect going abroad for masters in any way (like scholarships, loans..)?

2) What exactly should I do so that I can increase my chances of getting scholarship and admission abroad? I've heard doing internships, projects etc increases chance but someone pls elaborate. 

3) When going abroad, do you find maximum % scholarships (lets say I found an 80% scholarship to X university), then apply to X university or do you find a university and then later apply for scholarship?

&amp;#x200B;

I'd find it extremely helpful if someone answered my questions."

I haven't gotten to building my portfolio just yet, but I have a few edX certifications in some relevant domains. I also plan to do some small internships while doing BCA.

I know that BCA is seen as worthless in India and the norm is to go for MCA, at a better institute like NIT. But I was wondering if I could go abroad for MS after BCA. In US most colleges want 4 year degree but I have checked and there are plenty of good colleges that accept 3 year degrees also.

One main concern is that I won't be able to manage huge jump from BCA to MS because it will be very hard, but there are people doing MS in computer coming from totally unrelated fields. I have to work hard but I think I can do it. Financing will be a problem but my parents say not to worry. In some European countries like Germany, France etc masters is free or very cheap according to my friend doing masters in Germany.

The abroad option seems more attractive because it will help me add value beyond the BCA while also allowing me to break into the foreign job market. So, MCA or MS guys? am I missing something here is there some other criteria to go abroad or some procedures? I'm decent at academics and am willing to learn languages if it comes to it.

Basically, I’m a 21 old guy from Europe. I have zero former experiences with programming (like not a single line of code type). In September I got into the University (Computer Science; Bachelor Degree; Six Semester Course). 

I was always kind of “techy” type but more of a “wow, this new hardware is interesting, let me read more about it” type. I know that it was kind of dumb, but I sort of hoped that they teach me programming at the Uni.

Well, I’m in the middle of the first semester and I didn’t see a sh*t from computers. 90% of my classes is math (which I’m okay with, getting through tests without problems - but it isn’t programming really and I don’t have that much spare time to self-study programming because classes are time consuming and I work part time). 

And the one thing that is really getting me anxious is that majority of my classmates are fully working programmers. They work in IT industry as interns or developing software on their own. 
They just have the skills, the experience. They do it for the last five or more years. 

So…my question is “did I choose wrong?” And if not, “can I learn how to program from school” (or should I just drop out and try something else/bootcamp or something?)

I would really appreciate any feedback, insight, anything tbh. I’m glad that this sub exists.

I am a software engineer by work and earning some decent amount of money. From my college days onwards, i was in many relationships, but nothing stayed for long. Most of the time it is the girlfriend suddenly stopped communicating and don't return the calls. Eventually, it will be lost and this has happened nany times. My marriage also didn't last for much long. I have a girl child and she lives with her mother. I am sending money every month for her expenses, but the kid don't talk to me. 

My the end of last March, i met with a girl on one of the Matrimonial website. It is like the kinds of dating apps, but for people looking for marriage. She has mentioned seperated and has a son. She told me she is doing internship and don't have a job and asked me to help. Eventually we became close and i helped her to get a software engineer job and now she is earning some money through it. I have done online coding tests for her behalf and taught her each and everything. Also i have done the training assignments for her in her work and helped every now and then. She is not filing the divorce complaint and always pushing me to go abroad and take her there and live. I have also tried from my side, but i don't get any jobs there as of now. She has asked me to complete another assignment and she was simply sleeping. I have busy work at my company and i am also doing a second job as freelance. I have helped her as much as i can and have given money too, but not very significant amount. 

Now , she stopped talking to me all of a sudden and i am afraid everything is repeating itself and this will also end eventually. I am a self diagnosed borderline personality type, but the doctors i consult don't agree and give me medicine for OCD. I have anxiety and panic attacks and thinking that she left me is hurting me very much and this thought is haunting me. I don't know this is because of my personality type or its genuine. Soon after i take my medicine, i will sleep. Untill then i will be on constant worry and posting here for some relief. It's evening here and i wish night shall come little early so that I can finally sleep and done with the day. 

I am an idiot, immature and always yelling and complaining. I think the girl i was talking with is with someone else and so not taking my calls. Oh god how this thinking will go. I am so fed up."

In this sub everyone speaks about FAANG or HFT.. the problem is that they reject 99.99% of applications (or at least, they reject mines).. so it's nice to dream, but if someone like me is looking for a job, then it would be nice to know good companies that are actually hiring.. 

Now, considering I'm a recent graduate with 3 years of internship or working student experience as an ML/SWE engineer, I'm an EU citizen, and I need to get a job (I haven't even been able to get an interview for months), what are some good companies to work for?

I consider myself quite flexible in this sense, since I could work all over Europe, even willing to relocate.

Here are a few companies I've applied to or checked out:

Adobe, Airbnb, Amazon, Apple, Argo-AI, Bloomberg, BMW, Booking, BOSCH, CERN, Cisco, Confluent, Databricks, Datadog, Deepmind, Dell, Dropbox, Ebay, Elastic, Ergon Informatik, Github, Google, Here, IBM,  Jetbrains, Logitech, Meta, Microsoft, MongoDB, Netflix, Nvidia, Oracle, Paypal, Red Hat, Salesforce, Samsung, Shopify, Snap, Snowflake, Sony, Spotify, Stripe, Swisscom, Tesla, Think-Cell, TikTok, Uber, Visa, Wayfair, Zühlke Technology Group




The companies offering New Grad programs are mostly the so called WITCH (e.g. Deloitte Wipro Infosys IBM Accenture Atos TCS Tech Mahindra Cognizant Capgemini HCL Larsen &amp; Toubro).. Is it good to avoid them? 

Thank you."

zvw0hl,6,2022-12-26,I feel useless and like I will never be able to achieve my dreams/live up to my expectations,justlatherthatsall,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/zvw0hl/i_feel_useless_and_like_i_will_never_be_able_to/,"I am 22 years old and have been struggling with ADHD for the past 4-5 years. I got diagnosed at the beginning of this year. 

I used to enjoy making music as an EDM/electronic music producer. It's something I discovered in high school and was able to do every single day for a period of around 2-3 years. In 12th grade, I had a sort of traumatic event where my best friend at the time stopped speaking to me for reasons I will not go into. I stopped making music. I no longer had any motivation to. 

After months of trying to get over her I entered university. Once again, I tried to make music but it wasnt something I could get myself to do. I'd imagine myself doing it, take breaks on the assumption that I was burnt out, and seek inspiration from musicians on twitter to get me interested in doing it. But whenever I sat down in front of my computer, I just immediately felt tired and demotivated.

As for university, I initially began with very grades, as I wanted to show my father that I was capable of obtaining good grades and not being a disappointment. I would say that I am a smart kid and very quick at learning things, however, this has caused several issues. The first is that my parents expected that I get straight A's, which put a lot of pressure on me. The second is that throughout highschool (and eventually uni) I would end up cramming for all my exams on the day before them. This caused me to have no proper work ethic, only one that was dictated by deadlines. This caused a lot of anxiety and pressure on myself as well. 

My university journey was basically as follows: kept getting high grades and peaking in my second year to get very high grades (3.94 in one semester). After that semester i felt incredibly burnt out and I decided to take it easy after that, resulting in my grades becoming B- to B+'s. My CGPA went from 3.78 to 3.55 by the time I graduated. Which...is honestly good, just not for my parents at the time. I also didnt like it because I felt like i was being lazy and I also felt very guilty, because I am someone who likes to give it all in the things I do (if I had the choice, or if we didnt live in a system where uni degree's can guarantee you a safe path to a job 99% of the time, then I would've dropped out). Overall, that was my university journey. Avoiding my courses and exams until the last minute and trying to make music but of course not being able to and basically doing nothing.

I graduated uni 12 months ago. I had done an internship in my last semester which lead to a full time job, which I started working at 1 week after I graduated. I've been working there for 12 months now. The work I do is very...mild. It is ok. It's not something I want to do for the rest of my life. I am working as a software developer. 

Since starting my job, and the year of 2022, I've been able to experience just how unprepared I was for the real world. My system of waiting for the last minute and having virtually 0 work ethic and no well established habits were no longer enough. Yes, I can get by and deliver on my job, but when it came to wanting to achieve the things I wanted to...I could not. I got diagnosed sometime in April of this year, and have been going to a psychologist to try to get my life on track. My goal is to transition into a career that I can go into full-time and eventually quit my current job. I want to achieve my dreams. I've always wanted to be something along the lines of an artist or content creator. Right now, I think I want to be either a musician (electronic music) or a lets play youtuber (like pewdiepie, someone I have watched since I was a kid and always admired). These are two things that I have done before, so I have some experience in them. 

Today, I sat down and was about to record my first video when I felt this incredible dread and fear. I felt like it was pointless. The youtube Lets Play market is already incredibly saturated. I went online to search what people thought about becoming a Lets Play youtuber in 2022, and most people said 'do it as a hobby, but dont expect to make it a career'. But how can I enjoy something if it feels like there is no point to it? The same thing applies to becoming a musician. There are already tons of people online doing it that are much more dedicated than me. 

I also enjoy taking pictures sometimes, and recently opened a photography account on instagram with the hope of becoming big. The same issues that apply to the Youtube career and musician apply here. Basically, any career where you post content online looks to be impossible, due to saturation and due to my lack of skills in them, which make it seem impossible that I will ever get good at any of these things. For example, I saw a comment by a mother of 2 kids that has a lets play channel where she has been posting videos for 8 years! She only has 9k subscribers though. While that is fine, thats not where I want to be after 8 years of making videos. But of course, I am not special, there are 8 billion other people. So how will I make it? 

My psychologist has told me to take initiative, that I should just try these things. I know that she's probably right, but I cant seem to get out of this horrible cycle of inaction. I just feel INCREDIBLY demotivated anytime I want to make a big change in my life.

To summarize, I want to be an artist or musician or youtuber. These careers all seem impossible. I cannot get myself to do them. The past year has been frustrating. I dont want to look back in 30 years and feel regret at not having pursued my dreams. I just want to make a difference and contribute something to the world while doing something I enjoy.

I have tried to summarize everything in this post, of course there are some things that I missed but i find it difficult to completely capture everything on the first try. Hope this wasn't too long of a read lol"

I want to ask for advices on my resume. I'm a recent Chemical Engineer graduate in undergrad and want to break into the data analyst field. I had good experiences with Python and Excel, and am slowly learning to do SQL (however still too novice). Ideally I want to jump into entry-level position, but I might apply for more internship position too. I have throw in roughly 40 applications and they all rejected so far, so I want to look for a bit more guidance before applying more.

I have some questions:

For skill section, would it be better used to include job description keywords (like this one) that is still in a sense reflective of my experience? I am not sure if this is a good use of the skill section. Would this somewhat ""better"" help me run through companies that use ATS, while still staying true to what I did?

So far, all of my experience relevant is included on the resume. How would I optimize my Linkedin so it does not look exactly like my resume?

I have been messaging recruiters on Linkedin too, but to no helpful so far. It could be bad timing (december christmas season), but I would like some tips on whether I should apply to bigger/smaller company? Or relevant advice is good too.

thank you everyone in advance, and enjoy your holiday too.

LORS: I honestly have no clue but I included my Math teacher which I also knew through Math Club at my school, Humanities teacher from 6th-10th grade that I love a lot and he loves me a lot too, a research rec because I submitted a research portfolio (1 recon the MIT app and one on the actual Research Supplement) and my counselor rec.
 
Interview: Around 2 hours long and I think It went really well, explained more about my story of coming to America and some of my extracurriculars. Also, I knew a lot about MIT because they invited me to a program on Campus, but I still asked him a lot of questions about his own experience and even what he does now. 
 
Schools: List of colleges, ED/EA/RD, etc.

I'm an avid learner by nature and have been passionate about coding from a young age almost to the point of obsession hence I was having a blast beforehand and learning a lot and really developing and looking forward to my future in the industry. Problem is after being let go I've lost all my motivation to code and even trying to leetcode or learn new topics fills me with such uninterest and skull crushing boredom I feel like I could jump out a window. I think this is because I did everything correctly but still got dealt a bad hand fairly early on in my career leading me to feel powerless (and though I know it wont replace us, this whole chatGPT thing isnt helping either). I just got a full time role which is great but I just feel so demoitivated to do anything code-wise and I feel like I'm in limbo. I'm not worried about performing; I know I'll do my job because I'm getting paid and that's what's expected of me but how am I supposed to grow and learn if I cant even read a page of documentation anymore or open a book about anything code related? I'm wondering if anyone else has gone through this and how they found their passion and love of coding again because before this I literally felt like I could do this forever and that all changed in the course of a few days."

After doing some research, I think IT/Networking/Cyber Security seems more interesting and could be more enjoyable for me.

Recently I started applying to entry-level IT/Help Desk roles since I don't have any technical experience (didn't do internships during my undergrad), but I'm wondering if, along with my CS degree, doing some certifications could help me land a role. Would A+, Security+, and Network+ be good enough for me? What kind of roles should I be applying for with a degree and these certifications?

I’ve tried reaching out and he’s very helpful, when he has time. I’ve been able to meet with him for an hour and we were unable to solve the issue. He recommended some steps but that didn’t work either.

Since it’s the Holidays pretty much anyone that can help is out of office. I’ve been stressing about this project over the weekend since the story is due tomorrow and I was out of town.

It’s unlikely that I’ll close the story but my question is how can I avoid this in the future?

What are the chances that I get in, honestly have not done all too much except finish my course work. Should end up with around a 3.5 gpa for the semester (Columbia engineering courses mostly curve to  3.3 for context). I did get an offer from a FAANG company for software engineering internship over the summer, though am planning to major in bme.

Also as a freshman applicant I got into the scholars program (likely letters) at Columbia, Cornell, and Yale. Which was anywhere from top 1 - 5% of students enrolled.

Never applied to MIT, and realizing its probably the best fit for me, is it at all realistic to transfer or no? Would they consider it a lateral transfer and would that make a difference?

2. Internship at Royal Enfield. Interned as a bike mechanic and sales person
3. Weight training, I've been hitting the gym for 3 years now and I'm putting varsity sports level time into it. Albeit it doesn't stand on its own, its something that takes up a large portion of my time and I've invested a lot of time and energy into
4. Drum tutor, the title says it all. I teach kids drums at a school of music
5. Math tutor, I taught underprivileged kids math as a passion project, albeit it doesn't count as community service as I did charge them a small fee (I needed summer cash okay?)
6. Python proficiency certification and coding as a passion project. I have completed projects over the year relating to databases and drone engineering

I went into depth of how I am well-versed in the Judicial, Engineering, Musical, Administrative, Business, Athletic and Photography fields and I tied into how me being a generalist makes me a better fit for their college by bringing in diversity into their institution.

Im late 20s now. I went to college when I was 18, graduated bachelors at 23. Unfortunately my field wasn't lucrative. Didn't pan out no matter how many internships or volunteer related ""jobs"" I had in it. I decided when I was 25 that I needed to change. I decided to join a Coding bootcamp (used my life savings at the time) and went all in. After it, for over a year, I could not find a single job in tech, with over 600 applications sent. I finally found one internship that lasted 6 months, jobless again, and after depleting all my resources, found a job that's tech adjacent, and the pay is pretty low. It was decent during the pandemic, but with the record high inflation, im living paycheck to paycheck again. I promise this isn't a saving issue. After 2 years of this, and even applying again. I just can't seem to get out. My frustration is that no matter what I train to do, I can never get a position using it, so then obviously my skills in my trained field tend to falter over time. I can't just fork up more money I don't have anymore for a skill that (in my experience) doesn't pan out. I know it's selfish, I know it's asinine, but I just want a damn answer to WHAT DO I DO? I just want a course, or a skill, or fuck it, I want an entire program that I will go in debt for if it can guarantee just a damn middle wage job for me. Or something I can move up in. I would prefer to stay in tech. I just can't stand anymore the answer of ""go learn this language or this technology""...guess what, I learned Javascript, I taught myself SQL, I studied C#, none of it is good enough because I don't have experience in it, because even though I learn it, no one wants to hire for it.

So…it’s almost 2023 and I personally accomplished a few of my small goals this year, particularly getting an internship.

I am still going with it and getting paid (little but whatever) for my work. I love the company, the people, and even the work surprisingly.

As we go into the new year and I enter my final semester in my MA program, I want to keep the momentum going. What should my next step be moving forward?

Every time I get assigned a new task in my internship, I add it to my LI profile. I’ve been trying to network (mostly on Twitter, but trying to figure out how to translate that over to LI without being stalker-y or creepy about it). I didn’t get the paid internships I wanted at a major company which is why I’m still with the boutique digital marketing agency.

I really really want to keep the momentum going strong, as I said. I have two courses left, my capstone and another social media course towards a certificate that I’m working towards at the same time. I plan to ask two people for a LI recommendation who can really speak to my work and dedication. I’m also trying to write for myself now that I got more confident sharing my work and writing for SEO for clients. 

My dream and really end goal is to work in entertainment PR. Any ideas for what my focus should be with job hunting during this last semester starting in a few weeks

I am preparing for some exams right now and also doing a full time internship along with it in a Big4 accounting firm.

I have always been a pretty anxious kid growing up and was deeply attached to my parents who basically sheltered me and validated every fear I had of new things in life. Very basic things like hygiene, grocery shopping, small talk with family are very foreign to me since i was basically allowed to be on my laptop or watch TV in my room from the age of 10 onwards without any supervision. I had friends at school and I was a good student so I never really felt that my 'anxiety' was something that should concern me(?)and yeah life was good apart from the occasional teenage embarassments that we all go through.

Once school ended, and I had to go to college, I thought of myself as an interesting person who can be funny and thoughtful and assumed that I would make a lot of friends, just like at school. It was very very difficult because i spent most of my time trying to maintain good grades which was much trickier than it was in school. In my first year,  had to delete social media for a few months and when I came back I had lost all my school friends. My best friend of 5 years had picked a fight and kicked me out of her group and suddenly no one wanted to be friends with the awkward girl from school. It devastated me a lot to lose everyone like that and when I did get the grades i wanted I had no one to share it with. The anxiety got much worse then and I refused to get out of the house because I thought I might run into all these people and break down. 

All 5 years of college passed without any significant friendships and while I do have a group of 3-4 girls whom I love they all have their own school, community, college and work groups and it gets really hard being the only one who wants to hang out anymore because all the others have better options for friends. I keep stalking my school friends on an insta I made just to snoop and find myself getting angry at them and myself for how things unfolded. Meanwhile, I am not able to connect with anyone at work or make friends because I'm rather quiet and don't really party or go clubbing because it is really overwhelming. I also have a myriad of health issues that I'd rather not get into which have linkage with anxiety and depression. I'm also not the best looking person, I have bad skin, hair and I'm really thin and short which has affected my confidence a lot. I have never been asked out or even had guy friends because guys especially seem to just be turned off by my general demeanor.

I saw a psychiatrist a couple of years back who pretty much said there's nothing wrong with me and that I shouldn't  'think too much'. But my moods and behaviour concern me a lot, I genuinely don't feel any connection to the world and tbh the only reason I'm living even is because of my parents. I had a conversation with a family member recently who suggested that I don't bring anything to the table or have an interesting life and top of that I make people uncomfortable hence no one wants to be friends with me.

I need some advice on how to make friends ( real ones this time) and not drive people away. 

I'm open to any and all suggestions:)"

Is there anything else I can do to improve my chances of achieving this goal? I observe people receiving 200k TC following bachelor's degrees on Blind. I live in the greater Los Angeles region, but I'm open to moving to the Bay Area. I'm at a loss for what else to do. The micro-internship project manager does provide referral, that could help?

zwd2z1,1,2022-12-27,can i reject the full time offer after completing a 6 month internship?,keerti1720,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/zwd2z1/can_i_reject_the_full_time_offer_after_completing/,"hey guys, so the company i got the offer from stated that they want students who selected both internship+fte, not only an internship. While I did sign an offer letter for the internship, I’m planning on rejecting the full time offer due to my plans for a masters degree. Is it allowed for me to do the internship and then reject the full time offer since i haven’t yet signed an offer letter for full time?
It’s for a tech consulting role."
zwf7na,1,2022-12-27,Is the ACCA right for me??,money_invester123,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/zwf7na/is_the_acca_right_for_me/,"Hi all, I have a offer to complete the ACCA in industry in a finance company I interned at over the summer and will start when I graduate in July. I’ve got 2x questions. 

Firstly, I chose ACCA as I was given a choice of ACCA or CIMA (as it’s in industry I can’t do ACA) did I make the right choice? Following on from that I’m not sure what I want to do once I become qualified (I’m thinking about big 4, consulting or IB) are these options closed off completing ACCA in industry ? I’ve tried getting those roles now but I only have 1 relevant internship and a Open uni business degree and haven’t been able to get in that way (maybe when I’m part qualified but if I joined this company I would want to stay until I qualified)

Secondly, is there anything I should know or advice you would give to someone that’s about to start the ACCA?"

I had great internships and felt very prepared to enter the field of business/tech. I have had over thirty interviews and had not been able to land a job. 

I am a very shy person with social anxiety, and I prefer to just do computer work and stay to myself. Obviously this is very different from what nursing entails. But I thought about how in the corporate world, you have to switch jobs every few years, there’s very little job security, no fulfillment, possibility of getting low paying positions, and low flexibility. 

My second choice of a degree was nursing, but I was scared that I am too introverted for that. Now I am thinking that I want to be in the healthcare field, however, I would feel like I wasted so much time and money on school, projects, learning if I told my parents I would like to go to nursing school. 

My local community college as an AAS in Nursing program. I wish I could do ABSN, but I do not have any prerequisites and my GPA is less than 2.9. 

I’m 21 and I would feel embarrassed to go back and get an associates in something so different like my other degree didn’t work out, but I am also nervous about not being accepted into the nursing program at the community college after the first prerequisites. The cc has a 5 semester nursing program. Mainly I’m worried about how much time it will take to graduate and land a job. 

I don’t know if I’m being naive or impatient. Would an AAS hinder me from future opportunities like specializing? Do most hospitals ask you to get your BSN? Should I stay where I am and continue looking for a corporate job?

I will appreciate any advice given. Thank you."

Unfortunately I lost 4 years of my life to a horrible skin problem I developed after using a mosturizer on my face. The cream triggered some awful skin condition that has never fully gone away, but for four years I was in severe pain with the skin on my face and also had awful looking scabbing that lasted years. When it happened I was in a good internship and unfortunately as well as kind of destroying my career, I missed out on a lot of living for the past 4 years, couldn't date or anything, or couldn't go to the gym/play sport due to the agony I was in. I'm trying to get back to sport and also looking at dating again but I don't know how I'll come across to people anymore now as this really took it's toll on me. I'm a bit worried how I'm going to explain to people the situation I went through as it is such a messed up situation. Any advice would be helpful as I'm a bit lost at the moment. Thanks."

Location and return offer is not a huge concern for me at the moment. Listing some of the pros and cons for me (not sure if these are true at all lol, please correct me if I’m wrong!)

Two Sigma (NYC)
Pros:
- better resume value for breaking into top HFTs
- higher NG TC


Cons:
- projects potentially not as interesting/meaningful
- worse career growth (?)

Netflix (Los Gatos, CA)
Pros:
- better resume value in tech field
- more interesting projects
- relatively newer intern program (not sure if pro or con)


Cons:
- less resume value for breaking into HFT (?)
- declining performance

**Demographics**

* Gender: Female
* Race/Ethnicity: Taiwanese
* Residence: MA
* Income Bracket: 250k+
* Type of School: Public

**Intended Major(s)**: Mechanical Engineering

**Academics**

* GPA (UW/W): 4.45
* Rank (or percentile): None but our class profile says our top GPA is 4.48
* \# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: Maxed out honors where possible. APs (all 5s): APUSH, Chem, Calc BC, Lit.  Self-studied a 4 on AP Bio freshman year.
* Senior Year APs: Physics C, CSA, Lang, Stats.

**Standardized Testing**

*List the highest scores earned and all scores that were reported.*

* SAT I: 1530 (740RW, 790M) \[I did end up getting/submitting a 1570(770 RW, 800M) on the Nov SAT but don't know if that counted\]
* ACT: None
* Other (ex. IELTS, TOEFL, etc.): None

**Extracurriculars/Activities**

*List all extracurricular involvements, including leadership roles, time commitments, major achievements, etc.*

1. Paid research internship at Beth Israel through Dana Farber/Harvard Cancer Center. Did some dry-lab stuff. (Happy to talk more if you're interested)
2. Director and tutor at a non-profit with 100+ volunteers. Had 450+ hours tutoring plus ran some in-person events. This was a huge commitment of mine.
3. Science Research Club founder and co-president. Built my own projects (qualified for state fair but didn't win anything) and helped organize others' projects. Also got some guest speakers to come talk to us about their research/work.
4. Civil air patrol + state rep for squadron. Had lots of leadership within my squadron and led color guard and STEM competitions (model rocketry and cyber stuff). Helped organize some state-wide events. \[*If you don't know what CAP is, it's technically the ""auxiliary of the Air Force,"" but think of it like boy scouts but more military and aviation focused.*\]
5. Encampment Training NCO. Taught 116 cadets aerospace, character development, and leadership for a week. \[*This is part of CAP. Encampment is like ""bootcamp"" but less intense and only for 1 week. You spend a week on a military base and get immersed into military culture/customs. I attended encampment 2021, then staffed it 2022.*\]
6. Science NHS. Was elected co-president of my school's chapter for senior year. We have \~75 members and I basically co-planned events/volunteering opportunities.
7. Math teams. I'm part of our school's varsity math team and my regional ARML team. We compete a bunch and I help younger students. I qualified for our school's ""state"" team twice (basically the top 6-8 scorers in the county-level competitions at my school). Unfortunately, I've never made AIME :(.
8. Student pilot. Pretty self explanatory. I fly and try to have as many takeoffs as landings. Had about 60 hours at the time of applications.
9. Family restaurant. Been working since I was 11 and took on \~40 hour/week during covid and summers. I do just about everything but cook.
10. Amateur Tinkerer. Talked about some of my projects and hackathon participation. Nothing too big and nothing particularly notable. Just something I do for fun. (Happy to talk about this more if you'd like).

**Awards/Honors**

*List all awards and honors submitted on your application.*

1. Scholastic National Gold Medal
2. 10th Place State Math Olympiad
3. Individual placements on 2 college-hosted math competitions
4. AFROTC+ROTC Scholarships
5. 2 Smaller Hackathons with 40-50 participants each.

**Letters of Recommendation**

(*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*

AP Chemistry. I loved the class but was a touch hyper in it. I did well but there was a kid doing USNCO in the class so I was definitely not the best. According to my guidance counselor though, she writes good recs though and she knows a lot about my research stuff so 8/10.

AP Lit. I won the scholastic medal while in her class and she actually started a short-story unit after the AP exams for that (I'd won in the flash fiction category). She was also the mom of a soccer teammate of mine so I'm sure the rec was at least OK. However, I'd say that I was a lot closer to the science department than the English department as a whole so I'd guess that my AP Chem one would have been better. 7/10.

**Interviews**

(*Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)*

I talked too quickly during my Duke interview and really could've done a lot better. I'd say it was OK but not outstanding 7/10.

I ended up doing a lot of interviews this year (I think 7) so I'm a little disappointed my Duke one didn't go too well.

**Essays**

(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*

Aha. Essays. I stayed up until like 2AM on halloween writing essays for all my EA/ED schools. Duke's essays took from September and I ended up picking the community and best academic activity essays for my supps. The community one was copy/pasted from USC's version of the prompt just swapping USC for Duke. (BTW, all schools' supps should be like USC. Maybe its just the wording of their prompts but their essays were so easy to write.) I talked about food and a CAP potluck.  7.5/10

The best academic activity was written about my internship and I somehow turned the conclusion into a diversity essay. 2AM brain is very interesting. 7/10

My ""why duke"" essay touched on my tinkering and connected my past endeavors to what I hoped to do in Duke. I also mentioned wanting to be part of the gardening community there to really tie in my main common app essay. I feel the structure is a bit boring but the content is there. 7/10

My personal statement was the only one I paid to have reviewed (shoutout to bettercollegeapps) and I basically talk about learning to ask for help through gardening with my dad. I tied in a little bit of engineering (built an aquaponics system) and thought I used a little bit of well-placed humor. Overall, pretty proud of it. 8/10

As for the rest of the essays, I'd say my USC essays were 7.5-8/10 and all other essays were like 6/10. I'm not creative enough to use 100 words to write meaningful, non-cookie cutter essays.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* Duke ED (committed)
* Kettering (rolling)
* Milwaukee School of Engineering (rolling)

*Other (For my fellow service academy people!)*

*Withdrawn applications*

* USC
* UIUC
* UMass Amherst
* Purdue
* Northeastern

**Additional Information:**

I tried my best to get some sort of theme going throughout my application despite having a lot of things that don't really connect too much. I tried to use my essays to demonstrate that every one of my activities does sort of follow that STEM/engineering spike.

I guess my biggest advice is to be enthusiastic. Sayings like ""Dont do things for the sake of college apps"" is overdone and isn't stopping anyone from doing just that (heck, over half of my ECs were done just for college apps.) But, once you choose to start something, regardless of why you started it, find something that makes you excited about it. That thing or that group will make you far more motivated to do more and do better and be more innovative/creative/positive than college apps. Others pick up on that energy and it'll lead to better things and more opportunities.

I don't think my profile is nearly as strong as those I've seen on reddit or even those I've seen irl. I feel like most of my profile are things that most people can do really realistically so I hope that this gives people some hope!"
zwk91v,1,2022-12-27,Question on Recommender,giraffe_wont_limbo,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/zwk91v/question_on_recommender/,"I have a big problem on overthinking things and my latest overthink is who to choose for my SULI internship recommender. 

I already have a solid first recommender, but I have two professors I could ask for my second recommender, neither of which I know super well honestly. The first recommender used to work at a DOE lab, which I think might carry some weight considering SULI internships are at DOE labs. Also, I met with her seperately and we had a good converstaion about my major, so she knows who I am. 

The second recommender I also met with to discuss my major, but I feel like he knows me less well. Regardless, his class was a lot more itneractive (the previous professor taught a lecture course on circuits). In this class, we had case studies and projects that would give him stuff to talk about my academic merits, and I'm worried that the circuits professor wouldn't have as much info to draw upon. 

I am sending both of them my transcript, resume, and a few details about my past summer and things to include.

Does anyone have advice? I need to decide soon because I am already cutting this close with the deadline. Sorry for the long post!"

I graduated in Economics ( Management ) with full marks and I speak fluently enough French, English and Italian, moreover I'm learning German since September.

I would like to keep working in the export field/market strategy sector, do you think that there are opportunities in Berlin for non-german speakers? It will be too difficult to find a starting job? (I'm ready to accept an internship too for the first months)

I’ve had this friend I met in middle school (we’re in collage now) and we’re pretty close, but I’m conflicted about many things about him. I’ve never discussed this with anyone because I feel like a bad friend airing dirty laundry like that, but he just does these things that piss me off so bad he jumps on opportunities to pull me down. And then at the same time he’s also uplifting and will suddenly like me, I really don’t get it? I don’t know how to feel? Stay away? Give him the benefit of the doubt? I’m so confused.

Examples:

We’re in a large group setting having dinner together where I announced that I’d be taking a gap year after completing undergrad (we’re graduating this year) because I want to get some experience under my belt first. And in front of everyone, these are people who aren’t even close to us he just yells on top of his lungs “failing your classes isn’t a bragging right” which confused me because how’s that related, you know my grades you know I’m not failing and if that’s a joke where’s the funny part? Everyone just went dead silent after that and it ruined my whole night.

Another example is how there were select positions for a very exclusive internship I was applying to and I found out from a close friend he went around telling all of our friends to not tell me about it and make sure I don’t find about it because he doesn’t want me to get in, I just find that very odd like why would you do that?

Am I overreacting are these just little things that friends do? There’s a tonne of more examples but what’s even more conflicting is the sudden switch up, he suddenly gets nice to me and it’s so random. I rly don’t get it lol 

Anyways thanks for reading this"

zwtoze,79,2022-12-27,ECE classes rated by usefulness for job search,s889702,Purdue,https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/comments/zwtoze/ece_classes_rated_by_usefulness_for_job_search/,"I have no internship experience and landed a FAANG level job as a hardware engineer. Here's a list of classes I took and how useful they were towards my job search. I am compE and the HWE I refer to here is digital design/verilog and not EE. Commentary is based on personal opinion of SWE/HWE career path, I have nothing against the classes or the professors (other than Bob Givan). 

FYE:

CS159 - Intro level C, extremely important for everything down the line, take it seriously.

MAxxx (Calc) - Some concepts are used in later classes, if you passed you are fine.

Everything else like Chem, Phys, Bio, ENGR, ENGL whatever is BS

ECE:

ECE 20001/2: Intro concepts, some are pretty important to understand as a hardware engineer, rest is BS. If you plan on doing software this is completely useless. Unnecessarily hard imo. I found these classes to be a waste of my time.

ECE 264: Follow up of CS159, very important, take it seriously. If you do not fully understand this class it will make your life much harder in ECE 368. Easy with Lu.

ECE 20875: Very important, Python is used in hardware to generate test benches, overall very useful language. I use python the most for personal projects. Easy with David I.

ECE 270: Fundamentals of digital design, extremely important if you want do become a hardware engineer. Good to know as SWE as well. Great lectures with Rick.

ECE 362: Embedded C programming, this is a important build up for your senior design project if you take ECE 477. Most groups use the STM32 used in 362 one way or another in their projects. You can also pursue a career of embedded programming based on this class. Start your labs ahead of time or you will not finish. Medium difficulty with Rick, but consumes too much time.

ECE 368: You will 100% be asked about data structures in any programming related job interviews. You will need to learn these concepts one way or another. As SWE this is your bread and butter. Hard and time consuming, depends on number of PAs they decide to give out.

ECE 369: Complete BS with Givan, I'm happy he's no longer teaching it. Very easy A with Milind. Introduces some cool logical concepts, personally did not find very useful for the purpose of job search.

ECE 301: Useless math BS, unnecessarily hard.

ECE 302: Better than 301, still BS.

ECE 337: You have to take this class if you want to do hardware. Medium difficulty with Johnson, very time consuming. Many interview questions based on this class.

ECE 437: You have to take this class if you want to do hardware. Very hard and time consuming with Vijay. Tons of interview questions based on this class.

ECE 39595 (C++): C++, and object oriented programming is the bread and butter for design verification roles in hardware, these roles are also typically offered to new grads. You should take this classes and build a good understanding of OOP concepts, this puts you ahead of others who has only taken 337/437. Also easy A.

ECE 477: Senior design, wasn't super hard, basically a bigger version of 362 project for us. Time consuming. Great experience if you want to build a career in embedded.

ECE 570: Great if you want to do AI, good python exercise. Rumored to be one of the easiest grad level ECE course. Most get A/B.

ECE 29401/39401/49401: Total BS, Free A

GPA Booster Electives:

CSR 342: Took it online during summer, entire course is on quizlet. Free A.

COM 320: Go to class, free A.

EAPS 106: Watch movies, free A.

HIST 152: If you know high school level US history, easy A

Overall importance:

HWE: Digital Design (270, 337, 437) &gt; Programming (264, 368, 39595) &gt; else

SWE: Programming &gt; else

&amp;#x200B;

No matter what, you will need to do quite some studying by yourself for job interviews. However, having a strong understanding of these classes will put you ahead by a mile."

&gt;**thank-you letter:**  Wrote about my dad. He cried after reading it and my dad never cries so 10/10 essay (?)  
&gt;  
&gt;**why major: (7/10)** Talked about my high school’s shit architecture —&gt; transitioned into how the shit architecture fostered my love of STEM and fit for Penn SEAS  
&gt;  
&gt;**why penn: (7/10)**

I worked on my personal statement and DMD major essay on and off during the summer. Didn’t touch college apps again until a week before the early deadline to finish all my UPenn supplements.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* **UPenn DMD** (Digital Media Design) (ED)

**Additional Information:**

For Activity #3 I became very involved in *\[insert social issue\]* all 4 years and did p cool things related to it (spoke on live radio, interviewed by national broadcast system, published a book, won awards, etc). I mentioned it briefly in my personal statement.

Honestly, I had no idea what to study until the second half of junior year. For some time, I settled on architecture because my bs logic told me art + STEM = architecture (?) so I created a whole club and ran it until I realized that I can't visualize buildings. I never had ambitions to become the next zaha hadid or anything but the extent of my spatial design ability = minecraft houses which is a bit tragic.

I have a lot of variety in my activities list, but my cs extracurriculars were definitely a bit lacking for a cs applicant. No olympiads, no DE, no major internships, zero research. I think what carried me to the finish line was genuine passion for all my ECs and the way I made them relevant to my studies in my essays, even if they weren't directly related to my major. I'm terrible at giving advice but if I had to give one: do what you love. This'll make me sound dumb but for a while, I avoided cs because some dude managed to convince me when I was a freshman that I won’t get into a good school if I pursued cs (due to competition). Don't put too much weight on others' words (especially y'all in r/chanceme) and shoot your shot.

My passions have always been comp sci &amp; art. The fact that (after years of clownery) I get to pursue a BSE degree in at an ivy institution studying the two things I enjoy the most is pretty sick B)

PM me for any details/questions, any way I can help! I actually found out about upenn dmd through reddit (HAHA) and am more than willing to pay it forward :)"
zwweou,8,2022-12-27,How do I get past my fear of interviews,Chefmike101,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/zwweou/how_do_i_get_past_my_fear_of_interviews/,"I feel like I definitely let my fear of failure hold me back especially when it comes to interviews. To start I already get test anxiety while in school. If there's a question on the exam that I haven't seen before or don't know the answer to I internally freak out mainly bc I don't want to fail. So just thinking about these interviews I will have to do scares me since you don't know what coding questions they will ask you to solve. How do I get over this fear? I tend to do well at everything I set my mind to but when it comes to SWE interviews with timed coding assessments and being put on the spot, I just don't know how I'll ever be 100% prepared for them. I've applied to companies that have sent me coding assessments right away that I had to complete within a few days of receiving them and it gives me crippling anxiety. I'd go to start the assessment and would instantly not know how to solve the problem, my mind would go blank and I'd freeze up. Now I'm terrified to even apply. I wish they could just look at all the projects I've done and the code I've written to determine if I'm a good fit for the position. This has just been weighing on my mind lately bc I obviously want to land a good job but it's just the interview process freaks me out. I have a great resume with internship experience and a 3.9 GPA but if I can't do well on the coding assessments my experience and GPA don't mean anything."

I am proficient in Java, Python, C, and web design. Do you guys have any ideas for projects that can utilize those skills?   


 I'm also open to learning new things to get a project done. Anything helps, thanks."

* Other (ex. IELTS, TOEFL, etc.): None

**Extracurriculars/Activities**

*List all extracurricular involvements, including leadership roles, time commitments, major achievements, etc.*

1. Research internship at T20. Spent the entirety of my junior and senior year summers working on this. Not a program or anything, just cold emailed with a project proposal and got offered access to the lab under supervision from my mentor. Submitted the project report, dozens of essays, loads of documentation, and multiple letters of recommendation to the most prestigious science competition in the US. Results come out Jan 10. Also co-authored a report on a separate project under third iteration for publication in a journal with a 19.32 impact rating.
2. Leadership role on a mayoral campaign team. Led several efforts but mainly fundraising. Campaign broke a bunch of fundraising records. Candidate ended up winning despite being a massive underdog.
3. Policy advocate for a local non-profit. The issue was related to my research. Spoke as a youth representative before city council advocating in favor for  piece of legislation that the council voted unanimously in favor of. Ended up getting passed on a federal level a couple months later.
4. Represent 20k+ minors as policy advisor in my city's youth advisory council. Basically organize events with community leaders and submit policy proposals to the city council.
5. Created a blog that evaluates policy in my city.
6. Vice President of my school's student council
7. I was a competitive athlete in an independent sport (not a team sport and not a recruited sport in most colleges).
8. Founder and president of my school's game theory club
9. President of my school's investment club
10. Playing music. I play two instruments. I founded a band and I played the national anthem at national sporting events' opening ceremonies and stuff like that. Also did some piano competitions.

**Awards/Honors**

*List all awards and honors submitted on your application.*

1. Regional champion and a bunch of sponsorships regarding my sport
2. Certificate recognizing outstanding national achievement in my sport
3. I was the youngest ever feature in my middle school's alumni spotlight newsletter
4. Won 1st place in an international piano competition. Played a solo at Carnegie hall.
5. Won 1st in a different international piano competition.

**Letters of Recommendation**

(*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*

Chemistry teacher. He recommended me for other stuff. I excelled in his class and we had a good relationship. 7/10.

Precalc Honors teacher. She advises one of my clubs and we have a solid relationship. 7/10.

My research mentor. He said he had mentored 200+ students and would rank me top among all of them, and even claimed that my work was better than some of his PhD students. He is super distinguished in his field so I was very grateful to get a letter from him. 10/10

My city's mayor. I worked very closely with him and was one of his first campaign team members. He was student body president at Harvard and I might apply there as well so maybe his letter would carry more weight there. Didn't actually submit this to Stanford, since they only allow one optional LOR. 9.5/10

**Interviews**

(*Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)*

Thought my Stanford interview went pretty well. I prepared extensively but everything flowed naturally and I felt it was pretty well received. 9/10.

**Essays**

(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*

Personal statement: Started the writing process several months before I submitted it. Worked with multiple counselors to perfect it. Wrote about my experiences in science and how I want to translate them into informed policymaking. It was definitely my best but I feel like rating it is just ignorant speculation because I have no idea how it is relative to other candidates. If I absolutely had to pick a rating I would say 8.5/10, but please take this with a huge grain of salt.

Stanford supplementals: Received a lot of guidance in the process. I was genuinely myself, and pretty much came off as a quirky nerd that loves science and policy. Again, impossible to rate but I would guess 9/10

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* None

*Deferrals:*

* None

*Rejections:*

* Stanford University

*Pending:*

* State schools
* 5 of the UC's
* Caltech
* Columbia
* Cornell
* Duke
* Harvard
* NYU
* Santa Clara
* UPenn
* USC
* Yale

**Additional Information:**

I tried hard to illustrate that I had a strong spike in policy, and I consistently wrote about my passion for the implementation of science in policy, which truly is deeply meaningful to me.

In reflection I can see that my academic profile is pretty below average for Stanford's desired range so that was probably a big black mark against my application. EC's were good but compared to other applications I don't think they were as strong.

It's a real shame. Stanford's been a dream of mine for a while and my family has sacrificed so much to give me the opportunities I've had. All my friends thought I had a decent shot but I didn't even get deferred which was a little humiliating for lack of a better word. But, then again, I wouldn't be surprised if there were at least 2k applicants that would benefit from a Stanford education more than I would, so if that is the case, I guess I can live with that.

I was pretty sad for a couple of hours, but there's nothing that I can do about it now, and I already wrote all my other supplementals so now it's just a matter of sending them in.

I had a solid social life in high school but I never did a lot of the typical things that high schoolers do. Instead, I spent most of my free time working in the hopes of attending a top school. I don't have any regrets and I've recognized that it's time to move on with my life."

**TL;DR: I’ve made some potentially bad choices that can't be undone, including giving up my dream job to be closer to home mid-covid. Now I'm entering middle age without a clear path forward and in a financially precarious spot. Looking for advice and fresh perspective from some folks who don't know me personally.** 

Throwaway account to be more candid. 

I had a pretty hard time in early adulthood, attributable to a mix of things, some of which I'm very much responsible for. Graduated undergrad (political science, not a great choice) mid-Recession. Couldn't do internships etc. because I didn't get a whole lot of help from family and had to work service jobs and take out student loans to get by. Since it’s a little relevant, I also have a lifelong struggle with chronic illnesses that aren't managed well, but I'm functional a lot of the time.

As a result of all of the above, I ended up wasting a lot of time in my 20s -- service industry, freelancing, small jobs, trying to figure things out. I had some good experiences during this period, but it took me so much longer to ""launch"" than it seemed to take other people. I'm proud that I was financially independent that whole time (by necessity, but still) and I also finished an arts masters degree in that time that I enjoyed. Still, I know I'm never going to get those key building years back.

Around 30 I finally got more serious about my life, got some internships after grad school and got an entry-level job in my dream field: working in media. I loved it even though it was financially catastrophic for me. I was good, too: after a couple of years I was able to parlay the entry-level job into a different role at a more prestigious company in another state. I moved away and spent a few years there, was really respected by colleagues and was promoted onto a prominent team. I loved what I did, even though I wasn't making any money at all. I figured, ""next job I'll get paid"" and it would all even out. 

Then the pandemic hit, and everything fell apart.

After more than a year of working remotely while living alone, I just couldn't handle the indefinite separation from my support system anymore. I got an offer from a government agency that would allow me to move back to my home state, but the price was that I'd have to leave my field. At the time, I almost didn't care. I was sad, but felt so lonely and broken after the never-ending quarantine, and like I could not bear to sit in that house for one more isolating day. I also was looking forward to having the government agency's gold-standard health insurance, for once. (Truly life-changing, by the way. Every American should experience this at least one time and maybe always.) 

I've been back in my previous state of residence for more than a year now. I'm passionate about this city and feel so blessed to be near the people I love every single day. But I don't like my job and it's also very low-paid and has no real opportunity to advance. Without being too specific, I work with attorneys in a client-facing, non-administrative role, but the job that I do is primarily regarded as a stepping stone for people who want to go to law school, which I \*very much\* do not. There's a big ""intern"" vibe w/ the way some staff treat people in my role, which is hurtful to me, and also a bit humiliating, given how hard I've worked in life so far. 

Anyway -- I'm struggling because I gave up my dream job for a variety of trade-offs, but I don't make enough money to support myself in this area and am really not enjoying what I do now. It feels far too late to go back to school, I'm burdened by student loans, and I'm not sure what I'd want to do anyway. I feel super sad about the end of a career that I excelled at and really loved — there’s no job locally for me in my previous field, but the money also never worked, regardless. 

I also just straight-up feel like everything I've ever chosen is wrong in some way. I've lost faith in my ability to make good decisions about the future.

A lot of these issues are 100% my own deal. I’m the first to say I fucked up. As someone who is not from a wealthy background, I absolutely \*should not\* have chosen courses of study that did not have a direct line to a lucrative career path, and maybe should have foregone college (and grad school!) until I could figure that out. I was stubborn about those choices at the time and take responsibility for them as mistakes. I also should have come to terms earlier with the notion that I could not really afford to do a ""passion"" career for any length of time, though I feel kinda lucky that I got to, for a while, because I know a lot of people don't. Perhaps I could have held out a little longer in the ""passion"" field, although it certainly did not feel that way at the time.

Anyway, I feel like this is unfocused, and definitely is the most personal thing I've written on the internet since like 2001, but the whole situation has been weighing on me, especially with the impending new year. Any thoughts on a way forward? I'm looking to move into a new field that will give me a good standard of living in a HCOL area, won't require too much additional schooling (or has some kind of cost-supported education), and won't require me to move, because I already found out that's a dealbreaker. Patient-facing health care is probably out because I'm immunocompromised myself. 

It'd be cool if this field or role wasn't too soulless and terrible but that's feeling more and more like a ""nice to have"" these days. 

I have a lot of skills that I think are valuable in the workplace, especially interviewing, negotiating, working with data, critical analysis, great ""soft""/people skills including handling very delicate conversations, research, comms stuff, dealing with emergencies and putting out fires, etc., but it feels a bit hard to sell them because my resume is all over the place. I’ve done some intro coding classes (Python and JavaScript) and enjoyed them; although I'm not proficient I probably could be if the effort seemed worth it. Not much STEM training otherwise.

Welcome your wisdom and inevitable judgment. "

The war in Ukraine started near our borders. I was so scared I would have to enroll and I would never see my family, friends and lover again. I still am afraid of it even if I've gotten used to the idea.

I've struggled to learn how to drive and I still get incredibly anxious about it everytime. I don't do well under situational stress. 

I had to leave for a whole month abroad for an internship. Time in which I felt so incredibly alone and my relationship deteriorated badly. 

When I returned my long-term relationship was in shambles due to a lot of tension and personal/mental health problems on both of our sides. 

I tried my best to fix it and show my partner how much I cared and loved them. But it was not enough. I lost my partner and my heart has been broken ever since. 

I've started therapy for the sake of my partner and have been continuing, but while it's helpful, I can't see my therapist as often as I want to/need to. I won't be seeing him for a month still and I feel like I am drowning everyday. 

This year has been the first time I've done self-harm and the first time I've been suicidal too. I still feel like that sometimes. And I'm so sad and hollow and I keep hurting everyone around me. 

I'm thinking of dropping out of law school. I used to be really good at it, but recently I feel like I can't do it anymore and that I will become a failure. Though, if I drop out I will be a failure none the less. 

My best friends are all going through very hard times and I can't help them. One of them is going through a hard break-up, others are feeling sick and depressed because of social life and I can't do much for them. 

My ex partner is in a tough mental place and they won't accept my help even though we still love each other a lot. 

I feel so hopeless for next year. If this year has been so bad how can I hope for life to get better?
I'm not even sure I will be alive in one year time in order to look back on this. 

I feel so abandoned, alone and anxious all the time. I feel ike I fucked up every aspect of my life. How do I go on from the worst year of my life? 

I just want my old life back. I want my ex partner. I want my determination and control back. I want to be myself again, not this hollow shell of a man. I don't want to cry my eyes out everyday anymore. I don't want to feel so helpless and small anymore.

I'm not sure for how long I will still be alive. But I hope that next year will be better for the people that I care about. At least they deserve to live better."

Myquals : 21 MCOM student

So firstly the reason for choosing Mcom is that , I couldn’t crack any management exams after bcom , simultaneously i have applied for Mcom as a backup in different colleges , as I didn’t want any drop in my studies, and i also got into a college, which is having a great brand name , i just got admitted.(for Mcom)

Now , this college is good in its way , they are more focused towards research aspect of postgraduation , and will be a great help for someone who wants to pursue academics further , but at this point I don’t want that.

1.
I am thinking of giving MBA exams again during the final year of Mcom , but i am feeling that , “what if I can’t get into any good college again “ “ even if i get in to some college, will it be anygood , coz i don’t have work experience , and i have completed one postgraduation .

2.
If i start to focus on the college and try for placement from here , 
First, there are good placements here , but not par with mba , and what’s extra did i get from this 2yr (always these things are going on in my mind)

I hve done my grad froma state government college , so I don’t have good exposure, I haven’t done internships and all , i felt like i should atleast do a internship from big4 companies, for CV spike , but i got to know that you can only get internship through references from there

**Letters of Recommendation**

Never asked anyone to see their Letters of Rec, so these are just relationships I had with them

College Counselor: Never felt like I had a real connection with her, most interaction felt like a business meeting rather than real human interaction. I'm guessing she asked some help with hers, probably talked with my regular scholar coach as I had a good relationship with her.

Math Teacher: She was cool, I was the overachiever in the class and was far ahead of everyone in Junior year, besides that I think we grew a small bond with her due to how much I helped the class whenever she was busy helping someone else.

History Teacher: Had her during the pandemic, honestly really unsure of what she wrote for me, but I definitely notable as one of the few people to talk with her about politics and stuff and really engage in the class.

EXTRA Internship Supervisor: I love her, she's such a good friend and I really expect her to have given me an amazing recommendation. 

**Interviews**

None 

**Essays**

*Personal Statement:* The topic of my personal statement was escapism and how I get myself lost in the world of technology. Basically just a cooler way of saying I'm a loser and I don't leave the house. I think the way I wrote and presented it really highlighted my personality and my writing skills. What's weird though is that my final draft wasn't too different from my first draft. Overall I'd say it's some of my best work. 

*The Unique UChicago Essay*: Mine was about creating a new measurement system - where I promptly talked about a new one fully based croutons (those yummy pieces of bread they put in salads) and went on a whole rant about how the metric system is way better than the American System of Measurement. While it was fun to write, I ran into a bunch of issues with writing it but I think the final product was good, but definitely could've used improvements- especially near the end. 

*The Why UChicago Essay*: This was a bit weak in my opinion, mainly just because I found it pretty boring to write, but I covered all the basics and I think I included all I wanted to include, just basic things about their academic strengths, diversity, etc. I'm sure it was good compared to others, but I really wanted to add my own spin to it.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* *ED1 UChicago (the one that mattered to me most, the rest are just safety schools)*
* EA Macalester
* EA Reed
* EA DePauw

*Rejections:*

* *None*

**Additional Information:**

I thought I had no chance. Apparently, no one at my school went to UChicago, either because they got rejected or chose somewhere else to be. That alone added a whole layer of stress and doubt. The other thing that added to that was just fact that I don't find myself to be that unique of a person and a pretty lazy one at that, I didn't even try to do well on the SAT. My ECs are lacking in my opinion and I thought that would've killed my chances but loe and behold. I'd say my essays were what really carried me, so if I were to give anyone advice it'd be to work on those as much as you can until you're 100% satisfied. Also, I didn't include anything about me being gay in my application, I didn't really do any research as to whether it really improves my odds or not but it seems it didn't change anything either way. I'm just really happy to be accepted, good luck to future applicants!"

zx6acw,1,2022-12-28,What should an M.tech graduate do to land a job?,No_Zucchini8528,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/zx6acw/what_should_an_mtech_graduate_do_to_land_a_job/,"I recently completed my M.Tech degree in Computer Science and Engineering. 

I have a working experience of 1 year after completing B.tech (CSE) but that's not relevant to my field of study. (Sales Associate at a corporate organization)

I am located in India and am open to work anywhere here or in the middle east but am unable to find any suitable position.

Vacancies  require an experience of 3-5 years in the same field and internships consider B.Tech grads over M.Tech grads.

I'm confused about what path I should be taking.

Any words of advice would be appreciated."

zx7o6u,1,2022-12-28,How do you keep the passion alive for the subject and industry?,1cluelessguy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/zx7o6u/how_do_you_keep_the_passion_alive_for_the_subject/,"I'm doing a CS Masters currently and I've kinda reached a point where I'm starting to feel a little aimless and run out of passion for this entire field.

I'm not particularly bad at anything, I'm doing ok in coursework in college but I'm also just slightly above mediocre. The amount of stuff that you often don't know or will never touch is just overwhelming but I think I'm handling it ok.

I have had coding internships in the real world, they actually went fine. Nothing particularly bad about the jobs or people.

So in theory everything is kinda fine.

The thing is...when talking to students/coworkers and discussing things, it doesn't feel nearly as exciting as it should be anymore.

I always felt very passionate about programming, technology and what have you in the past but I no longer feel the same spark of excitement. It's much more mundane, oftentimes confusing and tiring mixed with exasperation when talking with fellow students or colleagues in the field.

There are still interesting things that I like about it all, otherwise I wouldn't be doing any of it, but I think in some ways the childish spark of joy, curiosity and passion dimmed out. 

These days, I often catch myself reading up on random other topics and discussing other things that have nothing to do with any of it and feel guilty that I spent so little time on keeping up and reading about interesting things in the CS and IT world. In fact on many days, I just want to not do anything related to it.

The paradoxical thing is: I can get very passionate when discussing
the subject and industry with outsiders who know little about what we do. I can spend hours on end talking about it and people always say that I sound extremely smart and knowledgable about what I do.

Does anyone else also feel the same?

If so, how do you keep the drive to do what you do?

Are there tips on how you keep that childish spark of curiosity and passion alive?"

Hi. Ok so I got rejected again and this rejection was even more frustrating. This job only hires students that go to my college with my major.

I am fully available for their work hours. I have a 3.95 GPA which the hiring managers praised during the interview. I do not need any visa sponsorship. I have the technical skills they require. I have prior internship experience.

I think my interview answers are great. I always include examples in my answers. When I practice interviews, I am told those answers are great. I also ask good questions for the hiring managers. I do not know what I am doing wrong.

I think there are dozens of students like me. Maybe they care only hire 1. I wish they could hire all of us.Sheesh."

The intern class was less than 20 people and they rescinded all but 3 people so that kinda pisses me off that this late stage startup couldnt keep a few interns for one summer. The pay was high and it was a startup so i rejected my other offers to come here and now I feel sad that I dont have anything. Been recruiting since July, but now I have to keep doing it. Overall just be careful in this economy. Accept multiple offers and be extra careful when applying here in the future."
zxdl3r,3,2022-12-28,Trouble landing a job as a grad student - need advice,drumstix97,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zxdl3r/trouble_landing_a_job_as_a_grad_student_need/,"I got an MS in Media Management in May 2022 (3.76 GPA) &amp; prior to that got a BS in Marketing in June 2020 (3.0 GPA). 

I went right into grad school studies because there were barely any jobs available due to the pandemic. 

While I was getting my MS I did a Marketing Operations Internship for a startup but unfortunately they did not extend a job offer to me after the internship. 

Overall I have a huge lack of professional experience because for 6 years I was in school nonstop and did not get a job during that time because the work load was very heavy. Unfortunately now this lack of professional experience is becoming a huge determining factor in me not getting hired by employers. 

When asked about it in interviews I am honest and say that I did not work because I was in school full time, but this seems to make employers not interested in me. 

Am I doing the wrong thing by being honest?"

zxe792,9,2022-12-28,SWE Intern: Goldman Sachs vs. Citi vs. Walmart vs. Nutanix,RednazFR,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/zxe792/swe_intern_goldman_sachs_vs_citi_vs_walmart_vs/,"Currently have offers for all 4 of these companies, however I am having a very hard time deciding on which one to pick. Mainly looking for experience / resume name to get a better offer the following year, however I also want to consider the company for potential return offers. Any advice is really appreciated and please correct me if I put any wrong information :)

Goldman Sachs - Dallas, TX

* $43/h + 5k stipend
* 10 week program

**Analysis:** Good company name, and potentially good first step towards big tech the following year. Also better overall offer than Citi, however still a bank.... 

Citi - Dallas, TX

* $43/h + 2k stipend
* 10 week program

**Analysis:** Decent company name, and maybe also a good step towards big tech / fintech, however I don't know if the name is as good as Goldman Sachs, and offer is not as good overall. This is the internship I am the least considering out of the 4.

Walmart - Sunnyvale, CA

* $37/h 
* Housing and transportation included
* 10 week program

**Analysis:** Is Walmart a good company name? The global tech branch seems to be pretty decent, and location is much more interesting to me than Dallas + free housing/transportation. Working environment also seems to be more like tech companies rather than the other two banks. Return offers are also rather decent, however company name might not be as good as Goldman Sachs...

Nutanix - Remote (normally San Jose, CA)

* $45/h
* 12 week program

**Analysis:** Company name isn't super well known, however this is a tech focused company. Would be working as a core systems engineer within a cloud based software environment, thus probably much more interesting work than the other 3. Remote does not really bother me, but the name is what really worries me here. Return offers are very similar to Walmart, and would be in San Jose, CA

If anyone has experience with recruitment at big tech companies and can provide information as to which company would look best on resume for New Grad offers next year, please let me know as this is my main goal with this summer's internship.

zxef5y,12,2022-12-28,First project at intern is massive,RespondHour3530,learnpython,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/zxef5y/first_project_at_intern_is_massive/, Hi learnpython. I have not worked on any big projects and I am into AI. I have got an intern and I am supposed to make a project which is not so trivial. I have to use the MCTS(Monte Carlo Tree Search) algo and MCMC(Markov Chain Monte Carlo) methods. There is already one implementation of something similar on github but it is 2600 lines of Cython code and I am terrified by looking at that. I am interested in the mathematical aspect of this but I don't know how to go about the coding part with the little programming experience that I have.
zxf3oi,0,2022-12-28,Career Start Advice,5pet,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/zxf3oi/career_start_advice/,"Hi guys. I am 3rd year software engineering student. I feel kinda lost, I love everything about software and I find it difficult to find area to specialize(Fronted/backed/ai/ml etc). I want to start an internship but from these reasons I find it difficult to choose. In my uni I can choose to graduate with 3 or 4 years (4th year has only elective courses). So my question is:
Should I stay at uni one more year and try different things to find what really interests me or should I just graduate and get a random software engineering job/internship and get in the industry."

   Currently, Final year CSE undergrad 2023 batch in a tier 3 college placed in a WITCH with 7 LPA through campus (as you will get it by 7 LPA company). Willing to take efforts to get more pakage. I think I deserve a better place and offer but has self doubt has given some interview off campus with some startups and failed in some interviews but I think that skill can be improved (your suggestions are welcome) I have 500+ leetcode count although I know it's not a quantity game but quality here also any advice for beginners like me is welcome .

My question is how to proceed as I have 3 to 4 months ( Not any internships aligned and only has final year project in 8th semester as I am in ending of 7th semester ) to get at least 12 LPA base salary that, I think I deserve and willing to take efforts.

Your complete suggestions, resources,paths, anything you would like to share  are welcome! Experienced folks please reply..! As you are guiding to your younger brother!"
zxgdrb,1,2022-12-28,"High end work station build. Are there any incompatible, overpriced, or unnecessary parts?",Aeleonator,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/zxgdrb/high_end_work_station_build_are_there_any/,"###Build Help/Ready:

**Have you read the sidebar and [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/rules)? (Please do)**

Yes.

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

This will be the tool of my trade. I am a software engineering student. I want to use this computer for at least 5 years, hopefully longer, so I will be using this in my professional life after I graduate. If I get an internship this summer, then I might be using it professionally much sooner. 

50% software development. I will be taking image processing, machine learning, and computer vision classes after the summer. I expect some of my remaining classes to have bigger projects, so compile speed is a high priority for this build. I also need to do a decent amount of file compression so I can transfer projects between my home computer and the university's computers.

25% watching video content using madvr. In this new build, I hope to upscale from 1080p sources to 4k, mostly for anime as that is normally 1080p.

Less than 20% gaming. This year was very busy and the next one will be even worse so I expect my gaming time to remain minimal. In the last 3 months, I have played maybe 20 hours of video games.

The remaining is normal stuff like web surfing, YouTube, etc.

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, framerate, game settings)**

I don't expect to game much but when I do, I want the best I can get. Hoping for 4k at min 60Hz; higher fps, ideally 120Hz, is better. I play mostly indie and/or single player games these days. For competitive multiplayer games, 1440p at 144hz minimum but I am willing to turn down graphics settings in this situation.

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

Ideally $4000 CAD before taxes, not counting the monitor(s). Willing to go up to $5000 CAD. 

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

Canada

**Post a draft of your potential build here (specific parts please). [Consider formatting your parts list.](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/pcpp) Don't ask to be spoonfed a build (read the rules!)**.

**Provide any additional details you wish below.**

I am buying right now to take advantage of the deals. I will not be buying the graphics card right now because I didn't see any good deals or availability. I am also waiting on OLED monitors so even if I were to buy a good graphics card, I can't really use it. I am leaning towards the 4090 but since I won't be buying it right now, you can skip the gpu in the build review. I have budgeted $2500 for the gpu. Anything left over can go into the monitors.

1. I will be dual booting windows and linux. The 1TB ssd is of OSs and the 2TB is for general use. I know I can save some money by getting a 2TB 970 evo plus. I will make the final decision when I buy, but for now let's stick to the 980 pro.

2. The NAS HDD was chosen because it is cheap at $100. I don't really need any NAS features. If there is a cheaper option, let me know. 

3. I have no idea about the case. I chose it because it looks ok and memory express has it. I want to also try water cooling so I went with a big one. I'll overclock once I have a custom loop set up. 

4. The cpu and cooler come as a bundle at $950. If there is a better option let me know. The cooler is one place where my knowledge is lacking. Would it be better to buy an air cooler for now until I have the water cooling set up in maybe 6 months?

5. Same with the motherboard. I think I chose the correct one but I don't know if its right. Since I am going for a high end build, it makes no sense to go with a cheap one. I will also be trying my hand at overclocking, maybe in a year.

6. Waiting on an ATX 3.0 psu since my computer will consume a lot of power. I can only make the PSUs so big before I overload the electrical wiring. I am not sure if the current 1200W PSUs can handle the transient loads while the computer is overclocked and running a water cooling loop.



**NOTE: I have not yet compared prices between merchants. This post is mostly for rooting out bad or overpriced products, and mismatched components. Otherwise the build is almost within my budget. I will still take any saving I can get**"

I’ve been applying all of my fall semester, and despite having a number of projects, and trying to perfect my resume, I haven’t been hearing back much at all from the jobs I’ve been applying to.

My experience (dual engineering major in unrelated field and cs minor and a software internship) isn’t anything too impressive. 

Look, imma be honest. I’m a former LC monkey. I grinded that shit when I decided summer before senior year of college that I wanted to work in tech, up till now. And I’m a pretty charismatic person in interviews. If you give me a big tech interview (only applies to new grad positions obviously), there’s a good shot I’ll pass it. I’ve grinded LC for too long not to. It’s not a flex since I understand that I’m way under-experienced at everything else related to software engineering 

For that reason, I wound up with an offer at that banana company, despite having a below average background. But it got delayed by 6 months, so I gotta look for work in the meantime.

So to stand out, I was planning on mentioning it on job apps or to recruiters that I was delayed from this company and that I‘ve turned down the offer citing future economic uncertainty and worries about future layoffs at this place (I haven’t). Ethics aside, is it worth doing? I’ll be applying to local Fortune 500 companies most likely. I don’t have too much faith in my profile otherwise. My saving grace for the banana company and adjacent companies is that they’ll send OA’s to anyone with a pulse (when they’re hiring at least).

zxx9py,7,2022-12-29,I'm having an impossible time collaborating/getting peer interaction since covid. Still.,8Splendiferous8,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/zxx9py/im_having_an_impossible_time_collaboratinggetting/,"I started my MSc in Physics in 2019 or something (I've lost track of time. Who the hell even knows anymore.) In 2020, I landed a summer internship with a National Lab far away from my school. When March hit, the internship, which was supposed to be onsite, was moved online. Moving past how crushed I was, I tried to make the best of it. The work was very different from the work my PI does (He does computational nuclear physics. This group does more applied mathematics and numerical PDEs.) But I found it 100x more interesting than any of the physics research my school has to offer. (They specialize in nuclear, optics, astro, and biophysics. All not my favorite, tbh. But I didn't know enough/have alternatives at the time to realize that it wasn't interesting to me.)

On my way out the door, one of the members on the research group with whom I was working made the unfortunate decision to offer me the opportunity to work with him for my thesis research. Basically, we called a Zoom meeting with my PI where we asked him to do me the solid of being my PI on paper (since I need a PI at my actual physical school,) but my project would be more or less entirely overseen by this guy (we'll call him my mentor) online at the lab. He agreed, but he warned me that because this research has nothing to do with his research, he can only provide limited assistance, so if I ended up up shit creek, I'd be, well, up shit creek. I agreed to the terms, and I was over the moon excited about it.

The thing is, while I find my research fascinating, being completely cut off from anyone who has anything to do with it has really impeded my progress. Any time I get stuck, I'm stuck. If I can't get the answer through my mentor, I damn near can't get an answer. And I can tell my mentor's getting impatient about it, which makes it that much harder to understand his explanations (which are much harder to understand as he verbally spews symbols at me over Zoom without a whiteboard.)

It's not like I used to always have to run to my PI/supervising professor every time I had a question (I've been a part of a couple research projects in the past before starting grad school, including one with my current PI.) If I got stuck, I often found a way--a friend, a colleague, something--to get my answer, either through discussion or through a suggested resource. I find that relying on a single source for help is both limiting to my understanding (I learn by variety. Also, my supervisor doesn't always know the answer to my question; that's kinda the point of research.) and draining to my supervisor. And, I honestly haven't taken enough classes on the material in this current research to have sufficient background in it on my own. I'm certain that, had I made it into an environment where I was surrounded by people who were already knowledgable about this material, I probably would've been able to get up to speed relatively quickly. But I can only spend so long pining over what could have been before I have to put my big-girl pants on and write this thesis so I can move the hell on to the next stage of my life.

Oftentimes, these are simple questions, like, ""What's the term for this phenomenon/operator/process I'm doing so I know what to Google?"" But they take me ages to figure out because all I get from my friends focused on nuclear are shrugs. And I can tell my mentor is starting to think I'm stupid, and you know what? I'm at peace with that. I'd think I were stupid, too, if I had to hold my hand as much as he has. And I'm tired of explaining my angle to him. I just want to code up my final tests so I can finish already.

I guess my question is, say I have a question like, ""How do I make a higher-order forward-difference first derivative operator?"" or ""I'm not understanding how to perform Von Neumann phase analysis on higher-order RKs."" or ""Does anyone know anything about Perfectly Matched Layers?"" Is there any online forum anywhere where I can shoot the shit about math problems (like I used to do on a whiteboard with my friends in the Beforetime) with other people since I never befriended anyone in the lab where my research is headquartered so real-live physical people in my field are no longer available to me? Like, these aren't questions that exist in the vacuum of my lab group's research alone. These are relatively ubiquitous numerical problems. Someone out there knows something about my questions. But I can only absorb so much from reading. I need some amount of logical argumentation to orient my understanding. Is there anything of the nature that I'm describing, or am I SOL and doomed to continue brute forcing my way through this project for years indefinite?"

Im a long time lurker, and I decided to make this post now. A little about me, I am a 3rd year student at a respectable public university studying computer engineering with a current gpa of 3.89.

Lately I've been starting to think of what to do after college, whether it is to try my best to get a good placement in industry, or to go to graduate school (for a masters program specifically). There are pros and cons for both, and Im just not sure what to do, so I wanted to see if I can get some advice from others.

Pros:

\-I have heard time and time again that getting a masters degree will help put you ahead of the competition, especially for more competitive jobs. As a bonus, the average pay increase for people that have a masters is not miniscule.

\-It allows me to specialize in what I am interested in, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence. It also allows me to take classes that I would have taken if I was a cs major at my university (my university doesnt allow internal transfers into cs due to it being impacted).

\-Both my parents and a sibling have gone to graduate school. Both my parents have done exceptionally well in their careers, and they both highly recommend that I go to graduate school (to the point where they even have a graduate school fund setup for me).

\-I am a junior, and I still havent gotten an internship yet (currently at application 55 right now woo hoo!). This will most likely make me less desirable in the hiring pool after graduating and make it more difficult to get a job. Going to graduate school will give me more time to find something and possibly ride out the current recession and hiring freezes.

\-Its only 2 more years, right?

Cons:

\-2 more years of added stress from classes, exams, worries about failing, etc. I dont want to overstrain my mental health and well being. Sometimes I feel like I kind of want to take a break from school due to its stress culture.

\-Its 2 more years of basically unpaid work when I could be making money in industry.

\-I'd have to do alot of prep work for applying. Making connections with professors to get letters of recommendation, researching which schools I want to apply to, studying and taking the GRE, padding my extra curriculums as I currently am not part of any, etc. The only good part is that my GPA is excellent so I dont have to worry about that.

I feel like this shouldnt be that difficult of a decision, however I cant help be feel stressed, anxious, and worried about whats to come and whether I will make the right decision. Will I disappoint people if I choose one or the other, will I fry my brain with too much stress, will I be able to find a job if I decide not to go to graduate school, etc.

Any guidance is much appreciated. Thank you for taking your time in reading this!"

zy5pbr,0,2022-12-29,How do I improve/become better after years of living unhealthy and neglecting myself.,Tultras,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/zy5pbr/how_do_i_improvebecome_better_after_years_of/,"Hello everyone, hope you're doing well!

I really don't know how to start, or from where to give context, as there has been so much that i have been trying to overcome.

I'll put aside my childhood, and start from when I became an adult and entered med school. A few things happened in med school that left me mentally and emotionally battered. People that i really cared about which went through things such as S\*\*cide, as well as S\*\*ual abuse, as someone who had just started medical school, my will of helping people overcame my will to take care of myself, to this end I researched and studied s\*\*cide ( academically as well, My research paper was on the subject ), and tried to study everything i could on abuse ( one of the resources that really helped with that was RAINN ).

Shortly, still in early med school, I wound up in a toxic and abusive relationship and ended up involving myself in drugs ( weed ), Things became so bad that I ended up finding myself contemplating self harm and ending things myself, but for whatever reason I didn't go through.

After years of my ex coming and going from my life as she pleased ( and of course i exhibited no control or boundaries to help myself ), she left me. That was the close of that chapter but my drug addiction was still at play. Infact, I spent the last 2 years of med school getting high every day. Post med school, in my internship year as a doctor under supervision, the drugs got cut down ( as my internship year was in 2020, the start of the global pandemic, which was traumatic on its own for obvious reasons ), but I was still getting high on my off time, when not on duty.

After my internship year, everything was so bubbled inside that I gave up, and while I didn't contemplate ending things, what i did was just get high. Every day. Day after day, I would just get stoned. I would try to fight it, and tell myself that I'm going to quit ( while being stoned ), but go back to getting stoned the next day. I thought that would be it, that'd be my life, unable to pick myself up and wounding stoned and alone and eventually passing away. I had a hobby which presented me with the opportunity to work very little, and make a lot of money. So financially, my addiction wasn't creating any problems, but in every way apart from financially, I was a shell.

This cycle continued for a year and a half, during which I met some amazing people, who helped me to open up to them, and i gradually became better in my communication styles and being open about my feelings. However, that didn't help much towards self-improvement on getting my shit together.

**Improvement arc**:

Finally, early-mid this year, I snapped. After years of being addicted and helpless, Something inside of me reversed, like a switch. It may not have been as abrupt as that, but I decided I want out, that I want better. So I went **cold turkey**, It has been around 7 months since I have had a joint. On the eve of a close friends S\*\*cide anniversary ( anniversary might not be the right word ), I promised myself that i would keep moving forward, that I wouldn't go back. I started **therapy** ( of which it has been 5 months ), I started **working out** and it had been 3 months to that and unfortunately I'm not working out currently as there are a few things going in the family that have sapped my energy. I got my mind to focus on my career as being a doctor has been my dream ( ever since I walked in my clinical rotations, childcare has been my dream. ), and i start my post graduate residency in Pediatrics in a few days.

**Advice on how to improve and not regress:**

1: So here's the thing, Since a few months of stopping the drugs, I have been faced with a loss of personality, It feels like I'm not myself. I cherished myself in my capacity to be a sweet, kind and wholesome person ( as per peoples view, my personal view about myself is not that great considering the damage to my self esteem ). It feels like because of the things i went through, and because of the drugs, that i have no personality anymore. That I feel like a kind of shell ( albeit a positive shell where I can mold rather than a negative shell when I was just getting stoned ). How do I improve upon my personality, or rather, how do I find myself again?

2: Socials: As it goes, when you start drugs, your social circle starts to reform, you hang out with people who do the same drugs and you spend your time hanging out with them. This has been the case with me for a very long time. I have very few ( probably 1 or 2 ) friends who do not consume weed. One thing i will add, is that the friends I made who i used to get high with, and i still sit in their groups because they are amazing people and I'm genuinely grateful for having met them in my life. I do not seek to replace them. It's just that sitting in those circles where they all get high and i stay sober, there's a big discrepancy in social wavelength. I used to ( back when i didn't get high ) have a lot of friends who were sober, How do I improve on that aspect? How do i find people that I can hang out with and be social with where the center of the activity isn't getting high?

2: A few weeks ago, One of my parents had a raised blood marker and is currently being evaluated for cancer. This is obviously a very big deal and I genuinely feel scared. I feel scared that I'll regress and go back to old habits and I don't want to. I went through a lot of trauma and then a lot of helplessness as i felt powerless and it took me a long time to find the ability to regain control of myself. I want to avoid going back at any cost, Any advice on this will be highly appreciated.

I don't know how to TLDR this, for the people that took the time to read through it all, I very much appreciate it."
zy68h2,2,2022-12-29,Follow up AWS intern rejection,superpommes,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/zy68h2/follow_up_aws_intern_rejection/,"I applied for the role Professional Services Consultant intern in Munich, Germany few weeks ago, and I received a rejection mail this morning after I had an interview with AWS yesterday.

In the mail, it is stated that ""While we are not able to provide additional feedback or information about this decision, we would like to thank you for your time to take part in our recruitment process."" Despite this, it is important for me to know what went wrong with my performance in the interview, not only because I am interested in applying for other roles in the future, but also because this is my first time having an interview with a company.

So my question is, would it be appropriate if I still insist in sending an e-mail asking for feedback on my interview and reasons for rejection?

Another problem is, while I was contacted by one HR during the process of my application, the rejection mail was sent by the other recruiting coordinator (and it looks like canned response). If I were to send a follow up mail, should I directly reply to the rejection mail, or should I send the mail to the HR who contacted me?

My last question is, assumably I sent the follow up mail, but did not receive any response, is it appropriate that I connect with my interviewer on LinkedIn and politely ask for feedback?

Thank you in advance for reading this. This is my first time applying for an internship and could really use your advices."
zy6hja,7,2022-12-29,I ruptured my thumb tendon RIP,yoshis21,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/zy6hja/i_ruptured_my_thumb_tendon_rip/,"Hi!

**TLDR:** I had a recent EPL tendon rupture (the tendon that allows you to thumbs up) as a complication from a wrist fracture on my dominant hand. I have the choice to go through surgery combined with 6 weeks of PT (to get somewhat full range of motion (ROM) again by rewiring one of my index finger tendons to the EPL) or, deal with the decreased range of motion and get surgery in the near-future (most likely in the summer).

My quarter literally starts next week and getting an appointment for surgery will take at least two weeks. The entire process takes around 6-10 weeks, and usually patients can start to type after usually 3-4 weeks post surgery. However, as this is a tendon transfer that rewires one of the pointer finger tendons to the thumb (EPL), I will need to do physical therapy (around 6 weeks) to train both the thumb and index finger (I might need to relearn how to touch type lol). I'm guessing that this will be quite stressful for me with school (taking upper divs for the first time this quarter) but, will leave me better off in the future.

Now, with just sticking it through (for now) and getting the surgery done in the future, I believe that I can complete my winter and spring quarter as I can still type somewhat alright (avg. 95 wpm) with the limited mobility in my right hand (I never really used my thumb before). However, when working as a software engineer in the near or distant future (internships or after-grad), I really don't want to lower the lifespan of my hand by putting off surgery by almost 6 months. I think this can deteriorate the unused muscles around the thumb and make the PT part longer. Also, adapting to this over the months might make me not want me get the surgery, which I believe is still important in preserving my hand's lifespan.

Let me know what you guys think.

I'm currently leaning towards getting the surgery ASAP (suffer for now, and be alright for the rest of my life). But, I really don't want to go through the process of PT and getting another cast (I just took mine off for my wrist fracture two weeks ago). I also am adapting to decreased ROM quite well. For more context I can't really afford a medical leave of absence as I'm off campus and still need to pay my lease with my financial aid by being a full time student."

What is a reasonable raise to ask for?,Boneless_Blaine,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/zy710h/asking_for_a_raise_as_an_intern_in_swe_should_i/,"**TLDR**; I've been an intern at a company for a year now and I'm a crucial to the project I'm on. Do I ask for a raise even without another offer for leverage or do I stick it out until I get a FT offer?

I'm currently an undergrad in Computer Engineering and should graduate with my bachelors in less than a year. Just short of a year ago, I took an internship at a large defense contractor and I've been working here since. I was definitely not very good at my job at first because this is my first professional experience and I had very little practical software understanding.

 Since then, I've gained a lot of skills and I'm at the point where I can be given tasks unsupervised. I'm understanding architecture and design concepts, getting comfortable with the languages and relevant tools. I work on an R&amp;D project supported by 1 solutions architect, 1 mid/senior-level SWE, and 1 other intern. The SWE has his time split between 2-3 other projects and the other intern just took an indefinite leave of absence. I'm nearly solely responsible for the actual development that's happening on this project and I'm beginning to be an important part of the design, research, and architecture as well. If I left right now, this project would probably not make meaningful progress in terms of development for quite a while.

I'm starting to see this as a potential career, and it seems almost certain that they'll extend a full-time offer to me when I graduate. Unfortunately, my cost of living has skyrocketed in the last year for several reasons, inflation included, and I already live in an expensive city. I was hired on at $22/hr. and that's what I still make. I'm hesitant to ask for a raise because I feel like I don't really have that much negotiating power. I don't have a counter-offer for more money elsewhere, and I feel like that's the most compelling argument for a raise. If they said no, I'd still keep working there and I think they could guess that. 

So my question is, should I ask for a raise now based on my importance and the merit of my work, go get another offer and then ask, or just wait it out for a year until they offer me an FT position? In addition, what pay increase is reasonable to ask for? Is $26/hr. unreasonable? Any advice is appreciated, thank you."

1) Graduate with BA in CS by May 2024 w/ only a chance at a Spring 2024 internship prior to graduation.   


2) Graduate with BS in CS by Dec 2024 w/ a chance at a Spring, Summer, and Fall 2024 internship.

I have zero relevant CS experience and I plan on taking DS&amp;A in the summer so I can leverage my skills for the Spring 2024 internship cycle.

During COVID, I fell into a deep downward spiral and couldn't get myself to attend my classes or do any assignments. I essentially voluntary withdrew from all my classes three semesters in a row.   


In September we finally came back in person and somehow all my motivation was back, and my average for that semester was pretty decent. However, instead of graduating 1 semester from now, I am 4 semesters away. if I do a summer semester, thats May 2024 instead of May 2023.   


This is really stressing me out because I don't know how I'm going to explain this to my parents, who are hoping/expecting I'm graduating in a semester. Everytime I try to explain they insist I try to graduate ASAP.  


2020-2021 was a complete daze for me, it felt like my world was flipped upside down and I went schizo for a while. I haven't gotten any CS internships yet, so I'm trying to get one, even if it means I graduate  August 2024.   


This whole thing has been really stressing me out and dragging me down and I don't really know what to do. Any insight/advice would be deeply appreciated.

###Build Help/Ready:

**Have you read the sidebar and [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/rules)? (Please do)**

Yes

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

This will be the tool of my trade. I am a software engineering student. I want to use this computer for at least 5 years, hopefully longer, so I will be using this in my professional life after I graduate. If I get an internship this summer, then I might be using it professionally much sooner.

50% software development. I will be taking image processing, machine learning, and computer vision classes after the summer. I expect some of my remaining classes to have bigger projects, so compile speed is a high priority for this build. I also need to do a decent amount of file compression so I can transfer projects between my home computer and the university's computers.

(N/A until I get a GPU. See below) 25% watching video content using madvr. In this new build, I hope to upscale from 1080p sources to 4k, mostly for anime as that is normally 1080p.

(N/A until I get a GPU. See below) Less than 20% gaming. This year was very busy and the next one will be even worse so I expect my gaming time to remain minimal. In the last 3 months, I have played maybe 20 hours of video games.

The remaining is normal stuff like web surfing, YouTube, etc.

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, framerate, game settings)**

N/A.

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

$3000 CAD, excluding GPU and PSU

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

Canada

Replaced the motherboard with a cheaper option. I looked at both the A and P models of the board and went with the A for the better IO. I need BT 5.2 for my headphones so I can't go with the cheaper, no wifi variant.

Changed the case to a slightly cheaper one, and opted to get the water cooling now instead of buying a CPU cooler and then upgrading later. 

As was recommended, I took another look at the Gamer's Nexus review of i9 13900k to compare it to 7950X. For my use case, the i9 has a slight edge.

Another recommendation was the 990 pro ssd. While it is better, it is also expensive and not something I need right now. It is also something that can be upgraded easily so I will stick with the 980 pros.

Purchase of GPU has been deferred. I don't need a GPU for compiling code, and my image processing and deep learning classes aren't until September. I also don't have a monitor yet that can take 
advantage of the new GPUs. So I will wait to see what comes out in the next few months before buying. In the meantime I will continue to use my gtx 970.

Same with the PSU. Since I am not buying the GPU yet, I can get by with my current PSU in the meantime. This way I can wait for the ATX 3.0 PSUs.

How's the RAM? MSI's website showed it is compatible with my board. The RAM is 6000 MHz but the board only supports 5600(JEDEC). It does support higher speeds 6200(OC), 6000(OC), 5800(OC), etc. I am assuming OC means overclocked RAM. Since 6000MHz is not supported at stock speeds, should I get a slower RAM?

Looks like I am within budget. Are there any recommendations that can make the build better? Any money saved means more for my GPU and monitor.

**NOTE: You do not have to follow this format, but please be sure to answer these questions. Please do not ask to simply be given a build. You are welcome to delete this section.**"
zyc3jt,19,2022-12-29,What do interns usually do?,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/zyc3jt/what_do_interns_usually_do/,"Hello, my daughter landed an internship last summer with a nearby engineering company. It was her first internship right out of high school. She did some cleaning, mopping, assisted in some testing, put some equipment together, did some modeling using Solid Works. It was an 8-week job and at the end she didn't have much to do so she taught herself Creo. Her expectations were high and she says she did not like the internship.

Now, she is in college studying Mechanical Engineering. The engineering company wants her to come back as an intern this coming summer. I try to encourage her but her expectations are so high on what she thinks she should be doing. She doesn't want to go back but I try to encourage her.

Any comments please."

Personally, it takes me way longer than the average CS student to complete assignments/projects. All though my transcript is great, it doesn’t take into account the work I put in and how much stress I had.


So ik UCI program is somewhat easier than UCB. This will give me more time to focus on securing internships and have a better social life. Also, all my lower division courses transfer, so I should graduate on time.

If I transfer to UCB I have to retake 3 intro CS classses which IMMEDIATELY puts me behind my peers. I might also have to retake some gen Ed courses(idk it’s difficult to tell with UCB)


In addition, I might graduate later, the courses are way harder, and idk based on my personal case if an internship will be harder to secure or not. (Cause I’m behind and will be focusing on catch up work instead of securing internships 


Even though UCB is my dream school, if I’m being realistic, idk if I will succeed there. I’m very intimidated and don’t want to fail out. I’d be fine with going to UCI too. But I’m really just stuck….

I used this to get my foot in the door. I’m making 64k, but not happy just based on a “I’m not a sales person” energy. I’m good at my job just not thrilled waking up to do it. I want to be more technical and get into a “real tech role” if that makes sense. I could move up at this company but I would have to be in sales for 2 more years before they let you move on to a different department. 

I got an offer for an IT Analyst summer internship! At a well known brand (not a tech company but a house hold name). It’s paid but it’s definitely less than what I’m making now. I think I would be happier in this role since it’s more technical and I THINK it would set me up for success in the future for other tech roles? Maybe? 

I just have hesitations since it’s an internship and I would have to quit my job to take it. Since it’s only a summer internship “with hopes to hire full time after I graduate school” I just get nervous.  

Do you have any thoughts/advice/ comments??

You know who you are. Realizing this list is only going to grow with everyone's inputs, and I'm hitting the 40'000 character reddit post limit. Any suggestions on how to get around this will also be super helpful. 

**Why this?**

I don't know if anyone else needs this but  I often find myself utterly confused by the acronyms used in every other sentence in every thread here. So I started collecting a list of acronyms and added to it every time I came across a new one (which still happens every time, by the way).

For each acronym:

* I looked up the **acronym definition** (e.g. LAC - Licensed associate counselor / licensed addiction counselor / Looked-after children - UK)
* Copied and/or **wrote a short description** enough for me to understand the terms on a very superficial ""high-level"" (e.g. LAC can refer to a few things. In the US, mainly refers either licensed associate counselor OR licensed addiction counselor in some states. Could refer to children in public care who are placed with foster carers, in residential homes or with parents or other relatives in the UK.)
* **Saved a decent source-link** for later reference, a good habit from my 10 years as an academic researcher. (e.g. [iow.gov.uk](https://www.iow.gov.uk/Council/OtherServices/Looked-After-Children/What-is-a-Looked-After-Child#:~:text='Looked%20after%20children'%20(LAC,a%20temporary%20or%20permanent%20capacity.)))

So I'm sharing this in case this is helpful to one other person here.

**How this is structured**

The list is structured in the following way:

1. 👀 **Acronym - Full Name list** 👀 (for a quick reference to the acronym only)
2. 📚 **Definitions &amp; Sources** 📚 of the same list (for more context than the expanded acronym definition)

**Disclaimer**

**I do not claim to have all the most accurate definitions** so anyone spotting clearly wrong or inaccurate information should comment or reach out via DM so we leverage everyone's eyes and minds here to make this as accurate as possible over time.

**This is also not meant to be fully comprehensive** (as it is simply not possible). But please also point out any obviously missing terms so they can be added to the list.

Happy also to hear any **suggestions on how to improve this** moving forward.

Also **there will likely be typos and the occasional silly human error** here or there. Let me know if you spot any.

I got a job offered at a medium-sized company as a software engineer, I have been working there since last May as an intern. They are willing to give me a full-time role while I am back for school this January until graduation which is \~1.5 years from now. I could theoretically manage the work-load and work while I am going to school.

I was a duel enrollment student back in high school at a community college so I already have a lot of credits coming into university. However, I feel that if I continue to work then it could limits my ability to take more advanced classes such as computer graphics, compilers and Real time OS that are very heavy. What do you guys  , should I gain more experiences from working ? or should I maybe stop and focus more on school because I am taking 3 heavy cs classes per term?

For context, the position mainly deal with developments in  SQL, C#, .NET, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Angular for in-house application. The pay is 67k per years."

&amp;#x200B;

Some advice for those still looking, theres the cliche 'just keep pushing champ', which I hate that that is all that some can say, but truly do try to stay motivated. For me, what really helped was that I managed to make a connection with my interviewer, who will be my supervisor (which makes me think it wasn't just in my head), during the initial half hour. It was really tiny, he read my resume, saw I had studied math, his eyes lit up and there was a brief moment of 'this guy knows whats up'. It was notable enough that I actually journaled about it that evening, so I like to think it helped. Your interviewers are human (some just as flawed as you, which you'll notice as you do more and more), so making a connection will help them remember you, and increase your chances of a call back."

zyt4bn,0,2022-12-30,I love what I'm doing right now in the classes that I'm taking - how do I find out which specific field I want to end up in and hone my skills?,Laymayo,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/zyt4bn/i_love_what_im_doing_right_now_in_the_classes/,"Brief background for context: I started my school year (in university) as a Poli Sci major. I had to take an intro to computer science class to fulfill a graduation requirement, but I ended up falling in love with the class and switching to Software Engineering as my major. Personally what I find awesome about learning how to code (Python) is that I'm constantly learning new stuff and I can literally be an artist with this stuff - I can have an idea, go on the Internet and learn the working parts, and then produce something entirely of my own. I have definitely dived (diven?) down way too many rabbit holes when working on projects, but I find these rabbit holes to be infinitely fascinating and when stuff ends up 'clicking' and I can work with this newfound knowledge - that feeling is awesome. This whole process is addicting - it's got me seeing the whole world in a different light. For example, I'm not a car guy by any stretch of the imagination, but the other day I did something really sick - I did an oil change on my car. I only mention this because the whole process felt very similar to coding in a lot of ways - here was a super complicated problem/task that I had to break down into its working parts and then insert myself as the engineer in order to effect a solution that I did *alone -* it feels awesome *doing a thing!* The personal satisfaction I get from repairing/creating something is definitely a huge factor in my loving what I'm doing right now. I think I want to start getting into the hardware side of computers  as well and am going to check out my school's robotics club when I return from break.

My problem right now is, I have historically had a problem of confusing something I'd love in theory to something I love in practicality (one example being me enrolling as Poli Sci, which was something I loved the *idea* of me loving - I hated it in reality/practicality). I am now looking for CS-related internships over the summer, and I find that I'm a bit overwhelmed with where I want to go. I find that I find so many aspects of coding/engineering *fascinating* that I can't really see an end goal right now - and a part of me doesn't want to pigeonhole myself into any one field, even though I know it'll have to happen eventually. I'm scared to make a decision here, frankly.

I only included that gargantuan background in hopes that maybe someone farther down the line has related to how I'm feeling right now and can impart some wisdom to me onto where to go from here. I'm trying to cast a super wide net for these internships I'm applying for over the summer, but I'm worried I'll freeze up if (in an ideal world) I have to make the inevitable choice of which internship to go with. I'm seeing programs for machine learning, AI, robotics, software engineering, etc. I'm leaning way more towards Software Engineering right now because it's what I'm doing and I *know* it's something I like, but I also feel that I would really like something in robotics...but then again, I've never touched a robot, so that seems silly to say, so I guess this boils down to FOMO.

Any advice? Thank you in advance!"

Seeking advice from you all since I have seen people getting great career advices from here.

I'm a 2021 mechanical engineering graduate from a tier 3 private college in South India. And I had worked for a few weeks in a spare parts manufacturing company in Chennai. I had to leave that place since other employees were blaming me for the mistakes they had done. This incident made me realize working in core sector is not what I like.

Currently, I'm 24 yrs old and unemployed, staying at home thinking about what to do next. I need to do something fast since my father has reached his late 50s and I'm ashamed to sit idle without helping him. I only have little knowledge about programming from what I have learned in college. I had tried to learn HTML through ""Freecodecamp"", but I'm losing my interest whenever I spend 3-4 hours learning it.

Recently, I took up a course from Udemy on ""Python by Colt steele"" since a lot of you guys recommended it to people who were budding programmers. I'm planning to complete it and at least learn Python rather than sitting idle without any skills.

It has become a *notion* these days that a person can only lead a good life if they have an IT job.

My doubts are:

Will companies provide training to me if I join any service based company?

Is there tech jobs that doesn't require hard programming languages and also has moderate job security?

Can I get internships with basic knowledge about Python?

What are some jobs other than tech related which pays handsomely in India?

I tried getting an internship for Ux design. Didn't work. So why major in it just to find out how hard it is ?? Or how difficult it is to get a job or a simple internship in it???

I tried getting an internship for cybersecurity....didnt work. 

I did get an IT internship but I learned nothing besides being a computer mule and running up and down the stairs setting up computers. Most of what I learned was on my own time...at home. 

How can I know what I want a career in and major for if I don't know what the actual job is like ???

zz60pp,1,2022-12-30,Im really scared to stay home alone with my uncle.,3sperr,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/zz60pp/im_really_scared_to_stay_home_alone_with_my_uncle/,"&amp;#x200B;

16M. Im currently living in my grandma's house right now for a bit.

My uncle has always been an asshole. Plus he's the only one of my grandma's children who doesnt have a real job. All he does is stay home and 'paint' so he can make money. Hes in his late 30s and still lives in his mom's house. He's the opposite of a role mode. He drinks, smokes, does weed and even when he was younger, he went to jail.

He annoys me so much. He keeps lecturing me that I'm on my pc all day, even though im a long distance runner and I definitely lose like at least 10x more calories than him, and I have way more outside activity than him. When he asks me to sweep the house, I get a bit vexed but I do it anyways. He gets mad that I get vexed, but do you really expect a teenager to love doing chores?

He's a person who can lose control sometimes. There's been multiple times where he lost control on my grandma in a rage because she annoyed him, and sometimes he breaks shit and when hes done, the living room has a shitload of glass shards. Its fucking terrifying. Then he cools down and I make sure to shut my room door.

But one thing that I wont forget, is what happened last week, or 2 weeks ago, when we were the only ones in the house. Once, I had to go to work(I was on an internship back then). I know he'd said I have to sweep the house again, so when he told me to sweep it, I said that I'll do it soon, but then I waited for when it's almost time for me to leave, which isnt that long from when he asked. Then I showered and he asked again and I said i gotta go soon. He really didnt like this, so he started getting passive aggressive, then he turned off the internet. He then says that all I do is stay on the computer all day and do nothing in the house. This one really made me upset because I'm literally doing long distance running, and it's not like theres anything else to do in the Christmas break. Like bro, am I supposed to go on business trips or something?. This also made me upset because hes criticizing me like this, when he literally doesnt do shit in the house and all he does is stay in his room like some sort of fat neek. He never went to college, doesnt have a job, literally the opposite of a role model, yet he shits on me like this.

I yelled at him and told him thats not all I do, and I have a lot of work to do on my laptop. Then I told him to turn the internet back on so I can tell my teacher something(but I just wanted to check reddit) then he got upset once again and said TELL ME WHEN YOU TELL HER, AND SHOW ME WHEN YOU DO SO I CAN TURN IT OFF. Then in my mind I was like ""bro wtf is wrong with this guy""

Main part of the post:

I told him that Im done, and then we started arguing. Then he decided to take things up and said ""LISTEN M8, DONT RAISE YOUR VOICE AT ME OR ILL DEAL WITH YOU LIKE A REAL MAN IN HERE. ONLY YOU AND I ARE HERE AND IM GONNA FUCK YOU UP"". This is when I started to get scared. Then ran out in a rage and started swearing. This is when hes gonna lose control again. He then put his hand and choked me for a bit, then shouted ""REMEMBER THAT ITS ONLY YOU AND I HERE, AND IM GONNA DEAL WITH YOU LIKE A REAL MAN. DONT PLAY WITH ME"" and then stormed off again, looking like he's going to get something.

I dont remember the exact words, but basically, he was going berserk and was in such a rage, but he looked like he legitimately kill me. He actually looked like he was going to grab something and beat the shit out of me. So I decided to take my shoes and sprint as fast as I can out of the house. My aunt and some of my cousins live only on the other block, which is like 20 seconds away. I sprinted there shitless and then I got to the gate so he couldnt reach me there. I was gasping for air and I was just glad I avoided that guy. Then 6 mins later, he came over there and said ""come back over"". Then I walked as fast as I can back to the house, then put on my shoes to go to work.

When I was almost gonna go on a bus, he apparently followed me and told me he's sorry. Obviously I dont want to forgive him, but he asked for forgiveness and I said yes(but in reality he can go fuck himself. I dont forgive him).

But today, we're in the same house again. Me and him alone. I'm honestly scared to death right now. Should I ask my aunt if I can spend the day at her house? She doesnt know the exact story, but she does know that something happened between me and him. That guy is just absolutely crazy. He's lost it on his own mom, breaking her glasses and shit and trashing stuff. I just dont know what to do. Im so scared man. Im a nice guy too. I havent even gotten detention in school in my whole life. Most people consider me as a kind person, and my friends said that ive been a good friend to them. I just got mad at my uncle because he keeps assuming stuff he doesnt know about me, even though he isnt any better himself.

So, should I go over my aunt's house for a few hours? I dont wanna live off them. She has a pretty nice home. The 2nd best house on that block, but idk if she has the money to feed another mouth. Id feel guilty. So im just gonna go over my aunt's house, then come back to my house get food, then go over again.

I'm still wondering what wouldve happened if I havent ran out of the house that morning. I dont think he wouldve killed me or anything, but I think something mightve happpened. He's not a bad guy or anything, but when that guy gets angry, everyone stays at least 30 feet away from him until he's done. He's a normal person(excluding his past, such as him being in jail once and him smoking, drinking and doing weed), but when he gets in a rage he's just a different guy.

Also, I didnt tell my mom since its already gone, and I dont want to make her worry or be in constant anxiety when she leaves the house. Only my grandma knows the full story. I never saw him the same way again. Even when hes nice, I just cant see him like that. Im scared to even go outside my room sometimes, and if hes in the kitchen, I stay away from the kitchen until hes done."

For context, I’m a second year. Which of these would you choose and would add the most value in future internships? I don’t want to lock myself into a company, as I want to just add valuable experience to my resume. Which company does this the most?

Returning SDE pays the most, then Snap, then Google.

I would heavily appreciate your thoughts.

Edit: not really prioritizing a return offer since I’m not a junior

zzbywo,0,2022-12-30,How to deal with a senior colleague who ignores your Slack messages?,Balantinova,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/zzbywo/how_to_deal_with_a_senior_colleague_who_ignores/,"Hi all, I think I need some advice for this-

I worked as an design intern in a mid-sized company in the Boston area and will return as a full-time employee soon. 

During my internship, I was paired with a senior project manager in a low priority project. After the first meeting, he has been showing low commitment to our communication. I had to send Slack messages 2-3 times to remind him to check on my work progress and ask for his thoughts, which he will just ignore or respond briefly after 3 days.

There was a time he missed a meeting in the early morning, apologized and rescheduled to the noon, and then missed it again, wasting my time for over 40 minutes being in the zoom call.

Towards the end the my internship, I gathered some market analysis to share it with him, which got no response as usual. Later on that day I shared it with another designer (without mentioning any of his unresponsiveness) and they encouraged me to share it to the public channel. After posting in the public channel, another two project managers responded immediately with their thoughts and suggestions, one of them @ that senior pm because obviously it is his domain of work. It was until then he replied to the thread in the public channel. Yet up till now he had not responded to any of my work progress/slack messages.

Overall I had a hard time communicating with him, I don’t know if he was just too busy or purposefully ignored my messages. 

I don’t want to play my diversity card though I am an Asian/Non-binary gay immigrant and he is a local married white male. But I did sense discomfort when working and talking to him remotely and in-person with his low responsiveness. Besides him I had a very good relationship with other colleagues.

I plan to talk to my manager first about it, but my friends suggest me directly reporting this to the HR team. What should I do in this case?

Thank you!"

I’d like to start applying for internships and was curious what are some steps to take to get ready for those internships? Seems like most of them want experience working on projects, how do you find projects to work on? What kind of things do they normally like to see on your resume? Any input is appreciated."

well alex found out about the story i posted on reddit and im not happy anymore im broken and not sure ill recover i never expected the story to generate so much buzz and attention and i didnt anticipate the range of reactions it would receive some people laughed some attack me and others just thought it was cool

i didnt mean to hurt alex or put our relationship on display like that i just wanted to share our story and hopefully inspire others to be themselves and find happiness but i didnt realize the consequences of my actions until it was too late

alex was angry and hurt when he found out about the story he felt like i had betrayed him and violated our privacy he couldnt understand why i would do something like that without consulting him first we had a huge fight and i didnt know if we would be able to recover

i was devastated and felt like i had lost everything i lost my internship my reputation was in tatters and i was worried about my future but most of all i was worried about losing alex he was the love of my life and i couldnt imagine a future without him

i tried to apologize and make things right but it seemed like it was too late i didnt know what to do or how to fix things i was lost and alone and i didnt know if i would ever find my way back to happiness

just when i thought things couldnt get any worse i received a call from a forgotten friend John he had a message for me and it was a message that would change everything he told me that there was more to my story than i realized and that there were people out there who were willing to help me uncover the truth (they read the story on reddit)

i didnt know who to trust or what to believe but i knew that i had to find out more i had to discover the secrets that had been hidden from me for so long i had to find out what really happened to me and to alex and i had to find out if there was any chance for us to be happy together again

not sure if i should share what happens next"

Everyone says the market is horrible, is that at hopeless as people make it seem, I have nothing else to fall back on and have barely any money left.",salthetender,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/zzejt5/feeling_overwhelmed_and_hopeless_as_a_28yearold/," 

Hey everyone,

I'm a 28-year-old college student working towards my CS degree, but I'm starting to feel really hopeless. I won't be able to finish my degree until spring 2025, and it feels like such a long time from now. I dont' want to get burnt out and start to fall behind, and I'm not sure how to stay motivated and focused. I'm starting to read so much about how bad it is going into CS right now and the market is horrible. I'm older so this is all I can fall back on and dedicate my time to. I'm reading so much that no one can secure a job or internship and that it's going to look rougher in the future, around when I graduate. I don't know what to do, I'm starting to let all the negativity get to me and even wonder why I'm doing this in the first place if I can't even get a job now if the market is so horrible. Like its getting pretty bad to my mental state, to where I really just want to give everything up and just be nothing.

 I also don't care at all about working at some big fancy FAANG-like company. I am literally ok with a low-paying job, I'll take as low as 40k and I live in California. I just seriously need a job and people are making it seem impossible to get any sort of job and its so depressing because it's not an easy job at all and you have to endure so much and dedicate so much of your life to be an engineer.

I'm reaching out to see if anyone has any advice or words of encouragement for a student in my position. How do you stay motivated when you have a long journey ahead and a lot of responsibilities to manage? Is the market that bad to where ill be doomed, I know no one really has the answer but I don't know much myself. Do you have any tips for balancing school, work, and other commitments? Any words of wisdom would be much appreciated.

Thanks in advance!"
zzep8d,15,2022-12-30,Received verbal offer from a big company with current layoffs that is also consolidating. How likely is it that I’m getting burned?,gamerVapeGod,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/zzep8d/received_verbal_offer_from_a_big_company_with/,"I really just want some closure on whether I'm actually getting hired or not. I interviewed at a very large company for an internship. Everyone was super nice and I really liked the team and the work they had for me. Almost 2 weeks after the last interview, an HR director called me extending a verbal offer and explaining that the recruiter was out sick until the new year. I told her I'd email her with my decision and she sent me an email outlining the pay, benefits, start date, manager, etc.. I accepted through email and was told the recruiter would email me an offer letter after she comes back from PTO in January. 


This company is in the news for layoffs (not FAANG though), and they're currently undergoing consolidation. They also went through a merger 1 or 2 years ago. Last time I got a verbal offer I only had to wait 2 days and the company was in a much more stable state so it's really nerve wracking to have to wait so long. I'm really nervous that the offer will get rescinded after new years because someone won't approve/budgets cuts/restructuring. Has anyone else had an experience like this and how did it turn out? What do you think is the most likely outcome here? The pay is low for a dev but relatively high for an intern it's under 100k but more than 50k. 

I'd really appreciate anything you could share that could help me figure out the most likely outcome here. I really need some closure to so I don't spend all of new years worrying about it."

1. How is the overall CS internship culture?

zzfamr,3,2022-12-30,Please respond thank you,NotAnAverageGuy69,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/zzfamr/please_respond_thank_you/,I recently lost a great opportunity to turn my internship into full time employment. The day I had my meet with HR and knew about my termination I did not feel anything for myself. I kept this news hidden from my mom and dad. They have been suportive about it but I cant meet their eyes. My friend who has been visiting a psychologist said I should visit as well. I dont whether I should or not.  I feel I deserve this pain because of my incompetence. I am not able to go home because of the same. Cant even talk to my dad who keeps aksong me about what I want to do next. Drinking is kind of relief but I dont want that. If I go to the psychologist what do I tell her?  Should I brute force tgrough this phase?  Any help is appreciated anything that will help me meet my parents and friends who have been with me through this.

I'm a current junior studying computer science and I would love to secure a software engineering or machine learning internship for the summer. The problem is, I don't think I have that much valuable information to put on my resume. I haven't really done any big projects and my coding skills aren't crazy good or anything.

I'm mainly looking to fine-tune my resume. I've gotten only two interviews so far, out of maybe 30 or so applications. I got some coding assessments, but the rest have either been no response or rejections.

I was wondering if anyone had any advice for what I should change or things I should consider adding to the resume to have a better chance at securing an internship. I would appreciate it!"

I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity and also got my SSCP (Systems Security Certified Practioner) and my eJPT (eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester) certifications. I have one year of internship experience as a software engineer and around five months of experience as a Network engineer. So, I have around 1.5 years of combined experience in total. Furthermore, for my final project for school, I also conducted a vulnerability assessment/penetration test on a real company. I would really like to start my own one-man penetration testing company/firm instead of working as a security analyst or penetration tester for another company. Will this be possible without having any real cybersecurity experience?"

I am a 25 year old guy trying to find a first job and I’m totally clueless on what to do or where to start. I was pursuing a information science degree out of pure passion for computers and 3 years into it, even though I still enjoy computers, I  realized it’s not something I want to do for the rest of my life. After some breakdowns and therapy for some underlying serious anxiety and other issues, I figured out I always wanted to be involved in the field of hospitality. And voila I decided to pursue a business administration degree in hospitality. 1.5 years into the degree, COVID happens and I realize how volatile the industry is. I anyways hustled and travelled to the US for my internship. Hands on experience gave me more realities. I do enjoy working with people, managing a team to solve issues, but again I don’t enjoy the hotel industry. This became more obvious when I was called into work on the day  of Hurricane Ian. That day still gives me nightmares  from seeing the things I dis did first hand. So, I definitely don’t think I want to be working in  the hotel industry, especially not after returning to India in a couple of weeks.   
I \*think\* I can work in a career path that gives me freedom of creativity and is not the same everyday.

 I never have an answer when someone asks me what I want to do. I have no idea where to start. I don’t even know if I’m good at anything, all I know is if I’m given a problem and a team of people, I can resolve the issue by bringing the team together. 

Any inputs or advice  on where to start or what to do will be greatly appreciated. I want to get out of this confused state of mind  and start somewhere ASAP.

 Thanks in advance!"

I’ve always had an entrepreneurial bone in my body and have always fantasized about startups being my life, and I have a good idea I'm passively working on.

Reason I’m posting is it feels like everybody measures success in CS by the prestige of their internships and jobs, and I know obviously there are people that ""make it"" by doing their own thing instead, but that almost feels like a mythical storyline.

Keep me real here—is founding a startup a realistic enough career goal that I should actively pursue it? Or would it be a waste of time that I should instead be spending on getting established in the industry?"

Need help deciding by tomorrow!",Throwmeawaythanks99,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zzp7nr/partner_thinks_im_too_good_for_the_entry_level/,"I've only had one minimum seasonal job working at a bakery. I graduated this year with a useless degree in interdisciplinary humanities/fine arts, albeit from a top school. I'm decent at traditional art, and I've spent the last few months trying to transition to digital design but I'm still not great in that area (the skills surprisingly do not overlap). Inaccessibility to mental health resources since graduating has also taken a huge toll.

I recently applied to a minimum wage internship teaching art. I need help deciding by tomorrow if my doubts for turning down this opportunity are valid.

Pros:

* It has 6 months paid training, they teach you how to teach art and this is a marketable skill
* Very part time (3.5 hours around 4 times a week), which will allow me to flesh out other skills and do other internships on the side
* I am passionate about fine arts and kids are fun to work with
* I have no skills or useful work experience and this is one of the few jobs that doesn't have any hard skill or prior experience requirements
* Sounds fun
* Involves fine art

Cons:

* I am very introverted and not great with public speaking to adults, but I'm unsure if this is a matter of ""do a customer service job to get rid of your social anxiety"" sort of thing or if I will come off as unapproachable and cold and be miserable at the job. I think I'm friendly but suuuper chill; I don't exactly have that giggly disneyland enthusiasm that gets kids excited. I know a lot of teachers put on a ""work persona"" though
* Since my classes were during covid, I've never worked with kids in person and don't know what that is like.
* They require you to stay with them for a year, and I'm not sure if being part time and in person will effect me getting a full time position elsewhere + I won't be able to visit my long distance partner as opposed to the remote internships I'm looking at
* Minimum wage (expected)
* My partner is a software engineer and thinks something in tech/design would be good for me. He says that I could ""do better"" and that this job is for high schoolers. But I feel like I'm starting from scratch careerwise and the alternative is to get a unpaid internship or volunteer position (I'm planning on doing at least two internships).

TL;DR: Am an introvert unsure if I can do an extrovert job, partner thinks I shouldn't ""give up"" by taking a min wage part time job I'm a bad personality fit for. Are these valid doubts to turn down the opportunity? The woman who runs the place wants us to be all in"

I’ve been apathetic for about a year now (probably because of a mix of anxiety and depression) and I have no clue how to change this feeling. I have so little motivation to do most things — I spend so much time lying around, watching YouTube, scrolling endlessly on Instagram, reading Reddit, et cetera — and I HATE it. The days I feel my best are when I get out of the house and do things the entire day. And I know what makes me feel happy and fulfilled: making new friends or hanging out with current friends, reading, coding, taking photos with my camera, making art, and a few other things. Yet I really can’t bring myself to do any of it. I constantly procrastinate on homework and miss class, and when I do work, it’s always in my bed (Yeah, I’m always lying down. Whether it’s to consume social media mindlessly or to do homework, I’m always in my bed). I can barely even bring myself to do the amount of work necessary to get a therapist, which feels like a monumental task. Everything feels so meaningless! Even things I enjoy doing feel meaningless. Yeah, it’s fun to code a small project, but I’ll never be as good as my friends, who are already getting jobs and starting companies. Everything I can code seems trivial. Yeah, it’s a good idea to do homework, but it all feels useless because grades don’t matter in college anyway. And I know I feel good whenever I spend most of the day out and about, yet it’s easier to stay in my dorm all day and my classes are boring and I can probably figure out the material on my own anyway. I know getting a therapist would help me figure my life out, but it’s so much effort to not only find a therapist but to have a consultation with them and to actually go through with meeting with them. I know watching Instagram and YouTube for hours every day makes me feel awful and is a complete waste of time, but breaking my habit of turning my brain off and scrolling endlessly requires so much effort and energy. I know I would feel better if I exercised more, but I’m really out of shape and there are so many people at the gym that I feel embarrassed, so I choose not to put my energy into going. I know I am more productive if I’m at a library or at my desk or just ANYTHING other than lying in bed all day, but I can’t help myself, I have a habit of just lying in my bed anyway. I know I could do things to fix my insomnia like only lying in bed when I’m trying to sleep or going to therapy to decrease my anxiety but it’s just so much effort. I know for a fact that I’m a smart person but can’t apply myself even though I want to. I think and think and think about everything, yet if I have a list of ten tasks to complete in a day, it’s almost impossible for me to get past the first one.

My point is that everything feels like a monumental cliff to climb. I convince myself to not really do anything because it’s all so exhausting. I need help, I really really want to get better and live a better life. I know that if I could apply myself, I’d accomplish a lot. Yet, after being STUCK for SO LONG, it’s genuinely really hard for me to actually be convinced that I can really change. 

I do have an image in my mind of a truly fulfilling life. One where I have a set schedule every day that I actually follow rather than sitting around all day. One where I have a best friend or a group of close friends, rather than a loose network of friendships that don’t feel especially close. One where I’m actually able to work my brain and overcome hard problems instead of shutting my brain off for hours a day with Instagram and YouTube. One where I’m in an internship or job or research position and put 110% of my effort in, instead of doing the bare minimum to skirt by my classes. 

I really, really WANT to change my situation. It just feels like I’ve made zero progress for the past year, so it’s hard for me to see if it’s even possible. I don’t feel less intelligent than many of my friends, it just feels like they are naturally more motivated and productive.

I need help convincing myself that I can change, because this has defined every moment of my life for what feels like forever now."

I was always living in the moment and school was mostly a place to fuck around for me. School was like a place to go and meet friends and mess about. The same goes for university. 

I know what I did, and I am fully to blame for it, so please don't come at me for messing up like this. I know i fucked up. 

Anyways, I'm from the UK and I did my A-levels, got decent grades actually and went off to university without knowing what I want to do and without caring. 

I graduated this year with a 2:1 in politics, and after summer when September came, it finally hit me. I fucked up. I never got any work experience except a few customer service and delivery jobs during summer, and that's it. I realised that my degree is useless. It hasn't given me any specific skills or vocational skills, and I haven't gone out my way to get internships. 

I dont know what career i want, at all. I dont know what job I want. I don't know what the next step is. All jobs require experience and for you to be job ready. I'm honestly kinda scared now. Currently, I'm living with my parents, not know what the hell to do. Everyone else got their lives figured out. 

If i could go back in time, I would learn a specific skill that's in demand, and do an apprenticheship where im actually getting trained for a job. I feel like doing a broad degree like this has left me more confused than ever. I'm not just blaming the degree itself. I agree, a degree is what you make out of it, but I made this huge mistake of just not caring and doing whatever is next expected, without a plan for the future whatsoever. 

The only skill I'd say i have is i am pretty advanced in excel. I can do VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, INDEX/MATCH, IF formulas, pivot tables, power pivot, Macros, conditional formatting etc. I learnt these a while back when i took a course on excel training. But i've never actually used these for a job, i just know how to do them. so i dont even have evidence i can do these. 

i dont know how fucked i am but im not feeling confident. So in summary, i have a 2.1 in a useless degree, no internships or professional work experience except a couple customer service/delivery jobs i did during the summer for some quick cash, no extra curricular or volunteering, no specific skillset except Excel, i never networked or even went to a single careers fair. 

again, please dont come at me. I take full blame for what i did. I just dont know what to do next. I need a job now and need to start earning. But i dont know how to build a career. Do i just get a basic office assistant job or something? but then what? i wish i had a skill i specialised in that i could do forever. 

im kinda scared. because of the uncertainty, because of the lack of skillset. i dont know what i have to offer to employers.

any advice is appreciated. thank you."

Now coming to the point, I was dating one girl(24 years old) at first obviously everything seems very beautiful but  her toxicity started when i discovered i was at her place and she went to her University (currently she's doing internship as a dentist), at the day when i was at her place, when she came home she told me her ex boyfriend dropped her home and he told her that she seemed I'll so he will help her to her room and she told him that not needed as ""my boyfriend is in home"" and she narrated this story also said her ex became awkward on that thing and went away, then i told asked her why her ex felt awkward she told me she had no idea, we had bit argument on that she said if she stops hanging out with her ex then at the University no one will entertain his ex so i told her that's not your concern so she said i was being illogical and toxic, also note she has only guy friends and she says that everyone frames her as someone who doesn't Know her boundaries (all the bitching from her side) now fast forward to last week, one of her University female was getting married to a different city, she first told me she didn't want to go but anyhow she went, at her trip she didn't even bother to texte up, before her trip too, she acted like pseudo feminist that why females are being only told not to be very close with guys, anyway, on her trip as she didn't even bother to text, she thou spent a lot of times with ""Her Guy Best Friends"", she wore very short dresses extremely revealing then one of her pics she uploaded on her status was her so called friends grabbing her waist from the back and she was leaning on him and looking at his eyes. 
The occasion of her trip was someone's marriage ceremony but she went on exploring 2-3 tourist places, resorts, Jungle Safari and camping with those males, the. After her trip got over yesterday, she came back and called me and said how she misses me and all. 
Now, today as I told earlier i have stressful job Sometimes and last month i told her before 1st of January I'll be stressed for my work so won't be online much. 
Anyway she called me at 7pm when i was in a meeting. 
At 8 i called back she started saying don't talk to me you don't text and all. 
Then i didn't wanted to argue thus i told her that as I told you I'll be sort of busy till 1st of January thus i was in a meeting still you want to take time, it's yours but just know I'm here. 
On this particular statement she said: don't say bullshit like I'm here, these words are just bullshit, you don't text. 
I told her you know already i haven't slept since 3 days due to workload, so she was like now I'll take later i don't want to hear the bullshit excuses. 
Later, today i texted her: ""Now i don't want to talk to you as you are looking for reasons to fight with me and i can understand the scenarios you're building.
Finally, I BLOCKED HER. 
(Bonus point: she used to get mad at me for zero reasons literally zero reasons)
I tried communicating but it always backfires me.
Lastly, before starting our relationshipa we discussed about likes and dislikes and she knew i didn't like ultra exposing dresses in general and she was against of those things but two weeks back she went some someone's birthday and she wore very ultra revealing dress and that day she told me that I'll be very upset I asked why I'll be upset she sent me the picture and she told me she wore that dress knowing i won't like it.
I didn't react on that thing. 
But today when she started playing the victim card, i had to end it up. 
Every suggestion and feedbacks are welcomed."

I consider myself a decent programmer, but I constantly see people having very detailed discussions around the inner workings of language X vs language Y, how all these languages do things slightly differently under the hood (things like how they manage arrays in memory, etc.) and how that affects overall architecture and performance.

I think it's in part because I don't have a formal education in SE; I was self taught before getting my first internship and have just learned on the job from there, so everything I know is higher level application principles etc. I just don't have the in depth knowledge of the minutae to be able to take part in those conversations.

I do however want a safe job with good work life balance and decent pay. I want to be able to spend a decent amount of my life making friendships and spending time with friends.

Please help me decide Management Information Systems vs Computer Science, I'm losing my mind lol.

# Computer Science (CS)

Pros:

* More likely to make a lot amount of money.
* Probably more work from home jobs.
* If AI starts stealing everyone's job 15 years from now, CS might be a good place to be if I can get into machine learning and help run the AI.
* Problem solving can be cool
* Maybe way worse work life balance than MIS in college, but way better work life balance than MIS like 2 years out of college??

Cons:

* Courses are much harder than MIS, thus less time to spend building friendships.
* To be competitive for internships and jobs you also need to spend a significant amount of time outside of classes learning actual skills. So even less time free time as if the classes don't demand enough time.
* Supposedly there is huge saturation, at the very least there is in the entry level. This is maybe one of the biggest cons. The big issues from my understanding that causes this and why it is a real issue and not just short term like the recession/tech layoffs are as follows:

1. The huge rise of social media selling the idea that everyone can make 100K if they come into the industry. Now seems like everyone is doing boot camps.
2. Even without the self-learning and boot camp craze, the computer science graduates per year have doubled from 50K ten years ago to now over 100K new CS grads per year.
3. Global outsourcing.
4. ChatGPT/AI will advance exponentially, and will allow for workers to be more efficient leading to less workers needed, if any at all eventually.

# Management Information Systems (MIS)

Pros:

* Supposedly it's pretty common for people to make 80K starting from Temple University with MIS, I can easily go to this school.
* MIS is mix of CS and business stuff, so I'd imagine I'd have way more jobs I can get into with this degree for way better job safety. AND if I want to, I can always self-learn most CS skills if I wanted to get CS jobs. And I could get masters in CS if I wanted to.
* Probably was less competition and saturation than CS field.
* MIS is known to be an easier degree, plus I don't need to learn a hole bunch of stuff on top of the courses just to get hired, so more time for friends.

Cons:

* Maybe easier job to replace with AI?? If AI takes over every job, it will be harder to get into the AI/ML stuff with MIS
* Probably slightly lower average pay and lower ceiling for pay??
* People call it the CS drop out degree
* Maybe not as many work from home jobs, although honestly it's probably comparable??
* Maybe initially work life balance is better than CS, but not long term??

&amp;#x200B;

No matter which degree I choose, I am still a dedicated student and will work hard to be competitive for internships and jobs, I just really value work life balance so I can spend time with friends.

Which path do you think makes sense if I want to make decent money, but also be able to have plenty of time to touch grass and hang with friends?

However, people have said that the degree is what you make of it, and it’s important to network, find internships, get certifications, build personal projects, etc., but I just feel really overwhelmed and don't know where to start. I’ve also thought about going into business analytics, UI/UX design, or web development, but I’m super indecisive and don’t know what to do after graduation.

I’ve talked to multiple career/academic advisors, taken a few career assessments, and searched for a couple of careers that I might like, but I’m honestly really lost right now. I plan to be more involved on campus next semester and hopefully gain some clarity about my career path, but there’s just so much uncertainty, and I don’t know what to do about it. I’ve already taken some time off from school but was forced to continue my education this semester.

Also, I would like to get some feedback on my schedule for the spring semester. Here are the classes that I’ll be taking:

• Intro to Comm and Information Processes

• CS111

• Intro to Macroeconomics 

• Intro to Marketing

I'm an Electrical power engineering student, i want to know about the potential of this job, is it still worth it?, also the waiting opportunities, what i should study or read besides the curriculum, and how to get internships as the ones provided by cairo uni aren't that prestigious.

I need general advice, do's and don't do's smths like that.

It would be really helpful and I'm gonna save this post so i get back to it when i need some guidance.

They sent me an email saying onboarding will continue up until a week before my start date which is in may. Here’s the picture they sent too https://imgur.com/a/eqOFOo2

Should I expect a mandatory drug test sometime during the onboarding process, or will it most likely be a week before I start?"
1002oue,7,2022-12-31,Fields in SWE that I can cruise in,goethefan69420,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1002oue/fields_in_swe_that_i_can_cruise_in/,"Hi,

I have one more year left in college after this upcoming semester, and will likely get some kind of internship or job. I want to work until 2027, and then for 3 years, I plan to use the money I saved from my job to prepare and train for the Chopin Competition in 2030. If piano doesn't work out, I would be willing to go back into tech, and just teach on the side/make content or something.

I'm pretty interested in SWE, I know Python, C, and Assembly. I've been coding since around May of last year.

The stuff I'm probably most interested in is networks/the problem of scaling in general (stuff like distributed systems, cloud stuff is okay)...

For this period of 2024-2027, I'm wondering what skills would be the best to learn based off the foundation I have now, to find a job that will be not very intensive on my brain and focus, or just won't take a lot of hours. I'm even willing to grind hard to be overqualified for a certain job, and then take an easy job with less pay than needed, because, time and focus is really is what is more valuable to me, money matters a bit, but, it's not as important as time and focus to me.

What I'm wondering is what kind of jobs should I be looking at or positions can I get that are pretty cruisey/relaxed. I've heard learning Java Spring may be a good idea, and working in something like pharma/insurance/gov jobs can be a good way to not have a lot of free time. As I said, IDC too much about TC, I'll likely live with my parents for 1-2 years.

Or, should I just pursue what I'm interested in even though it is much harder work than being a CRUD app monkey.

I do like learning about this kind of stuff, and think I have the potential to be pretty decent at it, but, I do not want to put myself in a position where I spread myself too thin, I want to have the time to practice piano for at-least 2-3 hours a day, still have time to go to the gym, read books, and spend time with family/gf without being completely drained. Piano is my main focus, and I will need to practice it for 8+ hours a day 2027-2030, and I am fine with that. But, I'm just really wondering what I can do in tech that would fit my personality and schedule for this time period, then if it doesn't work out, I know what fields are interesting to me and will pursue them.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for reading, I hope I can get some good advice, or can someone post this on blind for me as well?"

1004cyx,35,2022-12-31,Took 3 Years to Complete my First Year in Electrical Engineering,SubAtomicParticle10,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1004cyx/took_3_years_to_complete_my_first_year_in/," Hello everyone, so as the title says it took me 3 years of college to complete my first year in Electrical Engineering. 3.5 actually as I just finished it this fall term.

 So let me explain how I got into this situation. This is actually my 4th year in college and the first and second years I mostly fucked around, not knowing what I wanted to major in, getting bad grades and whatnot, almost getting kicked our of college at one point. At my college you need to complete 8 first year engineering courses to be accepted into the engineering department, and they only look at those 8 grades for admission, hence how I was able to get into the electrical department despite a lackluster gpa. I withdrew from a lot of courses as I always struggled with some concepts in alot of classes however I know I can pass engineering as I survived calculus 2, chem, and thermodynamics. Plus this is my dream career path so quitting is not an option.

 Im looking at completing my degree in at least 5 or 6 more years meaning I will spend at least 9 years in college to finish a 4 year degree. The questions I ask is if anyone has ever been in this situation, and how did you manage to pass? Do I even have any hope for an internship and will I even be hired after college with how long I spent in college? Im very worried for my future. Also if anyone was wondering how I was able to afford wasting all this time I was lucky because of a scholarship amd bursaries since im poor and a minority but even that will run out and I will be forced to take loans so I basically squandered that opportunity."
