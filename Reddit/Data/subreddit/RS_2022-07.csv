Im building a regression model for price prediction. My target variable varies a lot from 0.05 dollars to like 100K dollars but it’s mostly right skewed data. I got my MAE to be about 5,000 dollars while a dummy predictor predicts 7,000 dollars. However my MAPE was only 2.07% which is very low. I’m tempted to report my MAPE to my stakeholder but I feel like I’m missing something and I want to understand how this occurs and would appreciate any advice. The way I would interpret my model to my stakeholder in both cases would be:

MAE: “On average my model  differs from the true value by 5,000 dollars “

MAPE: “On average the percent error of my predictions are 2%”

Update: the dummy predictor for MAPE was 9% which isn’t too far of from 2%."

Hello,

I am on my last semester as a sophomore studying computer science. I recently got a message on HandShake for a internship at Amazon. My resume, does not look that good currently and was planning on adding more to it this upcoming semester as I will learn more during those classes, and I plan on creating personal projects. I was wondering if it's in my best interest to wait and apply since I will have a more impressive resume in the future, or if I should apply now since it's really early (Internship is not until 2023. I'm scared of waiting because in my head I feel like the longer I wait the less chance I will get the Internship secured, since they will see someone's application sooner than mine.

Any advice would be very much appreciated. Thanks!"

I am aware that Google has a few labs (I know of Calico and Verily), and I'm aware of Microsoft having a Computational Biology division at least in Redmond office, but I'm not aware of many others. I'm talking here about tech giants having teams that tackle biological problems from a data science/AI perspective, and not focusing on other support stuff like cloud infrastructure, or creating web based tools for analyses. Computational Chemistry (like DESRES) works too. Basically anything research-heavy, anything related to pharmacology or any omics. 

If you guys are aware of any other tech giants, that have such units or have collaborations with biotech/pharma for such roles, can you please list them here?


For biotech/pharma giants:

I know most of them have their primary focus on wet lab work, and many of them have computational divisions but not as their main focus (I'm aware of DeepGenomics having their main focus on computational genomics, but it's more of a startup). I'm interested in companies that work with pharmacogenomics data and invests heavily in computational techniques discovered.

If you guys are aware of any such biotech/pharma giants, that have such units or have collaborations with tech for such roles, can you please list them here?


Background:
I'll be graduating next year amidst the recession with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Data Science and Master's in Bioinformatics, and research experience in Medical Image Analysis, Biomarker Discovery and Pharmacogenomics/Precision Medicine, all heavily focusing on AI techniques. I have to look for internship and job opportunities for next year, and I figured that the best places to apply to would be in the giants. I'll be applying to smaller companies and startups too, but who knows what'll happen to them during the recession. Just to be safe, I don't want to miss out on applying to any bigger/safer firms.

Thanks in advance!"

Why parse? Because of [this](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/)

During my internship, I built a few scrappers and I have to deal with `any` type, as you can imagine I have to write quite a few nested `if statement` to narrow down the data type, it makes thing hard to read

I also built a scrapper for my final year project and use Third Party API in other projects quite often, I have to ensure that the data type work in both compile and runtime environment, so that TypeScript and JavaScript project can use it

So what happens if the data cannot be parse as intended type? An alternative action can be taken. Read [this](https://github.com/P-YNPM/parse-dont-validate#what-are-the-functionalities) for more info

Hence, I built this package, I got to admit the codebase is quite messy and I also know there are other type guarding/validating packages, but most of it did not pass down the type information along the way

I‘m 24 year old male working  as a product manager in one of the most successful IT companies in my homecountry of Kazakhstan. 

Before getting into product management I studied computer programming. I never had any commercial experience with software development because in the course of my studies I stumbled upon an opportunity to become a junior product manager in my current company. I decided to apply, because the company is amazing and I liked the fact that I‘ll have the means to create and work on products that millions of people use.  

Career-wise it‘s going great. It‘s been 1 year and 10  months, I‘m responsible for two great products, my income more than doubled during this time and I‘m on track to become a Senior Product Manager within a year. I have a good NPS and C-level executives like me.

Satisfaction-wise it‘s shit. I am very introverted and even though I can work with people and lead teams it‘s  painfully hard for me. I‘m not very assertive and I don‘t like conflict which sometimes causes troubles. I struggle with being strict when needed and I‘m sick of endless stream of meetings, presentations and pitches. I think best when I‘m alone and my company does allow for remote work but I cannot work from home all the time because as a manager I need to be visible and accessible.

I‘m considering switching to software development and about once a year my company opens up dev internships. I‘m sure I can get into one of them as the most important selection criteria is culture fit and I‘m good on that front. I enjoy coding and still do it in my free time sometimes. I also think that software development allows for  more opportunities in case I want to relocate or work remotely 100% of time.

However, the starting pay is significantly lower and it‘ll take me at least 1.5 to 2 years to get back to my current income level. I‘m married and my wife doesn‘t work. She is going to apply for several product designer positions and in case she gets the job and I get the internship our combined income for the first couple of months would be about 1/2 of what I make now. It‘s still higher than the median household income in our country but we‘ll have to lower our living standards and probably move to her parents‘ place for about 6 months since rent prices are crazy where we live. My wife and her parents are okay with this.

I want to try, but I‘m scared of it not working out and don‘t know how well will I cope with starting out from scratch and making less money. Any advice on how to proceed would be appreciated. And if you’ve been in a similar situation please share your story"

So it started a year back and as an intern I joined this company. I was liking the work until one day, almost 2 months into it, my boss started getting too close to me. He is the CEO and the company is pretty small, so I knew nothing world happen even if I went to the HR. Everyday just kept getting worse. I quit after a few day saying I was prepping for my entrance exams.  

After a month, they contacted me again and wanted me to help them out (basically part time) with an event. I needed the money and I said yes (worst thing and I regret it). It was all going fine and I would have a meeting with them once a week ans update with my work. I was happy. 

Around 2 months ago, they asked me if I could help a little more as the event date was getting closer. I said yes to help them as i though how much more work they could give me. Things started out fine but now I’ve got too much work load with the same pay they were giving me while I was working part time. They want to have meetings everyday, shout at me for small things and expect me to be available all the time. 

This event that I am helping with is next week and it’ll look bad if I quit right now. Plus, I’m soon going abroad for my further studies and i kinda need a good referral. 

I really want to quit and not care about the referral. I’m stressed everyday. They’re paying me very less which makes me wonder if going through all this trouble is worth it?

I called in sick today because I didn’t wanna work. It was getting too much for me .

Just need for advice guyssss"

voys4n,1,2022-07-01,Post-Grad adjustment advice?,HoldMeBackOrElse,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/voys4n/postgrad_adjustment_advice/,"&amp;#x200B;

I just graduated with a BS in comp sci this May. I feel like post-grad depression is hitting me pretty hard right now. I dealt with a lot physical and mental health issues throughout college and feel like I missed out on a lot. I went to an amazing school on the east coast, but I wasn't very happy there at the beginning. Partly because I needed time to adjust, and partly because I have MDD and didn't have my treatment sorted out at the time. 

The first two years I made friends and went out fairly often, but after Covid I kind of became a hermit and lost touch with a lot of people. Senior year was hard mentally and I didn't go out or socialize often and I'm regretting it now. I wish I had gone to more parties, made more friends and connections, went to more school events and just made more of my experience. I was a high achiever in HS and graduated in the top 1%, but I in college I graduated with a GPA barely above 3.0 which is ok for my field but bad for my self-esteem. I was one of the few people out of the 90-ish A&amp;S CS graduates that didn't graduate with honors.

College was a rough time, but I was really starting to feel like I was where I belonged senior year. But just as I grew into it, it outgrew me. I miss my campus and living in a house with my friends. I miss being a college student, but If you told me I had to do another semester of classes I would dread it. I liked being in that in-between stage of adulthood where you have a lot of support and resources from your university, a community on campus, and no big responsibilities outside of getting your homework in and finding internships. I don't feel ready to start my job at the end of July. Honestly I wish I could time travel back to 2018 and do it all again, but make better choices like getting my mental health sorted right away and some of the things I mentioned above. I feel really jealous of people who got to do all the things I wished I could have done. People I know who landed amazing internships, got to study/travel abroad, who found a job early senior year and got to relax and enjoy themselves instead of stressing about finding work last minute like I did. 

I'm grieving and dreading entering the workplace. It almost feels like my life is ending instead of just beginning a new chapter. I'm trying to stay positive and remind myself of the good parts of graduating like how there isn't constant stress of new assignments, I'll have strict working hours and not have to think about work after clocking out, and  I'll actually have money now, etc... But I can't help think of the bad things like losing that sense of community and feeling lonely, moving far away from the close friends I made, not having months free in the summer to go travel and do whatever I want with my time, etc...

 I know post-grad depression is A Thing so I was hoping more people shared my experience and could offer advice. How did you adjust after graduating? Any advice about transitioning from being a college student to working full time? Can you tell me about things you really like about not being in college anymore? How about building a new community when you graduate?"

I wanted to apply for quant internships for summer 2023, which begins right about now. I’ve heard the Ivy name helps, but I’ll only be joining August, so I’m not sure how to put it on my resume, as I don’t technically have a GPA from Columbia yet? What do y’all suggest I do?"

vp3jj1,5,2022-07-01,I need some Financial Analyst career path advice,girl_need_advice,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/vp3jj1/i_need_some_financial_analyst_career_path_advice/," Hi everyone, I’m a fresh graduate with a bachelor’s degree in Finance and Banking, specializing in Corporate Finance. I have no practical experience, and I’m planning to study a master's program in Financial Analytics or Business Analytics in Finance next year. I want to be a FA but I'm still having confusion about this career path.   

1. Can knowledge and experience in the Accounting field assist me in the FA career path? I’m looking for a FA internship but it’s pretty hard, instead, there are a lot of Accounting intern vacancies. I think I’m gonna take the chance but will it be helpful in the future if I pursue the FA path?   

2. Is CFA necessary? I’ve seen a lot of articles lately, they all say that CFA is extremely important for a FA. Is this true? And are there any other certificates related to FA career paths that also play important roles like CFA?  

3. Is my plan to study master's in Business Analytics in Finance an appropriate choice? I also consider Data Analysis/Data Science course since I think FA may need to have some knowledge in IT, and the data analytic field.   

My undergraduate program wasn't very specialized in financial analysis, it was more ACCA-oriented. So when I decided to follow this career path I was confused about lots of things. Since my family has no one working in this field, I really need some advice from people who have practical experience in FA or the financial industry. (English is not my mother tongue, please forgive my mistakes)  

Thanks for the answers, I’ll be appreciative."
vp3z1k,1,2022-07-01,Landlord is forcing me to move out but still making me pay rent for an extra 5 days and refusing to refund me for an entire extra month of rent I paid,CrabAssHerpes,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/vp3z1k/landlord_is_forcing_me_to_move_out_but_still/,"I'm going to break this post down into 2 sections just for convenience. First chunk will just be the immediate legal issue without the extra detail.  The second section will be extraneous personal beef I have with my landlord to give more context about the other bad ways he's treated me.

1. TLDR 4 Pt. 1: paid off lease in advance. landlord said i could move out early so I signed new lease for when he said I would move out. He took it back and said I was still responsible for my lease even though I signed another one that I couldn't get out of because he said I could. He released my unit but I had a month overlap of paying rent at 2 places. He won't refund my rent yet and says that, if/when he does, he will give me a prorated amount and make me pay through July 5th but he wants me out yesterday and is forcing me to pay rent even though I'm not allowed to be in the apartment and he's also saying he won't refund my rent if he has to replace my fridge  even though I have a direct deposit that should be used for that.

* So the current legal issue: For reference, this is happening in the state of Texas.  I moved into this apartment in August of 2021. I signed a year long lease that originally ended 7/31/22.  I'm a college student and I use financial aid to cover my rent so, in January of this year when I received my aid, I gave him a check for all of my rent for the remainder of my lease so I've paid through the end of July.  In April of this year, my landlord reached out to me and said that someone wanted my unit but they wanted to move in June and he asked if I'd be willing to move out by June 1st.  I agreed and was very happy to leave due to the reasons that will be in the second paragraph if you care to read it.  So we verbally agreed I'd be moving out and I went out and signed a lease at a new apartment starting June 1st.  A few weeks later, he texted me and told me that the person fell through and that I would still be responsible for the remainder of my lease through July.  I told him I had already signed a new lease somewhere else and that I couldn't get out of and I needed the extra rent back I had paid him in order to pay that lease. He told me he'd try to lease out my unit but no promises and he refused to give me a refund for the remainder of my rent.  Eventually he found someone to who signed a lease for my unit starting July 5th and I'd just have to pay rent at both apartments for the month of June and pay a prorated amount for the first 5 days of july.  Sucks but whatever. Since I've been paying rent in two places, I've just been taking my time moving little by little which has been nice because I've been very busy with work and super intense summer courses.  Well here's where the problem starts. On June 27th, they called me to tell me the maintenance guys went into my apartment (i hadn't been back in there for over a week) and they said the power must've gone out quite some time ago because it was over 90 degrees in the unit and all of the food in the fridge had spoiled and had become infested with maggots and flies and the entire apartment had an intense putrid odor. I don't know why there's no power or why that happened, but the next day I went to go clean it and it was awful.  While I was there, I asked once more if I could get my refund for the excess rent I had paid them.  They told me that wouldn't refund me until they did a walkthrough of my apartment after I moved out completely because they wanted to assess damages and they were fairly certain they'd have to replace the fridge (i hadn't caused any notable damages and the apartment was clean before this, but I do understand that the fridge is a bad situation). My issue with that is that I've already paid a security deposit for that exact purpose, I don't care if they don't refund my deposit but they have no right to use my rent money that isn't even theirs to begin with since they've already leased out my apartment to someone else for the majority of the month I've paid for.  To make matters worse, at about 4:00 pm yesterday (June 30th), they called me while I was at work and told me I needed to turn in my key by 5:00 pm that day. I didn't get off work until 9:30 and i'm also still not done moving out or cleaning.  I asked them why they were making me move out if I had to pay through the 5th.  I was told that my lease ended June 30th (i've never signed anything that says that and that was never communicated to me, all that I've been told is that I'd be refunded the rent I paid for July minus a prorated amount for the first 5 days) and they said they were making me pay until the next person moved in because i was ""breaking my lease"" and they needed those days to clean and prep the unit.  I'm really confused as to how they can say I'm breaking my lease when they're the ones who asked me to move out early. Also, i know from working there (details about that in next section) that they ALWAYS have a few days between leases for every unit to deep clean and that nobody ever pays for that (except in the form of your deposit I suppose if there's some sort of crazy damages).  They're pissed at me and are saying I need to be out now and I just literally can't do that.  I could maybe get out by the end of today once I'm off work, but I don't understand how they can force me out when I'm still paying rent for the next several days.  I'm also extremely worried that they won't ever refund me the extra month of rent they owe me.  They're acting like they can just use that as an extra security deposit and I'm wondering if there's any legal right for them to do that and if they have the right to tell me to move out while still charging me rent.

TLDR 4 Pt 2: ew ew ew ew fuck shit ew gross I'm such a dumb idiot woman filthy liberal piece of shit but at least i'm hot sexy because of the way I could pass for a 12 year old. People who aren't straight white men or cute white girls between the ages of 12-24 should all just be homeless and go fuck themselves.

1. Onto my massive personal beef with my dbag of a landlord (who I'll call D). I despise this man with all of my angry lil heart.  Around November last year, I was just getting out of my car and he spotted me and ran up to me.  He told me that his receptionist was quitting (it's a small office, him and the receptionist are the only people who worked there) and he asked me if I wanted the job. He just said I always stood out as being super friendly to everyone and he was very impressed with me because one time my car battery died and he saw me trying to jump it and he came out to help.  He was very impressed when he realized I had done everything properly to jump it.  We determined the batter was just a dud and I had to replace it and he told me to let him know when I got back with the new battery and he'd help me swap it out.  I'm shy and stupid though so when I got back with my new battery, I just put it in myself.  He was absolutely mind blown that a 22 year old girl could put a battery in an engine and attach two plugs to it. Gave me mildly sexist vibes how impressed he was but it made him want to hire me so who cares. I thought it was an awesome opportunity and I said yes.  The girl who worked there (Z) at the time was leaving in January for an internship, so for the month of December I worked part time with her so she could train me and then I was going to take over full time when she left.  Once I started working,  it started quickly seeming a little bit less super great.  D quickly told me that there was actually no real reason to have a receptionist and there was no work for me to do. He said he just liked having a pretty girl in the office to ""hang out with"" and that all of the work could easily be done by himself. I don't think it's coincidental that I look a ton like the previous girl, we're both thin, cute, baby faced brunettes in their early 20s while he was just some pervy 60 year old who hired me to hang out with him.  He spent all day with me talking about how he'd go to bars and pick up college girls and complain about how immature they were but also talk about how disgusted he was with women over 30 and how he hated it whenever they tried to talk to him. He'd make fun of women within 30 years of his own age and just say how old and fat and ugly they all were. It was extremely uncomfortable for me. He was also radically conservative while I'm very left leaning (which shouldn't matter in a work environment but it pissed him off).  He would say horrifically racist stuff all the time. He constantly accused all black people of being drug dealers and would go out of his way to deny them housing, he referred to black women as ""dumb fat b\*tches"", he said to avoid renting to any Asian people because they ""smell bad and always try to sneak in extra people"".  If cute 20 something white girls came in and wanted a lease, they were able to sign the same day they came in with no questioning or background check.  But if anyone of color came in, he told me to lie to them and say we didn't have any units to show (i never followed that instruction). He wouldn't offer them applications and he'd only give them applications if they asked and he'd be very rude to them.  Then he'd do excessive background and credit checks on them (that he never ever did on white people) and would find any reason at all to turn them down.  I felt so trapped in this job that violated all of my morals with a guy who looked at me like a bag of meat.  I don't like having a job just to look pretty and entertain some creepy douchebag, so I always went out of my way to make up work and do stuff to improve the way the office was run. I actually did a lot of really cool helpful stuff. I also was trying to start gathering evidence that he was committing housing discrimination so I could screw up his life because live laugh love. He frequently made comments about how he was shocked that I was so hard working even though I was a liberal and a woman (i love backhanded compliments). He also told me I was a way better employee than Z who worked there for 2 years and would show up 2-3 hours late to work literally every single day (but she was conservative so I guess it doesn't count when she's lazy?). One time, i threw an empty cup in the trashcan under my desk. We weren't allowed to put food in there because it wasn't changed frequently, but I didn't think i totally empty cup counted.  The next day when I came into the office, he had dug the cup out of the trash and set it on my desk.  The second I got in, he started YELLING at me and called me a dumb lazy liberal and said a lot of crazy shit about how liberals just think rules don't apply to them and they can do whatever we want and we all expect handouts and he threatened to fire me. It was insane and totally uncalled for and that was literally my first and only mistake the whole time i worked there and I almost got fired over it, meanwhile Z was completely unreliable but he kept her because she was flirty and conservative.  So for the whole month and a half/two months I worked there, D was always telling Z that she needed to submit her paperwork for the internship because she needed to get a new source of income since he already hired her replacement.  He said numerous times that she would not have this job to fall back on because he had already hired me and he was keeping me. Well one day I came into work and D told me that Z ended up not doing the paperwork in time so she couldn't get her internship and she ended up just having to drop out of college because of it so they were going to give her MY job back.  He gave me a whole speech about how I was an exceptional worker compared to everyone else in my generation and that I'm the only 20 something year old he knew that actually worked hard and was punctual and that everyone now just expects handouts. The irony that he was giving my job as a HANDOUT to someone else because they were too LAZY to do paperwork or show up on time to shit seemed lost on him.  That situation really screwed me over financially because I had paid all of that rent in advance because I thought I'd have a job to cover my day to day expenses like eating and buying oatmilk matcha tea lattes at starbucks 3 times a day like a filthy liberal.  It threw a huge wrench into my life and I was pretty frustrated that he did that, it felt really unfair but I just moved on. This experience made me feel really uncomfortable living there, partially because of how gross he was to me, but mainly just knowing how he was treating people of color and I had no way of proving it (i do plan on reporting to the fair housing committee once I'm moved out and don't have to see him anymore though).  When he offered me to get out of my lease, I was thrilled at the opportunity and now I feel like he's screwing me over again for no reason. I don't know what this dudes deal is but I think he should consider maybe just leaving 20 year old girls and people of color alone forever. He should also consider not taking a whole months worth of rent from me. Like I would've been able to move out sooner if I could show up 2 hours late to work every day and get handouts in the form of extra months worth of rent, but some of us have to work for a living and actually go to class."
vp60dk,1,2022-07-01,'friend',ilanagrngr,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/vp60dk/friend/,"Hi i don't know how to start hmm. First, sorry if my English is bad (English is not my first language). I don't know where and to who should i tell about what i feel right now. I don't have many friends. I think i should let it out now eventhough it may be a small problem to some people. I know this is not about social anxiety but i feel like this is a right place to keep this small confession here. 

I have this one friend, she is my classmate, my roommate, and my closest friend in the university. I've never been so stress before we became a roommate. Sometimes she likes to compare her work with other which make me so stressed about it. She sees all things as a competition. We currently working on final year project and she always told me about her partners and sometimes she talked bad about her partners. I know this is not a big problem but when you have to face it nearly everyday you will know how it feels. Sometimes she became a noisy person. 

Then for this semester we have to find an internship placement for the next semester. Luckily, I managed to find an internship in this small company from my supervisor's suggestion. I was so happy so I told my friend about this news and then she asked me how much allowance will I get. I said none. Then she started to ask why that company doesn't give allowance, asking are you serious that company will not give you allowance??? and so on like a busybody person. I know she only choose a company that give allowance and i don't care about it. She makes me feel not good for applying that company and I was so sad. I don't mind if i don't get any allowance for my internship. What's important for me is to graduate on time. But her respond just make me feel shitty. Then i started to think maybe i shouldn't tell anybody about my personal life. 

Today her family came to visit her and she asked me to join them so i agreed. We have a little chat and her father started to ask me about my personal life. Then her father asked me if i already get internship placement. I said yes. Then suddenly my friend interrupted and mentioned about that 'allowance' thing. She said that i got internship through my lecturer's help and i don't get allowance which i thought those things are not necessary to say to other people. Once again i felt like a shit. She said a wrong thing about my internship which she doesn't know much about it. I also go through the same process like other student  to get that internship placement. When she got an interview for her internship I helped her practice her interview and cheer her up. I want to defend myself when she said those words to her father but i can't because they are very kind to me. 

Why am i feeling like this? I felt like I'm the one who toxic. Sometimes i felt guilty cause I always mad at her due to her behaviour for being noisy.  I feel so bad because i started to hate her and trying to avoid her eventhough I know i can't cause we are roommate. 

There was one time i want to talk about my problem to her. Then she said 'so?' which means ok then? I was hoping some comfort words but she just asked me like that. She always vent to me but when it's my time, I have no one to vent. Since then i rarely talk about my problem to her. 

Thank you for reading this small confession!"

vp6nni,3,2022-07-01,do recruiters/employers care about time spent in college?,retromani,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vp6nni/do_recruitersemployers_care_about_time_spent_in/,"Hi guys, I just need some advice about extending my graduation date.

I started college in 2017 as a biology major coming in with 30 credits from high school AP exams, everything was going great and even though my expected graduation date was 2021, everyone thought I'd graduate a year early.

Unfortunately I burned out fast, and got hit with extreme depression and anxiety and locked myself in my dorm the entire first semester and failed all my classes. I ended up taking a break the next semester and going back to my home country (east africa area) for the summer for mental clarity.

When I came back, I felt better about college and switched to being a psychology major from fall 2018 till spring 2020, it helped me boost my gpa from 0.75 to a 3.3. I was able to reach the dean's/president's list multiple times. I realized that the psychology courses helped me grow mentally and be more confident in myself and I wanted to try a more challenging major and something that would keep me financially secure.

Thus, I switched into computer science at the end of spring 2020, right when we went into quarantine for COVID. I've basically spent my entire CS degree learning online, which was really hard switching from psychology straight into calc1, calc2, data structs etc.

Now, I'm almost at the end of my CS major required courses and I'm expected to graduate by May this next spring.

The issue is that I don't feel ready at all. I feel like I've been chasing to get good grades and graduate rather than to actually understand my courses and degree. I'm doing my best to secure an internship for this coming fall semester, but because I've been working, sometimes up to 4 part-time jobs, to pay for my cost of living and tuition, I've had no time to practice what I'm taught outside the classroom or to work on any personal projects.

I want to extend my graduation date and do 2 classes per semester rather than 4 and graduate by December next Fall of 2023, that way I can give myself the time to work on personal projects and get comfortable with data structures and algorithms. I also want to have more time to have more opportunities for internships.

Does this sound like a pragmatic approach to take towards my education and career, or will this be handicap to any future employment opportunities that may come my way?

I appreciate any advice you can provide. Thank you."
vp6swd,3,2022-07-01,Thoughts on summer internships?,Kaizzurr,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vp6swd/thoughts_on_summer_internships/,"I’ve been told that it is pretty standard to get some kind of internship the summer before junior year in preparation for a much better internship going into your senior year.
Next summer will be the summer before my junior year, meaning I should be aiming for an internship if I want to follow the general and recommended path. Issue is that I am pretty new to programming (been learning for around 3 weeks) and applications open up in August, and I simply don’t know if I’ll have all the knowledge I need to land any internship by the time deadlines close.
Any thoughts?"
vp7muz,47,2022-07-01,Do entry level bioinformaticians normally get a lot of training?,spacedout496,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/vp7muz/do_entry_level_bioinformaticians_normally_get_a/,"Hi, I’m about to get a masters degree in bioinformatics, I got my bachelors degree in physics. Unfortunately, I don’t feel prepared to start working. I have about two years of experience scripting with R and MATLAB, however when it comes bioinformatics workflows involving things like RNAseq or ChIPseq analysis, I have very surface level exposure. I worked with a professor for around 6 months performing disorder analysis on proteins, which only involved using web applications. This summer I’ve been working with another professor and was supposed to be creating machine learning models meant to predict drug activity based on gene expression, but I haven’t started building any models yet because he’s been really busy, so this internship has been moving at a very slow pace. I took a course called Applied Computational Genomics, and was able to get some exposure to bioinformatics workflows involving R programming, but the class was ridiculously easy. I got an A+ and barely feel like I learned anything. 

I got my first call today from an HR rep for an employer and I’m waiting to see if they’d like to set up an interview with me. I’m just worried that my scripting skills alone won’t be good enough and that I might lose my job if I’m hired but then it turns out that I need a lot of training. 

Do people normally feel this way? Do entry level hires normally require a lot of training? I feel like my program did not prepare me enough, we focused a lot on biology, types of databases out there, concepts involving sequence alignments, but barely focused on computational stuff. I’m so worried that I wasted all of this time and money 😔

updated during RD with a prestigious scholarship with 2% acpt rate and finalist for another prestigious scholarship.

**Letters of Recommendation**

counselor (8/10) - shes new this year but we've formed a pretty close relationship. she has said that she expects to read about me in the future (wow my ego is inflating) and she wrote my recs for my scholarships as well.

AP world history teacher (7.5/10) - i didn't really ask questions in her class, but i did rlly well in her class and she uses my presentations to teach this year cus she thinks they are good. she was also impressed with the work ethic i had cus i continued to do my work even though i was rlly sick with corona.

AP environmental science teacher (6/10) - tbh i should've asked another teacher. she doesn't know me that well relative to my other science teachers. but she knows abt my classes at my local university bc her daughter (whos an undergrad) is in one of my classes and has called me hardworking.

**Interviews**

MIT (10/10) - my interviewer was actually someone who i met during my childhood. the conversation i had with her when i was a kid was actually pretty lifechanging and surprisingly she still remembers me! we connected really well and we held a common passion for science/medicine. our interview lasted for around 3.5 hours and she said that she hopes i'll be in her place in the future, interviewing prospective mit students. at the end of the interview she also said that i have blown her mind so many times.

UPenn (4/10) - i took like 5 minutes of thinking to answer one of the questions (it was a really unexpected question eye). my interviewer and i also had completely different interests...but we had a good convo about fraternities (he was in one at UPenn). lasted for 1 hour.

Princeton (6.5/10) - it didn't really feel like a conversation, and my interviewer seemed to really be rushing to meet the time limit of 45 minutes. but she kept saying ""wow"" and was impressed with my tutoring organization though and fascinated by how i always read things in the chinese version and english version. lasted for 1 hour.

Duke Kunshan (8.5/10) - my interviewer and i connected really well and i had very good reasons for why i wanted to attend DKU that she really liked. lasted for 1 hour.

Northwestern (??/10) - was invited to interview but didn't accept the invite oops.

**Essays**

commonapp (7.5/10) - this was the only essay i actually spent some time on. i worked on this on and off for around 1 week. i wrote about my thankfulness for my middle school teacher that helped me overcome my extreme fear of speaking, and how it has made me the person i am today. it was in a narrative format and i feel like my voice came through. reflecting back, however, i think i have better topics to write about that would have showed who i am more.

supplementals (varies/10) - i didn't start working on any supplementals until it was vERY close to the deadlines of each school (sometimes a day, sometimes just a few hours before). some of them even have multiple typos. a lot of them were really generic and definitely did not pass the ""white-out rule."" i wasn't really connecting who i am to why i want to attend the school for the ""why us"" questions.

additional information (8.5/10)  - i submitted another essay about my game development to better explain it to every school that allowed me to send an update. i worked on this essay for a few days. i actually think this essay was the reason why i got into some schools

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* UCSD
* UCSB

* OSU
* Northwestern (committed!!)

* Duke Kunshan (Withdrew)

**Additional Information:** i started getting my stuff together starting sophomore year 2nd semester...when corona hit. i had a lot of time to reflect and think about what i was doing and realized i was wasting my life away. during freshman year, I received multiple Bs, and even 2 Cs in my classes. during sophomore year, i received multiple Bs first semester. i didn't go through any trauma or anything like that—i was just lazy and i coasted through middle school not caring about doing work for grades. i had all As since the second semester of my sophomore year on a very rigorous course load to make up for it. thus, my weighted gpa was able to rise significantly with the number of AP and dual enrollment i took. this allowed me to place in the top 1% of my class. i can say that i was practically on less than 4 hours of sleep every school day to accomplish this. if i could go back i would start working hard freshman year rather than being always sleep deprived to make up for my bad grades

i tried to get involved with research sophomore year, but then corona hit and the opportunity i got to intern in a neuroscience lab got cancelled. (i mentioned this on the corona essay). after that i kinda gave up, not knowing that there were virtual opportunities and competitive programs that had returned during junior year. in terms of other ecs, there were a lot of interesting opportunities that i missed

my self diagnosed weaknesses: gpa, lack of research, lack of academic and prestigious awards, &amp; ESSAYS. as said before, most of my supplementals were pretty bad. but for the schools that i got waitlisted/accepted by, i feel like those supplementals definitely showed more of who i am."

vpanl6,1,2022-07-01,C++ or C# for small simulations and/or strategy games and embedded projects?,Novel-Butterfly7822,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/vpanl6/c_or_c_for_small_simulations_andor_strategy_games/,"Hello, I'm 16 years old. I'm certified from Microsoft in Python and I've been learning C++ on/off for a few months. I also work with electronics and robotics. I seem to have reached a crux in my programming journey: I'm not sure whether I want to continue with C++.

I'm on page 415 of *Programming Principles and Practices with C++* by Bjarne Stroustrup. It's been pretty smooth thus far, as most of the lower-level stuff is very comprehensible given my background with super-low level stuff (built an 8-bit computer a while back) This is the part where GUI comes into play. Stroustrup uses a mysterious ""graph.h"" file, which I've deduced is a derivative of FLTK. My research into how in the world I might get this framework to work so I can follow along has led me down a rabbithole of ""do I continue with C++ for my purposes"".

I want to make physics/general simulations and small strategy games. I mainly chose C++ because it is used with embedded systems and robotics. I use ESP32/esp8266's and Arduinos for my projects, and C++ works well with these. I'm just unsure now of whether C++ is the best choice for these simulations and little projects i'd like to make.

Can anyone offer input on how feasible my goals are (physics simulations, etc)? I'm especially interested in destruction physics. Is continuing with C++ a good cause? If so, where do I start with GUI? I've given up on this books lessons on it.

I work a full time job, and have obligations to my Debate and Mountain Biking team, so time is scarce right now. Once school starts I will have a lot more free time, however I'd like to be somewhat adept in one of these languages by then, as I don't want to squander my time learning a language when I could make making stuff. I got accepted into a joint college and internship technology studies program, and as such reaping the full benefits of this program would be ideal. That is what i'm building up to right now.

Thank you"

vpdcc9,5,2022-07-01,"Is my experience considered ""internship"" experience or can I pass it off as a junior position?",Lykaior,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vpdcc9/is_my_experience_considered_internship_experience/,"**Context:**

I graduated back in December 2021 with a CS degree and a Math degree. I worked at a state department as a student assistant doing software development work up until mid April of this year. I left because I must be a student to continue working there. I worked there for a total of 2 years and 7 months while I was in university. During semesters I would work part time, and I would work full time during the breaks (roughly 8/4 month split). Now that I am looking for work, I ran into this question of what to classify my previous work experience as.

In the position I mentioned, I worked as part of an internal research project (pretty rare for this state department to do) that involved a software component. I was responsible for the software and given quite a bit of freedom in deciding how to improve the software. As a result, I did some fairly involved work implementing new features. On my resume, I describe the work experience as such:

- Developed automation feature using a random forest machine learning model.  Feature resulted in a 50% reduction in user workload. Used Weka 3 to train the model and implemented it into a Java application using the Weka library.

- Improved performance of computer vision software for object detection from recorded footage. The improvements resulted in more accurate detection and reduced false positives. Used the OpenCV library and Java to develop improvements.

- Implemented features requested by internal clients to desktop Java application.

(I omitted some specifics above to make it less obvious where I worked)

**My issue:**

I read ""The Tech Resume Inside Out"" by Gergely Orosz which says ""If the position does not describe your role well, consider clarifying it and using a description that does."" My official title was ""Student Assistant System Developer"" but I changed it to ""Student Assistant Software Engineer"" on my resume. I spoke with a friend who said I was underselling myself and that I should omit the ""student assistant"" part of the title or else it will be dismissed by recruiters. Part of me thinks he's right, because I think the work I did was above internship level, but I also do not want to lie/be misleading.

The previous position was similar to an internship in that it was:

- Low pay (relative to the average software engineer)
- For students only
- Part time during the semester, full time during breaks

But on the other hand it was also:

- Not short lived (2-3 month summer internship vs 2.5-3 years)
- More in depth experience than a typical internship
- It was never described as an internship by the department

**In summary:**

Would it be appropriate to list this work experience with the title ""Software Engineer"" or maybe ""Junior Software Engineer""? Or should I list it as ""Software Engineer (Student Assistant)""?

Side question, is it appropriate to round up 2 years 7 months to 3 years?"

Although this is a very long read (5.4k words), I would be extremely grateful if you could read it. Thank you.

**Chapter 1: Prologue**

**&gt;Hello, World!**

Hi everyone, I figured if you were gonna spend ample time reading this document then maybe you should know a little bit about me and my situation (by the way I’d like to stay somewhat anonymous for now just so I don't give future AET professors/higher ups a reason to dislike me). I will be attending UT this coming semester, fall 2022, and maybe some of you are wondering why someone who hasn't even spent a single second in a college classroom would be writing about the trials and tribulations of a small COFA major, and this section of the document is meant to answer some of your questions regarding myself and the purpose of this project. I was originally accepted into UT’s design program, but after attending a small tour of the design facilities and learning more about this major, it seemed like it wasn't for me. I appealed my major to AET because I thought it sounded like it was a better fit for me. Eventually I came to regret this decision after reading a reddit post detailing the shortcomings of AET. After reading said reddit post, I began my quest to research more about this topic, and to my dismay, there wasn't a ton of information out there, and the only anecdotal info regarding this major seemed to be largely negative. I began messaging people on discord via the official AET server as well as other small ones. After having an extremely insightful and long conversation with an alumni about his success out of AET, I decided that I wanted more responses. I created a Google form for both AET students and alumni with the intention to give the public more information about the student opinions of this major, as well as the outcomes of someone who graduates with an AET degree. The data gathered from this form is already impacting the major, as it is currently being used to improve AET 304, a foundation class. So for that I thank everyone, sincerely, for participating in this form, it wouldn't be possible without you. I hope that this project helps anyone who is interested in AET. Without wasting anymore time, let's get into it.

**The Whistleblower**

Arts and Entertainment Technologies was introduced to the University of Texas at Austin in the Fall of 2016, which was a major that was targeted towards creatives that were interested in topics like animation, video game design, and music production. On January 29th, 2017, Reddit user “Aetwarning” was created, which warned those who were thinking of internally transferring into AET. Aetwarning’s post describes their grievances with the major, which includes courses lacking substance and purpose, and the professors lacking professional work. This reddit user states that many students were planning on transferring out or had already. It has been 5 years since this was posted on reddit, and since then, user Aetwarning has gone silent.

**“These Days You Gotta Have A Sequel”**

On April 3rd, 2022, Reddit user “AETWarning2” was created, roughly 6 years after AET was introduced to the university. This user claims to have no affiliation with the original Aetwarning, and posted the following on the r/UTAustin subreddit titled: “AET Has Not Gotten Better and it is Not Going to Improve: The Suffering of the AET Student Body”. The focal point of this post was how AET was going in a direction that most students did not approve of. Some key points include AET becoming more of a “T” shaped major, the lack of Music and Sound courses, a dysfunctional AMA in the official AET discord, the push into interactivity, the removal of independent study, and the lack of quality that these classes provided. If you haven't read this post, I highly recommend it as it provides more context to this issue and I think it's necessary you do so if you are to continue to read this document, [here is the link](https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/udh966/aet_has_not_gotten_better_and_it_is_not_going_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). This post exploded amongst the AET community, and was fairly popular on r/UTAustin for a few days. This post especially concerned those in the class of 2026 due to most of them already being enrolled at UT.

**Chapter 2: Eureka! Data.**

**Google Form Quick Stats**

**Chapter 3: The Court of Public Opinion (Part 1)**

**The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly**

The court of public opinion is now in session and it's time to compile all of these responses in a way as to where you can draw your own conclusions (we will get to my personal opinion later on). Personally I feel like we should address the negative responses first in order to get them out of the way. The main problems that AET has derives from two factors, its academics and its management.

The academics at AET aren’t held to the same standard as other majors at UT. A lot of students say that this major involves an extensive amount of self teaching (Youtube is going to be your best friend here). Another problem is the level of academic rigor that these classes provide. Students mention that some of these classes feel like they could be electives in highschool, and don't provide enough substance or quality to be good enough for college courses. Examples of this include a lack of things like basic narrative design, exploring other game engines other than Unity, and having multiple layers of progression in available tracks (Animation I, Animation II, etc). The lack of academic rigor is unfortunately reflected in the projects that come from this major as well (AET Senior Design Projects). There are a lot of examples of less prestigious universities producing a video game design student body that is far more skilled and equipped to enter the game industry compared to UT’s. Some examples of this include institutions like Clark University, RIT, Michigan State University, and UT Dallas. Let's take our emphasis away from the game design portion of AET for a bit. All of these problems are present in every available track, although game design seems to have the least amount of problems. The rest of the tracks like PLAI, Music and Sound, and digital visualization have all the same problems game design has but much worse. The classes that you can take in these tracks are few and far between, and when you are able to find a course it ends up being extremely surface level, which is especially true for the music and sound track. These are some quotes gathered from students and alumni that describe their negative opinions towards AET: “The AET curriculum is poorly structured and lacks rigor. Too many foundation classes and not enough advanced classes. For example, there’s an Intro to Animation but no Animation II or III. There’s a game scripting I but no II. It feels like anyone going in could become a jack of all trades but that’s not what the industry wants. It feels like you can’t have a specific specialization, just a general specialization in game design or something.” “A lot of good professors and a few really great classes, but the program was pretty heavily in flux so every semester was different and a lot of classes don't necessarily feel like great ways to advance your portfolio.”

Some say that the biggest problem that AET has is the management of the major. Overall, AET seems to be very disorganized and inconsistent. Some classes may appear one semester then be scrapped the next, which makes it really hard for students to be able to figure out their degree plan. The higher ups at AET seem to be pushing interactivity into every aspect of AET, and while that is fine for some students, others do not want to be forced down this track. A lot of students mention that they should just cut out certain aspects of the major, like themed entertainment design, or at the very least not force people to take classes that they have no interest in. Even though AET historically has focused on game design, it is shifting more and more towards focusing on interactivity and themed entertainment design, which none of the students asked for and most are not interested in these topics, as they did not apply to this major to get a degree focusing on how to design a theme park. This major seems to not allow students to specialize in their own field, which sets them up for hardships in the future as the entertainment industry is extremely competitive, which wants the best of the best for a desired position. A good analogy would be to see yourself as a tool for entertainment companies. If a company wants to hire an excellent “hammer”, they're not going to hire a mediocre hammer who can also be a mediocre wrench, they are going  to hire someone who specializes in being a hammer. AET students mention that their concerns do not feel heard whenever they bring it up with administrators, which is unfortunate because this major cannot improve when concerns fall on deaf ears. All of these problems combined have given AET a bad reputation, which reflects on all of the students of this major. AET’s reputation is known by a surprising number of non-AET students considering how small this major is, and AET’s reputation may also be known by local companies as well. Now, AET isn't all bad, there is still hope for this major, and a lot of students have described good aspects that AET possesses.

The list of good attributes of AET might not be as long as the former, but it is definitely worth looking into. When asked what students liked the most about AET, the vast majority of people mentioned the student body and the professors. It is considerably easier to “find your people” in this major compared to others. Almost every student here is extremely passionate about what they are doing, be that animation, game design, or music. There is a large sense of comradery in this major, which some may appreciate. Most of the professors are nice and genuinely want to help students achieve their goals (seems like a lot of students love Neal Daughtery so shout out to you if you're reading this).  Some students mention that this major is pretty easy compared to most at UT, so you may have an easier time here compared to other students. While these classes may indeed be very easy, something that might factor into this opinion is that a vast majority of students already have previous experience in things like music, art, or coding. The networking opportunities that AET provides is also one aspect that students appreciate, especially with companies like EA and Blizzard being in Austin. Here are some quotes gathered from students and alumni that describe their positive opinions towards AET: “I came to UT thinking it was a Game Design major that focused on all the different specializations of games. Therefore, I'm decently happy with what I've learned and I can say that (while this may be controversial), I really like some of the professors and feel they are genuinely invested in my learning. And that's one of the most important factors for me. If I can go to someone when I need help or have questions and they actually care and take time to give answers or make connections, I really appreciate that.” “It’s a great crossroad between art &amp; design and comp-sci but still has some kinks that need to be worked out.”

**Attention Freshmen!**

When I ran this form I mainly had freshmen and prospective students in mind, so a lot of these form questions are geared towards this audience. During this section of the document, we will be discussing advice AET students have for freshmen.

When AET students were asked what they would have done differently their freshman year, this is what they had to say. A good chunk of students mentioned that they would have tried to transfer out of AET. The majority mentioned RTF, as it is better for animation and music compared to AET. Others mentioned that they would have tried to transfer to CNS, ECE, CS or design. Others mentioned that they would have transferred to another university completely. Some mentioned more personal things, like to not procrastinate as much, work harder, join more clubs or orgs, make more friends, network and to focus on what they were good at. Speaking of networking, students gave some solid advice on this topic. Many said to create a LinkedIn, as it is the main way that connections were made. It is essential to get out of your comfort zone and attend anything and everything that is related to your career interests. This means to try to join as many clubs and organizations that you can, and to go to career oriented events as well. Make sure to be very sociable and make some friends as well!

I believe most people entering COFA are worried about getting jobs in the industry, and AET is not any different. I was able to gather great advice from people regarding how to acquire internships or jobs. First and foremost, networking and finding connections is vital to land certain jobs, so please try your best and put yourself out there. A good portfolio is also extremely helpful, and it is best to work as soon as possible on this portfolio, due to the competitive nature of entertainment industries. When completing AET assignments, make sure to make them as good as possible in order for them to look good on your portfolio. It is also extremely important for you to start looking into internships early, as soon as your first semester in college honestly. And lastly, BELIEVE IN YOURSELF! I know it might sound corny but even if you don't think you are good enough for a job/internships, submit your portfolio or application, because you never know.

**Chapter 3: The Court of Public Opinion (Part 2)**

**The Good, the Bad, and The Ugly, Alumni Edition!**

The court of public opinion is now calling up alumni up to the stand, where it is now their turn to discuss their experience on AET as a major. We will be discussing topics like alumni income, job prospects, advice, and we’ll see how Alumni answered their questions compared to current AET students.

**“Hello, I Like Money :D”**

As college students, projected income is something that we often think about. The whole point of college is to further your education in a subject that you enjoy, and to improve your job prospects regarding your intended career. As you could tell from the quick stats, AET alumni are definitely not struggling with their finances. According to my form, you are projected to make around $58.5k which is definitely very impressive considering that the average COFA student makes around $30k. It is even more impressive when you consider that the median income in Austin is $41k, and to live “comfortably” you would need to earn a minimum of $55k. You may be thinking, “those that are the high earners don't even have careers related to AET”, but I am here to prove you wrong. 65% of those that declared their salary mentioned that they were working in industries related to what AET covers. Some examples include: A Motion Graphics Animator (VR+AR) who earns $70k, someone in an undisclosed AET related job earning $92k, and another earning $57k. All of these are extremely respectable salaries, especially for COFA alumni. The highest paying jobs are in those that went into the tech industry, with respondents earning close to $100k and one in particular is currently earning $200k which is astonishing. Now that we know how much AET graduates make, we can get into how long it takes to get a job out of college. Some were able to get a job before they even graduated, but that was relatively rare. You can expect your job search to last around 3 months until you're able to land one, which isn't bad at all, the average college graduate typically finds work 3-6 months after graduation. There have been a few notable outliers when considering success, with one Alumni working at Industrial Light and Magic and another working for Disney, so working at a really famous studio like these is definitely possible.

**Passing the Torch**

It's best to learn from the experiences of others rather than going in blind into a vastly different environment that is college. A lot of the advice that alumni were able to provide was similar to advice that current students were able to give, although of course there are differences, and their responses have the luxury of having hindsight.

Some alumni mentioned if they were to do something different in their undergraduate years, is to not worry about the future as much. Anxiety can always get the best of us, and at times, it can get the better of us and drain us mentally. It is important to just believe in yourself and in your abilities, while always making progress towards your goals no matter what. Some wish that they would have taken more VR/AR classes, or be more aggressive with recruiters in showing off their work. When asked what tips they would give freshman for getting internships or jobs in AET related industries, they mentioned that its important to reach out to people and be social. For this question you can just refer to what students said, because their advice is very similar to what alumni said.

Ok coding nerds this one's for you so listen up. A decent chunk of AET alumni are now working in the tech space, and they have some advice for those that are wanting to get into the tech industry. It is really important to practice coding interview questions, because in a lot of software jobs they test your coding abilities during the interview. Alumni recommend practicing maybe 3-5 days a week. Make sure to have personal coding projects, it is also beneficial if you have a group coding project that you've worked on. Make sure to always be up to date on the latest coding languages and technology. Make sure to also attend many coding events like hackathons. Alumni mentioned that worrying about getting a degree in CS is useless, because you can get into the tech space with the certificate alone. Although your chances of working at a FAANG company are pretty low if you don't get a CS degree, if you graduate with the certificate plus your own personal projects, you can find a CS related job with relative ease, and with a decent chunk of change as well (AET alumni in the tech industry report a $60k-$200k salary).

For those interested in the first word in AET, here is some advice for you. Make sure your portfolio is STRONG. You are competing against hundreds of artists for the position that you want, be that an animator or being a concept artist. Make sure that your portfolio is unique and stands out from the rest. Reach out to everyone and everything. Reach out to fellow artists, in real life or social media, and most importantly, reach out to every art company, design firm, animation studio that you can. Take some classes out of AET, which can include studio art or design, or even RTF for better film structure and storyboard skills. If you want to go into tech art like VR/AR stuff, make sure you also take the CS certificate. Make sure to be able to match other art styles if you can, because that is a very valued skill in the animation industry for example. Make sure to get critique on your art (you wont find this in AET). There are many groups on discord that you can use in order to find critique. Talk to professors, practice effectively, if you can 5 days a week, learn industry software in and out, and put yourself out there, social media can be a powerful tool.

Some bad news for the music kids, there wasn't a lot of advice for people that were in the music industry. There was only one response which said to be very adaptable and to have a broad taste in music, as this will give you a better chance of success.

**Chapter 4: Coda**

**For the People, by the People**

Going forward with this document, I will be sharing my own opinion, which I believe is fair since I've been pretty objective so far. It is honestly abnormal for a prestigious university like UT to have a college program that has this amount of complaints/concerns. The fact that I even have to write this whole thing proves it so. If any faculty or administrator tells you that AET is an excellent and normal major, they are lying to you. Faculty and those that manage AET, if you are reading this, please listen to students when they have concerns, and please take this document/project seriously. Going to college is meant to enrich a student's education and improve their chances of doing what they want in life. This portion of the document is meant to detail what steps AET can take in order to improve as a major, and this is what students had to say. Transparency is something that I believe is necessary when managing a major, and most students agree with this sentiment. Addressing the direction AET is taking in a public manner is a good step in the right direction. Students also want foundation classes to improve, which thanks to data gathered from this form, is something that is currently happening as we speak. If AET insists on offering multiple fields like game dev, digital visualization, and music production, it should have more classes in these individual fields to allow students to specialize their skills. This will require more faculty of course, which hopefully is something that can happen in the future. Please tenure the professors, it would be extremely beneficial not only for the sake of the professors, but also for the students because doing so would allow professors  to more freely suggest changes for AET without the fear of being let go. This major needs to fix how it is advertised as many believed that they could advance their music skills in AET due to the mention of the music and audio track, but that isn't the case once you get here. Students often mention that AET should stick to these three tracks and kill off other ones (Interactivity and themed entertainment), the major is already spread thin if you ask me. If it were up to me, I would make AET music and sound a subdivision of RTF, due to them having more resources for music production and it would benefit both music students and AET students. I would remove the rest of the other tracks like themed entertainment and PLAI, since they seem unpopular and resources would be better spent developing the game design and animation aspect of AET, since the groundwork for those tracks are already there. And lastly I would advertise this major as a game design and animation program and nothing else. But this is just my opinion on how I would run things based on what Alumni and students have mentioned.

**Who Is This Major For?**

The following is my own personal opinion and is in the perspective of those who are yet to apply to UT. Would I recommend this major to the general population of students? No. I would only recommend this major to someone with the following traits. I would recommend this major to someone that already has extensive experience in game development/coding and art, and wants to be in the gaming industry, but accepts the possibility that they won't end up in game dev or the entertainment industry in the future. If you are to take this major, a certificate in another study is basically necessary. Furthermore, I would only recommend this major to someone who is dead set on living in Austin, and that also considers UT as one of their top schools. Someone who is easily self motivated and passionate about what they do would also do great in this major. In order to take advantage of this major, you must be a relatively social person and be able to put yourself out there whenever you can. If you check all of these boxes then great! I am sure that you will be able to experience success and relative satisfaction with this major. However, If you KNOW you want to be in game development I would not recommend AET, as you would be better off in UT CS or in another university all together like the ones previously mentioned. If you KNOW you want to be in the animation/concept art industry, I cannot recommend going to UT, and I would go to another university either specializing in the arts or I would go to universities that have highly ranked art and animation programs like NYU, NEU, Syracuse University, DigiPen etc. I am sorry to say but if you want to go into AET for music, please don't, and look into the butler school of music, RTF or another university altogether.

The topic of internal transfers always seems to be brought up when talking about AET, and unfortunately, UT Austin is probably one of the worst schools you could go to if you plan on internally transferring. The process of doing so is by far one of the most difficult ones across universities in the same league as UT. If you are already enrolled at UT, and you decide that AET is not for you, and can't transfer to another university, there are still some options for you. If you are going down the game dev track, you can *try* transferring into CS (30-50% successful transfer rate with a 4.0 GPA) or into Electrical and Computer Engineering which is slightly easier to transfer into, but still extremely difficult (if you want to have a chance it's best you have at least a 3.9 GPA). For those that are in AET wanting to focus on 2d animation and film, I recommend internally transferring into RTF, as it is a much more established program for these topics. It’s not going to be easy but it's definitely not as difficult as transferring into STEM. If  you want to focus on concept art, try transferring into studio art, it shouldn't be too hard since it's in the same college as AET. And finally for those in the music track, I recommend transferring into the butler school of music and perhaps RTF.

If you decide to stay in AET, please take advantage of all the advice that has been provided to you and apply it to yourself. Obviously I don't know you, but if you are able to follow all of this advice effectively, I am confident that you will succeed after graduating from UT.

**Final Thoughts**

Happiness. Satisfaction, and fulfillment. These are words that we would like to associate with our future after college. These are also words that I would like to discuss with you regarding AET. If you are an AET major, I do believe that your worries and concerns are justified, but to have anxiety riddle your mind regarding your future is something that is unnecessary and not helpful at all. Is AET a good major? To be blunt, No. No major that is considered “good” will have this amount of concerns and disappointed students. But Is AET a bad major? No, it isn't either. Is it decent? Yes, but some may consider AET to be disappointing considering the fact that [Austin Community College](https://www.austincc.edu/academic-and-career-programs/areas-of-study/arts-digital-media-and-communications/game-development-animation-and-motion-graphics) has a better game dev, animation, and motion graphics program. The only aspects of AET that are better than the program at ACC is that AET has better access to resources, connections, and being in AET means you are a UT student, which is very valuable. In terms of educational content, it is unacceptable that a program like AET is being beat out by a similar program at a local community college, and honestly it is embarrassing on the behalf of the management team of AET.. If you are an incoming AET freshman, I recommend thinking about internally transferring to the majors that have been mentioned previously. I'm in no way telling you to transfer but thinking about it in my eyes is necessary if you are to go on with UT. However keep in mind that if you aren’t able to successfully transfer, it isn't the end of the world by any means. Students in the School of Design and Creative Technologies are the highest earners among COFA alumni. Using data from the [Austin Chamber of Commerce](https://www.austinchamber.com/blog/07-10-2018-graduate-earnings) and cross referencing it with my own data, I can conclude that AET in particular beats out the following bachelor majors in terms of projected annual earnings: Fine and Studio Arts, Psychology, Anthropology, Nutritional Sciences, RTF, Biology, Social Work, Human Development and Family Sciences, and English Language. So for being as mediocre as AET is, the student body there is able to provide extremely surprising results. Although I would be more confident in giving this credit to the students and not AET, since the student body seems extremely passionate and also goes into tech related industries with the aid of the CS-certificate, which honestly makes up for a lot of AET’s shortcomings. So with all of that being said, I would like to disclose my own plan of action. Personally, I think I’ll try internally transferring once into either CS, ECE, or RTF. If I don’t succeed, and remain in AET, I am happy with completing my college journey here at UT. I will major in AET with the addition of the CS certificate. I feel confident in my future no matter if I internally transfer or not, and I hope you feel like that as well after reading everything..

If you have any further questions, feel free to message me. I urge people to to have an open conversation about this topic. If you disagree with this document or agree, make it known. If any AET faculty is reading this, feel free to message me, as I am open to conversation. If anyone from the AET management team is reading this, please listen to students and make changes accordingly, we have waited long enough.

**TL;DR**

AET is not as terrible as its made out to be. AET is a mediocre major, with smart and creative people that end up earning more than most non-STEM majors and a few STEM majors. If you enjoy game design but are open to not using your major all that much for your future career, and would rather rely on UT-exclusive connections and certificates, then this major should suffice. Although I would not recommend this major to most people.

EDIT: It has come to my attention that even if you choose to pursue the Computer Science certificate, completion is not guaranteed because a lot of these classes get filled up extremely quickly. This makes this degree even harder to recommend. "

I recently finished 3rd year and will start the 4th year or 7th sem from the next month. I also recently completed an internship (focused on data science) in SRI-B just a few days ago.

However, if I am completely honest with myself then I feel like I have massively f****d up with regards to my studies. The last 2.5 years have been completely online, and in my college mass cheating was rampant during the online sems. So I passed all the subjects like discrete structures, data structures and algorithms, compilers, machine learning, comp organization and architecture etc easily without putting an iota of hard work. I know now that it was a phenomenally stupid decision to indulge in such acts, but what's done is done; I can't change that. I got a reality check even during the campus internship drive, as I got selected for the internship quite late as compared to my peers. But in the end since I got the internship, I reverted back to the old ways after a couple of weeks of work.

But now, I am completely worried about my upcoming campus placement drives for which the coding interviews will be held sometime around first or second week in October. So between now and then I have a time of 3-3.5 months. In this duration I HAVE to improve my skills and clear my concepts for clearing the coding rounds as well as interviews, if possible even for big companies like Google and Microsoft. My question is, how do I plan this out? Is there any excellent resource or something which I can use to read up on concepts like Graph algorithms, BFS, DFS, DP etc. and then also solve questions.

Any help will be completely appreciated. Thank you."

I  am currently a professor with 25 years of experience teaching mostly  introduction to computer programming (C and Python), data structures,  and introduction to cryptography.

Given the current recession, I am considering a career move to software development.

I  only worked in a production environment as an intern in the University  Data Processing Center  in the 90's for an year and a half (IBM  Mainframe).

Do I have any chance  of finding a job, preferably remote, that would give me around  U$100k/year? or is that a dream for a 48 year old?

What skills would are the most sought after in the market these days?

P.S.: sorry about my english.

I know they can get an IT job with only a degree and internships, but the reality is most of the new grads are not making over 60k (in NY at least). Then they have to pay this large amount of subsidized and unsubsidized loans for years.

vpepad,1,2022-07-01,"Finished my project early, and there's not much work left for me to do?",StoicallyGay,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/vpepad/finished_my_project_early_and_theres_not_much/,"So as of last week I finished my intern project, with 5-6 weeks remaining. 80% of the last 2 weeks was spent either waiting for code reviews/merge requests, or waiting for my mentor to have time to help me deploy my project and some final touches that I can't do on my own because they're very company-based. This was exacerbated by some issues we were facing that he was also having trouble diagnosing/solving, and since he's busy as well, well, you know.


Now I feel there's very little left for me to do. I try to get an understanding of what everyone in the team is working on, although a lot of it and especially the codebase is way more complicated than an intern should and could know, especially from learning alone (I've been told not to stress about it), and I feel like any work that I can do requires hours of my team members' time to help get me started or explain stuff to me. Again, this is sort of necessary because there's this whole process that's not well documented so I need to be walked through the code.


I've been assigned a ticket for a tricky small bug, a very simple problem whose cause I still can't figure out. And most of the other tickets require using several internal tools + having a deep understanding of the system, along with making changes that can literally break the system, so those can't be assigned to me.


Generally, I feel like I have very little to do. I completed all the pre-assigned work so anything extra is also asking more of the team to spend time explaining stuff to me an guiding me through the processes, which is extra work for them and makes me feel guilty. My team is very kind, the managers and team members are reassuring that they want me to learn and want to accelerate my career, but it's nonetheless clear people are busy when my mentor takes 1-2 hours to respond to simple questions. I've been told my work and progress so far has well exceeded expectations but I really don't think so when it was simple enough to finish quickly.

*****

So to sum it up: I finished my project, and when I get work to do, it's generally too complicated for me to do on my own, meaning a team member has to to walk me through stuff to get started for 1-2 hours. I'm encouraged to ask questions and bother people if necessary as my team and managers have made it clear to be supportive and that they want what's best for me and my future career...but at this point, I'm not sure what's best for me or what else I can meaningfully contribute without being a burden.


Any advice?"

I'm a Canadian citizen in the US, and was wondering what the ""best"" path forward would be. My research is in applied ML, and I'm currently an SDE intern at Amazon.

Key factors for ""best"" path are lucrativeness, WLB, impact, and relative ease of immigration. Currently, I'm considering:  

* Professor: not lucrative, and perhaps not the best WLB, but a decent impact, and possibly easier immigration?
* Research scientist/applied scientist: I believe this is a bit less lucrative than SDE, but I'm not sure about the other factors.
* SDE: I believe this is the most lucrative (especially at SDE 3+). WLB depends on the company, I suppose.

I could also work in Canada, but the salaries are just not competitive with the US, and the highest paying jobs (which are in Toronto/Vancouver/Montreal) are also in the highest COL areas. What do you guys recommend?"
vpfsow,1,2022-07-01,Should I take another major risk?,Thunder-Sloth,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/vpfsow/should_i_take_another_major_risk/,"Hello,

To give a little background info, I served four years in the Marines as Infantry, then went on to work for the railroad for 11 years (three yrs as an operations manager/dispatcher and eight yrs as a freight train conductor). With just enough time to earn a BS degree, I quit the railroad in January 2019 and enrolled in community college that same month. I am a 38-year-old full-time student (online) and am currently working full-time as an IT Support Technician for a school district with about 1,200 students between three schools. The IT team consists of myself, a database administrator, a technology integrator, and a Director of Technology.

It took me about two years between two different community colleges studying Computer Science to realize that programming and software development was not for me. However, I do enjoy programming to some extent (Java/C++/Python). Towards the end of my time at community college, I began an internship with a local school district (October 2020). I enrolled, repaired, and managed Chromebooks, wiring cables, light switching and networking, installing access points, troubleshooting tickets, etc. After about nine months as an intern, I accepted a full-time position as an IT Support Technician. I also transferred to a four-year school switching from CS to IT, and I will earn my BS in Information Technologies by this time next year (July of 2023).

Currently, I am the happiest I have ever been in my life. I genuinely wake up and am so glad to drive to work. My current boss is a 32-year-old Director of IT who is the best boss I have ever had, and we have a fantastic relationship. My first boss was equally impressive, except that he was less willing to grant access to certain things, which is entirely understandable. However, with my current boss, he trusts me to be involved in every aspect of the department. We usually work hand in hand on anything IT-related. Recently I have added many skills to my resume, such as taking control of the VOIP phone system, working with virtual machines/creating images in vSphere, and smart deploy. I am also included in projects and meetings, and there is nothing I do not have access to except for sensitive information/director stuff that is about 40k above my head/responsibilities.

With all that said, I feel like I have this fantastic, perfect job of my dreams, but I also have a wife and two young children (1 and 5), and I want to provide them with the best life possible. I am also 38 years old, starting late in the game, and I feel like I need to fast-track my progress. I wonder If I am being selfish by remaining in a comfortable situation and not pushing myself harder, like studying for certifications and applying for higher-paying jobs right now. I hear from most people in this industry that the ONLY way to make more money is to get another offer and either be matched by your current employer or accept the new title. Then continue doing this until you reach your max. I have looked at salaries for similar positions at other schools in my state and surrounding states, and I have concluded that I am among the highest-paid (Starting @ $55k, (now @ $57k after this year's raise) for PC Technician/Support roles). However, I cannot stop looking at job postings and wondering if I should try to take another significant risk by possibly leaving the school district for a higher-paying job and some different kinds of experience. Or if I should stay where I am for a few more years and continue on my current path and plan.

As of now, my plan consists of continuing to work at the school district for a few more years to gain as much experience as possible and finish my BS degree. Maybe earn some certifications like network+, security+, and then start applying for a Systems Admin or Network admin gig. I  realize I have been at the school for a relatively short time. An intern since October 2020 and onto a full-time employee in July 2021, making today my first anniversary. But from what I understand, most people in this industry move to other jobs every 1-3 years. I was hoping to get some advice or perspective from other IT professionals on how they would proceed if they were in my shoes.

I am an incoming Fall 2022 student and am hoping to take Compilers as my first course. I understand it's quite difficult but I have some experience with llvm-based front-end compilers and really need this class to get into some competitive internships in this space next summer. I'm currently doing an internship that overlaps this space (programming languages) and my background is in mobile engineering. I'm hoping to write the compiler in C++ for this class. I'll be wrapping up my internship when this class begins and then spend some time leetcoding for jobs in early fall (and expect a month or so of low-pressure onboarding in winter) so I sort of view taking this class as taking a difficult class during the only semblance of downtime I'll have before graduating.

That being said, what are some things I can do to prep for this class? I'm currently writing C++ in my internship so it's acting as a refresher. I found [this list of lectures](https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/html5/html5lib/v2.89/mwEmbedFrame.php/p/2019031/uiconf_id/40436601?wid=1_xw5ysaiy&amp;iframeembed=true&amp;playerId=kaltura_player_&amp;flashvars[playlistAPI.kpl0Id]=1_9nxx14uh&amp;flashvars[ks]=&amp;&amp;flashvars[imageDefaultDuration]=30&amp;flashvars[localizationCode]=en&amp;flashvars[leadWithHTML5]=true&amp;flashvars[forceMobileHTML5]=true&amp;flashvars[nextPrevBtn.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[hotspots.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[sideBarContainer.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[sideBarContainer.position]=left&amp;flashvars[sideBarContainer.clickToClose]=true&amp;flashvars[chapters.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[chapters.layout]=vertical&amp;flashvars[chapters.thumbnailRotator]=false&amp;flashvars[streamSelector.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[EmbedPlayer.SpinnerTarget]=videoHolder&amp;flashvars[dualScreen.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[playlistAPI.playlistUrl]=https://canvasgatechtest.kaf.kaltura.com/playlist/details/{playlistAPI.kpl0Id}/categoryid/142202531) and am planning on watching them this month (is this the full list of lectures for this course?). I know many don't take this class so I'm hoping to get some advice on how to ace it with some prep work from people who have taken it.

vpgadv,0,2022-07-01,do certificates from codeacademy actually mean anything?,pineapplez_0,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/vpgadv/do_certificates_from_codeacademy_actually_mean/,"i'm planning on applying to first/second year internships in the fall, and i'm trying to make up for my lack of internship experience through efforts outside of school. i'm doing some side projects and also learned two useful languages, python and SQL. is it worth putting certifications from these online courses (codeacademy and linkedin learning) on my resume? 

I was hoping it'd show my interest and initiative in my own time, but i'm not sure if it means anything."
vphdi6,5,2022-07-01,Is 1 internship enough for new grad?,hyalope,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/vphdi6/is_1_internship_enough_for_new_grad/,"I’m a rising senior transfer student at UC Berkeley doing my first software development internship this summer at a mid-large sized tech-oriented nonprofit. Other than that, I don’t really have any relevant experience besides maybe CS tutoring from CC. I also have a few personal projects and a subpar GPA which I don’t even list on my resume. 

Seeing so many people on LinkedIn and around me interning since freshman year with multiple FAANG internships has made start to question if only 1 internship is adequate enough to land something good full time.

I already feel a little behind the curve as a transfer, only having 1 proper summer to intern and having to take such an accelerated courseload just to graduate on time, and I’m not sure if I’d be wasting my time/resources applying for a 2nd fall/spring internship, as opposed to just grinding leetcode and applying for new grad roles. I guess my biggest worry is not making it past resume screening for FAANG/other big tech due to lack of experience. 

If anyone has any insight, I’d love to hear it, especially from any transfers or someone who’s been in a similar situation."
vphjj4,42,2022-07-01,When Our Signal Was Answered,IWnaBNkd,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/vphjj4/when_our_signal_was_answered/,"On our way out, I could hear a few of the techs saying they were told not to speak about what happened, but I don’t think this is something that should be kept quiet. We were starting an internship at the Graham Hess Observatory. A place I had hoped to one day become a permanent employee. The house I grew up in is just down the road and I could see the massive telescope and looming satellite dishes from my backyard as a kid. I saved my allowance for a junior scientist kit, and by using my own telescope, would stare at the stars and plot the astronomy in the sky. I knew one day I would be able to step inside the observatory.

The internship started this morning. Hailey, Reggie, and I met in the parking lot. I didn’t know them too well, nor they each other, but we connected quickly during the few classes we had together. Excited to enter the observatory. We got out of our cars and chatted briefly in the parking lot. 

“I didn’t sleep at all last night. I guess I’m nervous”, I said to Hailey. 

“Same. I woke up an hour before my alarm went off.”

Reggie fumbled the crinkly foil of a pop-tart in his hands, guiding the pastry to his face with the same arm weighed down by his patch-covered backpack. 

“I didn’t sleep at all. I don’t think. I was playing Galaxy Rouges until, well, the last time I saw the clock it was three A.M. so, late.”

Hailey hoisted Reggie’s backpack up, the sudden weight shift forced the pastry quickly into his mouth.

“You stay up every night playing that game. What we’re doing today is real, Reggie!” 

Dry pop-tart peppered the air as he retorted ironically.

“Hey, what I do for the citizens of Nebulos is very real, okay? Oh, did you two see what we’re doing today?”

Did we see what we’re doing today? Of course, we knew. This was *beyond* my expectations for my first day. Today, we get to send out radio frequencies! I can’t believe they’re allowing us to do this already! I feel like I need more training or something. The introductory email said we would be debriefed this morning. Yes, the word ‘debriefed’ was written. Once the last shred of frosted aluminum treat was scarfed, we headed inside. 

We were greeted by our professor, and a man sporting a nice sweater vest and thick-lensed glasses. 

“Hello, fellow planeteers! Welcome to the Graham Hess Observatory!” He raised a finger, sliding his glasses back up the bridge of his nose as our professor scrambled through her notes.

“So! Today we will be joining Mr. Thatcher for a quick tour of the facility. We’ll learn a little bit about his every day, and then we’ll continue with our assignment. I hope everyone is excited!” 

“I am! I can’t wait to find an alien!” I said, trying to be enthusiastic.

Mr. Thatcher paused and chuckled slightly. “Well I don’t know about aliens, but hopefully we can successfully transmit signals into space.” 

Great. Apparently jokes about aliens are taboo around here. Now he thinks I’m an idiot. Hailey grabbed my arm and offered a reassuring smile. Mr. Thatcher turned, signaling everyone to follow. I held my bookbag close to my chest. My eyes, ignoring the sleep deprivation, stayed wide; fixated on the white and grey decorated main lobby. A tan-colored rug lined the entryway, and a collection of space-themed posters lined the hallway. We headed toward the end of the hallway, toward a set of double doors with a sign reading, ‘Employees Only’. I glanced over at Hailey, who I was relieved was just as giddy as me, though simultaneously swatting Reggie from opening a second packet of pop-tarts. 

“I see you’re all eager to learn about the mysteries of deep space! Fortunately for you, I am a long-time veteran of this, and I can assure you! …We might not find much more than interesting specs of dust. But! Don’t let that discourage you from today’s tour and assignment!”

“Uh, you know…” Reggie declared, grabbing everyone’s attention. “Space dust is pretty important, actually. If we find enough, we can trade it for galgulon currency!”, he said inquisitively, raising an eyebrow while taking a bite out of pastry number three. 

“Uh, Reggie? I don’t think your video game is going to apply here.” Hailey said. 

“Oh, Galaxy Rouges is no game. It’s a way of life!”. Hailey and I stared at Mr. Thatcher in disbelief. 

“Yes sir!”. Reggie raised a hand and the two high-fived. Everyone continued walking toward the double doors. 

“I can’t believe it. Reggie is the favorite, and Mr. Thatcher thinks I believe in aliens.” 

Hailey laughed, “I think Reggie *is* an alien”.

The group followed Mr. Thatcher into hallways and rooms, striding past people in lab coats and business attire. I was so enthralled that I was inside the observatory that I barely heard what Mr. Thatcher was telling us. Every so often Hailey or I would tap the other’s arm, pointing excitedly at a chart, interstellar photo, or scientific workstation. The bland smell of manilla folders and numbing hum of fluorescent lights washed over me. I adjusted my glasses, reassured it had been a good idea to pay extra for the blue light-filtered lenses.

“And here’s where you’ll be working today!”

Like a nerdy rockstar, Mr. Thatcher opened the pair of double doors. Light burst from beyond, transforming him into the silhouette of a man revealing his scientific playground. I swear, his lab coat fluttered like a cape for just a second. We all stepped inside the giant spherical room. The echo from the metallic dome reverberated Mr. Thatcher’s voice. In the center of the room was the biggest telescope I’d ever seen. 

Hailey turned to me, mouthing the words, *oh my god*. Our professor, grinning from ear to ear, leaned toward us. 

“I just know you two will see this room *many* more times”. Her words of encouragement nearly brought me to tears. As I took a deep breath, I wondered if I could see the house I grew up in from one of the windows. 

“What about me?”, Reggie held his hands up in confusion. 

“Oh! Uhm, well I’m sure you… Reggie, I can’t wait for you to see the cafeteria!”

His face lit up, like how ours did, first walking into the observatory. “Now we’re talking! When’s *that* tour?” Hailey and I burst into laughter.

“For the assignment today, I will leave you in the hands of our trusty senior instrument system engineer, Scott!”

“Uh, sir I really don’t have time today to- “

“Nonsense! These fine young students would, *frequent*, learning frequency broadcasting!” 

“That… doesn’t even make sense. Look, we have something on our hands here and we’ve got to be careful what we- “

“Perfect! we’ll leave them in your capable hands!” Mr. Thatcher laid a supportive slap on Scott’s shoulder and walked away with our professor.

Scott, pinching the bridge of his nose between his eyes, proceeded to show us a series of computer programs on equipment I could only imagine seeing in a sci-fi movie. Frequency translating software, azimuth and elevation levels, electromagnetic wave modulators, coordinate inputs for broadcasting; enough stuff that I felt overwhelmed *immediately*. He began by showing us the three most important parts of the process: the transmitter, receiver, and coordinates. Hailey and I looked at each other, baffled about how to do *anything* Scott had just described. Reggie took a confident step forward.

“So this one here adjusts the X and Y coordinates of the signal we’d be broadcasting? According to the azimuth levels, of course.” 

Reggie’s burst of intellect was masked only by the leftover crumbs of pastry in the corner of his mouth.

Scott’s face erupted with surprise. “Er, yeah that’s correct. We can adjust the levels here or enter them manually into the software. Have you done this before?”

“Oh, I’ve seen my fair share of intergalactic travel.” 

I rolled my eyes as Hailey and I chuckled. “See? An alien!”, Hailey whispered to me.

“Okay, well this isn’t a video game,” said Scott, adjusting his tie. “I don’t want you guys sending any frequencies beyond the levels I’ve chosen for you, but you can aim the antenna in any direction you want. It will take some time for the antenna to rotate, so you could probably give the program a try five or six times today before lunch.”

“But that’s in another four hours.” Hailey said.

“And it takes the antenna about forty-five minutes to complete one 360-degree rotation. You could send out more signals, if don’t move the antenna very much.”

Scott looked at his watch and grabbed a clipboard off the table. 

“Okay, you guys should be set. I’ve gotta’ run. Have fun!”  

We each looked at each other, our excitement extinguishing, and took our seats at the control board.

“Well at least we get to push a few buttons! …For the next four hours.” I say, trying to lighten the mood.

The morning went by rather uneventfully. We each took turns entering a coordinate for X, then a coordinate for Y; changing the direction slightly so we didn’t have to wait too long before trying again, then sending a signal. We didn’t really understand the point of sending out a signal that would reach halfway to the moon, but Scott wouldn’t let us extend past that. We’d send out a frequency, wait a few moments, and watch as the decibels in the receiver stayed exactly as they’d been since the first time we sat down. Luckily, we had only an hour left until we could go to lunch. 

I couldn’t believe it. I was finally in there. Inside the building I looked at since I was a kid, and I couldn’t wait to go eat cafeteria food. I leaned my head on my hand and rested my elbow on the control panel. I changed the Y-coordinate from 34.004 to 34.007 and hit ENTER. A hum from the massive antenna rotating outside rumbled the window next to us. We waited a few moments, but again, nothing. I had never felt so defeated.

“You okay, Layla? I thought you were super stoked for this stuff!” Reggie said, moving into position as it was his turn next.

“I was *stoked* to learn something. Not do this- busy work.” Reggie perked his lips for a moment and grinned as he turned to the monitor.

“Do you guys want another turn at this? Or can I just keep…” 

“You can do this for the rest of the day for all I care, Reg.”, Hailey said, putting her feet up. “Just wake me up if you see the professor coming. I might as well catch up on the sleep I lost.”

I felt guilty, but I too was tired. Sitting back in my chair, I leered around the giant spherical room. The room I once dreamed about being inside of- and closed my eyes.

*&lt;BEEP&gt;* *&lt;BEEP&gt;* *&lt;BEEP&gt;* *&lt;BEEP&gt;* *&lt;BEEP&gt;* *&lt;BEEP&gt;* *&lt;BEEP&gt;* *&lt;BEEP&gt;* *&lt;BEEP&gt;*

My eyes peeled open. The familiar sound of an alarm clock pulled me out of my sleep. I woke up to see that I was still in the observatory and Reggie, was clearly panicking. 

“Uh-oh Reggie, what’d you break?” Hailey said, rubbing her face and lowering her feet.

“Uh- guys…”

Reggie pointed to the receiving transmitter. A light indicating that a signal had been received was lit. Once the recording finished, it would play back the audio feed.

“Okay, I did something bad. Scott said we couldn’t send out a signal past what he programmed, but like, I did…a *lot* further”

“Dude. We’re going to get in so much trouble. Why would you do that?!”

“I don’t know! This was just so boring! So I thought we could have our last signal be a big one. I programmed a frequency that would transmit for an hour. But that’s the thing, how did we get a response so fast? Wouldn’t it take like, half an hour to reach us or something?”

“No” 

From behind us, the voice of Scott, even less welcoming than before, made us all sit up straight.  

&lt;Pop&gt; 

The beeping stopped and the flashing light faded. A small window appeared on the monitor.

*&lt;Playback Recorded Audio? Yes No&gt;*

“Absolutely not. I asked very nicely that you didn’t mess with these levels. There are things we don’t understand about what we’ve seen the last few days and this isn’t-“

“Well, good heavens! Look what we have here!” Mr. Thatcher appeared; his tone as gleeful as when we first saw him. 

“Sir, I’m sorry. They changed the pre-adjusted levels I chose for them. That thing- “. He paused, lowering his voice, “-thing we found the other day? I think this is it. We *have* to call- “.

“Yes, yes, Scott. We’ll call ‘the men in black’ in a minute. For now, let’s have a listen!” He reached past Scott, swatting his hand off the mouse. 

“What? No! This isn’t something we should- “!

&lt;click&gt;

Mr. Thatcher clicked ‘yes’ and the window engulfed the screen. He aimed the cursor at the volume control choosing a separate output, choosing the intercom. The broadcast played to the entire room. Hailey and I gave each other a look, and I don’t think Reggie had blinked once since we woke up.

Static filled the air. Fluctuating radio waves raised and lowered in pitch. People in the room stopped working and began to listen. Subtle and consistent roars of bass framed the eerie staticky screech. Then, silence. A moment passed. Mr. Thatcher shifted his weight, crossing his arms impatiently. A high-pitched whirring sprinkled in lightly, then suddenly the entire room filled with the sounds of scratching and feedback. Instinctively, everyone grabbed their ears in pain, even so, the noise was clear as day. The sound of fleshy crackling erupted; the anthem of an unholy presence declared itself from the other side of the recording in ways no one has ever heard noises be produced. The feelings of dread, fear, and threat washed over me as if communicated to me directly.  A tone so guttural and strenuous it shook the fiber and assembly of every speaker in the room. The horror and distress grew louder, clasped ears could hardly bare, then, it ended. The connection severed. 

The room was quiet. Computer fans and humming monitors garnished the silence. &lt;*Play Again?*\&gt; appeared on the screen before us. From behind me, I could hear a phone ringing. Hailey and I looked at each other, our eyes wide despite the recent nap. Mr. Thatcher, still leaning on the chair toward the monitor, was speechless. His brow furrowed and his lips pursed forward. I turned as I heard Scott’s voice speak into the phone. He started walking away as the conversation began.

“Hello? Yes, this is the Graham Hess Observatory. Yes. We’ve acquired a response. Well, we sent a signal…”

It wasn’t until I couldn’t hear him anymore that I realize the entire room of scientists, technicians, and astrologists were all looking our way. Their faces mimicked the same horrified expression we had. 

“…well! Let’s call that a day, huh?” 

Mr. Thatcher’s tone, happy and cheerful as it had been since we arrived, didn’t quite match the look on his face. We were excused from the room, if not escorted out quickly. I ignored the stares of all the people in the room the best I could. A slow rise of conversation began filling the room and bodies began moving about their workday once again.

We didn’t say a word to each other all the way to our cars. The feeling that we had done something wrong was overwhelming. Though I guess Reggie is the only one who should feel guilty. And though we bonded the most we ever had today, it now felt like we didn’t know each other again. Hailey murmured something along the lines of ‘that was crazy’, to which Reggie and I slightly chuckled, but an awkward smile from us both capped the conversation. We waved goodbye to each other and went our separate ways.

I haven’t spoken to them since. I even checked the online discussion board for the class, but they were both offline. I’m now sitting in my old room at my parent’s house.  I didn’t feel like driving back to my university dorm tonight. I’m just a little shaken up. But I wanted to post my experience about what happened today, because of what has happened since. 

After I got settled in, I went into the yard and stared up at the night sky. When you lay in the backyard, the privacy fence was just tall enough to block out the neighboring houses and hills. You could only see the stars, moon, and the silvery dome of the observatory. What was strange, was that the lights were usually off by now. But If I hadn’t been so fixated on the sky, I never would have seen the stars begin to vanish. 

It was subtle at first. A small patch of stars began disappearing. Oval in shape; a black void grew larger. The ominous presence of something large continued to grow, swallowing every star above me. It took nearly sixty seconds before the black void enveloped the entire sky above me, including the moon. Everything around went me in my parent’s yard went black. I couldn’t even see my feet when I looked down. Then, a few flickers popped, every so often in the sky. Stars began reappearing, but abnormally. Artificially. The Orion Constellation wasn’t near the celestial equator. The Big Dipper was far smaller than it should be, and it was- backwards. Nearly a minute after the glistening night sky had vanished, blocked out by whatever filled the entire horizon, had now reappeared. And though everything seemed normal, I know whatever just arrived was still there. It was just…camouflaged. 

There was no wind. Bats, Birds, Dogs, and rodents; not one animal was making a sound. The ominous presence of something large looming over my city was unbearable. It filled the sky, easily larger than our entire state. An expertly crafted level of technology designed for stealth. After a while, I broke from my frozen state and came upstairs. I’m not sure what’s going to happen next, but I can’t help but feel scared. I ran inside after realizing my cellphone lost service and the wi-fi went out. Luckily, for now, I can still connect my laptop through an ethernet connection using broadband. 

When I was outside, I noticed the observatory was still open. Its lights illuminated off the hill it sat. I wonder if they’re trying to figure out what’s going on too. Anyone who’ll listen, just be ready. Find something to defend yourself and your family with if you want to survive a little longer. Lock your doors. Watch the sky. 

As Steven Hawking once said, “If aliens ever visit us, I think the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America, which didn’t turn out well for the Native Americans. We only have to look at ourselves to see how intelligent life might develop into something we wouldn’t want to meet.”"

Pomona (10/10): Got paired with an alumni who was also accepted into the POP program before; He literally said ""If -no when- you get into Pomona..."" lmao; We shared same interests in statistics and data; He was so nice, and it went for over an hour

Yale SCEA (8/10): Interviewer and I shared a lot of the same interests in global health equity; He said he appreciated our nice conversation; went for over an hour

Harvard (7.5/10): I think the interview went well, but I wish I could have refined some of my responses. Overall, I feel like I still established a strong connection with my interviewer with what I discussed; went for 45 min.

Columbia (7/10): It was more of a conversation than an interview, and they asked only a few things about me. They were nice tho. Went for around 45 min. 

Berkeley Regents (8.5/10): The professor was super eager to learn more about me and my work! Liked our conversation even though it was a bit short, around 30 min.

---

The Core was, well. 

Crowded. 

All of the nation-states that were going to be, were. Any grand campaigns of conquest were either sharply abridged, or so couched in pre-emptive treaties setting limits on interference, that corporate mergers were often bloodier and more abrupt. Skirmishes rarely did damage beyond scorching paint jobs on ships or stations, or demolishing defensive structures that were slated to be decommissioned anyway.

All of this … enforced civility was as a mite infestation in Fleet Admiral Lastborn’s pheromone-spiracles. The bad mites. The ones that sing in the dark. 

Lastborn was just that. The least. The last to burst from the waxen hive-cask in the Flesh-Emperor’s final brood before he Ascended into the Ever-Growing Throne of Blood-Alloy in the Bone-Porcelain Palace*. 

Unlike all of the other progeny, the many, many other progeny who earned their blood-metal and skeletal-ceramics through litigation or commercial default, Lastborn was more… hands-on. Starting as a cadet in the antipiracy fleets, and working up to possessing a full fleet of underlings, all passing up tithes of the blood and flesh shed under their command, Lastborn was starting to accrue enough material to find a sector of relatively free space and declare a new dynasty. 

Which looped back around to where we started. The Core was rather crowded, and the Arms, while vast, weren’t much better, by and large. Civilization tended to fade out as it got further from the energy and resource rich central regions, where one could almost live entirely off the raw vital powers sleeting through the skies, but the Arms had their own merit: Room. Especially the Dead Arm. The other Arms had their minimal hegemonies, clusters of life scattered around in their own cute, primitive way. 

This Arm, however, was avoided by the bustling life of the core in the way that urban civilization tended to avoid the septic treatment bogs down-wind and down-stream of any proper metropolis. The territory was acknowledged, it was patently there. People just looked at you like your eyebrows were full of phosphor-leeches if you said you wanted to spend any extended time there. 

Sure, there were the sims and theater about the sectors of that space being full of ghosts, of all sorts of primitive cultures’ worth of monsters and bogeymen and bogans. Of creatures without heart, without soul, who lacked even the decency to quarantine themselves to upper management. 

But only the truly gullible would believe those hatchling-stories to be true, and most of them were safely secured in contractual internships in regional palaces. 

Surely, this was the true gold of rulers: Free Real Estate. 

Departure papers for his fleet, its supplies, and its exorbitant amount of experimental weaponry was filed, crosschecked, and signed off. A small planet’s worth of personnel, enough stellar tonnage to make a reasonable start on a planetary superstructure formed up. Hundreds of slip drives reached out, grabbed the fundaments of reality, and gave them a light twitch. 

Slipspace isn’t too bad, especially if you’re used to the Deep Core. You’re just out of phase with reality enough that solid objects in your path are more of a gravity-assist matter, unless you manage to clip a singularity dead-on, but that rarely happens anymore. 

— 

Staging Point One, 10 percent of the Arm out from Core Civilization-bounds 

The first stop, and already the journey was proving profitable. The Fleet  discovered what may have been the origin of some ancient tales - vast creatures of energy fields and stellar dust, who sang at each other in a chorus of modulated background radiation. The more science-minded ships veered out, slowly, and managed to get close enough to boarding-harpoon several of the creatures in their mass-nuclei, and reel them in before the rest Slipped out of the region. The research-prone crew were expressing cautious optimism that the creatures could provide insight into improving shp systems. 

—  

Arm Sector One, 12 percent of the Arm from the Core Civilization-bounds 

The first Landfall of Lastborn’s People out the Arm, and they discovered natives! Primitive, nature-bound natives, but still. It proved the hidebound Corestuck peoples wrong: Life was here, and even managed the semblances of proto-civilization. The bipeds seemed to be some sort of hybrid of endothermic wildlife and some of the endemic sessile life that subsisted on what meager stellar energy could be harvested. They certainly lived in and among some of the sessile sun-harvesters, some of which were as large as some of the megapolitan structures on the home worlds.  

These novel primitives, without any technology to their credit, had somehow accrued stores of various industrially-useful ores, held in storage-trees throughout their settlements. Perhaps to be used for ornamentation, or religious purposes.  

In any case, the landing teams were able to relieve them of the burden of the ores, with hardly any collateral arson. The provisions-stores were largely emptied when found, however.  

The world was logged as a vital raiding-site, for future metals and provisions needs, and the fleet proceeded on.  

—  

Arm Sector One, 17 percent from the Core.  

At first, the Fleet thought they had discovered a graveyard, the demolished ruins of an ancient space battle. One set of ships lacked any uniform build, rather looking like the makers had simply bolted, welded, or strapped on whatever equipment they currently needed to a blank patch of hull. They lacked beauty, until you pulled back and took in their utilitarian functionality. The other set of ships … flowed. Each was a shining piece of art, and they all fell within a few clear design-classes. All looked distinctly lifeless, moving only in the general relative-motion of space. That understanding was promptly corrected when the salvage vessels came close enough to the two distinct sets of ships to begin boarding procedures, and were promptly shut down under a torrent of electronic warfare, seething back and forth between the various vessels. Boarders in hardened, simplistic shuttles were able to access the craft. The utilitarian ships were dark inside as well, and appeared to be crewed by squat individuals who were likewise covered in somewhat randomly-afixed but highly functional equipment. Attempts to retrieve some of those crew for further analysis ended … poorly, however those who attempted were … mostly … returned, when unarmed reinforcements showed up. On the other vessel, the crew appeared to be tall, thin, graceful synthetic beings. Attempts to capture them resulted in all crew in the vicinity blacking out until they woke in the nearest airlock.  

Still, the fleet profited by the sheer payload of electronic mayhem that had been unleashed on them in their time near the ships. For now, though… time to move on before the locals took any more exception to the interlopers.  

—  

Arm Sector Three, 20 percent from the core.  

The fleet was still together, mostly.  

Strategic exploration and raiding, however, had devolved to banditry and opportunistic raids.  

The Arm wasn’t empty.  

Three sectors in, while there was far more distance between the stars than the Core would ever see, every star and many points between boasted at least a minimal outpost of what must be the dominant empire of the arm.  

Aside from a few scattered planets that boasted absolutely nothing in the way of weaponry, every least outpost put up the sort of fight usually expected from battalions or fleet divisions; they all seemed experts in their chosen forms of combat. Worse, their response times were improving. It was almost like the Fleet could be tracked through Slipspace. But that should be impossible, as Slipspace is detached from reality in most ways…

“Admiral! Native fleet emerging from Slipspace, they appear to have followed us, matching us by tonnage and coming in hot!”  

“Priority Slip, Staging point Thrice in Section 4. GO. We can’t take another battle in our current condition!”  

—  

Arm Sector Three … Not Section 4 Staging Point Thrice  

The stars were … wrong. 

Navigation control was reporting errors across their consoles, which was also concerning. But the stars were wrong. Too many of them, moving too much, almost as though… oh.

A fleet of fleets wrapped around Lastborn’s fleet, the least of which easily outmassed his flagship. So many ships, in all sorts of makes. Most, fairly standard. Others stuck out, however. At either ends of the sphere, and it truly was a sphere closing behind them, the utilitarian, brutalist ships from a sector away, and the sweeping, shining works of art. Craft of living wood and steel, swimming through space in smooth patterns with the spaceborn energy-creatures, singing energy songs to each other. A whole sky of ships, similar but different, in different paint-patterns. Seething throughout, smaller ships that were only being noticed when they passed between the fleet and the hulls of their more vibrant cousins. All slowly maneuvering around the Fleet.  

Waiting.  

The Fleet Admiral became aware of a presence that had faded into existence, a hologram of one of the locals looking at the screens from just behind Lastborn’s shoulder. Radiating, somehow, smug.

The hologram walked around to the middle of the bridge, and spun once on its heels, taking in the locations and dispositions of the crew.  

“Well, then.” The creature spoke in textbook Core Trade, with traces of accent.  

“First off, welcome to our patch of space; we were somewhat expecting you. Every few generations, some Core folk look at that map of yours, decide all of that empty space needs to be filled in, and come burning up the Arm. Some more literally than others.”  

“Thank you, by the way, for keeping the property damage to a relative minimum. Most of your predecessors were not nearly so restrained when they made it to Human space.”

“H-HUMANS?! You can’t be, that word was an old folk word for ‘treacherous scum’ from an ancient nomadic culture…”  

“Considering how we’ve got on with some of our neighbors, and our own, harsh but fairer than most of us would prefer to admit.” The hologram paused, pointing at a crewman outside what should have been the periphery of its vision. “You need to put that gun down before I do something unpleasant to you.”   

A shot rang out, energy leaving ripples in the image as it passed through the figure, then splashed relatively harmlessly on the far bulkhead.  

The suited human sighed, gestured at the crewman, and … unpleasantness happened. “Now. Assuming we scanned your physiology correctly, that should all mend within a week or so, if you stay on light duty. But you won’t be doing that again for now.” The hologram… how was it being projected inside a ship where there shouldn’t be any projectors? It rapped its knuckles on a console (wait, how?) to get the crew’s attention once more, as the disarmed crew was escorted to the medical facilities.  

“Now. What we have here, is a failure to communicate. Lots of piracy, property damage, some people had their bodies shut off, and if we hadn’t developed some new technologies with some friends of ours, they’d have been even more upset about that. Or perhaps not, we’ve not had word back on that one. Either way, you’ve been a bother since you hit our space.”  

“Your space? But we’ve only recently hit your section of the arm. We *did* raid all those other races, but that’s a different jurisdiction, surely?”  

“No, you’ve definitely been in our territory since you had a grab at some of the Swimmers. Most thought it was an amusing game of tag, but I understand the one you managed to center-mass with a magnetic harpoon is carrying a grudge.”

“You mean those things are humans? What about the plant-things? The cyborgs, and the robots?”  

“Yes, yes, yes and a relatively newer yes. We have the knack of altering our environments to be more convenient to us, but we also took to altering ourselves to fit our environments. Bit of a matter of pride when we manage it.”  

“But… most of you were fighting at least one other faction out here. *I can see some of the ships using low-powered weaponry on each other right now*!” Lastborn was starting to scrabble at straws as understanding fell away.  

The glowing man, tangible as he wished to be, leaned on the console now. “Yeah, we do that. And those guys are being relatively behaved right now; usually their squabbles would be shaking us from here. The trick is we have rules, hard-learned and hard-enforced. They keep us from doing anything too drastic, because any time someone breaks them, everyone else lines up to give them a proper kicking.”  

“And… We broke those rules?”  

“And you broke those rules. Not too badly, though. Didn’t kill anyone who’d stay dead, didn’t steal anything that couldn’t be restocked in the next trade convoy. So that is why you’re getting this.” The man pulled a hardcopy booklet, printed in what turned out to be Core Trade, from his jacket and handed the surprisingly material object to the increasingly stunned Fleet Admiral. “We also have the coordinates of a cluster of worlds off in a less-used corner of our space. Plenty of room to settle in, get situated, and be ready for the welcome.”  

“The … Welcome?”  

“Yup. See… the factions of Humanity are kind of like a family. A large, extended family. A somewhat intoxicated one. Rowdy. Running around all over, being loud. Sometimes, it’s a bit hard to tell who’s on what team, due to the piled on mank. But we’re also good sports, usually, when everyone else is.” The man pulled another object out from nowhere, a somewhat squashed spheroid, and pushed it into Lastborn’s midsection with slightly more than necessary force.   

“You and yours have the opportunity. A cluster to set up your new home. Loud neighbors, but we’ll look out for you as long as you stick to the rules. Kind of like an extended family playing rugby on holiday. And you are welcome to the human scrum.”

I recently finished 3rd year and will start the 4th year or 7th sem from the next month. I also recently completed an internship (focused on data science) in SRI-B just a few days ago.

However, if I am completely honest with myself then I feel like I have massively f\*\*\*\*d up with regards to my studies. The last 2.5 years have been completely online, and in my college mass cheating was rampant during the online sems. So I passed all the subjects like discrete structures, data structures and algorithms, compilers, machine learning, comp organization and architecture etc easily without putting an iota of hard work. I know now that it was a phenomenally stupid decision to indulge in such acts, but what's done is done; I can't change that. I got a reality check even during the campus internship drive, as I got selected for the internship quite late as compared to my peers. But in the end since I got the internship, I reverted back to the old ways after a couple of weeks of work.

But now, I am completely worried about my upcoming campus placement drives for which the coding interviews will be held sometime around first or second week in October. So between now and then I have a time of 3-3.5 months. In this duration I HAVE to improve my skills and clear my concepts for clearing the coding rounds as well as interviews, if possible even for big companies like Google and Microsoft. My question is, how do I plan this out? Is there any excellent resource or something which I can use to read up on concepts like Graph algorithms, BFS, DFS, DP etc. and then also solve questions.

Any help will be completely appreciated. Thank you."
vpov6h,2,2022-07-02,AWS DevOps Engineer,ahmedtm1,devops,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/vpov6h/aws_devops_engineer/," I'm preparing for AWS DevOps Engineer Exam. I found some questions on internet but not the solution. Pls help me in getting the best solution for these questions.

1- A company has several S3 buckets in their AWS account. On creating a new bucket, the DevOps team member with full admin. access is still shown an error about the buckets’ limit reached. Why is this error occurring and how can this be resolved?

2- A DevOps intern sets up a Free-Tier AWS account. He buys a domain from GoDaddy and imports it into Route53. He only uses t2.micro for a few hours, an application load balancer, RDS database and S3 bucket all which come under Free-Tier. Even his data storage and transfer limit is under Free-Tier limits. Despite this, he received a $0.50 bill at the end of the month. Please explain why he was charged and for what service?

3- A company needs to shift their MongoDB server hosted on MLab to AWS. The company's Software Architect asks you to suggest how to use MongoDB on AWS. You recommend him DynamoDB but on reading the documentation, Software Architect suggests DynamoDB would require several lines of code changes because the querying syntax is completely different from MongoDB and that there is no time for these changes so he needs a solution that requires bare-minimum code changes. Please suggest two other options of how you could host MongoDB on AWS. Pls suggest any managed solutions available for it on AWS.

4- While browsing a freelance website you see a paid task where the client mentioned that his website used 6GB ram out of 8GB ram on his EC2 instance. He is using 4 core CPU and the CPU usage graphs shared by him shows that CPU in the past 1 month has never crossed 3% usage. He is looking for a cheaper alternative on AWS. What would you assume his current instance type is? Which instance would you suggest to him? How much cost savings would he approximately have? Pls explain your logic and calculations.

5- You just joined a new company and the finance team cannot understand why they are getting an AWS bill every month when all the 10 servers in their AWS account are in a stopped state. They do not have any other AWS Sub Accounts or Services running. Their account only had 10 EC2 servers and you confirmed on the EC2 console that all of them are stopped. Being an awesome DevOps support engineer, how would you immediately identify the cause of this bill without looking at the billing console?

Edit: 3 more questions. Thanks for helping. Really appreciate it.

1-  You are working on making a presentable CloudWatch Dashboard over the weekend and show your boss about how all metrics are visible on the CloudWatch Dashboard. Your boss is impressed. He gets your team a new PS4 with a 55 inch TCL TV. Since you do not intend to play PS4 all day, you consider using the chrome browser in the TCL TV to open CloudWatch Dashboard on the big screen. However, you do not want to sign-in to the AWS account on your TV because it is not safe. You also do not want to make a user with CloudWatch permissions because you would need to login using that User-ID as well. You need to find a way to display the CloudWatch dashboard on the Chrome browser without signing in. How do you display the dashboard you made on CloudWatch on the TV? 

2-  Your university teacher is interested in giving an assignment to his students around ""serverless"" technologies on AWS as he has read several posts about this on LinkedIn. He assigns you an assignment by giving you a CSV file with 10,000 records of a database and tells you to use a server-less AWS service to query the database. You read about lambda and ask your professor if lambda would be the right choice, however, he declines because he wants to type SQL statements on the screen and query S3 data without designing any application or software. Unlike every other student, rather than searching on Google, you look for AWS Console to see if you find a relevant service. What would your answer be? Which service would help you do the task you are assigned? 

3-  Your developers are using an EC2 instance and to make the application architecture decoupled, they have also started using AWS Simple Queue Service - FIFO queues for this purpose. The AWS NodeJS tutorial that they referred to requires an AWS Access KeyId and Secret Access Key. Naturally with you being the AWS Administrator, they turn to you for keys. What do you do according to AWS recommended best practises?"

I know C and MATLAB and I’m working with C in my spare time to get better. I’m keen on leaning other languages though, I’m under the impression that those languages aren’t used that often in industry.

I really want to keep programming because I feel passionate about it, but I also really want a job that takes advantage of my qualification as an engineer. I would also like it if job / career path allowed for remote work (possibly working for a US company).

Well I'm in a kind of dilemma, a few of my friends have got internships in ML and are working on opencv and such with a 10k stipend, this internship was offered by the college I guess with some tie up company. Would it be good to assume that the college will provide more such opportunities in the future too and prepare for ML positions? Or should I work on Backend as suggested in the other post and then gradually work towards moving to ML?

Considering this, should I focus on Backend development in the holidays or try making projects in Machine Learning?

vpsrwg,0,2022-07-02,I partially disagree with putting technical assessments for internships,CannotStopMeOnReddit,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vpsrwg/i_partially_disagree_with_putting_technical/,"I get that big and popular companies who have a lot of intern applicants, have only room for an N amount of interns. So they provide technical assessments to select the best among them. But even smaller companies require their interns applicants to do them.

School and internships are the places you're supposed to learn the skills. Doing your home work on those subjects are part of it. As I understand it, a lot of companies ask technical knowledge of students  that weren't even covered in the school courses.

So when they're at the technical interview, they're just overloaded with questions they don't have an answer to and just fail miserably. I don't find it weird at all for them not succeeding.

It looks like students are expected to be practicing code for 24/7 to be good enough for an intern position and then after that they're allowed to gain the working experience.

There's already a shortage of software engineers, this gap is never going to be filled if companies set requirements like these. Why don't companies put intrinsic values before extrinsic values?

When a student is motivated and passionate to learn more, the knowledge will come, they will gain the working experience and in return, the company will eventually get devs to strengthen their company.

It's highly unlikely a second year CS student doesn't have any technical knowledge. It could be that they have decent experience in JavaScript and Python, but lack the skills for working with C# or Java. So they should get the opportunity to learn this knowledge at their internship.

**Unless it's for the matter of having limited intern positions,** I don't see the reason for companies putting up such barriers for students, because it's not contributing to society in general. The students of today are the workforce for tomorrow. Students need somewhere to start."

Tl;dr : Title pretty much sums it up

I (25F) met my boyfriend (27M) during college, are together for 2 years now and we want to marry. He is Spanish, which I knew would be a problem for my APs from the very beginning, but since at least my AD and his side generally were always more open minded for some reason I thought they might at least tolerate it after giving them some time. Boy was I wrong.

Because of the pandemic half of our relationship was basically long distance and I came back home last Christmas to finish my internship online and graduate. I did everything to keep it a secret, because I knew they would drive those 3 hours and drag me back home if they found out ( I studied abroad).

I couldn't bear the paranoia, stress, pressure, guilt and frustration anymore and decided to tell my AM in February. I did so in the car so she couldn't get physical if things escalated. I had a boyfriend before in high school when I was 18 and back then she imprisoned me at home for 3 years, didn't let me go anywhere besides school and took my phone. My AD would threaten to kill him if he saw him, so I should be careful. With that in mind I was obviously scared to break the news to AM, but to my surprise she just chuckled and started the car. ""What were you even thinking?"" she said and we went shopping as if nothing happened.

Everything went down ofc when we were back home and she told my AD. 

He started saying that he sent me abroad even though the whole family was against it, that he trusted me, that he happily supported me financially and by getting my stuff back and forth by car and this is what I do to him. That I always had a fixation with those foreigners since childhood, I never had friends from our own community, my lifestyle was always like theirs, my interests, hobbies, you name it. And now I even want to marry one them, with a language barrier, and completely cut my connection to my roots. He thinks I only want to marry him to escape. AM didn't talk to me for 2 months after that.

I understand where he is coming from, especially the problem with the language barrier, but I do not understand how he chooses to raise me in a western country, with only my uncle and his family here and expects me to be like ""one of us"" when I don't even know my own mother tongue? I am a 2nd gen immigrant child. Despite this I still know my roots, my values and who I am (which my boyfriend supports 100%), but that is not enough for him. Both AP don't want to see him.

I graduated yesterday and am in the process of looking for jobs and after I have one, I will have to choose. Either I stay, my family stays in tact, I don't destroy their ""pseudo reputation"" and my siblings wont have to deal with the consequences of me leaving. Or I choose to leave and live the life I want for myself at the cost of losing my entire family (except maybe a few individuals), AD will go back to his village in his home country and who knows what happens to the rest. How am I even going to break the news to the family in our home country? If I tell them, I am a disgrace, if I don't tell them I am still a disgrace but on top of that I regarded them as insignificant enough to not tell them about something so important like marriage. 

I feel like I am trapped, crying my eyes out since I told AP. It would be much easier to leave them if I genuinely hated them, but they are actually really good parents and rather progressive, the only thing they are still stuck in the middle ages is when it comes to this kind of topic with daughters and dating and reputation etc. This is so heavy for them that they would cut me off over it and I am so confused, I feel guilty towards them but also like a coward towards my boyfriend."

I like the job and the people but I just don't see myself staying in this country for a long time. I want to move to Australia/New Zealand as soon as possible. I will get a promotion next March so I decided to keep the job until September (so that I can get the promotion, spend the summer in Europe with my family and avoid starting out in Australia during rain season). This company has always treated me with respect so I will give them at least a 2 months notice so that they can hire someone new who I can train before leaving.

I am 24yo, I have a bachelor in business administration and a master in supply chain management. I started out in this company as an intern and got promoted after 6 months.

No success.

A) want someone experienced 
B) Are unpaid but you have to work long hours anyways
C) you have to pay them for internship

* 7+ years of IT/cyber exp.

* TS Clearance.

&amp;#x200B;

1. I keep hearing about opportunities with FAANG and startups, but if someone like myself wants to stay in the government world to utilize my clearance, what is available to me regarding internships? Would I have a better shot as an FTE with contracting companies or the DoD due to my clearance instead of an internship? I am working full-time with a family, so I don't know if I can drop my salary to no lower than $100K. 
2. Are there remote jobs for TS roles? Does anyone have experience or know anyone working remotely in this space with a clearance?
3. What job titles should I be shooting for during courses? (Developer, Software Engineer?)
4. Am I missing anything?

I'll be taking **1 course per term**. I'm planning to start in the Winter of 2023. Thoughts on my set-up?

vq7f8w,1,2022-07-02,Should I continue being friends with her?,Gloomy_Performance71,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/vq7f8w/should_i_continue_being_friends_with_her/,"I need help. Sorry in advance for this long post, but I'll try to make it as thorough as possible. Let's call my friend Lola. Lola and I have been pretty close friends since our Junior year in HS. I have some priorities and she has hers, but that's her business. However, it pains me to watch her make the wrong mistakes. And sometimes, I may push too much into her business, but that is my human nature. My mom is the same exact way. I am the type of person who likes to plan things out before they happen and I research things before committing to things especially when it comes to College. It's hard to notice when I go too far. Here are some examples...

Lola and I have been studying Business Administration in HS together and are both majoring in Business in College. When completing our Freshman Year, we've been majoring in Accounting because our moms told us to. After completing one course that involved Excel, I realized Accounting wasn't for me, so I changed majors to Business Management concentrating in Human Resources. However, Lola stayed in Accounting because she didn't know what else to study in Business. Fast forward to our Sophomore Year at CC, we're both transferring to the same 4-year University next semester for our Junior Year. We've talked about rooming together and being closer, but things are changing between our customs. I've done my research on my major, booked my housing assignment at school, gone to orientation, and enrolled in my classes. On the contrary, Lola has waited to sign up for her orientation and was only able to get the orientation AFTER mine, which resulted in her only getting some of the classes she needed in order to progress in her academic career. I asked her if she's still doing Accounting, and she chose to change her major to Supply Chain Management and that she'll have to stick with it no matter if she likes it or not because it'll be her Junior Year and she won't be able to afford to go to college another semester/year if she changed her major again. She also decided to not get a rooming assignment and will be commuting to school every day since we both live about 30-40 minutes away. I only found out until I initiated the conversation and asked whether she got a room with me or not. Therefore, she will not get a meal plan, which will mean that we'll have even less time to see each other. Usually, she doesn't tell me any details about what she's going through, even though we're both going through the same thing at the same time and wanted to room together next year.

She also relies a TON on her parents. When I asked her how her orientation went, which I had to ask her about, she told me she went with her mom and never spoke with other students. Normally, prospective students make one or two friends at orientation but she never branched out at all. I went by myself, and so did most of the students there. I am deeply introverted, and I was able to make about five new friends.

To mention another example, I got a retail job during the summer after my Freshman Year in college to get job experience. Lola did not. She always made sure to do summer courses to stay ahead, but she might have a harder time finding at least an internship without any job experience when competing with other applicants. This summer, I was looking out for her and asked what she was doing this summer. She said she wasn't doing summer courses this summer and was taking a break. So I asked was she working then because most college students either work or do summer courses over the summer when they have the chance. She said no. So she'll just be ""sitting around the house being unproductive."" I worked to save up for my dorm decorations, and I almost got everything I need and am still making purchases.

I then asked her what was her plan during college, and if she was getting internships. She told me she may be getting internships, but I know she'll struggle to get them. However, I kept it to myself. When she asked me what I planned to do, I said that I planned on getting internships and getting multiple certifications either before or after I graduate. I think I made her sound like she had no idea what she was doing, but how couldn't I?? She was able to enroll in about two classes with me next semester, but it'll be awkward because we won't be nearly as close as we used to be.

Lastly, the friendship is dying because she doesn't communicate with me. She doesn't text me at all and doesn't let me know anything. I'm not needy or anything. I tried not texting her for a while to see if my absence mattered at all to her, and she never reached out to me for two months.  

We just seem to be on different pages. She seems to be too reliable on her family and doesn't want to branch out. She's also screwing herself over because she's not researching her major before committing to it. I feel like I'm trying to stay friends with her, but she keeps ""pulling me down."" Then she doesn't even communicate with me. Our friendship is like a candle whose flame is dying out. I have a strong feeling our friendship will die once the school year starts.

Can someone tell me if I should keep conversing with her? I tried keeping this friendship alive, but it seems things on her side have made the ship sink a little."
vq7yyq,1,2022-07-02,How should I ask my boss for a decent raise?,Gobirds_95,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/vq7yyq/how_should_i_ask_my_boss_for_a_decent_raise/,"I’ve been employed at my new job as an Accountant for over 6 months now. The pay at first was surprisingly low (less than what I made as an intern at another firm). I didn’t mind though because I had dual income from my girlfriend at the time but since then we have split up. Now a few factors besides this have made me want to ask for a raise.

1. Hyper inflation has made rent prices impossible with my current salary. 

2. I am living on my moms couch in a 1 bedroom apartment.

3. The cost of day to day necessities are burning a giant hole in my pocket.

4. My co worker is leaving next week and i am going to be tasked with all of her clients assignments thus much more work. 


I am very grateful for my job but the pay is honestly insulting for my education and experience. I would like to stay with this firm, atleast through next tax season but I must make more to get my life back on track.

I want to ask for a $3-$5 raise per hour but am unsure how to approach my managers. What should I say and do?"
vq8x19,0,2022-07-03,"Turning a new ""leaf"" (confession)",ZERREOD,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/vq8x19/turning_a_new_leaf_confession/,"I doubt this will get much tract but that's ok. A little background: I'm in the US as an 20 year old woman who was part of the 2020 HS graduate class, the covid year. I did the most idiotic thing, I took a year in work for 11.25 full time first job and didn't go to college becuase I was scared. Then my job scared me becuase I don't want to commit in long term management in a conservative retirement town. I also didn't choose college at first becuase I was avoiding financial strain, but it was mostly cowardice.

I quit my job and made a plan to break into IT becuase it interested me, and something I wanted to commit to. I still didn't go to college and instead went through a 10k 6 month bootcamp for fullstack web development. Which is now quite possibly my worst move. I completed the bootcamp and moved onto job hunting.

For the past year and half I've spent my time polishing my resume, completing small certificate qualifications and even completed a unpaid intern position for a research study to propose growth plans for a startup. I really started to get into the full swing of job hunting for about 3 months. By now I've had well over 100 applications in various intern and entry level positions.

In all of that I've had 4 responses, which have all dropped contact. 2 are currently pending with 1 being a guarantee phone interview. And research says this inactivity is my fault. I'm getting desperate now, and I quite literally am at odds unable to compete with over qualified candidates or college graduates. In my situation, I cannot move forward without admitting debt for college.

I have been unemployed for 2 years now, I've shot myself in the foot and let it rot. I was stubborn becuase I thought I could get the skills college would have got me for free, which I have somewhat but it's not enough. I'm tired and scared becuase I don't have the leniency to be at the mercy lucking my way into a position to break into media or tech.

It hurts becuade it's disillusioned me even with my hobbies which are all tech based, and it really is not for me. If you're still reading this don't bring out the violins. No one can get a job right now even with a degree. The US is in a recession and art is undervalued, a symbol of a failing system. And it hurts even more I'm turning my back on what I was fighting to get, my plan failed. A plan I could identify my goals and dreams.

Now I either plan to study forensics or criminology or something in cyber security because I still want something to have control over choosing, something I can equally commit to. And something I am still interested in. This time in college.

Thanks for taking time to read this, if you made it to the end. My mom always tells me ""keep on swimming"". So it's worth it to always keep trying your best."

vqb66e,1,2022-07-03,"My old employer called me back 6 months after I changed jobs, what do I do?",adorooo,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/vqb66e/my_old_employer_called_me_back_6_months_after_i/,"I (24F) will start with a small introduction which could help understand the situation. I grew up in a north western European country and did my BSc in my home country. For my MSc degree I moved to a country in southern europe, because this country is famous for an industry i always wanted to work in and allowed me to specialize in that field already during studies. I studied business administration and management at a university level for 5 years.

When I graduated (2020), the covid situation was very bad and I had to find my first job during the pandemic. After months of searching I finally found an internship at an important company in the industry I wanted to work in. After 6 months of internship, I got hired by the company, but not for the position I was initially taken for, but for another position that had to urgently be filled and I honestly did not like as much, but given the job market I decided to sign anyway in order to have a work contract and not have to start the internship cycle again at another company (that’s how it works in this country).

So I work in this job for another 10 months and really do not enjoy the tasks, which are too operational, require 24/7 availability from my side as I’m the only one in the company that knows how to do certain things and access certain programs etc. I did often find myself working in evenings, weekends, in hotels while on vacation and this made me very stressed. I asked the HR at my company to help me with a job rotation, because I did see some other positions inside the company I thought I would enjoy. They did not help me though, because they knew I would leave an immediate gap in my team which they did not seem to want to find a solution for.

At the same time I got contacted by another company in the industry for another position, and ended up receiving an offer. The pay was slightly better and as I was close to burn out so ‘out of panic’ I decided to quit my job and accept this new offer. The new work place seemed fine, but I noticed the amount of work was so little that basically I find myself sitting at the office staring at my screen for 70% of the time. I told my manager already 3 times that I could take on more tasks and she told me there will be more busy periods in the future and to be patient.

Last week I received a message on linkedin from a former coworker of my former company, asking me if I would be available for a short call. Turns out the position I expressed my interest in some months ago at my first company became available and both the manager of that position as well as the HR would be interested to discuss the possibility of me coming back.

I’m quite confused at this point. It’s been 6 months I’ve been in my new role and even though I love my new manager as a person, I spend most of my time doing nothing and do not see any way to grow in that company. On the other hand I feel embarrassed going back to the company I just left 6 months ago, maybe ruining my cv..? I also have to say the atmosphere at the company at the time was not amazing, but this depended mainly on my position and the way it was set up and the main stakeholders I was in touch with. In the new position, I would work mainly with the manager, whom I know quite well and is extremely nice. 

I’m just here to ask some advice to more experienced people as I feel very lost. There’s several things at my new company that I absolutely do not like and likely will not change. I already get shivers though when I think about telling my manager about leaving after just 6 months.. also, how do I go about negotiating the salary at my old workplace. I used to be quite underpaid (there was a standard junior salary for people just finishing their internships), but I know of people getting more decent salaries there too. Given though that they know I used to earn X just 6 months ago, can I expect an offer much better than the one I accepted at my new company? At my old company I earned X, my new company offered me X +20%, and I would want the old company to offer me at least 20% more with respect to my new salary as well (given the inflation AND knowing I could be the perfect candidate for the job, already knowing the company, manager and the main tasks I would be executing).

Sorry for the long story, but just hoping to get some advice, i have a 30 min call scheduled on tuesday with the HR and manager I both already know."

On Mondays I meet with my mentor, talk about how I'm doing, if I'm having any problems, etc

At one point he started telling me a story about hsi internships. He says his first one, his boss told him if he ever had a question to ask. So he did. He asked a lot, got his work done. At the end, he didn't get the offer because he wasn't independent enough.

 Then the next internship, he went out of his way to ask 0 questions. Said he was pretty lost but still got some work done. They offered him employment. 

He follows this up and says to me ""I've got a challenge for this week. I want you to really get into a problem, get lost in it and dig your way out of it. Get comfortable with not knowing the answer to a problem immediately""

I didn't take it as an insult, but I could tell it was because I was asking too many questions last week.

What I'm wondering here is if anyone could kind of give more advice on this. Like what kinds of questions are ok or even good to ask, which are not.

I followed his advice this week and was fine, but i had other questions I wanted to ask but I couldn't tell if they were the kinds of questions he was referring to.

Anyway, Id like to end with an offer from this place, so any help is greatly appreciated

EDIT: Wow thanks for the responses guys. I've read all atm and they've been really helpful!"
vqc8rt,4,2022-07-03,What do I do about the fact that my mom wants me (13f) to start working because she wants to retire early?,Patient-Weekend-420,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/vqc8rt/what_do_i_do_about_the_fact_that_my_mom_wants_me/,"I apologise for any grammatical errors, I am typing from a phone.

Hi, I'm 13f from India. My mom is a teacher, my dad recently started a business (growing slowly but steadily).

Context:
 
In 6th grade, the pandemic hit. My mom's salary was halved and my dad did not yet own a business and was unemployed. They'd got me coding classes before and therefore wanted me to earn. Instead of politely explaining this to me, my dad asked me to make a website for a random school owner he knew.

He asked me to make it on wix, and said I'd get payed. That felt unfair to me, since I was getting paid it don't feel okay for me to make it on wix, and I said I'd rather do it in HTML. After some back and forth, we went on to do other things, then in the evening, he again asked me to make a website. I was sleepy back then (I'd gotten up early that day) and fell asleep. When I woke up and went out to the living room, my parents were staring at me. They told me I had to make the website. My dad was crying when I fell asleep, and my mom was telling me this angrily. My dad then explained that the school owner didn't pay me, he was going to pay me with his money because he wanted me lazy butt to get up and work. This affected me. 

For a month or so (I don't exactly remember) after that, I was making profiles on freelance websites. In hopes of earning some money. I remember this one time it was around midnight, and I was on my laptop when I found some people who wanted a web developer, I filled it up. There was this one question ""why should we give you this job?"" I remember writing something along the lines of ""My mom works 14 hours a day and still doesn't get payed properly I need this job to help her."" Even writing this is making me cry. I couldn't even sign up because I was 11 and underaged to get a job :(

I think after some point my parents realized they were wrecking me, or maybe they gave up and thought I was hopeless. I still get the occasional ""you don't do anything, you don't study, don't clean the house, learn from your sister!"" It still makes me cry sometimes.

Present:

I have a math teacher that I absolutely adore. He's so kind and nice and he has a passion for what he teacher which is rare. He found out I know js some time ago, and has been telling me to progress further in it so I can get a job. I respect that he cares, but some things he says are just not true. He says if I work on programming, I wouldn't be in India, I'd be so much better off. He might be right, but I think I wouldn't be able to handle all the stress.

He told me mom about all this, and my mom is pretty toxic in my eyes. She always exaggerates my achievements which make me feel like my achievements weren't enough (2 weeks gets changed to 2 months, silver medal gets changed to gold, etc). She's alos a hypocrite. I'm an introvert and she brags about it to her friends and relatives, and proudly mentions that it is a sign that I'm very smart, but when I refuse to go out with her because I want to study, she gets angry at me. She also probably thinks that when I'm alone in a room I'm watching pron and talking to boyfriends, which I inferred from her way of talking and her not leaving me alone at home many times despite the fact that the area is safe.

She wants me to do this course on programming, which guarantees an internship (according to the website). I'd be fine if it were just that, but she doesn't want me to work for the experience and knowledge, she wants me to work because she wants to quit. She says stuff like ""next year we're going to live with your relatives, I'll pull you out of school and I'll quit, then I'll moniter you the entire day"". She doesn't even know the difference between a website and a software. She goes around telling relatives I can make softwares.

She says that I can either start working in a few months, or graduate school, then 4 years of college, then get a job. She doesn't understand that I have no will to work. I'd rather starve to death. I just want to learn stuff. That's it."
vqc94f,1,2022-07-03,Should I quit my first post-grad job?,fk8319,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/vqc94f/should_i_quit_my_first_postgrad_job/,"Hi, hope everyone has had a good week. I’ve got a dilemma and need advice, please. I graduated college May 2021 and in September 2021 I relocated across the country to the west to start my first real big girl job. I knew when I applied and accepted that I would have to relocate, and I was fine with it. I’m a very independent person and not very close with my parents so it wasn’t too difficult to say goodbye. 

Now here I am almost a year later and I hate it here. The most difficult part is I haven’t really been able to make any close friends and I just really miss my old friends who all moved to the same city and are living it up while I sit in my FOMO. I mean to have a 9-5 and then not have a single fun thing to look forward to after or on the weekends is just really lonely. I also had to leave my family dog behind that is the light of my life. 

What made it impossible to adjust is that even though I was told I have to relocate, nothing in my job ever requires me to actually go into the office. I just work from my extremely overpriced apartment that I can’t even afford to make feel like home. And to make matters worse the job is pretty miserable. I feel like I am doing basic intern grunt work and there is no work-life balance because I keep getting other people’s random work piled on me. 

I’ve asked many times if I can just be remote and move back home but the answer is always no for reasons that they never justify. 

The reasons why I’m hesitant to walk away are because 
1. It took so long to find a job for after graduation. It was the only offer I got and everything else was rejection after rejection and I’m terrified I won’t find anything else. 
2. I wanted to tough it out for two years to finish the program I am in. I hate leaving something unfinished and I don’t want to have to explain why I didn’t see it through in future interviews. I find it embarrassing and I don’t want to have any regrets. Like what if in 5? 10? years I see what my past coworkers are doing and the company and think that could’ve been me? 
3. I think it’s such a cool company, I really wanna give it more of a shot to see if I find my place because I don’t think I’ll ever find a company this cool and exciting and innovative. 

I’ve been traveling back and forth to my hometown and spending lots of time back home since I basically only WFH and they still won’t let me just be completely remote. So instead I blow money on my apartment and cross country flights every other month. Since I started this job, I haven’t even been able to save anything due to my cost of living and the entry level salary I’m earning. I’m technically net-negative since I started so compensation really wouldn’t be a reason to stay either. 

Well if you made it this far, thank you. I guess I just don’t know if I should prioritize my happiness now and give up potential future success at this company or if I should be miserable for another year and give it a longer shot."

I just finally graduated from Bachelor Degree in Engineering Physics. My bachelor thesis topics pertain to Process Design and Control, Mathematical Programming, and Deep RL.

My performance during study is not so excellent. I have a 3.32/4 GPA and finish the study in 5 years instead of normal 4 years.

Honestly, I would like to start my career abroad and hopefully also attend a Master's degree there while working.

My parents and one of their acquaintance told me to create a LinkedIn account to realize those aforementioned aspirations.

However, I still am not quite sure about the way things work on LinkedIn, the practical use of it, and whether it is possible for a fresh graduate like me to get proper job and opportunities through the platform.

Also, I don't feel like my experiences or CV are standing out or good enough to be taken notice. I barely took any professional work other than a single 3 month internship at National Nuclear Research Center and recent part-time job as Physics Olympiad Tutor.

What is your take on this? Do you have experiences on LinkedIn, especially for Fresh Graduates? What differs LinkedIn from other social media? Is having LinkedIn worth trying for me?"

I am a 23 year old African American female and I have a question about the path I should par take. I started my IT journey in 2019, got my Google It support cert, and decided to pursue cybersecurity. I got my sec+ and joined year up in 2021 where I had a SOC analyst internship position for 7 months. Safe to say I did not like the job but the environment was awesome everyone was helpful I just didn’t like sitting there waiting for a ticket to pop up and threat hunting was ok but just not what I want to do. What I want to do is be able to build and maintain infrastructure and that’s where the cloud has come in. AWS just makes more sense to me. So it’s 2022 and I didn’t get hired because the company is being bought and I’m looking for a job. That was 7 months ago, now I’m thinking about throwing in the towel, I noticed it’s very hard to get into cyber, not saying cloud is easier, but I feel like I have a better chance getting into cloud. I’ve applied to cloud and cyber roles these last 7 months and gotten interviews but no offers. The question I wanted to ask is should I keep going for cyber or should I drop It and focus on cloud? I’m already doing labs and posting the write up on my blog. What junior/entry level position in the cloud should I look for? Or should I settle for what I don’t want like help desk because I need a job and it’s been half a year already. I’ve been networking and all that good stuff but nothing yet and I’m getting discouraged. Everyone is getting there role except me."

vqk7dc,11,2022-07-03,Exposing the Disney College Program,Repulsive-Mixture348,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/vqk7dc/exposing_the_disney_college_program/,"Hi everyone. I recently left my role in the Disney College Program and I thought I would come on here to honestly tell y'all what that experience was like. This is going to be extremely candid, raw and honest. Some of y'all may not like that, and may not like to hear this, but it is all the 100% truth and I feel like needs to be told.

 For starters, when we applied, there was no interview, but in order to accept our program we had to pay 400 dollars. The 400 dollar charge was required whether we lived at Flamingo Crossings (Disney's housing for CP's) or off property in our own place. We paid 400 dollars to come work for Disney, which already was odd, but I didn't think much of it at the time. Then, for those living at Flamingo they went over the rent and roommate processes. For rent, it is automatically taken out of your paycheck weekly, meaning you may only have 50-100 dollars to live on after that. The room layouts come in 4x4 (4 bedrooms 4 bathrooms), 4x2 and 2x2 (2 beds in a room with one bathroom per each room). They tell us that we have the option to pick if we want our rooms to be gender neutral or not, and that we have the option to link with one roommate with the exact same start and end dates. What they did *not* tell us is that if you don't link with someone and pick gender neutral they will often throw you with anyone. There was a case where an 18 year old girl got put into a 2x2 with an older gentleman, as you can finish college at any age. You don't get told who your actual roommate is until 1. You arrive there on your check in date and 2. You sign your lease. Even if you link with someone, they don't bother to tell you that you may still not get out with them. So if you're in a 2x2, you may each get put with the other roommate. For many people who have called Flamingo asking them about roommate issues, or their potentially unsafe matches, the response they have been met with is ""We cannot guarantee your safety"". 

Then there was disability accomodations. My friend, who ended up being my roommate, has celiacs disease. When she went to get an accomodation for her program they connected her with a case advocate who worked to help her get a role that was safe for her. For any of y'all that don't know, celiacs disease makes it so you have a serious autoimmune reaction to gluten, even if it's just simply inhaling particles of it in the air, and it can put you out for weeks or send you to the hospital. Well so she told them her main accommodation she needed was a role that wasn't food and beverage. So where did they put her? Food and beverage. Then she had to fight tooth and nail to get them to change that. Mind the fact this was *before* we even started working. 

Now let's jump to working and arriving. After you move into housing, you are required to go to Traditions, which is the start of your program. At Traditions our speaker blatantly told us ""There will be days you feel depressed, anxious, and not want to go into work. But you *will* go into work regardless. And you are to always smile. Why? Because the guest doesn't care. The guest doesn't care what you're going through"". After that they sent us to get our ID's made, and to finish our registration process. They had us line up to each be asked individually for our information. One part of that was that they asked up, out loud in front of everyone, what our weight was. As you can imagine that was fun for lots of people. 

Jumping into working: they tell you that you are to have 24/7 availability. The rule is that they need to give you at least an 8 hour window between shifts. That's their only rule. So they can schedule as much as humanly possible, for as long as they want as long as they give you 8 hours between then and your next shift. It is extremely common for CP's to be scheduled upwards of 9 days in a row with no breaks, and shifts up to and often times over 12 hours. One of my friends got scheduled 14 days in a row, with almost every day being a 12 hour shift out in the blazing Florida sun, and one of the days even was a 15 hour shift. One of my other close friends went into their leader to tell them how exhausted they were with their program and how they felt they needed a break, and that their mental health was declining and their leader responded ""you came here to work, so get back out there and work"". She has type 1 diabetes and when her number got super low one day she told her leaders she needed an Early Release because she didn't feel good, to which they told her ""The only way we will let you go home is if you are passed out on the ground or need an ambulance"". Now I will say, not every leader is like this, as with anything in life there are good leaders and bad leaders, but sadly this experience with leaders being like this was all too common to hear about at Disney. It also wasn't uncommon to be force extended. At my location we had a huge amount of people one night get force extended, and some of them got put on shifts up to 17 hours. Which in Florida this all surprisingly is legal.

Throughout the program, you learn very quickly that people start self-terming (quitting) left and right. Tons of people came to the program thinking it would help their depression and anxiety because Disney is their happy place, only to have their conditions seriously worsened and have to leave. The vast majority of CP's you talk to will tell you that they hated working at Disney. Some will tell you they liked it, but also hated and noticed all the aforementioned issues. I fell in the middle, as I did love assisting guests, and my coworkers, but that was the only thing holding me on. Disney also gave us a self admission pass, stating that our one benefit of the program was getting into the parks for free. Well that would've been great if we weren't pretty much blocked out from the parks all the time, and we're given the time between shifts to even go. The vast majority of the time we wanted to go to the parks, it was fully blocked out meaning it was unavailable to even go. We were allowed to put in ADO, meaning approved days off, on our HUB to state that we needed specific days off in the future. If we got our ADO approved it meant no matter what we were to not be scheduled. Well I once got my ADO's approved for a week, 2 months in advance, where relatives were coming down including my 90 year old grandma. Only about a week or so before those dates they decided ""nope, we take it back"" and scheduled me anyways, so I had to fight to get at least a few of those days off and then call out the other days which put points on my record. 

For me, due to operational need in the middle of my program they told me my role was being switched. I didn't mind this too much, but then they put me in a role that my disability accomodations didn't allow for. So going to work each day in food and beverage caused me to have allergic reactions  each day. After a week of that I advocated and said I cannot go back into this location, it's too dangerous for me, and that I need my role switched. The leave administration team told me that if I brought in a doctor's note saying I needed a certain amount of days off, that they would honor those days off until I got my role changed and that the points wouldn't go on my record. So I sent in a doctor's note, and they told me I had those days approved and they would tell my leaders and get me in contact with my case advocate so we can do a role change. Seven days into that I get a call from my internship coordinator telling me that they told me false information and that every day I've been out, points are going on my account and that if I don't go back into work soon I would be fired. So I hustled to get in contact with my case advocate and rush to get my role changed, and after 2 weeks they finally got things changed. They told me they would go on and contact my leaders to get the points removed from my account, because a certain amount of points means you're fired, regardless if it's your fault or not. Did they get those points taken off? Nope, instead my case advocated actually ghosted me. My friend had the same case advocate and he ghosted them too. 2 months later and still no points had been taken off and I had gotten reprimands for something that wasn't my fault. 

Jumping forward, after a while in my new role, which I actually did enjoy at times because of my coworkers, I decided that the pros of this definitely did not outweigh the cons and I decided to self term. Since leaving the program, my mental health has gotten exponentially better, I have time to actually enjoy Florida and do things that I am passionate about. Not everything in the program was bad, I had some leaders I personally really liked, my coworkers have become some of my best friends, and I got the experience of being able to truly see what I do and don't want for myself. I am greatful that I did the program because it taught me to advocate for myself and it also made me realize my self worth and what I do not need to put up with. It also gave me an opportunity to move to Florida, where I will be staying from now on. I choose to have a healthy relationship with Disney now and have decided for me, Disney is only for visiting, not for working and I don't want to mesh those two things in my mind anymore. I guess the moral here is that if something doesn't feel right, and you feel like you're being mistreated, you do not need to sit there and let that happen, it is okay to say ""this is enough"" and leave something when it's seriously affecting your mental and emotional well-being."

So I sent in a doctor's note, and they told me I had those days approved and they would tell my leaders and get me in contact with my case advocate so we can do a role change. Seven days into that I get a call from my internship coordinator telling me that they told me false information and that every day I've been out, points are going on my account and that if I don't go back into work soon I would be fired. So I hustled to get in contact with my case advocate and rush to get my role changed, and after 2 weeks they finally got things changed. They told me they would go on and contact my leaders to get the points removed from my account, because a certain amount of points means you're fired, regardless if it's your fault or not. Did they get those points taken off? Nope, instead my case advocated actually ghosted me. My friend had the same case advocate and he ghosted them too. 2 months later and still no points had been taken off and I had gotten reprimands for something that wasn't my fault. 

Jumping forward, after a while in my new role, which I actually did enjoy at times because of my coworkers, I decided that the pros of this definitely did not outweigh the cons and I decided to self term. Since leaving the program, my mental health has gotten exponentially better, I have time to actually enjoy Florida and do things that I am passionate about. Not everything in the program was bad, I had some leaders I personally really liked, my coworkers have become some of my best friends, and I got the experience of being able to truly see what I do and don't want for myself. I am greatful that I did the program because it taught me to advocate for myself and it also made me realize my self worth and what I do not need to put up with. It also gave me an opportunity to move to Florida, where I will be staying from now on. I choose to have a healthy relationship with Disney now and have decided for me, Disney is only for visiting, not for working and I don't want to mesh those two things in my mind anymore. I guess the moral here is that if something doesn't feel right, and you feel like you're being mistreated, you do not need to sit there and let that happen, it is okay to say ""this is enough"" and leave something when it's seriously affecting your mental and emotional well-being."

Hi everyone. I recently left my role in the Disney College Program and I thought I would come on here to honestly tell y'all what that experience was like. This is going to be extremely candid, raw and honest. Some of y'all may not like that, and may not like to hear this, but it is all the 100% truth and I feel like needs to be told.

 For starters, when we applied, there was no interview, but in order to accept our program we had to pay 400 dollars. The 400 dollar charge was required whether we lived at Flamingo Crossings (Disney's housing for CP's) or off property in our own place. We paid 400 dollars to come work for Disney, which already was odd, but I didn't think much of it at the time. Then, for those living at Flamingo they went over the rent and roommate processes. For rent, it is automatically taken out of your paycheck weekly, meaning you may only have 50-100 dollars to live on after that. The room layouts come in 4x4 (4 bedrooms 4 bathrooms), 4x2 and 2x2 (2 beds in a room with one bathroom per each room). They tell us that we have the option to pick if we want our rooms to be gender neutral or not, and that we have the option to link with one roommate with the exact same start and end dates. What they did *not* tell us is that if you don't link with someone and pick gender neutral they will often throw you with anyone. There was a case where an 18 year old girl got put into a 2x2 with an older gentleman, as you can finish college at any age. You don't get told who your actual roommate is until 1. You arrive there on your check in date and 2. You sign your lease. Even if you link with someone, they don't bother to tell you that you may still not get out with them. So if you're in a 2x2, you may each get put with the other roommate. For many people who have called Flamingo asking them about roommate issues, or their potentially unsafe matches, the response they have been met with is ""We cannot guarantee your safety"". 

Then there was disability accomodations. My friend, who ended up being my roommate, has celiacs disease. When she went to get an accomodation for her program they connected her with a case advocate who worked to help her get a role that was safe for her. For any of y'all that don't know, celiacs disease makes it so you have a serious autoimmune reaction to gluten, even if it's just simply inhaling particles of it in the air, and it can put you out for weeks or send you to the hospital. Well so she told them her main accommodation she needed was a role that wasn't food and beverage. So where did they put her? Food and beverage. Then she had to fight tooth and nail to get them to change that. Mind the fact this was *before* we even started working. 

Now let's jump to working and arriving. After you move into housing, you are required to go to Traditions, which is the start of your program. At Traditions our speaker blatantly told us ""There will be days you feel depressed, anxious, and not want to go into work. But you *will* go into work regardless. And you are to always smile. Why? Because the guest doesn't care. The guest doesn't care what you're going through"". After that they sent us to get our ID's made, and to finish our registration process. They had us line up to each be asked individually for our information. One part of that was that they asked up, out loud in front of everyone, what our weight was. As you can imagine that was fun for lots of people. 

Jumping into working: they tell you that you are to have 24/7 availability. The rule is that they need to give you at least an 8 hour window between shifts. That's their only rule. So they can schedule as much as humanly possible, for as long as they want as long as they give you 8 hours between then and your next shift. It is extremely common for CP's to be scheduled upwards of 9 days in a row with no breaks, and shifts up to and often times over 12 hours. One of my friends got scheduled 14 days in a row, with almost every day being a 12 hour shift out in the blazing Florida sun, and one of the days even was a 15 hour shift. One of my other close friends went into their leader to tell them how exhausted they were with their program and how they felt they needed a break, and that their mental health was declining and their leader responded ""you came here to work, so get back out there and work"". She has type 1 diabetes and when her number got super low one day she told her leaders she needed an Early Release because she didn't feel good, to which they told her ""The only way we will let you go home is if you are passed out on the ground or need an ambulance"". Now I will say, not every leader is like this, as with anything in life there are good leaders and bad leaders, but sadly this experience with leaders being like this was all too common to hear about at Disney. It also wasn't uncommon to be force extended. At my location we had a huge amount of people one night get force extended, and some of them got put on shifts up to 17 hours. Which in Florida this all surprisingly is legal.

Throughout the program, you learn very quickly that people start self-terming (quitting) left and right. Tons of people came to the program thinking it would help their depression and anxiety because Disney is their happy place, only to have their conditions seriously worsened and have to leave. The vast majority of CP's you talk to will tell you that they hated working at Disney. Some will tell you they liked it, but also hated and noticed all the aforementioned issues. I fell in the middle, as I did love assisting guests, and my coworkers, but that was the only thing holding me on. Disney also gave us a self admission pass, stating that our one benefit of the program was getting into the parks for free. Well that would've been great if we weren't pretty much blocked out from the parks all the time, and we're given the time between shifts to even go. The vast majority of the time we wanted to go to the parks, it was fully blocked out meaning it was unavailable to even go. We were allowed to put in ADO, meaning approved days off, on our HUB to state that we needed specific days off in the future. If we got our ADO approved it meant no matter what we were to not be scheduled. Well I once got my ADO's approved for a week, 2 months in advance, where relatives were coming down including my 90 year old grandma. Only about a week or so before those dates they decided ""nope, we take it back"" and scheduled me anyways, so I had to fight to get at least a few of those days off and then call out the other days which put points on my record. 

For me, due to operational need in the middle of my program they told me my role was being switched. I didn't mind this too much, but then they put me in a role that my disability accomodations didn't allow for. So going to work each day in food and beverage caused me to have allergic reactions  each day. After a week of that I advocated and said I cannot go back into this location, it's too dangerous for me, and that I need my role switched. The leave administration team told me that if I brought in a doctor's note saying I needed a certain amount of days off, that they would honor those days off until I got my role changed and that the points wouldn't go on my record. So I sent in a doctor's note, and they told me I had those days approved and they would tell my leaders and get me in contact with my case advocate so we can do a role change. Seven days into that I get a call from my internship coordinator telling me that they told me false information and that every day I've been out, points are going on my account and that if I don't go back into work soon I would be fired. So I hustled to get in contact with my case advocate and rush to get my role changed, and after 2 weeks they finally got things changed. They told me they would go on and contact my leaders to get the points removed from my account, because a certain amount of points means you're fired, regardless if it's your fault or not. Did they get those points taken off? Nope, instead my case advocated actually ghosted me. My friend had the same case advocate and he ghosted them too. 2 months later and still no points had been taken off and I had gotten reprimands for something that wasn't my fault.

ACT: 33 (may take again because my math was a 29. 35 in English and reading and 34 in science) 

SAT (not sending) 1350

gpa- currently a 4.14, will be a 4.35 or so whenever I graduate. 

Our valedictorian system is really weird and isn’t based off GPA, But I’ll be top 10% at the very least. 

CLASSES- 
my freshman and sophomore years I wasn’t taking very hard classes just because I had a different career part at the time and I wanted to go into digital design and marketing, so I won’t include my classes for those years but I’ll mention I’ve always been one math class ahead of the majority of my grade. 

JUNIOR YEAR-

-I want to add our school only offers one more AP not listed and that is AP PSYCH. 

———ESSAYS———
Writing is 100% my strong suite, and I’ve had a lot happen to me in my life that that I could 100% tie into my passions. For example, being from such a small area our police are horrible individuals and I’ve witnessed a lot of corrupt actions in my community. During covid I had time to reflect on this and it really sparked a passion that had already been there, but needed that push. I’d say they’ll be 8-9s. 

——LORS—— (Planned) 

APLIT Teacher- We’re super close and I’ve had her write multiple letters for me before for summer programs, QuestBridge, etc. I’ve also excelled in her close because I’m pretty good at Literature and writing, and she’s told me she thinks super highly of me. She knows me well enough that I think the letter would be a 9/10. She’s also the advisor of the newspaper I created. 

Gopo teacher- he loves me and also calls me patient all the time bc he struggles with my pronouns. Told me he wants me to do it again and has always praised me as being one of the best students in there. 7/10 

Hopefully someone from this program I’m going to this summer, but that’s just a maybe. 

Counselor- This is just if I need another one. Knows me pretty well but absolutely hates me. 

Vice Principal- Currently working on my main project w her so hopefully by the time I need her to write it it’ll be a 8/10. Project will be described below! 
———————————
EXTRACURRICULARS/HOBBIES
-We The People Competition- super passionate about this one. Goes hand in hand with our GOPO class, and I’ve spent a ton of time and effort on it. Also combines a lot of my interests such as politics and writing. 

-Newspaper Team- Created a school newspaper, head of it. Put my own money forth to create a website in an effort to save paper. Hand picked the team after talking w teachers to see who the strongest writers, editors, etc were. 

-Cake Baking and Decorating- 
This one is 100% a hobby. I’ve done cakes for about 5 birthday parties at this point, and I started it to make some pocket money and help out my family as well. 

-Creative Writing- 
I’ve wrote like 50k words of creative writing at this point lol, it’s just something I do on my free time but it’s a huge interest. 

— College Readiness Program —
This one is still in the works and will start at the beginning of the next school yeah, hopefully. It will be a non-profit type thing with multiple sections that all focus on different things. We have a really low amount of students who go to college, and our state universities have super low graduation rates. This is the program I’m working on with my vice principal. It was my idea but I brought it to her so I’d have someone in administration to help get it through. It will hopefully set up college days, spread information, and have a section that focuses on ACT/SAT prep that will let our tutors get volunteer hours. I’m going to have to take it outside of school sadly but I rlly want to make it work. 

CERT- digital design/social media worked for our community emergency response team. 

Student Council, Hopefully President next year.

National Honor Society

WVGHA- Governors academy for top like 100 students in the state. My classes have an emphasis on politics and government with some literature on the side. 

I’m a QuestBridge prep scholar and won a scholarship for the Stanford Envision Law program. 

I want to add that we don’t have clubs and I’ve never been able to do sports or anything that required travel due to how low income we are, like we literally didn’t get a car until like two years ago. A Lot of my opportunities have been self created because of this.

1)I  did a paid internship at 2021 from September to December  but for some reason in the **CRA website** it  says "" 2021 RRSP deduction limit **$0.00""**

Screenshot: [https://gyazo.com/bb3c5f7208b0d7cbde22212b3b4585e9](https://gyazo.com/bb3c5f7208b0d7cbde22212b3b4585e9)

I also got a permanent job and I deducted my salary to my RRSP so that my employers can match up to x %/. If my RRSP contriubtion room is somehow 0 dollars, will I get penalized by telling my employer to match my RRSP?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

2) For TFSA, I'm double checking, in the **CRA website** it says

Unused TFSA contribution room at the end of 2021:

**$0.00**

That means **I used up** all my TFSA contriubtion room, correct? I just need to add 6k for 2022's contirubtion room to be maxed out by the end of 2022."
vqmoyz,26,2022-07-03,This one’s fun : my APs lied to me about when my father went to medical school to ‘push me harder’ and now I’m on the edge of a cliff,OpenScratch5758,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/vqmoyz/this_ones_fun_my_aps_lied_to_me_about_when_my/,"The peak of Asian parenting : here it goes. It’s a long one but.. 

It sounds irrelevant to the story but I used to be a gifted kid. Now, I’m not Einstein but I was 12 in the ninth grade and even though academically I did well I was far too young. Everyone was discovering sex and their first boyfriends and I was still a child. 

When I mentioned something about a blowjob, my parents freaked out and I repeated a year but I’m still relatively young for my peer group but I was still pushed pretty hard.

All my friends are 21/22. I am in in my senior year of college and I’m 20 right now. I was 17 when I first began college and have always been so determined to be perfect academically I let myself go physically. When I swam in my school, it was for my college apps. I was going to be a surgeon, didn’t work out. 

Because I wanted to be a surgeon as a child, I spent the summer of 2016 studying and prepping myself for med school and whatnot. I was 14. After the SAT, I was so exhausted, I slept for 13 hours straight. At one point, my parents would hide energy drinks from me because I was up all night studying obsessively, and chugging red bull when my parents woke up at 6 am. I was terrified of not doing well in school. I drove myself up the wall. 

When I realised I wouldn’t be a surgeon and told my parents mid college they were so disappointed in me, I stress drank and ate again. When I said I was an English major, oh dear god I drank for 2 days straight. When I said I couldn’t graduate in 3 years, they were disappointed again. I tried adderall for the first time, stayed up for 72 hours, smoked a cigarette and passed out outside my dorm. 

All this is my fault not my parents but my dad is an incredibly successful business man from a middle class background and I’ve always aspired to be like him. 

I changed career paths three times and I was so shamed for it (even at 15/16) that Im a painful perfectionist now and cannot give myself free time. The entire reason I changed career paths was because no one ever really asked me to choose and I never let myself until I was 18. And my closest friends being older than me really influenced me in terms of drinking/drugs/ eating etc. also they were 21/22 and their friends were 24/25. For a while I was a 19 year old among 22- 24 year olds. I thought I was so fucking cool. When I was 15, I was dating a 19 year old. Thankfully I had the good sense to dump and report him when he pressured me into sex but I was so young I didn’t even see anything wrong with it. 

I’ve never gotten a bad grade and I’m completing 3 internships right now but my mental health is in the toilet. When school is full time, I work two jobs even though I’m not on fin-aid.  

Like I said all these are a series of my bad decisions but a reason I push myself so hard is once, when I was 15, I was told by my parents my dad began med school at 16 and that’s why he had an early start in life and I’m a late bloomer. I’ve always been age conscious and feel halfway to the grave at 20.

Not to mention - I was branded as the problem child because I said an 8 pm curfew was too early and I wanted 3 ear piercings. This was a label that was used quite often along with the golden child label. 

Recently, I mentioned the fact that my dad began med school at 16 to my parents and they looked kind of confused. Then I reminded them of the day they said that to me and they sheepishly said it was a lie to motivate me and my dads timeline had been completely ordinary. Now, I don’t think that takes away from what he’s done but they’ve always pushed the narrative that he was a child genius on me. 

Now, ny sister isn’t like me and she’s more easy going and less stressed. She’s 19. However, she’s in her first year of college and her grades aren’t as good but she just isn’t subject to this kind of scrutiny. she skipped school and went bowling. It doesn’t help that I partied as hard as I studied. I never went bowling, sightseeing or shopping wirh my friends. It was either partying or studying. 

If it makes a difference, I’m the first grandchild to both sides of my family and the one ‘the hopes and dreams are pinned on’. 

Also : even if just one person sees this and realises they need to take a break, it’s a victory : for 20 years, till yesterday I didn’t BELIEVE in the concept of burn-out. I was proud of it too - the fact that I pushed myself till I almost died.

I literally thought it was something people made up even when I was so burnt-out I nearly killed myself. I convinced myself burn-out was an excuse for idiots. I’ve been burnt out for 5-6 years. Don’t be me - take a break and parents can really ducking suck."

Families and teachers directed me to study it because of my science and maths classes being good. At least I've got to take wide variety of classes from Western Art and Music to Economics, widening my area of interests and getting to know more stuff about world's different topics.

If you'd ask me to contest the significant events that the college taught me, single handed, I'd say the opportunities I had to experience abroad studies.

1- My first long time internship in Germany, 3 months. Blessed to improve my skills on how to form strong connections in a country that I don't know the language of, socialize, spending the 1k$ to my rent, healthy nutrition, going out with friends and having fun plus putting some bucks to my savings account. Felt 10x more productive, happy, free, sexy.

2- 6 months of erasmus studies in Madrid, 3 years ago. It's almost impossible to explain how in every aspect I improved myself. It really feels like those 6 months are the only months that I could remember exactly moment by moment. Maybe the only months that I've felt alive, real and free in my whole life. Being vulnurable and opening my real self to people, having pure, meaningful and long lasting sexual and friendly relationships, getting out of my boundaries, travelling, falling in love, crying a lot, regretting a lot, getting to know bunch of people, learning a language and a culture that I've fallen in love and learnt, sleeping in the streets, learning new skills, drinkink, smoking.. and trying to balance everything with health and school, basically surviving with less then 1- 1.5k$ monthly. The way that I felt and the person I became in that period of my life was by far the best version of myself that I've always thought of.  But as soon as I came back to my home country, Turkey, everyhing has eventually faded off. 

Right now, I'm living with my mom in Turkey. I've got a job as a Junior JS developer a month ago and I'm trying to learn it as quick as possible to use it as a gateway for my exit from this sh\*thole.  It's been 3 years that I'm thinking to become that person again but I don't know how to do it. I've seen that with the economical, political and social state of my country has, it's almost impossible for me to excell myself again in any aspect possible. Personally I'm seeing living in EU again, especially Madrid, as the only option for me to achieve my goals and happiness.

I don't know where I'm doing wrong. I consider myself as a skillful individual that more or less capable to learn stuff quickly. I speak 3 languages, learning German now to increase it to 4. I've got an Electronics Degree, I look good and healthy, I have good relations with people I know and tend to leave good first impression. I know how to survive abroad.. 

I hope I was clear enough both introducing myself sincerely and my desires. I am widely open to all negative and positive feedbacks and advices. Love you all &lt;3"

So I enrolled in a bachelor of advanced computer science at Griffith University on the Gold Coast starting February this year and was wondering if I would be at a disadvantage for career prospects upon graduation from my undergrad?

I don't have the money/resources to move interstate/elsewhere so I just decided to stick to my local uni which is Griffith. Only thing though, is I don't know how to feel about this institution's computer science reputation because it doesn't really have one?

Are there any downsides of attending what seems to be a poorly recognized CS degree program in terms of internship opportunities/chances of landing a job at big tech right out of graduation? I have pretty big ambitions and want to hopefully work at a large tech firm (FAANG/Australian equivalents like Atlassian) one day/out of graduation.

Does anyone have any experience hiring from/experience with finding a CS job with this university at all? If worst comes to worst I *could* probably apply for unimelb/unsw/an institution with a widely recognized CS program in Australia, get in and move for undergrad but I'd 100% rather not because I don't have any money/it would be extremely difficult to support myself.

Any insight would help, thanks a lot!"

First of all, if this isn’t allowed to post, feel free to delete, in that case I’m sorry.
Not that is out of the way, I’m kinda struggling with the following;
Recently I’m finally diagnosed with ADHD, and having the prescription really gets me into programming again. It’s a bit late for a career switch, I’m 30 with a pretty decent job and a mortgage, so an internship isn’t possible moneywise. Programming always has been an interest for me, but when I had to decide in school, I couldn’t proceed with an IT career since I couldn’t sit still or focus all day, sadly 

But of to the question. Since my meds I’m really starting to pick programming up again. Previously I had somewhat decent experience in HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Right now I’m following a course on Udemy; Python from zero to hero 2022. 
As I notice myself, I do starting to have some difficulties picking it up, which in turn makes it harder to set myself to learn again. 
What language do you guys/girls recommend for something just on the side? As mentioned above, I don’t really think I’m in the position to switch careers, or go back to school again. Although I wouldn’t mind a career switch.
If it makes any difference, I’m from The Netherlands where almost all jobs in the IT are in shortage.

TLDR; what would you recommend as starting language for someone who just wants to learn programming on the side?

Any advice is welcome, and thanks to all in advance"
vqokdr,1,2022-07-03,Does a Master's Specialization matter?,Crazy_Holiday3262,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/vqokdr/does_a_masters_specialization_matter/," Hello,

I am a computer science undergraduate student and I am not sure what I want to pursue exactly, whether it be research or industry. I am feeling out different paths to see what I would like to do and currently, I am doing an internship in industry and do not find it enjoyable. I figured doing a master's program with a research thesis may be a good idea to see if research is something I am interested in pursuing, rather than committing to a PhD. If I do not enjoy research at the graduate level it will at least provide me with the experience to pursue a more specialized field in the industry.

My question is if I were to do a master's and enjoyed the research, how important is the topic of the master's degree if I wanted to pursue a Ph.D. in Computational Neuroscience? Does it matter, if I pursue a general master's in computer science instead of a specialized master's program? Or is the coursework and thesis I end up pursuing more important than any specific program?

Should I just focus on the research opportunities provided by the program and what the faculty is currently researching at the university or is that only relevant to PhD programs?

Thank you for any guidance."
vqovo5,246,2022-07-03,Exposing the Disney College Program (VERY Honest and Raw),Repulsive-Mixture348,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/vqovo5/exposing_the_disney_college_program_very_honest/,"*if y'all would be so kind as to crosspost this, we can get more views*

Hi everyone. I recently left my role in the Disney College Program and I thought I would come on here to honestly tell y'all what that experience was like. This is going to be extremely candid, raw and honest. Some of y'all may not like that, and may not like to hear this, but it is all the 100% truth and I feel like needs to be told.

 For starters, when we applied, there was no interview, but in order to accept our program we had to pay 400 dollars. The 400 dollar charge was required whether we lived at Flamingo Crossings (Disney's housing for CP's) or off property in our own place. We paid 400 dollars to come work for Disney, which already was odd, but I didn't think much of it at the time. Then, for those living at Flamingo they went over the rent and roommate processes. For rent, it is automatically taken out of your paycheck weekly, meaning you may only have 50-100 dollars to live on after that. The room layouts come in 4x4 (4 bedrooms 4 bathrooms), 4x2 and 2x2 (2 beds in a room with one bathroom per each room). They tell us that we have the option to pick if we want our rooms to be gender neutral or not, and that we have the option to link with one roommate with the exact same start and end dates. What they did *not* tell us is that if you don't link with someone and pick gender neutral they will often throw you with anyone. There was a case where an 18 year old girl got put into a 2x2 with an older gentleman, as you can finish college at any age. You don't get told who your actual roommate is until 1. You arrive there on your check in date and 2. You sign your lease. Even if you link with someone, they don't bother to tell you that you may still not get out with them. So if you're in a 2x2, you may each get put with the other roommate. For many people who have called Flamingo asking them about roommate issues, or their potentially unsafe matches, the response they have been met with is ""We cannot guarantee your safety"". 

Then there was disability accomodations. My friend, who ended up being my roommate, has celiacs disease. When she went to get an accomodation for her program they connected her with a case advocate who worked to help her get a role that was safe for her. For any of y'all that don't know, celiacs disease makes it so you have a serious autoimmune reaction to gluten, even if it's just simply inhaling particles of it in the air, and it can put you out for weeks or send you to the hospital. Well so she told them her main accommodation she needed was a role that wasn't food and beverage. So where did they put her? Food and beverage. Then she had to fight tooth and nail to get them to change that. Mind the fact this was *before* we even started working. While I was working I distinctly remember a time when I was having an Asthma attack and had to go offstage to use my inhaler, and so I went to our managers office to let them know, and they saw me standing in the doorway wheezing, out of breath using my inhaler, and they ignored me and kept talking amongst themselves for a solid 5 min before saying ""can we help you...?"". They also would frequently have us stand outside during lightning storms with no regard for our safety.

Now let's jump to working and arriving. After you move into housing, you are required to go to Traditions, which is the start of your program. At Traditions our speaker blatantly told us ""There will be days you feel depressed, anxious, and not want to go into work. But you *will* go into work regardless. And you are to always smile. Why? Because the guest doesn't care. The guest doesn't care what you're going through"". After that they sent us to get our ID's made, and to finish our registration process. They had us line up to each be asked individually for our information. One part of that was that they asked up, out loud in front of everyone, what our weight was. As you can imagine that was fun for lots of people. 

Jumping into working: they tell you that you are to have 24/7 availability. The rule is that they need to give you at least an 8 hour window between shifts. That's their only rule. So they can schedule as much as humanly possible, for as long as they want as long as they give you 8 hours between then and your next shift. It is extremely common for CP's to be scheduled upwards of 9 days in a row with no breaks, and shifts up to and often times over 12 hours. One of my friends got scheduled 14 days in a row, with almost every day being a 12 hour shift out in the blazing Florida sun, and one of the days even was a 15 hour shift. One of my other close friends went into their leader to tell them how exhausted they were with their program and how they felt they needed a break, and that their mental health was declining and their leader responded ""you came here to work, so get back out there and work"". She has type 1 diabetes and when her number got super low one day she told her leaders she needed an Early Release because she didn't feel good, to which they told her ""The only way we will let you go home is if you are passed out on the ground or need an ambulance"". Now I will say, not every leader is like this, as with anything in life there are good leaders and bad leaders, but sadly this experience with leaders being like this was all too common to hear about at Disney. It also wasn't uncommon to be force extended. At my location we had a huge amount of people one night get force extended, and some of them got put on shifts up to 17 hours. Which in Florida this all surprisingly is legal.

Throughout the program, you learn very quickly that people start self-terming (quitting) left and right. Tons of people came to the program thinking it would help their depression and anxiety because Disney is their happy place, only to have their conditions seriously worsened and have to leave. The vast majority of CP's you talk to will tell you that they hated working at Disney. Some will tell you they liked it, but also hated and noticed all the aforementioned issues. I fell in the middle, as I did love assisting guests, and my coworkers, but that was the only thing holding me on. Disney also gave us a self admission pass, stating that our one benefit of the program was getting into the parks for free. Well that would've been great if we weren't pretty much blocked out from the parks all the time, and we're given the time between shifts to even go. The vast majority of the time we wanted to go to the parks, it was fully blocked out meaning it was unavailable to even go. We were allowed to put in ADO, meaning approved days off, on our HUB to state that we needed specific days off in the future. If we got our ADO approved it meant no matter what we were to not be scheduled. Well I once got my ADO's approved for a week, 2 months in advance, where relatives were coming down including my 90 year old grandma. Only about a week or so before those dates they decided ""nope, we take it back"" and scheduled me anyways, so I had to fight to get at least a few of those days off and then call out the other days which put points on my record. 

For me, due to operational need in the middle of my program they told me my role was being switched. I didn't mind this too much, but then they put me in a role that my disability accomodations didn't allow for. So going to work each day in food and beverage caused me to have allergic reactions  each day. After a week of that I advocated and said I cannot go back into this location, it's too dangerous for me, and that I need my role switched. The leave administration team told me that if I brought in a doctor's note saying I needed a certain amount of days off, that they would honor those days off until I got my role changed and that the points wouldn't go on my record. So I sent in a doctor's note, and they told me I had those days approved and they would tell my leaders and get me in contact with my case advocate so we can do a role change. Seven days into that I get a call from my internship coordinator telling me that they told me false information and that every day I've been out, points are going on my account and that if I don't go back into work soon I would be fired. So I hustled to get in contact with my case advocate and rush to get my role changed, and after 2 weeks they finally got things changed. They told me they would go on and contact my leaders to get the points removed from my account, because a certain amount of points means you're fired, regardless if it's your fault or not. Did they get those points taken off? Nope, instead my case advocated actually ghosted me. My friend had the same case advocate and he ghosted them too. 2 months later and still no points had been taken off and I had gotten reprimands for something that wasn't my fault. 

Jumping forward, after a while in my new role, which I actually did enjoy at times because of my coworkers, I decided that the pros of this definitely did not outweigh the cons and I decided to self term. Since leaving the program, my mental health has gotten exponentially better, I have time to actually enjoy Florida and do things that I am passionate about. Not everything in the program was bad, I had some leaders I personally really liked, my coworkers have become some of my best friends, and I got the experience of being able to truly see what I do and don't want for myself. I am greatful that I did the program because it taught me to advocate for myself and it also made me realize my self worth and what I do not need to put up with. It also gave me an opportunity to move to Florida, where I will be staying from now on. I choose to have a healthy relationship with Disney now and have decided for me, Disney is only for visiting, not for working and I don't want to mesh those two things in my mind anymore. I guess the moral here is that if something doesn't feel right, and you feel like you're being mistreated, you do not need to sit there and let that happen, it is okay to say ""this is enough"" and leave something when it's seriously affecting your mental and emotional well-being."

**Essays**

I will be writing about my involvement in the NPO I started, my internships and some of my passion cs projects, and how I sort of went up against terrorists:

**(I am not in the military and neither am I an American citizen.)**

A while ago I was given the opportunity to join a team of highly qualified soldiers (of my nation’s army) to combat terrorism. I, of course, accepted the opportunity. I was trained physically for weeks for the mission that lasted a few days, days in an unforgiving environment, and maybe even enemies on our trail. We had limited supplies since all of us were on foot and after a point, it is detrimental for the team to carry more supplies (you need more men to carry more supplies and in turn, more food to feed the new men; of course, there go more intricacies into all the planning but I am ignorant to that or am I?).

We camped in the forest at night, well calling it camping is an exaggeration, it was more like sleeping with just a sheet under and nothing above in the middle of nowhere. We had so little to eat and drink, I was suffering from sleep deprivation for the last few days and the paranoia of literally being oof’d at any moment was so exhausting but the time I spent in the forest with people, that now I consider to be some of the most important figures and inspiration for me, was the best time of my life. Those few days changed my outlook on life so drastically that I can’t really put it into words.

Just FYI, maybe will give you a perspective:
* I’m from a big country that is allied with the US, so it shouldn't come off as me working for US’s enemy’s army or whatever if it matters for the universities. 
* I’m currently studying in the US at a small public university as an international student. So, I will be applying as a transfer student. 
* Also, if it matters to you, we didn't engage with the terrorists but did complete our objectives. We all returned safely.

When I was 17 I released a phone game using Unity and that process was a lot of fun. Since then I have been solely doing web development and devops. I still have no clue which specific career I'd want to specialise in but I think full-stack would be the most interesting. During university, I have found it fun to integrate mathematics and physics in my code, leading me back to my interest for game development. There's a lot of stigma surrounding game development jobs regarding the workplace, money, and absurdly long hours which has made me sceptical of pursuing that career path further than possibly an internship. Also, working from home of another country would be amazing.

I would like to create a game to have on my portfolio, as I think games are a great way to show off my programming skills. However, I have been stuck on choosing a language/game engine that would fit me. I have worked with Unity, Pygame as well as MonoGame, so I would choose between one of these 3. I also do a bit of C++ so maybe that is a better option, but C++ isn't really relevant outside of games except for OS?

**My question is:** Is it a waste of time developing your own game engine if you do not plan on working in the video game industry? Would that be showing unnecessary, irrelevant skills? Should I use Unity? It feels quite amateurish even though I know it isn't. What would fit me the most?

I have been struggling with this question for quite some time now so I would really appreciate some guidance - thank you in advance!"

I'm planning on applying as a finance/econ/business major. I applied and interviewed for the internship in the fall of 2020 and was accepted and offered a position as an intern in the summer of 2021. My father, however, also applied for a job position at the same firm shortly after I got accepted as an intern, and ended up getting a position there. He left his old job and started working at the firm around the same time as I did.

If i put this as a major activity, and colleges see that I did an internship at the same place where my father now works, will it look bad for me even though I applied, interviewed and got accepted before my father even applied for a job position?"

* Is now a good time to start applying for jobs?
* Finding new grad/software engineer level 1 openings are really few and far between. Which companies are actively hiring new grads? Should I even bother applying for level 2 or level 3 positions?
* Meta has a lot of job openings, but there are rumors that hiring is slowing down. Should I bother applying to other FAANG companies that are similar?

&amp;#x200B;

I believe I will be a shoe-in for a job at the national laboratory that I work at now as a software engineer/cyber security engineer. Should I just not bother applying for other tech jobs because of the supposed impending recession? I've looked at the pay grades for where I'm interning at and the pay isn't that bad, 80-90k/year in a low cost of living area. Think I could get better than that?"

I’m entering my senior year of high school and after completing my google IT certification, I saw many people reccomend the CompTIA A+ certification as my next move, I have an internship planning with a local tech company once the school year begins and lately I’ve just been really intrigued by the CompTIA exam. And so, I’ve  decided to give it a shot! I would say I have a decent understanding of tech, and was wondering if anyone had any tips? I also had a couple questions.

1. I know there are two parts of the exam, do they have to be taken directly after each other or can time pass between?
2. Anyone have any study sets or websites they reccomend? I’ve been using the CompTIA A+ app and I’ve really liked the way it worked, but Is it really that beneficial?

vqyla3,18,2022-07-03,My boss will never see it coming. (Quitting and fair “revenge”),metzyxx,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/vqyla3/my_boss_will_never_see_it_coming_quitting_and/,"
Hello, this is my first post in this subreddit after lurking for awhile. I thought it’d be appropriate because I am quitting my shitty fast food job in a particular fashion. 

For background, I am an assistant manager of a popular sandwich chain known for their “gourmet” sandwiches. This job sparked my love for working in restaurants, and is the reason for me going to school to run restaurants. I work my ass off, all day everyday I work. I don’t cut corners, and I serve customers and employees with the best service possible. Every. Day. 

I am tired and done with being taken advantage of and treated like I am naive and don’t know anything. Which is why I am leaving. I am not dumb, and I see through all of the petty bullshit my boss and the manager under me do. 

First off the manager under me is a former GM and she got demoted for not doing her job. She makes $2 more than me an hour, and does significantly less work than I do. She is always taking digs at me, making something out of nothing and creating tension in the store for no reason. Mind you, this is my first management job. This is my first JOB, point blank period. (Ive been here 4 years) I’m still actively learning everyday while managing. I am not perfect, but I do a damn good job at what I do 100% of the time. (Also, she is not allowed to be a real manager but because we have no one else, she is and has a bogus title as a loophole) 

Secondly, a large problem that I’ve had since I gained this position 6 months ago is getting respect from the teenagers. When I run the weekends they are constantly talking, getting out of their spots and being disrespectful. I have talked to them, I have asked nicely, I have yelled, I have written them up, I have done everything I can to get them to stop and it has kind of worked. But regardless, it is still not good enough and its still my fault for their behavior. I am close in age with them so maybe thats why, but I would think that after trying to put my foot down and doing all these things it is not my fault and it is just them. Kids these days are not scared of consequences (and for good reason). 

Between these two things, and a plethora of other things that are out of my control, I never receive praise from my boss. He did a manager review on me and scored me low on things I do perfectly. On a scale from 1-5, I got a 2.5 on slicing meat. He put “always slicing to par”, which is what we are supposed to do. (PAR means the amount we set to be able to make it through the day). Why isnt that a 5? I do the thing that is expected of me, but yet it is not good enough. He states that my opens are not done 100% by 10AM on the weekends. Even though they are. He is not there, so he just assumes they arent. Overall, he takes the word of everyone else over mine and never talks to me about these things, not letting me defend myself or tell him WHY something happened the way that it did. 

This stuff has been going on since since I gained this position. I have greatly improved my work since I started opening, I have gotten faster and overall have gotten better at everything, but its never good enough and that has never been recognized. 

So, here comes the fun. Ive been looking for a new job the past couple months, one that can push me into the restaurant industry and one that is not in fast food. I finally found one that I feel matches my values and is a great candidate for me to grow and reach my full potential. I am putting in my two weeks this week, and he is never going to see it coming. 

My boss still thinks that he has a couple months before I have to change jobs for my school internship thats coming up in september. I asked him about a raise a few weeks ago, and I never heard anything back so I am guessing I am not deserving of one. I am planning on leaving my two week notice on a night I close so he comes into it in the morning. 

And I am not just leaving my two weeks. After my last day, I am going to file reports with OSHA and the health department for the broken, unsafe things in the store. The black mold on the sinks and floors, the crumbling shelving units that are one truck supply order from breaking, the moldy trays that we thaw bread on, the produce that is stored on the floor. The black mold on the inside of the soda machine and ice machine. Managers are not scheduled for breaks either and I never recieve a break on my 10HR shifts. Hopefully I can find more things too. 

It might not seem that dramatic, but they dont have anyone lined up to come be a manager. The franchise of 50+ stores is crumbling and many stores are understaffed. I’m sure they will find a replacement for me, but once I leave I hope my boss realizes all of the things that I do for him that no one else does. He can run the store with the other shitty manager and his bogus staff, I’m done. 

Also, many of our employees love me as their manager and dont love the other manager, because she is rude, disrespectful, and lazy. I hope some of them leave after I am gone and fuck him over there too. 

TLDR; 
I am prematurely quitting my job because of the way I am treated. Nothing is ever good enough for my boss, and I’m done being taken advantage of. Me quitting will catch him off guard, and he will be stressed. I am also hoping to get some fines or the store closed temporarily by reporting him to OSHA and the health department."

How long does it takes to be invited for 190?

Hi All,

So its been 4 weeks into my internship and i am kinda feeling not lost atm which i was feeling 2 weeks back . So i had been asked to build a tool in react so initially i was very nervous as to how would i go on building it but overtime i figured stuff out and its been going fine until now but its reached a standpoint where my mentoring is asking me to implement stuff which is not even possible using JavaScript (some feature where you would convert json into some api spec) . 

The tool he is asking me to build is not possible in the timeframe if its only me who is working on it which is what is happening (i am not a react/js expert but it might be possible for someone who has been doing this for years) I am getting bad anxieties about whats gonna happen in the coming days (only a month left for my internship to end) . Also the mentor has no knowledge of js/react or anything (he is some architect level guy seperate from my managers team with expertise in java kotlin) . Manager is clueless about what’s going on as he has hardly ever attended status calls . 

Also most of the times i am scoundering stackoverflow/google for help . Its been really stressful , even on weekends and post work i am working on it basically figuring stuff on my own without any guidance. sometimes i question myself that “am i doing it the right way? is there a better way to do this?” . I am worried about how will the manager measure my performance and make a decison on the return offer . Any tips would be really helpful . 

Thanks"

My internship is under a startup, and like all startup companies, I was made to do a lot of work out of coding. Surprisingly, I found these out-of-my-major work really interesting, so I am quite happy with what I am doing in the company right now. 

The issue is that I haven't done much technical stuff as a computing intern. I did have some coding to do, but they were pretty minimal and I was assigned to research, sales, and a lot of other things more often than coding. The ATAP interim report deadline is coming up, and I don't have much stuff to write about coding and developing of programs. 

Has anyone experienced this before? Is there any advice you can provide for me? Will writing an ATAP report focused on analysis of research papers still be applicable?"

vr54bg,3,2022-07-04,Please help me make an important decision,Sure_Candle_1144,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/vr54bg/please_help_me_make_an_important_decision/,"I (23F) have completed my bachelor's degree in Marketing but I was never convinced it was the right path for me and so I decided to switch to Finance after an interesting internship in a multinational financial group that made me reconsider my whole career path. 

Switching from Marketing to Finance has been a challenge thus far with the extensive courses I am currently doing as a first years masters student in Finance in my home university but I am thoroughly enjoying the learning process too. 

My dilemma is, I got accepted in a university in Belgium to complete my master's degree there. The cost is a lot higher than my current home university (x3 times more) And I'm not sure if this investment would be worth it or not. It is a good grade B university but quite reputable in Belgium and I do wish to pursue an international career so that looks like the easier path to integrate a company overseas. 

My question is : Should i go for it and consider the expensive fee as an investment in my future even though there is no guarantee I can get a job there later on ( I do speak fluent french and english so I'm trying to be a bit optimisitc on the job prospects side) or should i continue my second year in my home university and try to score a scholarship overseas next year even though I would like to start working ASAP and wasting another year studying in not my ideal plan. Please advise me on what to do ! I appreciate any comment or advice."

Having trouble getting interviews,harvish,EngineeringResumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringResumes/comments/vr61wj/recent_graduate_from_a_tier_3_university_from/,"So I recently graduated from a tier 3 university in India and have been having troubles getting interviews. I have around 1 year of internship experience building software 

A little about my undergrad: I have pursued Information and Communication Technology. It is a ""fancy"" combination of Electrical and IT. But majority of my electives were in computer science domain

Experience: Provided details of all the internships I have done so far

Academic Projects: I have multiple academic projects but have chosen to highlight these ones because of their complexity and they are recent

Likely starting in Central Florida and then willing to possibly move out of state for other opportunities. I also had a side plan to possibly move to the Netherlands based off what may happen regarding family, but until that's cemented the plan is likely to stay here in the states. I have no industry certifications, obviously no college, and no internships or otherwise. I've always been interested in the field, however, and have also always been around computers. Enough to think that going into another field would likely be very alienating. Anyway, as I haven't considered anything firmly so far I searched around and found the [Google](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-support) certification for IT, and the A+ exam are a pretty good baseline, and the typical progression is to take the A+, work a helpdesk and then work on certs at that job while slowly working up the chain of CompTIA certs and other assorted certs. Any advice for someone with little / no information on where to start?

TL;DR Want to know more about IT paths for someone still in high school while also possibly having no (initial) college."

I work at a grocery store and absolutely hate it but I have horrible anxiety about putting my 2 weeks in. 

1) I am one of the few (like 2) people there that know how to run the service desk/run the front so I’ll feel guilty 

2) money. It’s an easy money job but I hate it hate it hate it and I’m just worried about money when school comes back in the fall (I’m going to be a senior and have 2 days of classes and an internship that will most likely be paid) 

3) I am missing out on so many family functions because of work. Today some of my fav family members are coming over for a bbq and guess what… I’m working all night till close!! (11pm) 

I have so much fear and anxiety but for some reason I CANT bring myself to quit. I have tried multiple times to bring down my hours but my boss doesn’t listen. I’m pulling 40+hours a week and just want to be a 20 year old before I step out into the real world. I really think they are using me here because I also get treated like garbage. 

Since today is July 4th it might be to chaotic to quit and I’m going on vacation the week of July 9th so i could say “after my vacay that will be my 2 weeks as in I’ll work 2 weeks after I get back” 

Tbh Idek why I’m writing this, the obvious answer is quit but I’m genuinely SCARED of the issues they’ll give me within that 2 weeks. 

Maybe this is a rant I’m not sure but I’m actually about to start getting ready for work and my anxiety is through the roof and I want to cry. I hate this place so much. Should I just say screw it and quit?"

Hey everyone, I've recently decided that committing to getting an MBA would be the right decision for what satisfies me. Unfortunately I'm in an industry/path that has very few actual candidates for MBAs and really don't know how well I stack against the general masses... details in the post

Age - 26

UG GPA - 3.6 (State engineering schooling.. top amongst my class for what its worth) CS Major, Math/Business Minor

GMAT - 710, 46 Q 42 V 8 IR 6 AWA

Pro W/E: Uni: Research fellowship, 2 consulting software dev/BI internships, 1 software engineering internship. 

Post: 3 years at Amazon as a software engineer then manager. 2 Promotions. Currently 8 direct reports since march, and began managing partly last year. Experienced interviewer, mentor (even onboard higher level PMs and TPMs due to attrition, onboarded my manager as well..), 1 successful intern re-hire. Opportunity cost to leave for 2 years is very high, but I honestly feel that I have reached a ceiling and cap of satisfaction for my work. Not about the money for me but the chance to take a leap and do something bigger 

E.C.: Uni: VP of 2 organizations, Member of 1 alumni org, Director of largest philanthropic event on campus ($100K+ raised, Blood donations, service hours, canned food drive, etc...), participant in 2 week long service trips (leader on 1). Also served 1 year on schools VC fund with 1 successful exit.. only tech focused member of the board

Gaps post college on volunteering (did some basic volunteers hours like trash pickups etc), but started a tech focused undergrad university involvement org last year - still in early stages. Also have a junior board seat helping a nonprofit build their Mentorship platform, on my Organizations DEI committee as an External partnerships member, and have started a scholarship at my undergrad for first generation immigrants &amp; underprivileged youths. Focused on career and personal development (learn to snowboard, play ice hockey, DJ, play guitar/make beats, and cook instead... got burned out from college)

Background: British Immigrant, son of African Immigrants, Great grand-son of Indian immigrants. Motivated to work hard and do something mostly. Aim: gain more business smarts (aiming for finance) with a strong tech background and some VC experience to either go into VC, startups, Fintech, or back into tech on a path that will set me higher than current (I feel the ceiling, and its demotivating)

Dream: Stanford

Other: Harvard, Wharton, Columbia, Berkeley part time/full time, perhaps an online MBA. open to recommendations! 

Concern: opportunity cost for getting an MBA in my position means outside an elite degree it may not be worth, and not having that ""stamp"" from my Undergrad means Im looking for it.

thanks!"
vreosi,14,2022-07-04,APs don’t believe in insomnia… my dads a doctor…,OpenScratch5758,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/vreosi/aps_dont_believe_in_insomnia_my_dads_a_doctor/,"My (20F) parents (47F and 50M) genuinely don’t believe in insomnia.

I have it and I don’t mean I sleep less than eight hours a night or I have occasional nights where I don’t sleep. Since I’ve been 15, I have been sleeping ALTERNATE NIGHTS. There are nights where I’m wide awake every second wishing I was dead and the next day I’m a zombie and then I pass out the next day but even when I pass out I don’t sleep 7 hours. I don’t sleep more than 5 hours. I once stayed up for 48 hours and walked to class with my earphones plugged into my pants and wondered why music didn’t play. 

I still got my grades, did my work, do 3 internships and 2 part time jobs and am graduating by 21. But my brain is fully off. 

This has been happening for five years. I’ve tried EVERY SINGLE SLEEP HYGIENE METHOD. Every single one. 

My parents believe it’s because ‘I don’t try’. They also don’t believe I’m depressed even though I was once taken to the hospital in college for depression. 

Because they don’t believe me, I’ve resorted to taking zolpidem and Xanax for sleep issues. it isn’t exactly illegal because they’re given to me by my own pharmacist from the hospital owned in by my dad without him knowing 

My mom found them and yelled at me saying I just like to take pills and I have no real issue. She says drink chamomile, it’ll help. 

She said try to tire yourself out. Once after a 3 hour hike and an hour swim I was exhausted but couldn’t sleep in the night and stayed up ALL NIGHT and fainted in school the next day and hit my head on a stray nail and needed stitches. Apparently I passed out because ‘I hadn’t eaten enough’. They refuse to take me to a therapist or doctor because it’s a fake issue. Even though my dads a doctor. 

At 20, my body and mind are practically broken and fractured because I haven’t slept well in 5 years. My parents don’t believe I have insomnia or depression"

*Substance abuse*, *suicide (duh) threatening, probably others - tread with caution -* ***DETAILED(?) METHODS OF SUICIDE (that I think are necessary to explain)****. I do not condone the use of substances, despite saying ""good"" things of them. DO NOT END UP DOING THEM,* ***PLEASE****.*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Hi. I'll introduce myself first, I'm a 21 years-old NEET that has failed this university year because I couldn't find an internship, so my 3-years long degree went to the trashbin instantly. This left me a bit depressed, but not as much as last year where I also failed a year in a different degree, but I expected it.

Last year, I started abusing substances. Depressants - mainly benzodiazepines, empathogens, hallucinogens, dissociatives, opioids, amphetamines, research chemicals... Everything I could get my hands on, I would just do it - I stole two boxes of codeine pills from my sister, I stole Tramadol from my parents, etc, etc. Basically, it was me auto-diagnosing myself of anxiety, auto-prescribing myself and therefore, auto-medicating myself. In the beginning, it was not extremely well supported, but it actually helped me. 

My substance abuse was not under perfect control, but I managed it definitely better than a lot of people I know. Then, my brother became too curious about my activities on the Internet, and was looking for messages - I had a knife under my desk to threaten and scare them out, stupid right? This was the thing that revealed my substance abuse since they basically swatted my room. They found everything, and they became - and still are, desperate. The 10th of May, 2022, in the evening. 

I got handled by my GP, and a psychologist, and it helped me but I felt not as much as what I did. I didn't get a sufficient dose to calm my anxiety, my depression went through the roof, my stress itself went through the roof, just like my parents' and family, as they discovered I was/am, just some kind of junkie and not our kid. 

# Why I might actually do it

I deserve it. My mom now smokes 5 packs of cigarettes per day instead of the usual one, she lost 20 kgs, my dad oversleeps and avoid me, I feel bad permanantly. When I did the PHQ-9 test to see how my depression was, the family question thingy was always ""never"", because I didn't feel shame about it; it helped me, and I managed it well. I kept being under the radar for more than a year. Now, I might actually just end it tonight. My brother caught me just snorting a line of \[something\]. Couldn't hide behind an excuse, it was literally as described. He kept telling me that he loved me but I had to help myself and let them help me - but I don't want to. I want to continue. I already stopped valuing my physical health years ago, substances don't even matter now. As he revealed that my parents are still suffering from the fallout of the 10th of May, I might just do it.

I eyeballed all of the stuff I accumulated, both via prescriptions and, other means, and I have enough again to end my life multiple times over. Of course, it will be a combination. Pills, powders, alcohol, dangerous combinations to augment the chances to induce a heart attack, benzos to knock me out, combinations to induce respiratory depression, rope or belt to just hang myself. Razor blade to cut vertically, everything is ready, and I only have to wait for the night to fall.

It was a mere 30 minutes ago; my entire ""world"" that I ""rebuilt"", crumbled again. This false regained stability - gone. I suppose my brother did not expect that I would reopen the ""archives"" of my suicide plans and actually prepare it after telling me that I've actually been slowly destroying our family and causing immense harm for immense periods of time. I thought I was under the radar again, but they have been watching me like never before, and I didn't even see it.

# The End

The only penalty I deserve is death, and I judged myself today, and I might just execute myself today as well. I don't deserve to live. I didn't want to either way. It's probably the end now. But I still have that small glimmer of hope that you might end up understanding by reading the text below, but it is fading. 

I've never felt so bad in my entire life. And this is when my antidepressant finally started acting. Actual stability, and the additional false stability by reabusing substance. I can't take the stress anymore. I can't take the guilt of this anymore: the guilt of today, of the 10th, the guilt of so many things I've done in the past, the anxiety, the depression, the overall total helplessness I feel in front of life; I just can't. I'm done, so, so done.  

Sorry for bothering you. I probably just needed to vent or something, I know I might just be a coward like previous times and end up not actually doing it. See, I can't even end it correctly. I'm a fucking piece of shit. Please excuse me for wasting your time. 

    For legal reasons, and to any federal, governmental, or international agencies agents that are, or will be making an investigation on me, reading this text: I swear under oath that this text is *fictional* and that none of that have actually happened. If you are asking, yes, this is ass-covering, because I still think of joining sensible governmental organizations that I will not cite. Please excuse me for doing this, but it is necessary to explain that I am only looking for tips for something that did not happen. I hope you can understand why I added this."

I'm almost at the point of giving hope of ever getting a software development job. In the few years now since I've finished my two year qualification in software development, I've had maybe 10-12 interviews for junior jobs. I've probably applied to thousands of jobs in that time, most all were ""junior"" jobs. Applied to some internships too. None with any success. 

I don't know if that's a good number of interviews. It seems low so i would very much appreciate any feedback on my current CV: [CV](https://imgur.com/a/lTX2Moh) . I would put this on engineeringResumes but that's very American with the latex and stuff. I did have a CV like that for awhile, with no improvement. 

I do have autism, so I'm not the best in interviews. Sometimes they seem to go alright but alright clearly isn't good enough. I do study the tech stack and typical interview questions before them. I'm not applying for jobs I think are outside of my abilities. I do think my autism could a major contribution to my lack of finesse in interviews. My autism isnt enough to make me incapable or not valuable in this kind of job. 

Currently good with the following languages/technologies (the types of stacks I apply for): C#, Xamarin, java, bit of Android, SQl, the basics of the web stack(html, css, php), was learning more javascript recently, know the basics of github."

&amp;#x200B;

Age 25 - I am a class of 2020 Engineering Science graduate from the University of Rochester with a chemical engineering background (passed FE exam in chemical engineering 2021). I was recently let go from an environmental/water remediation engineering position in Astoria, Queens after only two months, reason being it not being a good fit, and I am at a crossroads whether to continue the engineering or to do something else. What I hope to find here in Reddit are new networks or career coaches (Ideally in the New York City Area as I live in Queens) or anyone that can give advice to finding better networking/job searching strategies or resources as well as getting a job/career/industry that is a better fit for me. Any advice, recommendations or perspectives can be useful as you may suggest something that I might not know about and that I can consider before deciding.   

There is a list of questions that I have answers to so that you can have a better sense of who I am. Feel free to add to the lists as the answers listed are what I know of as of now. Also feel free to ask me questions regarding my background or even my resume outside of Reddit if willing. 

Question #1: What I have been looking for so far (Ideally)?: 

I am looking for a medium/large sized chemical or environmental engineering company where there is a structured learning environment that has experience and is accepting towards neurodivergent employees (I have autistic spectrum, anxiety, and an auditory processing delay). I focus so far as been involved with water treatment chemical and environmental engineering but I am open to any other engineering position within the area, whether that is a full-time industry or internship. 

Question #2: What I value/want in a work environment: 

A. Being reasonably challenged where I am always learning something new. 

B. A structured work environment where the training and work expectations are very clear (ideally a medium or large sized company as they are more likely to do this). 

C. Being in an environment that is experienced and accepting in terms of neurodivergence and where I can feel at ease socially. 

D. One that is not overly collaborative and fast-paced in the sense that I don’t feel rushed to make an ad-hoc decision or respond on the spot when I need a few seconds to process things. 

E. Room for advancement so that I can stay long-term at a company. 

Question #3: What are your potential interests and industries (Within engineering): 

A. Water treatment. 

B. Water management

C. Photovoltaics. 

D. Chemical engineering. 

E. Separation processes. 

F. System design.

G. Food and Beverages. 

H. Packaging. 

I. Pipe 

J. Energy (oil or renewable). 

Question #4: What alternative career paths are you considering outside of engineering: 

A. Computer/Software Engineering. 

B. Actuarial Sciences. 

C. Math Teacher"
vrghg4,20,2022-07-04,Internship offers vs Junior Software Engineer offer for bootcamp grad/cs drop-out,dankychanmi,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vrghg4/internship_offers_vs_junior_software_engineer/,"So a bit of background:

I am 22, dropped out of CS at a top tier Canadian University last year, worked at a restaurant for 6 months, did a web dev bootcamp and finished that last month. Been job hunting for a month and now I have 3 offers on my hands and I am struggling to decide. Also living in HCOL Canadian city but at home with no rent and not planning to move out for at least a year.

All remote positions

Company A: Health tech company

* \~700 people
* Software engineer co-op (but would be on a front-end team)
* Pays $34.52/hour CAD
* From Sept to Dec. 
* Engineer manager told me they've turned interns full-time but the recruiter said they can't disclose too much information about converting interns to full-time until after I signed the contract.
* I got this offer on June 28 and the deadline is July 5, 5pm.
* Told them I had other interviews to go through and the recruiter did not give a fuck and they did not move the deadline. 
* Everyone was super friendly/high-energy.
* Profitable (been around since 2013)

Company B: Health tech startup 

* \~100 people
* Full-stack engineer co-op
* Pays $35/hour CAD
* Get to work on a team that is creating internal tools for company (they didn't have any internal tools beforehand, so I would be working on a fresh codebase)
* From Sept to Dec
* Interns get some benefits
* The engineering manager mentioned they have given incentive packages to get interns to return full-time and have had several interns return.
* Everyone was super chill and work culture seems great.
* Profitable

Company C: Transportation tech startup

* \~80 people
* Software engineer (full time position)
* Pays $76k CAD
* Stock options (but they are not public yet)
* 3 weeks vacation
* Typical health benefits and others (lifestyle budget, co-working budget, remote stipend)
* Starting date late july/early august
* Not profitable (they expect to be in 2024)

Between the two internships I am currently leaning towards Company B. But between Company C and B I am really conflicted. The fact that Company C is not profitable makes me nervous about job security. But I don't really plan to stay at Company C (if I took the position) more than 1 - 1.5 years anyways.

As a bootcamp grad/CS drop-out I feel super lucky to have multiple offers to pick from. Also don't really plan on finishing my CS degree (only half done) unless a really good opportunity arises (ie. an employer pays for part of the tuition). In terms of my career, I kind of plan to bust ass and work hard and don't plan to just ""coast"" through the job, so I am trying to pick a company that can best jump-start my career. 

Have to make a decision by tomorrow afternoon, any opinions would be helpful!"

I’m in a little bit of denial and just wanted to hear some other people’s thoughts before I finalized my decision. I have several options:

&gt;Take 1 summer class for $5000 (bs private school) and hope to goodness I can pass all my classes.

&gt;Take 2 summer classes and get financial aid and hope to goodness I can pass all my classes. But it’ll probably take all my personal time after my internship. Last summer I didn’t have a job and passed both my classes by the skin of my teeth.

Summer classes would start tomorrow. I don’t want to do any of these options. I’m in this position because I have a history of getting Ds and Fs in my harder classes. I’m probably going to take another semester; what if I ended up failing something and needed to take another semester anyways?

So, my plan is to go to community college for two years and then transfer to that university. But I have heard that internships are very difficult to obtain since companies are looking for people in 4 year uni and only reason why I want to go to college is to network and gain work experience so I’m worried that I’ll be too behind compared to everyone else.

There is also a state school that I really like and is partnering with NASA but it has a low ranking (top 50) and many of my teachers/counselors have told me to go to top schools (10-20) so I can have better opportunities in life.

vrj10t,4,2022-07-04,is it even worth it to apply as a math major to schools if i don’t have any math competitions under my belt?,starlightsounds,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/vrj10t/is_it_even_worth_it_to_apply_as_a_math_major_to/,"for me, math competitions sort of dilute the reasons why i like math so i never really considered doing many of them. plus i heard ab all the major ones for the first time like 2 months ago. and that’s my mistake especially considering how many applicants have crazy involvement in math competitions.

for me, i’d say the most “math” involved portions of my ecs would be my internship and paid job, as well as dif eq and linear algebra academically. but ppl w these competitions also often have this too. 

so my question basically is if it’s even worth it to apply as a math major in that context or if my chances would be higher as an economics major (even though i love mathematics a bit more).

I graduated in May 2021 with 1 internship at a medium sized company. Ended up taking the full time offer there with TC $80K. I’m now stuck working with a boring tech stack and the company has little to no coding standards. I’m now learning very little on the job and feel stuck. Outside of work, I’ve been studying for interviews and grinding LeetCode.

I really worked my butt off studying hard, leading SWE group projects, studying tools/frameworks outside of class, getting a good GPA, etc. but none of it really transitioned to a “great” job for me. I don’t think I necessarily have the skills for Big Tech, but I definitely think I could’ve landed a better job with greater learning opportunities.

Whenever I look up Purdue SWEs on LinkedIn, so many of you are working in Big Tech and Quants. For those that are working are working for companies like these, how did you get to where you are? What resources would you recommend for coding interviews? Was anyone else in a similar situation with a crappy first job and able to get out?

Just last week I started my first full time salary position, the pays decent for where I live but the work is terrible. I spend most of the day working on a .Net app that's terribly designed, the database is a mess and it's hard to learn the syntax because it's so messy and unkept (also have very limited experience already). The company has other projects but this is what they're starting me out on and I'm already considering looking for a new job. It also doesn't help that I don't do well in office job scenerarios (I worked in an office in high school for a family friend and hated it and my testing job was also in an office)

I have a few questions regarding the industry because right now I'm regretting even studying computer science (also forgive me if I sound wimpy or whatever I haven't been doing well mentally since finishing school)

1. What are my options if I want to work remote and develop less?

2. Is it feasible / realistic to get a job
more focused on front end? (angular, react, maybe vue)

3. Is it common to have to drudge through poorly managed code bases?

But it feels like the damage has already been done. I am a senior and barely have 2-3 friends in college. My gpa is much lower than it could’ve been because I failed a couple classes when I was at worst depression. This also prevented me from getting an internship this summer. I know that I can’t change the past but it feels like this happened at an important time in my life and it’s gonna hurt my future too. My high school friends all seem to be doing so much better than me socially and career wise. I try really hard not to think about it because I don’t want it to drag me back into depression. I don’t know what I can possibly do to catch up. It feels like impossible to make friends and get high enough grades to get a highly competitive job. I know that it’s my fault cause I didn’t do the work all these years but I don’t know how to change that now besides just trying as hard as I can. It really feels hopeless
vrohm0,1,2022-07-04,Conflict Within,wolfbellied,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/vrohm0/conflict_within/,"Hello.

I had posted earlier in this sub regarding school. I am glad to say I have accepted what has happened and moved on past it. This post is about something that I feel is less tangible than that topic.

I have accepted that my decisions in the past regarding academics have impacted my life in a certain way, i.e., I most likely will not be getting into ""top"" colleges. This is completely fine with me. Life will proceed on based on my own actions.

However, my parents are another story. This isn't something like, ""They hate me now because I performed badly"". I know they want me to succeed, but I feel that their wishes and my actions + demeanor are slowly creating a rift between us.

To them, the fact I haven't shown visible joy or a noticeable excitement on the prospect of college or university is something which entails certain failure. This is because I truly am not joyful, or extremely happy about going to college. You could list the benefits of it and I would acknowledge them as valid and useful.

Personally, I can't help but to view it as a business/school in a larger league; you gain knowledge, hopefully develop some connections and score internships, get your degree(s) and enter the workforce with your qualifications, eyes set on whatever position or job it is that you're aiming for. I don't have a hate for this, rather I view it as an option which, statistically, tends to work in terms of getting people into jobs.

It is this attitude of mine which is seen as nonchalant and slacking by my parents. I want to explain this view of mine to them further but I'm not sure how.

As I put into practice habits of discipline such as a rigid, earlier sleep and rising time, exercise, diet, pursuit of skills, etc., I have come to acknowledge that while change is inevitable, growth is a choice. And as I put the effort in to grow, I come to know myself better and what I want. Unfortunately, I can't pinpoint a specific path/plan besides a broad direction at the moment which is a source of discomfort to my parents. I have told them in the past that I would like to do some kind of engineering discipline in college, as I work at an auto shop currently and have an interest in physics, but even I am starting to doubt that.

The game plan of students where I live is, do everything in your power to get into at least a top 100 university. Then; just get through college, and land yourself a good job. My behavior doesn't line up with the mass of students who do research papers, internships, etc., with the hopes of scoring a college with prestige. In this context, I am atypical. When I tell people I'm a junior (rising senior at the moment) the first thing is along the lines of, ""what are your plans for college"", or something college-related. It's started to turn me off heavily.

I am not saying that I don't want to work hard or develop skills. My point is that those closest to me expect me to pour my soul into something that doesn't truly invigorate me, creating a conflict between us, and within myself. I'm a little sad to admit, a part of me just wants to submit to this typical route. 16 years of living with my parents and doing things that fall within their wishes and expectations is conflicted with the part of myself who wants control, who wants to consider the other routes, and would appreciate it if those around me looked at those other routes. (Some context for this; I showed my mom a technical/trade school that caught my interest, and she made a visible ""ugh"" face, seemingly troubled that I would even look into that sort of thing).

I really don't want this outward conflict to exist. I wish that I could express my sentiments in a way that my parents would understand and not immediately jump to the conclusion that I'm going end up a manual laborer making mediocre money, or, heavens forbid, a ""burger flipper"" (one of my dad's go-to terms when this type of topic is discussed/turns into a lecture). Sometimes, when I'm making music on a DAW called Logic Pro, or writing fiction, or watching an informative videos on something I'M interested in, something within me urges me to click off it and open some other document up when I hear my parents' footsteps, so when they enter the room, it looks like I'm doing or watching something that looks productive -- the way they see it.

I am 17. The average global lifespan is about 73 years. That is 56 years of life at least that I have to live still. Is it so troubling, so unacceptable that I'm a little unsure, seemingly a little more so than others? That I'm questioning this whole process and looking at other routes and what they have to offer? Is it so bad that my interests don't ""spike""? My parents talk about trade schools, community colleges, and even lower/mid-tier universities like it's a place where you sign away the opportunities that life offers, where you become forgotten, and become part of the mud under well-educated peoples' feet as they travel further through academia and their professional lives. Not word-for-word, obviously, but I can hear that sentiment in their tones and in their word choice; their true implications.

If you have felt the same way or been in a similar situation in the past, or even right now, I would appreciate if you could share parts of your experience or steps you took to get out of that rut. I know it's a lot of text, but I haven't been able to express what I'm feeling properly as of late.

Thanks."
vroqb2,20,2022-07-04,What am I supposed to do? Kinda lost on my learning,FattestDragon,dataanalysis,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/vroqb2/what_am_i_supposed_to_do_kinda_lost_on_my_learning/,"I am a commerce student going into my third year in Canada, and I officially started my data analysis journey this summer(failed to find a summer internship). So far I have earned IBM da certificate, and I also finished a Udemy SQL BootCamp. I am also almost done with a python and machine learning BootCamp, leaving the ML part unfinished. I have been doing some SQL problems on leetcode, and I have also been finding some Python problems on Hackerrank, although the problems are all basic.

However, I am feeling so lost. I have read many posts, most of which were saying that it is most important to do real projects and build your portfolio. I just have no idea where to start, and what should be the real priority of my learning. Currently, I am planning on earning a tableau desktop specialist certificate, but I do not really know if that would be helpful for me to find the first data internship.

Can any one of you share your insights? What should I focus on right now in order to land the first internship next summer? Should I further my study on SQL, or should I try to learn more tools such as tableau? Also, is machine learning really necessary for a data analyst, or may be I should put more emphasis on practicing python libraries such as pandas and numpy?

Finally, how should I start to do data projects? What projects are really valuable and where to find them? 

I may sound a bit frustrated and there seem to be too many questions. Apologize for that. Just feel so lost and worried about my future career..."

vrrkgu,9,2022-07-05,Random thoughts on my internship,Sturm_und_Drangg,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/vrrkgu/random_thoughts_on_my_internship/,"Sharing my thoughts on my first summer internship.

Some backstory ~
Coming from a well-known University Business School, I often feel FOMO as most of my sectional mates were constantly chatting about which internship they had acquired and how renowned the companies they have been accepted to are. As someone who is somewhat competitive, I do not want to be on the losing end. Thus, I started spamming my resumes to companies through their mailbox or LinkedIn towards the end of my previous semester. Perhaps due to my insufficient experience in the industry, I would like to intern in - Business development or trader, and/or for a relatively short duration, it was tough looking for an internship. Companies that had gotten back to me either wanted me to take an LOA or did not want me due to my insufficient experience. 

Hence, when company ABC (my current intern company) was willing to take me, I just accepted without much research or asking for advice, as the salary they were willing to pay me was appealing. 

After interning ~
Even though I was not given a chance to learn and excel in this internship, I would still like to say that I have grown mindset-wise and broadened my knowledge of what a working world is like.

I would say that I am pretty extroverted and love interacting with people. Hence, greeting my colleagues and instantly clicking is relatively easy and normal. However, I have realized that work is work and that colleagues are not friends after working hours. For instance, whenever I see my colleagues in public places such as the train or lift, they would often act like they do not know who I am, and being the friendly me would seem ridiculous trying to greet them or converse with them. 

Just some random thoughts whenever situations like this arise:
""Is this why people become unfriendly or selfish?""
""Are they afraid of being hurt?""
""Is being too friendly a bad thing?""
""Shouldn't we humans be more friendly, to create a bond whereby we can all work together happily?""

Linking it to another problem - Workplace Culture/Diversity~
As mentioned in my previous post, my company culture, I personally feel, is not a very healthy place to work in, in the long run. However, some of my colleagues tell me that this company's politics are considered quite okay compared to other organizations. I wonder,"" is it because they are the ones who are attributing to the toxic politics that they feel this way?"" Stereotyping also seems like a norm here. For instance, if you are a slow learner here, you would be classified as ""stupid"" and will not be given a second chance if you were to make any mistakes. The irony is that they only briefly instruct you or show you once at lightning speed. This was what happened to some other interns/full-timers in the company. 

Opportunities were also often get snatched/pushed away. For instance, my supervisor would tell the full-timers that were supposed to guide me to pass down some knowledge or regulations that he felt would benefit me in the future. They would often tell my supervisor or discuss among themselves, loud enough for me to hear' ""aiya, she is just an intern, no need to know one,"" or stuff like, ""she is also leaving in like a few months."" 

I know I am an intern. However, I would often feel sad or affected whenever they were to say that. My main priority in interning is to gain knowledge and experience, and them not being willing to share or give me tasks to do other than data entry is just wasting my time. I could potentially use my holidays to study or learn something worthwhile rather than being here doing data entry. 

That said, I often finish my task relatively fast, and almost every day after lunch, I have nothing much to nothing to do. Sometimes I would browse the news or read some useful articles. However, other colleagues from different departments and my boss would purposely walk passed me as though I was not doing my work or so. I have to keep changing between the news article and excel tabs as though I am working. BUT, I have literally nothing to do. I have tried asking several times for things to do or if any of them need my help but was often told, ""Nah, just chill.""

The thought of quitting constantly pops up in my mind; however, my parents would tell me not to give up, and since my internship will be ending in a few months might as well continue and get paid. Looking from the positive side, I learned how to be patient, judge one's expression, and react based on situations. This internship has also taught me not to put in too much feelings when working and to learn how to separate work and personal life. Since much guidance and opportunity were not provided, I cannot wait for my internship to end. 

To people who are also experiencing what I am experiencing right now, here are some takeaways for you:
– Do something you like after work, as this could potentially help you clear your mind.
– If you can quit earlier, like the first two weeks of your internship/work, please do as it will do your mental health good.
– Try sharing with your friends and family.
– DO NOT FOMO, as everyone's pace are different!

Thanks, humans, for listening to me. I am kind of bored at work right now."

What salary should I expect? I am asking this so I can get an idea on my budget for housing.

Do companies offer relocation packages?

I am interested in Machine Learning / Deep Learning but due to my small experience in the field I don't think I will be able to land a job in that sector yet. The only experience I have is from my thesis and internships.

vrtph2,5,2022-07-05,Afraid boss doesn't like me (college intern)? Am I right?,Far-Effort-7630,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/vrtph2/afraid_boss_doesnt_like_me_college_intern_am_i/,"So I've been navigating two internships at the same time (their ending and starting dates overlap). Internship 1 has been going on for several months and internship 2 ( to be about three months with no clear ending date on the third month) is the one I just started. Although I didn't mention it during our interview for internship 2 (since I didn't know when it was going to start and when internship 1 would end), I mentioned upon accepting the offer to internship 2 that I wouldn't be able to work full time for the first three weeks since I had internship 1 going on. I didn't ask for a late arrival to this new internship because I knew my boss was anxious to start (we have a lot of work to do). My boss accepted that and told me to send him a schedule of my availability. He didn't reply, so I've been letting him know my schedule at the beginning of every week. At first I tried to do shorter hours but come in every day of the week, but that didn't work with internship 1. So instead, I switched to doing just three full days at internship 2, and two full days at internship 1. 

He seemed frustrated last week, and I got nervous and offered to do a few weekend dates to smooth it over. I've been thinking that my boss really does not like me (although realistically he hasn't given me any reason to think that way) and that makes me feel really shy around him and not ask as many questions as I want to or make as many comments. Another intern came in after me as well and I don't do well in group conversations - I tend to be quiet. So they have been overshadowing me in all of our conversations even though I had a pretty good relationship with our second supervisor in the beginning. 

This other intern (who has more experience and is a grad student) has missed the same amount of time as me (and more due to getting sick and also going on vacation), but they are pretty confident and have a pretty good relationship with both of our supervisors. They will send over cool articles they find about our field of work and ask lots of questions, and are bold enough to ask about current full time openings and advice on how to get in. 

For some reason I still think my boss hates me - since I'm quieter and don't communicate as often, even though I do my work thoroughly and finish all tasks. I ask questions when necessary but try not to waste their time with unnecessary questions or comments. I apologize over and over again for missing time or bothering them. There are other things too, but these are my main concerns. 

I feel like I put 110% into internship 1 since I realized that's exactly where I wanted to be after I graduated. But I don't care as much about internship 2, and I'm really not that enthusiastic about it even though it's still an amazing organization and I know I should try to do well there and make as many connections as possible. I feel bad because of that, and I feel even more guilty knowing that I'm not as excited about it.

I've been feeling really bad and have been concerned about my image. Have I been in the wrong? Do supervisors typically not like interns like myself? 

I also may need to take one more day off or have shorter days in the future - is this wise to ask for or should I avoid this at all cost?"

vrz6qy,3,2022-07-05,"What should you learn about a company you're interested in, before applying?",learning-to-programm,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vrz6qy/what_should_you_learn_about_a_company_youre/,"So I'm currently in vocational school for IT who was interested in learning about (potential) future career opportunities. My mom happens to work at a bank, so a few days ago I asked her about her company and whether they had an IT department (take my use of the word IT as broadly btw, since what I'm in interested is technically more CS related, but that's not how most people speak), how big it was, what they did, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

She said yes, they have them (of course), multiple actually, she said they had departments responsible for networking, for building their internal tools, for security, etc. I was happy to hear that and i asked her about the departments responsible for building (software) tools and products, what they did, how  they did it, what stacks they used, what they looked for when hiring interns, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom said she wouldn't know, but that she would ask them; and today she did just that. Her colleague (the person she asked it to) told her to ask me to compile a list or a text with everything I'd like to know and that it would be easier to answer it that way.

&amp;#x200B;

So now I'm here wondering what exactly I could ask him to better understand how their company works, what they do, how they do, etc, other than the obvious ""what tech stack do you use?"", but even that is such a broad question that wouldn't be helpful without additional context. Besides, I know so little about the industry and what a SWE's work and day-to-day is like.

&amp;#x200B;

So, i think my question is now obvious; what kind of questions could I ask them, that would benefit me to know, help me set learning goals (assuming I'm interested in working/interning there one day), and also determine if they're a company I'd like to work for (if they treat their employees well, if they follow software engineering (and specially security, given it's a bank) best practices, etc)? Keep in mind though, I'm not from the USA (I'm from South**ern** Africa), so some of your advice might not applicable here if it's a little American-centric.

&amp;#x200B;

**And also,** ***for some context*****:** I am currently (re)learning programming - web development specifically; that's an area of software engineering I'm interested in and would like to know work in, in the future (or maybe now if I had the opportunity, though I doubt I'm qualified).  And I also asked this question to my mom because I don't really know a whole lot about about the tech/software engineering market is here and how it works; so I was also asking this question so I could get a grasp of what the market looks like here (though, of course, I should probably research about more companies to know that) so I could set my ambitions accordingly and appropriately prepare to enter the industry.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR: What kind of questions could I ask to my mom's company's IT department to help me understand what it's like to work as a SWE there?**"
vrzt72,0,2022-07-05,Stockroom Inventory Management Software,FloatedWheat82,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/vrzt72/stockroom_inventory_management_software/,"Hi, I’m a young intern at a large engineering company, and recently have been assigned to look into a software solution regarding our engineering stockroom. I’m having a bit of trouble finding a good solution, a software that has all the necessary features. If anyone has any suggestions that’d be amazing

Some more background info on the stockroom:
The company I work at has recently acquired a portion of another company, and are going through a nasty split. The former company refused to give the new company any help transitioning to a new building, and are not giving us access to the software they created and used to run this same stockroom, hence the need of this new software. We do not employee many software developers, so a custom internally made software is pretty much out of the question unfortunately.
We employee around 400-500 engineers, all who are constantly prototyping, testing, and tinkering with new products. These engineers used to be able to use the old software to order pieces and parts, small electronic components, and more from the stockroom. An employee in the stockroom would be able to see the order and prepare the parts for the engineers quickly.
The employee of the stockroom had admin access to the software, and with that was able to issue parts, run metrics regarding the usage of the parts, keep track of expiration dates and low stock, perform cycle counts, and reorder parts from manufactures directly on the software. 
The user interface the engineers have access to allows them to see a lot of information about parts, including pictures and detailed descriptions, and most importantly order the parts. 
Again we want this software to keep track of the inventor, and when an engineer order parts, that is reflected in the part database and quantity. 
The software does not need any e-commerce functionality, as nothing is being sold outside of the building. 

Required Features:
Administrative Interface
-Issue Parts
-Alerted (print ticket, push notification, email, something similar) from software when engineers order parts from the stockroom.
-Ability to order parts from suppliers
-Run metrics on part database relating to part usage by engineers
-Perform cycle counts

User Interface
-View inventory, along with detailed info
-Order parts to stockroom

Again if you have any recommendations, please let me know. Thank you so much for the help!"

vs0yty,7,2022-07-05,question about internship/job in big companies,AwaysGays,developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/vs0yty/question_about_internshipjob_in_big_companies/,"I'm a first year CS student and when I searched on indeed to get an idea about the recruitment, I found out that different companies use different tech stacks/languages. Is it a barrier to get hired? (In my case, get an internship?) What I mean is what if I don't know react or JS but good at, say, python or C++?

I want to get an internship from a well known company in my 3rd year. So on what basis should I create my projects? (Eg. Maybe google will prefer angular while meta will prefer react implementation)"
vs15s9,0,2022-07-05,How screwed am I?,throwaywhocares,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vs15s9/how_screwed_am_i/,"So I'm a grad student pursuing my masters in Data Science. I'm currently pursuing a summer internship in a not so big company which is slightly data science related but I do have other responsibilities as well. I'd love to pursue a career in data science but I'd also want to keep swe as a back up rn because there are more opportunities and they kinda make more money relatively 🤑. The problem is that I haven't done a single leetcode problem in my life. My DSA is abysmal. My SQL skills aren't up to the mark. I wasted the entire summer up till now in the name of my internship. I have to get started with full time grind. Assuming that I'd start applying by mid August, is it too late to leetcode? Should I just stick to data science roles? And work on my SQL and big data skills. 

I also want to work towards becoming an ML engineer someday, cuz y not? It sounds cool, job responsibilities are cool and the pay is amazing. So how would I go about that?"

 I'm currently working remote as Cloud Engineering Trainee and I was wondering if it'd be worth to put it as work experience. I really like it but unfortunately it would be really difficult and I doubt I'd be able to handle it as I'm also a last year student (starting September again). The job is fully remote and the university is present so I wouldn't be by able to be at 2 places simultaneously.

The main 2 reasons I took it is because we have a mandatory ""internship"" kind of thing required from the university and because I received great feedback about the company (honestly it's not bad at all)."

I'm currently planning on staying at this job for around 1-2 years max and then moving somewhere else as I feel like there isn't much progression in this job (I did a year-long internship here as well) but I'm not too sure what to do within this time apart from the job itself to then land a better job, so stuff like personal projects, leetcode/hackerrank that sort of thing, what would be recommended to do?

I'm brand new to everything coding/programming related, but am interested in getting into the field.

Upon graduating the program, supposedly you're offered a job with the company. 

So before anyone says ""but you can learn everything you need to know from the internet"" - yes, I know! But I think a structured environment surrounded by people I can ask questions from would be better for me starting from scratch. The pay isn't awesome, but its potentially better than paying for the same experience. I am skeptical of this program because it sounds too good to be true, so I'm wondering if anyone has gone through the program and what your thoughts were?

Some background: I am about to start graduate school and the masters program I am attending is very intense (M-F 9am to 4:30pm). A portion of this is internships. I was thinking I would continue working as a server. However, I was recommended to this tech company that offers remote work, and a very decent salary, I would definitely make more than I do now. It just sounds too good to be true. Would a position claiming ""flex"" actually be flexible with hours? Do I go for it, or stick to the service industry until I know I can dedicate my time?

I (21 F) start culinary school this August. So because of this I have already started to work as an intern in a restaurant kitchen to practice my skills, gain some knowlegde, etc.

I have really enjoyed working there so far but 2 weeks ago I had the worst (work)day of my life. 

One of the sous chefs, let's call him V, can't really handle stress all that well and tends to lash out on others when things aren't going as planned. So two weeks ago it was me, V, and 3 other chefs in the kitchen. It was busy and with me not being as skilled yet (though I do everything I can to be an asset to the team) and the 3 others being quite new as well, it was a hot mess.
V was an complete asshole the entire day to the point I was too scared to ask him anything, afraid of him lashing out. He also ruined the entire mood in the kitchen and let me tell you I have felt better vibes at cemeteries... that's how bad that was.

At the end of the evening I've had about two mini anxiety attacks and when I got home I cried for like 45 minutes, feeling very small (as a person) and a disappointment.
I hate confrontation and I honestly don't want argue with him as he is a really nice man when we're not working. He's also the kind of guy that doesn't really see his own faults so talking to him about this won't help, I'm sure.

Now I have four weeks of to go on vacation but I can't help but feel anxious to go back to work again, afraid of another night like that...

What do I do or what can I say to myself to get through those nights?

I utilized LinkedIn to get referrals or ask Berkeley Alumni about their experience with certain companies as graduation approached and I was applying to jobs.

With that being said, connecting in good faith is important to keep the ecosystem alive and well. What do I mean by this? I mean that if you connect and say ""hey I'd love to get to know other professionals in the tech industry"" but you just want a referral, or you say ""I'd love to chat and learn more about what your work looks like at [company]"" but you actually are trying to connect about your club on campus or some kind of partnership, then you are contributing to the ""bait and switch"" environment, which hurts everyone. 

cc: Cal student consulting organizations

## My Context

I have been on several panels for students in the program I graduated from at Cal (Statistics), have posted or commented on tech subreddits or other forums, and simply by having an updated LinkedIn profile, get somewhere between 3-5 messages / week during busy seasons and \~1/week during the rest of the year. Most people ask for referrals or for me to hire them explicitly when I have advertised that our team is growing; I once shared a referrel link directly to LinkedIn and our internal analytics registered thousands of likes and hundreds of applications, and I also got dozens of DMs during those times. Others ask how to ""break into tech"" from other industries, or ask miscellaneous questions about my current or past company.  I think LI's algorithm will suggest me in the sidebar since I have a high response rate, but from my colleagues this experience is not uncommon.

## Incentives on both sides

Before I go into the format with examples, a word on incentives:

### Incentives for Current students

1. Opportunities: internships, full time job offers, referrals
2.  Knowledge: a phone call or email exchange where you ask someone in industry about their experience, tech stack, org chart, best practices, domain knowledge, etc. This almost always feeds somehow into \#1, but a highly motivated senior for instance might have internships and a solid profile, so they may just be reaching out to understand a more niche role, like MLE vs. ML SWE, or DS vs Applied Scientist, TPM vs. PM, and so on, or ask about projects on a high level. 
3. Mentorship: maybe you have seen someone's content or interacted with them and you admire them or otherwise want to get to know them or learn about their career journey. Maybe they were a GSI who graduated or you were in a club with them.

### Incentives for Alumni

1. Hiring pipeline and referral bonuses: if there are entry level roles to be filled, then oftentimes Berkeley students are particularly capable, and it means that there will be a shared context, or the current employee may even have a clear grasp on exactly what sorts of projects and academic training the current student has. Referral bonuses range from $500-$5000 depending on the context, which is nontrivial for what usually amounts to submitting a form or a slack message on behalf of an applicant.
2. Giving back: being a mentor can be a rewarding experience, and it also uplevels you as a manager and teacher, gives you more context on what is happening at different levels of the hiring pipeline or experience funnel for your industry / role ladder, and also reminds you of how far you've come in your own journey to have someone giving you some level of trust, admiration, or otherwise looking to you for guidance. 
3. An additional connection who may be useful later when the currently employed individual is in a position of needing a reference or job. Maybe the current student is going to have a much more successful career and soon you'll be peers or in need of mentorship yourself! You never know. 

An important note here is that these interactions are almost exclusively one-sided at the outset, or at the very least strongly asymmetric. Even in the case of referral bonuses, a job offer is clearly of greater value than a couple thousand dollars one time after taxes. 

## The ""Hi and Why"" Format

My suggestion is the ""hi and why"" format. Give a greeting, and then give a VERY brief (one sentence if you can) description of what you want from the interaction, including scope. By scope I mean, do you want an hour long call and for me to review your resume and project portfolio? Do you want me to look at your code? Do you want to meet in person? Do you want me to connect you to someone else in my network? Do you really just have one question and think you need a phone call to ask it? I want to know how much you're asking of me so I can budget when I can offer it, if I do want to offer it.

### Good Example:

""Hi Jake,

I'm a data scientist looking to apply to [company]. I was hoping I could speak to you beforehand so I can better prepare for the roles I'm seeing. Let me know if you have time to chat!

Best,
[first_name]""


You can see this person reached out, gave a brief intro (hi), said what they were hoping for (why), and a polite salutation to conclude the message. I appreciated the brevity and because they included both the hi and why, I knew exactly what to expect and how to budget my own time and energy to interact with them. I ended up having a back and forth email chain of more than 25 emails over several weeks containing detailed feedback for this candidate's resume and other components of their interview prep, have had two chats now and I genuinely was glad to be part of their career journey as they transitioned to ""big tech"" roles since they come from a slightly different environment. We have plans to grab coffee in the next few weeks to finally meet in person. They responded promptly and eagerly, but not ""desperately"" and were appreciative and teachable. This makes the exchange rewarding for me, thereby reducing friction when it comes to having additional touch points or advising.

### Bad Example

""Hi Jake, I'm Mark\* and I'm an undergraduate at UC Berkeley. I saw that you studied at UC Berkeley too and I would love to connect! Go Bears!""

You can see here the student includes the hi, but no ""why"". I don't quite understand why people want to connect on LinkedIn with people they haven't met because a low quality ""connection"" without an introduction or brief set of messages is not very useful unless you post frequently and I'm able to sort of ""get to know you"" via seeing your posts on my feed (which I rarely look at). But I understand some students are eager to connect with professionals and don't want to rebuff their enthusiasm, so I sent back a message (again, with name changed here for privacy):

""Nice to meet you Mark; looks like you have a strong profile and still a couple years left to gain momentum. Have you considered if you will do a masters or MBA?""

I responded this way because this student clearly is ambitious, and their LinkedIn is FULLY decked out with over 12 different experiences, several internships per summer, and some confusing employment entries which I now understand are some kind of ""consulting clubs"" at Cal of which I'm unfamiliar. They have the full measure of both typical and somewhat cringy ""I am deeply honored to have accepted my offer of internship at Bumbleflairex\*"" for literally every step in their student career and internship journey. Understainding their goals could help me get at the ""why"" component of connecting, and I thought they could be interested in the masters program I completed.    


\*Bumbleflairex is what all small startup names sound like to me, but is not a real company (yet).

The student's response was to send some kind of multi-paragraph advertisement about how he is the vice president of a very exclusive and illustrious consulting organization and how my current company could really benefit from the expertise and ""acceleration of product development"" that his organization has to offer. The website was not specific about exactly what partnership looks like and I couldn't see clear examples so :shrug:. 

I was sort of taken aback because he also didn't answer my question or continue in the organic conversation, which indicated to me that I'm clearly part of a wide net LinkedIn outreach effort, and while I would be potentially interested in connecting with an eager student, I'm not excited to engage in some kind of ad, especially when it wasn't part of the ""why"" in the original message. It's a bait and switch--I saw you're a Cal alumni, let's connect! Great. I'll connect. Also, now that we've connected, here's an exclusive opportunity I want to sell you on. 

## The Big Tech Company Ecosystem

Before I go on, let me be clear--I think that Cal undergrads are exceptional. I was a GSI for several courses when I was at Cal and had students who were far more accomplished than I was as an undergrad and extremely sharp. However, the team I currently work with are all econ or stats PhDs from top 10 schools who have between 4-10 years of experience in our specific domain--oftentimes they come from the specific research field that my company or team focuses on. This means they have, on average, 12-15 years of experience working with the data and models our team cares about. This is nearing the age of undergrad students. And unless you're Terence Tao you're going to need more time to absorb and process the information and methods in our domain. When we hire interns or undergrads, it's nearly 100% because we trust that they will be helpful or productive after a substantial investment *from our end* while providing little to no benefit during the ramp up period. Internships in general are chiefly to reduce costs on the recruitment budget because it's easier to identify and invest in students over a summer and have return offers for the following year than it is to sift through hundreds of thousands of resumes during full time recruitment season, and those same interns tend to refer well for the roles we care about, so we pay them bonuses instead of hiring more recruiters. Furthermore, our company has a TON of training and bureacracy in order to allow people to have access to ANY data or even log in to our system. It's a huge headache when something goes wrong and we have senior people in their 30s who fuck something up even when they havd so much experience. It presents a large incentive NOT to trust or engage with outsiders about internal proprietary information and increases the necessary value add before a break even point. This is not to say that it's impossible to add value, it's simply to illustrate the perspective of someone working in industry and how this ecosystem is represented to us when we know nothing about your student organization.

What I'm getting at is that there is *some degree* of presumption when you are a student and you contact a full time engineer, data scientist, product manager, or other employee at a large firm and claim that you have something strong to offer. Additionally, it takes a substantial amount of ""messaging around"" for the most eager of employees to find out who is in charge of these partnerships, then I have to have a call to explain what it is, then a follow up to introduce the point person, and I also have to take on the risk of it being unfruitful which reflects poorly on me and might hurt my ability to get resources later when I need them. Have these organizations provided some value to companies in the past? Their existence suggests so, but it's not evident to me what the value would be, since my company has a hoard of engineers, data scientists, and PMs at all levels working on these things all the time.

This student has now sent me several messages to remind me of his original offer, and even sent me a ""Happy Fourth of July"" message and an **additional connection request** after I declined his first one, which actually reminded me to finish this post I had in my drafts, so it was not entirely useless.

## Recommendations

1. Be clear from the outset what you're interested in by summarizing it in your ""why"" component of your original message.
2. Avoid jargon and be specific whenever possible, because not everyone knows your context or what you're offering. E.g. if you say ""consultants"" or ""accelerate product development"" add that your consultants are current undergrads in a STEM major, and that by ""accelerate product development"" you mean perhaps that you will do some kind of project on an underresourced area for 4-6 weeks, or say ""you give us access to proprietary data and we will build a model and partner with one engineer, one data scientist, and one PM before we hand it back off to your team for maintenance"". 
3. Don't pester or follow up half a dozen times if the connection isn't happening. Leave your original message, MAYBE one reminder, and then thank them for their time and leave a link or an email to reach you if they are interested in the future. I have left a message on read or declined in the past, but then gone back to look for the message when the right time arose, but only if the person was (i) not aggressive or pretentious (ii) they were polite and brief."

He’s around 22/23. They worked for another part of the company, and applied for the role when they saw the opening. Feedback from previous managers was good, and after a good interview, we offered him the position. 

Day 1 of the job, he mentioned to me that he did not feel comfortable working on anything to do with our pride campaign (we work in marketing) due to religious reasons. He also shared with me he is gay. The specific role he had in assisting with that was minimal, and I told him I would cover it. He continued to keep mentioning it most weeks, as if I had forgotten.

Today in our 1:1, he shared that he had something he wanted to talk to me about. I never realized it, but he began following my public Instagram account. I shared some posts in Roe v. Wade a couple weeks ago, and he said seeing that made him extremely uncomfortable. He said that he was nervous if he were to share his own personal views on his personal Instagram (that women should carry to term if they are physically able to), he was worried if it would jeopardize getting hired after his student work term. I was taken aback, but I explained to him that we would never use his personal views against him in consideration for a new role. I did apologize if I made him uncomfortable, and we had a short conversation that it’s important to self-censor the content you consume (aka basically told him to unfollow if it made him uncomfortable) and that was that.

I’m planning to bring it to HR’s attention for two reasons: if it keeps happening, and so we have it in writing if we didn’t hire him on past his student position. Personally I’m beginning to get uncomfortable with his need to bring his personal views into the workplace, but I can handle these discussions.

Being in a student role, his work isn’t outstanding right now, but he’s learning. I’d like him to be working a bit faster, but I’m hoping we can get there with time. Losing him wouldn’t be the end of the world. 

Would love a second opinion on this."

I started an internship 1 month ago and I met my boss who is one of the most charismatic and funny people I have met. I instantly respected him and was drawn to him because of it (those personalities are my kryptonite - mostly because I want to emulate those traits myself). He was attracted to me because I am fairly conventionally attractive and his ego probably feels nice to know that a 20 something girl was into him even at his age. We started flirting by just smiling with each other and having 1-2 30sec conversations. He’s married and I’m leaving for college so we both know it’s not going anywhere. 

He started getting very jealous when I interact with anyone else on the team (and deep down I like it even when I shouldn’t). I never intentionally tried to make him jealous and would put in efforts to reduce eye contact with my other male colleagues just to show him that I treat him differently. He noticed that I got jealous when he interacted with another female colleague (I have no right over him I don’t know why I do) and he started loving the reaction I gave and would try to illicit it more. 

I realized that and immediately pulled back and started kind of ignoring him. I figured that that was the push I needed to get over this stupid crush that was distracting me from the actual objective of the internship. He thought I was pulling back because of his interactions with this female colleague (which deep down could also be a motivation for me).

Today, he started acting cold towards the female colleague to placate me and my emotional brain loved it. He even kind of made fun of the female colleague and I don’t know why but after that I stopped ignoring him. In a way, I validated his actions and I feel terrible about it. I was talking to another colleague about another matter related to the same female colleague and it probably added fuel to the fire and made him think I was trash talking about her when I really wasn’t. He started ignoring me, and the female colleague probably also noticed and started acting cold towards me(she’s one of the nicest people alive). 

I realize that this is not how I am supposed to be acting especially at a place where I want to take my internship seriously. How do I salvage this ?"

i'm in my third year of university (21 years old) and i have absolutely no clue what to do with my life. my bf is in the tech industry, and with internships he's had, he's pretty much set for life and knows exactly what he wants to do.

I'm in science, and i have absolutely no idea what sort of career i should strive for. he keeps bugging me to take time this summer to figure it out, since i'm just working part time at a Starbucks and not doing any classes. I have lots of free time.

While working at Starbucks, I have realized a key factor about myself: I love repetition. At my job, it's not a super busy location. It's pretty chill and my tasks are the exact same everyday (save for drink variety). I make drinks, take orders, clean everything, restock, make coffee. I always close and the closing routine is the exact. same. every single day.

and I love it!
I have really bad anxiety, so knowing exactly what i’m getting myself into everyday takes away almost all of my work related anxiety. 

I would have to say the one and probably only thing I dislike about this job is the standing. I’m only 21 but I suffer from osteoarthritis, back pain, joint pain, knee problems, and fatigue. 

other things to note about myself:
- i love cooking and baking
- i play video games
- i’m good with computers, and know HTML, CSS, and Python. 
- I am good with customer service and helping/talking to people. 
- I am generally pretty low energy. 
- i am an avid writer (fiction and fanfiction)

I would love to put my science degree to good use. If anyone has Any sort of career idea or suggestion to offer me, I’m all ears! And I’d really appreciate the help :)"

Questions:

1. Is my profile somewhat competitive for top 4 ? I am also not sure which schools would be safe choices.
2. When and how should I contact professors? Most professors at top schools mention on their webpages that they will not reply to mails from prospective PhD students.
3. Would it hurt a lot if I apply for a lab that does not have much to do with my previous work? (ex: my previous work=video understanding &amp; lab applying for=3D understanding, NeRF)"

5. &amp;#x200B;

**Letters of Recommendation**

Never got to read either of these letters but Ima try and take some educated guesses as to how they were:

Precalc and AP Calc Teacher (7/10) -- I felt like I had a pretty good connection with her, especially since I had her both sophomore and junior years. I put a lot of work into her class to bring my B in the first semester of precalc to an A+ by the second semester, so was hoping she'd write about that. However later a rumor went around the school that all her letters are pretty cut and paste but hey what can ya do

Honors English Teacher (8/10) -- Even though I only ever knew her over Zoom I felt like we kinda shared the same vibe. Was one of the most active members of the class and would often stay after class to talk about books and linguistics with her. Also she wanted a fat brag sheet from us for the letter so that thing must've been smacking

**Interviews**

*Georgetown* (9/10) -- My interviewer was sitting cross-legged in a gaming chair for the whole time so she was pretty lit. Also Indian so we bonded a lot over that. All around chiller and our convo went for like thirty minutes over time so I think that's good

*Tufts* (10/10) -- Wasn't as nervous for this one after the Georgetown interview so I feel like I was talking a lot more smoothly here. The interviewer had just graduated in like 2017 so she was pretty relatable and still knew a lot of the current events going on on-campus. Also went pretty long overtime

*Harvard* (6/10) -- My interviewer was very... proper. Even though I feel like I performed pretty well in this one I can't say I felt I made much of a connection with her at all. She ended our call right on the dot. I used the word ""grindset"" in response to one of her questions tho so that was pretty sick

**Essays**

Personal Statement -- This one was pretty eclectic but basically I talked about my love for jazz music and how it influenced my approach towards life. In the middle I brought up how I was born with a rare genetic condition called Osteogenesis Imperfecta (you can search it up if you want more info but basically it just means I'm hella fragile and have a spine so curvy it could be used as a model for protractors). I snuck that one Bear Grylls meme (""improvise, adapt, overcome"") into my closing sentence tho so felt pretty cheeky after that one

Other than that tho all my other essays were pretty mid, call them like a solid 7/10

**Decisions**

*Acceptances:*

* WashU STL (McKelvey CS)
* Cal Poly SLO (CS) **Attending**
* Tulane (Honors w/ $25k/year merit)
* UCSD (Intl Bus)
* UC Irvine (Undecided)
* George Washington U (Intl Bus) ($25k/year merit + Presidential Scholarship)
* UC Davis (CS)
* SDSU (Intl Bus)
* UC Santa Cruz (CS) (They also gave me Regent's Ship?!?!)
* U of San Francisco (CS) ($30k/year merit)

*Waitlists:*

* UCLA (Economics) (took the offer but didn't write an essay so not too likely to pull this one)
* UC Berkeley (CS) Pretty hyped to have even gotten the waitlist but it's not like there's a ton of movement on the UCB EECS waitlist so def not getting off it lol
* UCSB (Undecided)
* Tufts (CS)
* American U (Intl Bus)

*Rejections:*

* Georgetown (Intl Bus) (made me p sad but then I went to the gym and hit a new bench PR so we chilling)
* Stanford (CS interest) (obviously rejected lol)
* Northwestern (Undecided)
* Harvard
* USC

**Additional Information:**

Now for the question some of y'all might be wondering: *Why'd he commit to Cal Poly over WashU???* Basically, the decision was made for me once I did the total cost estimator for WashU lol. I've got a sister who wants to become a doctor and med school isn't cheap so I can't be asking my parents to pay a private school tuition knowing what her dreams are. Overall tho happy with the results, go stangs"
vshmyi,1,2022-07-06,Double Major OR Major and Minor for Bio + Business,Delicious_Snow_479,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/vshmyi/double_major_or_major_and_minor_for_bio_business/,"hi everyone! I'm actually an incoming college freshman (I know that's early, I just have to plan my schedule out ahead of time) and have two areas of interest: biology + business. I think I might be interested in biotechnology, biostatistics, bioinformatics, or something that combines knowledge of both but honestly, I have no idea what I'm really passionate about or want to actually pursue. My college, which is pretty competitive, has a bio major and a business major. When committing to college, I intended to double major. Also I will probably go to grad school after undergrad since I'm def not premed.

Since my initial commitment, I've really been struggling because I'm not sure if double majoring is worth it anymore or the right decision. The bio major is a rigorous 97-120 units and the bus major is another 99-102 units with a few cc credits and basically no overlapping classes it's a lot to fulfill. I'm also not sure if that difference in undergrad makes a huge difference or not. Realizing this, I'm considering a Bio major + bus minor instead because the minor is just 24 units.

I just feel really torn about what to do. This is a pros and cons list for double majoring:

Pros                                                                                         Cons

|allows me to explore my interests in both fields since I'm not sure which one of bio or bus I actually really enjoy more|doesn't allow me to spend more time on other activities like internships and research which I know are important, especially for grad school and work experience|
|:-|:-|
|makes me a more competitive applicant for grad school or a job (I'm assuming because 2 degrees is better than1 degree??)|less manageable and a lot more work|
|gives me more flexibility when it comes to finding a career that I'm interested in and can help me possibly promote into leadership positions with bus background|gives me more flexibility to take classes I'm interested in and can also help build skills or learn valuable information|

Edit: Someone mentioned that these major(s) might not be even helpful for the careers fields I mentioned. What would you guys think about the options of maybe majoring in Data Science with a minor such as Computational Biology, Quantitative Biology &amp; Bioinformatics, Neuroscience, or just Biological Sciences? what would you advise in terms of those options for a career in the fields I mentioned? would that be a better path? I honestly just need to make sure I'm making a strong salary (preferably over 130K) so if you have other suggestions for things I might even be interested in, I'd appreciate it. 

Sorry I know this is a long post, but I just need some advice especially because I need to have a full (basically 4 yr) schedule planned out before registering for classes. I'd appreciate any advice :)"

I graduated around one year ago, and have almost 2YoE between internships and current job.

Recently I have been contacted through LinkedIn for jobs that offer significantly more money than I currently make (almost 10k more total comp, which is like a 15%-20% increase), but are less related to what I want to do (Architectute, Product, PaaS) than what I currently do.

Im not poor by any means in my state (Spain), but Im not saving any money apart from a little emergency fund.

I tell myself the experience is way more important than money at this moment, especially since I have not been in my current position for a long time (think a couple months) and since Im able to live well enough, but man is money attractive.

Has any of you dealt with a similar situation, what did you do and how did whatever decision you made affect your future?

Ever since I was in 9th grade I thought that I’f be happy and enjoy studying Architecture because that was what my guidance counselors listed as the top college course I should take once I go to college. I was also pretty good at math, science and art. By the time I was in 11th grade I started to develop a liking towards visual arts (painting, drawing, etc.) and mulitmedia arts (graphic design, branding, etc.). At this point I thought to myself if ever Architecture doesn’t work out I could always just do art for a living. Upon college applications I wrote Architecture being my priority program and Fine Arts being my second choice. Luckily enough I was able to pass Architecture into a university most known for how good its Architecture program is. After my first semester, I began to start disliking the course—I didn’t exactly find the workload too much, I just didn’t enjoy what I was studying. I told myself since this was my first sem, it would be natural for me to find the course hard. By the time I came back for my next sem, I found myself despising a majority of the subjects I was taking—somewhat in a sense that I couldn’t envision myself doing it after I finished college, internship or even if I manage pass licensure (of which I already am sure I will not be taking). I told myself if ever I did fail this sem, I don’t really have to worry because I could always change majors anyways. To add, I was also taking in art commissions during the time. In all honesty, I was always looking forward to doing commission work rather than my assignments. I couldn’t help but be excited and over joyed when I was doing them, unlike when I was doing my drawing assignments for school. I just ended up finishing the sem for the sake of finishing it. Upon receiving my grades for the sem I was shocked to find out that I managed to pass all my classes and was able to be a dean’s lister, as well. 

As of the moment, I am currently on break and I can’t decide whether or not I want to stay in Architecture for my second year or move to Fine Arts. If I stay in Architecture, I know I would resent it for the rest of my life. However, I am equally as scared to move to Fine Arts because I feel like I might end up hating it just like I did with Architecture. My heart tells me to pursue Fine Arts, but my mind tells me to finish Architecture. I’ve discussed the matter with my parents and are perfectly fine with either decision I make. I would like to hope for advice regarding which would be the better option between passion or stablity. Do I listen to my stupid heart or to my heartless brain?"

I am a university student and doing a major in embedded systems. I am looking to secure an internship in the spring of 2023 (January next year, not doing in this summer). **I just wanted to ask that  what skills I should work on to increase my chances of getting an internship in 6 months from now.** I am currently doing projects independently, to name some I am building a communication platform that supports CSMA protocol using Arm cortex and I also just recently studied x86 architecture and DMA in detail. I will be doing another project in the next Fall semester. I have experience with peripherals and C and Embedded C, Python (only basic to intermediate), and I did study C++ (but have not used much)

I am planning to work on RTOS, learn about RISV-V and Arm architecture and learn any PCB designing software in next 6 months.

Your suggestions shall surely help!

Thanks,

vsin0u,3,2022-07-06,How Important is it to Know Your Major/Plan (Before) Your Freshman Year?,Delicious_Snow_479,UCDavis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/vsin0u/how_important_is_it_to_know_your_majorplan_before/,"hi everyone! I'm an incoming college freshman and have two areas of interest: biology + business. I think I might be interested in biotechnology, biostatistics, bioinformatics, or something that combines knowledge of both but honestly, I have no idea what I'm really passionate about or want to actually pursue which is exactly my issue. (also I will probably go to grad school after undergrad since I'm def not premed.) I feel like everyone already has everything planned out and it makes me so stressed out to think that I could be wasting my time especially in the first year or two trying to settle on a major. 

When committing to college, I intended to double major in Neurobiology, Physiology, and Behavior and Managerial Economics, but now I'm not so sure. The bio major is a rigorous 97-120 units and the bus major is another 99-102 units. Realizing this, I might just do the technology management minor which is about 20 units instead of double majoring. I don't even know if my major(s) will want I actually am interested in or want to pursue.

I'm just concerned because I really want to make the most out of my time at UCD and not have to worry about being behind with credits and graduating late, not having time for internships, etc. It's just stressful because the many different majors (and even minors) I'm considering have different pre-reqs and would completely change my first year (and first quarter) schedule. I don't want to take unnecessary classes or waste time because I haven't fully decided yet. I definitely need the time and experiences to explore my interests, but again I feel like I have to have it all figured out before my July 25th passtime. 

Sorry I know this is a long post and I don't mean to sound whiney or like I'm complaining, I've just been genuinely struggling with figuring this all out (I'm very much an overthinker and am hard on myself). I'd appreciate any advice or thoughts you might have :)"

Started my end of study internship a few months ago. I have no background in data science or Machine Learning, but I'm learning thanks to this sub, YouTube, blogs and documentations.

Now I've performed two physical experiment, which gave me two huge database. We are measuring two differents phenomenon that are similar but supposed to have some differences. When I plot scatter feats matrix or histogram, the datasets overlap. We cannot make up two group.

Measurements data goes through a preprocess consisting of selection (I picked randomly 15000 points per class in the few millions of my database), denoising, feature extracting, outlier remove). I then perform supervised learning as I'm fairly confident in my experiments.

The results are very very good. 99,98% accuracy (Stratified KFold cross validation). I've looked up which features weights the most in my models (I use KNN, RF, DTC, SGD) and tried to remove the top one. Still 99,95%. 

So I've made a loop that removes the top parameters from my dataset and then retrain my models and evaluate them. After a few execution, 19 of the 39 parameters where remove to obtain a classification accuracy below 90%. 

The results seems just too good to be real. I want to make sure I'm not making any stupid rookie mistake here. Is there any test that I can perform ? 

There's probably experimental biases, I'm performing new experiment as we speak to minimize them.

Cheers and have a good day"

vslv92,336,2022-07-06,"Stay and double my salary, or switch and try something new?",ErioRaggen,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/vslv92/stay_and_double_my_salary_or_switch_and_try/,"So I'm (24M) at a crossroad. I currently work as a software engineer at a big tech company. I was an intern for a year and made \~40k. The job is pretty relaxed and my collegues are nice. But I'm not really happy with the work I'm doing. While I like programming, I don't really like doing it for 40 hours a week. I really want to negotiate, discuss and explain. So more talking, less typing.

Now that my internship is almost done, If I stay, I will be promoted with a \~80k salary (including bonuses). But my position will be fairly the same. So just 40h weeks with nothing but programming. I've discussed this with my manager, and he said that more 'social' positions aren't available any time soon. So I should expect staying in this position for another 2-3 years.

But I can also switch to another company. I currently have 2 other job offers that I'm concidering. They are smaller companies, but this means I'll have more variety in my work. And won't only be programming, but also negotiate and making decision. But I'll go back to a \~35k salary, with not that much room for growth.

I know that I'm still young, and I should experiment with different jobs. But 80k sounds really nice, and I'm curious how it feels to make that much. But after doing this for a year, I'm pretty certain full time programming isn't for me.

I can also just stay for a year or so and then switch. But doing this for another year, isn't really something I look forward to.

So one voice says: 'just suck it up and take the money'

the other says: 'you tried for a year, now is a nice time to try something new. Because this isn't working'

I could really use some fresh perspective. Should I stay or switch?

&amp;#x200B;

edit: I think the overall message is clear. Going for the 35k jobs is selling myself short and will hinder my future salary growth. Even if I take the 80k job, I wouldn't even have to finish the whole year. As soon as I have the contract, I can use it as a springboard to launch my career. And aim for positions like 'solutions engineer' or 'sales engineer' (or even product manager). Which sound like positions that would fit me quite well and I would excel at.

Thank you all for the responses, you've been very helpful."

I am moving to the US for an internship and being paid an honorarium of a few thousand in PayPal. [PayPal charges a 4% conversion fee on top of poor exchange rates](https://www.paypal.com/ca/webapps/mpp/paypal-fees). I want to load all this up on a USD bank account so I can wire money to US people and register a pre-paid credit card (to avoid conversion fees).

I heard that transferring [USD from PayPal to a Canadian bank account](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/m2rwok/paypal_now_has_a_minimum_4_foreign_exchange_fee/) forces a currency conversion and fee. I heard this is true even if you have a USD currency account in your Canadian bank account. Apparently a few years ago, you could sign up for US-based USD accounts for international banks like TD. But now, PayPal will always default to currency conversion if your bank account location is in Canada.

**Question 1.** What is the best way for low fees USD PayPal balance to chequeing account?

Here are some alternatives that I read might work:

1. PayPal &gt; Transferwire &gt; Transferwire FX &gt; Canadian bank account with USD account
2. PayPal &gt; Transferwire &gt; Norton Gambit (IB/QT) &gt; Canadian bank account with USD account
3. PayPal &gt; Transferwire &gt; Knightsbridge &gt; Canadian bank account with USD account

**Question 2.** What is the best option for spending USD balance on a credit card (to avoid USD &gt; CDN transfer, and CDN &gt; USD exchange rate fees)?

I currently am thinking about using Wealthsimple Cash. Their card is a pre-paid visa credit. They have no fees but hold all money in CAD by default. They charge FX, obviously, but it can be used anywhere without bank fees. Apparently if you buy Plus for $10/mo, you can hold a USD balance.

&amp;#x200B;

**Update:** As of July 15th, 2022 the wise USD account works. I requested a physical card and got it in the mail today. I also tried to register it as a US bank on PP. It worked (awaiting deposit verification). I guess it takes a week or so for the banks to recognize my account."

vsy26k,1,2022-07-06,Should I give him a chance to talk face to face or just ghost him?,Accomplished-Aioli30,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/vsy26k/should_i_give_him_a_chance_to_talk_face_to_face/,"Should I give up on him?

So I (her/22) have been getting to know this boy (him/28) for the last three months. I don’t know how to resume this to you but I’m at a time that I don’t know what to do about him anymore or if he is worth having a last conversation. 

For a little background, we met on Instagram and since we began talking everything was amazing. We met on person and it was even better than talking online. We started getting to know each other and everything this implies: kissing, talking everyday, sex, etc. His interest in me was showing until one day, his ex girlfriend contacted him and his interest stopped being the way it was. When we were together everything was okay, but text replies began being slower and he was not as intense to me as he was before. We didn’t spend lots of time together (he is on his journey to become a doctor and needs to study for his exam while working as an intern in two different hospitals, while I’m finishing my bachelor degree) so we only afforded to meet one day per week maximum. He broke with his three year ex girlfriend eight months before meeting me and I know it has been hard on him, but he assured me he was okay with the past and has moved on. 

The thing is, a month ago I tried getting some communication on what page is he with me (over text) but he didn’t reply. He is a bad texter and there’s times where I don’t even get a reply on my messages for a whole day. There have been more things that he’s done to me that show me little interest in me but then there are moments when we’re together that everything is perfect. I met a lot of his friends and even his brother. But when we’re not together everything is so unclear to me. In order to not get hurt, every time something happened I distanced myself a little bit more.

So after all of this, Itold him that I wanted to meet him in order to get things clearer. We spent two weeks trying to find a day, but it was impossible. I was anxious to talk to him so I sent him two voice messages saying how I was feeling and telling him that I did not feel reciprocated and after everything that has happened, I think that the best is for us to be just friends.

He took two days to reply. And he told me that he was in a place we’re he could not meet someone the way he wanted even if he likes me, and that we should talk in person. I agreed but it’s been a week and he has not replied to my messages to meet.

I asked him some distance to get my feelings together and I haven’t texted him first. BUT he replied to my Instagram stories and when I did not respond started sending me some dog videos. I replied and still have no response. 

I want to end this situation. His actions are hurting me and being in this limbo is making me go nuts. Seeing his lack of effort also has hurt me deeply. Right now I want to ghost him but a part of me thinks that the correct thing to do is to see him and talk everything out to at least end this and move on. I don’t know if he deserves the effort after everything he’s done.

What do you think?"

I've never written a post on Reddit before, so I appreciate your patience as I seek advice for a situation I recently found myself in. 

I was laid off on June 28th, from a company based out of New York. We were told this layoff would impact 10% of the \~300 employees and was a result of declining business. The way they did the layoffs is they basically drew a line in the hierarchy of the business and laid off all of the lower level (junior, etc.) employees. 

I was told multiple times that this layoff was not a result of my performance or myself, but rather I was collateral in business decisions. 

Totally I found out that not even a week later that they hired a marketing intern, **who is the niece of the new COO that was hired several months ago,**  who is going to start in the next week or two (beginning of July), and will basically be doing all of the same responsibilities as I was doing in my role. 

I have gotten some advice that since the role I was in was ""eliminated"" (why I was laid off), it's illegal for them to be replacing the role with somebody else, especially with somebody so soon, and with somebody who has familial ties to an executive at the company. 

**Is there a case here?** I'm not sure what my next steps would be, or if there is any foul play at work, but I would be very grateful for any advice. Thank you in advance!"
vszilw,39,2022-07-06,I fucked up at my job and the corporate offered a legal service. Should I go with it or not?,lossunday,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/vszilw/i_fucked_up_at_my_job_and_the_corporate_offered_a/,"Due to the recession we are in, I couldn’t land an entry-level tech position for 4 months and instead was advised by my school’s career center to apply for internship programs instead since I, unfortunately, had no internship experience during undergrad due to the COVID recession that happened two years ago. For the past two months, I have applied to literally 400+ internship positions all over the nation and after a few failed attempts and 5 rounds of interviews at some places, I finally received an offer, only to be disappointed that it was unpaid and I had to be on-site every Tuesday\~Thursday. Beggars can’t be choosers, right?

After going through the training in the first week, I was ready to be put into production, writing/designing code, and cleared whatever tickets were given. Let’s just say despite having a CS degree I still am not a good programmer. Being stressed from completing all the training programs for less than a week even though I was supposed to finish in 3 days, I was exhausted and had to pull an all-nighter the other day to deploy a new feature. This is the moment when the brain fart crept in and I really did not pay attention to the script that I was passing into the terminal that wiped out the data. In short, upon migrating the server, I pretty much fucked something up and I wasn't exactly sure what it was. After my coworker asked me why the hell did I delete the wrong migration server, I slowly realized I dug a hole myself that I can't crawl back out of. my project manager yelled my name “lossunday, where the fuck you at?” from the end of the hallway and when he came to my desk, he slammed shut my laptop. He then proceeded to tell me to pack my shit and report to the exec office. At this point, I was beyond mortified as everyone on the floor rushed in to see what the hell was going on. Everyone was staring at me as I tread my way to the office. I wanted to run far away and never come back. When I got to the office, my PM told me to wait at the office until the execs are there. 

After waiting for half an hour I was still alone in the office, out of fear, I checked teams and some people were mentioning my name and some even cussed at me for wiping out the entire project. At this point, I started having a mental breakdown and threw my laptop to the ground, and started crying. After about an hour since I was sent to the room, the exec came to the building along with the HR team.

The HR and some of the exec team came to tell me that they are here for me and told me not to worry too much about it. One of the people who came along was a corporate lawyer on retainer and informed me that I could remain silent if I do want to but it is better that I tell everything truthfully. They were very empathetic and even offered me a cup of tea to soothe troubled waters. After they introduced themselves, one of the execs cut to the chase and told me that I am in big trouble but so long as I am cooperative and told everything truthfully, my legal risk will be lower than me not cooperating with them. I was a little caught off guard at this point, and I asked them what legal risk they were talking about. They seem to think that I have intentionally brought the server down and it has been assessed that the backup files from a third-party vendor are failing to restore which means they are back to square one after a few months of hard work which case it is totally possible for me to be tried for a civil AND criminal case. After this, I went into a full-on panic mode that I really couldn't concentrate and couldn't hear a word of what the execs were discussing for a few minutes. I was told to get some rest tonight and I could work with a lawyer sent from the corporate or could hire my own. After the meeting, they took back my laptop and a badge and the lawyer gave me the contact info and I left the place.

My question is, should I go with the lawyer from the corporate? Though he gave me good advice and what to do and what not to do in my case, I am a little worried that he might represent the corporate interest over mine. However, since I already have some student loans, I am not able to afford a good lawyer out of my own pocket. Also, could my parents potentially be hooked for having to repay for the severity of a data loss? Could this potentially go on my record which will make me unhirable?"

Is there a specific month or 2 when such positions have more openings, and this isn’t one of those months? Should I try other sites besides just LinkedIn? While I’m not willing to relocate, I am willing to work remotely regardless of where actual company is located. 

I’m looking primarily for new grad positions because I want to apply for positions that are more lax on experience and are willing to train upon hiring, as I graduated with no project or internship experience. Also was wondering what often qualifies as new grad, like if it’s within a year of official graduation date (July 2021, bachelors for me) or if it’s the first job you’re looking to start post-graduation?"

vt0p7d,3,2022-07-06,Advice on Feeling Discouraged When Applying to Jobs,Jawnnnnn,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/vt0p7d/advice_on_feeling_discouraged_when_applying_to/,"Hi Everyone,

I wanted some advice and to see how you all feel when applying for IT positions. I just left my previous job because I moved states and am now starting to apply to jobs but am feeling a little discouraged.

My background so far is that I have a B.S. in an unrelated field. Underwent a career change into IT in 2019 and got an associates from my local state college, I have my A+ cert, and about 2 years of experience so far from an internship and my previous job. With this I am still kinda looking for entry level 1-2 work just to find something that I can continue to build experience and work on other certifications as well so I can be more qualified for better jobs down the line.

I redid my resume and after having a few IT people review including one company recruiter, I feel it is in good shape. The recruiter actually really liked me and I would have landed a great job but I was unable to move earlier for when they wanted me to start.

So I'm here now in my new state and have started applying to jobs. I'm looking on LinkedIN and Indeed applying to anything I feel qualified for, but have started to feel a little discouraged because on LinkedIN you can see how many people have applied for the position and a lot of the time there may be hundreds or more applying to them. I know I am good at what I do but I am humble so I have a hard time believing that I am better than the other 200 people applying as well and start to think that maybe I shouldn't apply to that one because why would they pick me? Theres gotta be a few of them at least that are better than me right?

 I'm not sad or ""woe is me"" or anything but wanted to see how you all felt when applying to jobs and if you feel the same way I do. I'm going to keep applying and hopefully if I play a numbers game then something will turn up but thats just the feeling I've got so far from applying. Does it take long to potentially hear back from companies? My last position I transferred departments to IT so it has been about 6 years since I've actually had to do this again. Thanks for any advice or words of encouragement."

As a kid I was viewed as being stupid just because I have OCD/ADHD.  As I was growing up all I wanted to do was prove everyone wrong about me being stupid and a nobody. I am going to college and now I am currently doing an internship. At first when I got this internship, I felt like I have finally reached a level of confidence in myself that I am now longer going to be judged by others since I am working professionally. Boy was I wrong.

I have been working here for a little bit over a month and everyone seems annoyed with me since I ask a lot of questions on the job. The truth is I do ask a lot of questions but because of that it shows that I care. They told me at first no question is a stupid question, but I blew that out of proportion. ANYTHING I had wasn't sure about I would ask. Over time they realized I wasn't asking questions because I am an intern but instead that I am not as smart as them, but the truth is that not true. 

If this internship has taught me anything it's not that I am dumb but because I am unconfident in myself. Throughout the years of feeling beneath people it has made me paint a picture of myself as being dumb and worthless just because of my disorders but in all honesty, I know I am more outgoing than the rest of those people in the office I work in. Also, I apologize if I describe somebody that matches your background just know I am referring to them specifically.

The one dropped out of community college and eventually went back to get it. 3 of them are just related to the CEO of the company. I can go on, but I don't want to offend somebody my point is I am more impressive than their background. The one thing that I have that they don't is the fact that I have disabilities working inside a corporate environment. That to me proves that I can make it out in the world more than they can because having a disability and working in a corporate office is HARD. Anyone who can do it gets my vote on being a strong worker.

Growing up and being told by a bunch of people that I am beneath them has been a curse and a blessing. The good thing about it has given me the fire in my soul to keep pushing forward in life no matter how many times I keep getting knocked down. The bad part of it is like I keep saying I feel beneath people and the others in my company can see that as well. They say things to me that makes me feel really bad about myself and honestly, I really shouldn't. They have nothing to out beat me in other then the fact they didn't get born with something that would hinder them in their lives. I am in the same environment as them with these disorders but as an intern. They didn't have to work as hard as me with these disabilities. I shouldn't feel beneath them if anything I should feel above them.

For anyone that just has ADHD or OCD and not both its probably something you wouldn't expect to be that detrimental, but you'd be wrong. Having both of them is not 1+1=2 no its 1+1=5. It makes you overthink and unable to concentrate so badly that no matter how much you try it is still not enough for most of the time. Imagine having a job where you can't concentrate on what your boss is telling you what to do. Imagine having a job that is completely stacked against you. Don't believe me, I can list all the reasons. Here is everything that people with what I have struggle with, listening to others, we hate working with others, constant noise all around you, not being able to take charge of what you do, having deadlines to keep up with, having to retain memory, having to be organized with resources. I can keep going but I won't. Despite all of that I still don't give myself any credit.

Going back to what I was originally was saying. I still don't have any kind of self-confidence in myself even though I am trying with all my might so why do I continue to have doubts in myself. I can tell you it's because of how people have treated me all of my life and how they have made me feel."
vt46nl,3,2022-07-06,"As an intern, how to know if I'm asking too many questions?",Death_Strider16,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vt46nl/as_an_intern_how_to_know_if_im_asking_too_many/,"So I have an internship and my boss is pretty busy but almost always makes time for a video call at least once a day to help me when I'm stuck or give me directions on how to rewrite my code to be better.

Other than that he also answers questions over slack. Sometimes he's pretty quick, other times I don't hear from him for hours which is expected.

I try to only ask questions if I've been stuck on an issue for more than 30 minutes and I have exhausted everything i could think of because while I don't want to ask too many questions, I also get extreme anxiety whenever I'm no longer making progress because everyone on the team is super productive.

How do you determine if your question is worth asking or if you should sacrifice some productivity and try longer to figure it out on your own?

Thank you for any advice!"

A i7 2600k but i have recently found out that the PCs cooler cant handle over 65 watt CPU’s. (The 2600k is 95) Basically i have 2 options. Find some way to modify the case to accept the cpu stock cooler or something. Or find a small enough cooler that can handle the cpu and maybe just modify the top cover for better air flow. Any suggestions as im new to this stuff even as an IT intern.

My plan from the beginning was to work a year or so in a help desk role, gain experience/certs and level up, as is common. I'm quickly realizing that being such a small MSP (less than 3 FT employees and interns), I'm able to get exposed to a lot more systems/networking resposibilies than I might if I was in a corporate environment. That said, my boss and other higher level coworker are very bright and skilled, but very poor at teaching and tend to be micro managing. It also feels like organized chaos most days without a well organized knowledge base and duplicate alerts coming out of our eyeballs. I can't help but feel that a help desk team with multiple tiers and process cues would be a more beginner friendly environment.

When I accepted this job I turned down two, lesser paying entry level Helpdesk jobs for large corporate environments, in which I would have been one of many support techs. I'm starting to wonder if the corporate Helpdesk environment would have been more enjoyable starting out, or if this MSP opportunity will eventually pay off if I can mange to learn things without my boss not giving me enough training or leash to develop my skills.

So I'm wondering, is the grass really greener in a corporate help desk role that maybe has a lot of standardization, good team environment, but maybe not as much opportunity to have your hands on pretty much any and everything at a MSP?"
vt532u,3,2022-07-06,How bad is it to not have an internship in your sophomore summer as a rising Junior?,ScaredOfLife666,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vt532u/how_bad_is_it_to_not_have_an_internship_in_your/,"Long story short, I was rejected by everywhere I applied to so I'm now stuck on campus for the summer working as an IT help desk technician (also do it during the school year). To be fair, none of my classmates landed an internship either, but it feels like it's common for people here to land them in first or second year.

How bad is this? I've been trying to get started on this side project to help compensate for not interning but I guess I'm just growing anxious since I don't want to get rejected in my third year either. My school is a small public school but it also makes it mandatory to have an internship so yeah...

Any thoughts or advice?"
vt78a2,0,2022-07-06,Please give me a reality check,KeySherbet5423,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/vt78a2/please_give_me_a_reality_check/,"I feel like I'm too stuck on the idea of getting into a t20, and compare myself too much to other people on here and A2C. This is my first post; I would really love an honest opinion about whether my stats are competitive enough, and more recommendations on what I can do for target schools that are out of the midwest. 

**Demographics:** Female, white, semi-large public school in midwest with ok academics. Higher income bracket. 

**Intended major(s):** Stuck between STEM and humanities. Prefer stem but plan on going to law school so humanities seems to be a better choice. Will probably end up in political science. 

**Testing:** SAT 1550: 790 R, 760 M (not superscore), didn't take ACT. 

**GPA/Rank:** 4.0 UW/4.33 W. 1/\~400

**Coursework:** 

12 to 13 APs

* 10th: APUSH (5) 
* 11th: Chem (4) Gov (5) Calc AB (5) Lang (5) Macro/Micro (didn't take test) 
* 12th: (pending) Physics C, Lit, Psych, Calc BC, World, possibly APES

**Awards:** 

AP Scholar with distinction (2022)

2 National Science Olympiad medals (4th 2019, 5th 2022), 7+ Science O State medals, 15+ regional, 15+ invitational (from 2017-present). 

Orchestra individual honors: highest ratings for regional (duet and group) in 2020, 2021, 2022. Highest rating at state in 2022. Honors orchestra participant in 2019 and 2022 (not held in 2020/2021 due to COVID). School orchestra will be participating in a state honors program this year. 

**Hooks:** Not really sure. Only had one parent attend college but graduated this year. High commitment in a variety of STEM/humanities ECs. Heavily involved in music performance.

**Extracurriculars:**

1. Science Olympiad: competitor every year since 2017. Usually 4-5 events and high-medaling. Hopefully will be co-captain this year (seniors only). My school's program is considered a ""legacy"" or basically top 5 in SO history but isn't as good as it used to be. I spend so much of my time on science o, I would say 10-12 hours per week from November-May when you consider practices and outside study time and tournaments. Sometimes even during school. I have made cheat sheets during ap gov. 
2. Mock Trial: 2021, 2022, 2023. Will be co-captain this year. Competed regionals and states in 2021, regionals in 2022 (didn't make it to states). Usually 3-4 hours/wk from November-April. Was a witness in 2021 but lawyer in 2022. Important because I want to be a lawyer, but it isn't as involved or as prestigious as the science o program.
3. Model UN: 2022, 2023. Usually kind of dip out during SO/Mock trial season because I can't make room in my schedule, but have held a few important club leadership titles during the fall season. Am co-running a home invitational this year, and participated in it last year. I would say 2-3 hours/wk from June to November. 
4. Work: 2022, 2023. I work at a restaurant as an expediter. It is less impressive because it's not really an internship or related to something I want to do in the future, but I spend a lot of time there. September-May 10 hours/wk, June-August near 20-22 hours/wk. Hopefully will get a promotion soon.
5. Fiddle group: 2020-2023. Pretty unique, play Celtic music by memorization. Section leader since 2022, play solo during most of our 20+ songs. We do many local gigs, perform on radio shows, etc. I would say 3 hours/wk, it's only during the school year. 
6. NHS: 2022-2023. On its own is not special but I am a co-leader of my school's program so I help plan meetings, volunteer sessions/opportunities, etc. For my own volunteering I got around 55 hours last year, mainly boosted from music performance in my school's musical but I also tutored and did cleanups. Will likely have 50 or so this year as well.
7. Honors cello performance: honors orchestra in February every year, also do individual ratings/performance in my state. It takes up about 2 hours/wk between rehearsal and performance from November to February. I usually get high ratings. 
8. Piano/music arrangement: A bit more of a hobby, but took piano lessons 2019-2022. Taught myself a lot over COVID. I like to arrange songs on piano from listening to them, which is more like a party trick than an actual EC but I'm running out of activities to list. This has definitely declined over the years, from about 2 hrs/wk in 2019-2021 and now more like 1. Used to arrange original songs as a freshman but I just don't have time for it anymore. 
9. Babysitting: more of a job, but I frequently babysit my younger siblings. This is not a family duty in any way, more of a way for me to earn money as well as give my parents a break. Usually only during summer, about 2 hrs/wk. 
10. Not anything to put here, hopefully will find something (suggestions appreciated!!)

**LORs:** Should get good ones, my Lang teacher liked me a lot and is known for writing good LORs. I will ask my Chem teacher as well, which should be good because he knows how I tested out of chemistry in order to take AP and worked my butt off in order to still get the credit. 

**Essays:** Would rather not share on here but received high marks on them (college essays were required in my lang class). Am confident that they represent my personality well and aren't common or basic. 

**Schools:** I have 5+ safeties and a few targets but they will easily give away where I live so I am not going to list them here. UMich as non-restrictive EA. 

I'm considering to apply to Harvard or Yale REA but I have a lot of doubts on whether it's worth it. I would really like to go to an undergrad that I can also go to for law school, which is why I am drawn to those two. Some days I feel like I could get into an Ivy but other times I feel like a total idiot for even considering it. I desperately do not want to end up like the kids I see on these subs that think they can get into t20, shotgun with no safeties/targets, and then get massively disappointed when they get rejected from everything."
vt7clo,1,2022-07-06,"The new kid in the office is annoying, starting rumors about me, and won't take feedback seriously. How do I handle this?",JKP_TA,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/vt7clo/the_new_kid_in_the_office_is_annoying_starting/,"I’m an accountant for a mid-sized tech firm in DC. I work on a relatively small team, consisting of five accountants, two analysts, a consultant, and a manager. We’re mostly all late 20’s – mid 30’s Ivy-League graduates, are fairly introverted, yet get along wonderfully. No one has beef with anyone, and we keep politics to a minimum.

Last Monday, a new Analyst started. He’s a 22-year old male, fresh out of Wharton, with internship experience at Goldman Sachs and PwC. Despite the impressive resume, he’s not a great social fit on our team. He’s very, very openly homosexual (I’m gay myself, more on that later) and, frankly, a bit loud and obnoxious. He prances around doing the “OKURRRRR” thing, addresses everyone as ""his faggots,"" (e.g. shouting ""HEY FAGGOTS!"" when he sees a group of us in the cafeteria, turning every head in the room) and is constantly talking about his $150K G-wagon and how it's big enough to hook up in/etc.

He became close with the consultant on our team – let’s call her Emily. They’re the youngest two on our team and she seems to appreciate having someone closer to her age to socialize with. Emily presumably told Jace that I’m also gay, and now, I get the constant, obnoxious “Why are you staring at me?” comments from Jace, as well as the “Why are you obsessed with me?” BS every time I walk into the same room as him. It’s awkward, and super hostile feeling. I’m most certainly NOT into him and kind of wish he wasn’t there. Just today we were having a team lunch, and he asked me, in front of everyone, “Lol why are you so obsessed with me?” Everyone just laughed awkwardly, because that’s a weird question to ask, and I’m probably the most awkward person on our team and had no idea how to respond publicly.

This afternoon, I got a Slack message from another coworker – let’s call her Ashley. She asked me if I’d talked to Emily today, to which I told her we chatted briefly over lunch but not of anything substantial. She walked to my desk and told me that she was hearing things from Emily that Jace supposedly said about me.

Jace had supposedly told Emily and some women on another team in finance, that I have a “chode” and that he “probably wouldn’t do it again with me.” Or some stupid BS like that. Ashley asked me if this really happened, out of concern, to which I advised her that it did not and that I was frustrated about these rumors going around, putting me in a bad light. I have no idea who he told this to, or whether they believed him. I’m married, monogamous, and don’t love having this type of rhetoric spread around about me. It looks trashy, even if it’s untrue, and is wildly distracting. Every time I heard people giggle all afternoon today, I felt the need to listen in and make sure they weren’t talking about Jace and I.

I went back to my desk after this conversation with Ashley and began typing a Slack message to Jace. I wanted to respectfully bring up what he’s been telling people and just advise him that his kind of behavior isn’t always well received. I kept deleting what I was typing, and starting over, before he must have noticed that I was typing in the sidebar. He sent me a message, “can't decide what to say? lol why are you so obsessed with me?""

I literally left work angry. This child has derailed my comfort at work, is spitting my name around in rumors, and confronting me about being “obsessed” and “constantly staring at him” in front of other people. It’s BS and I don’t even want to bother confronting him because he’s not going to take me seriously.

How do I even deal with this? Do I bring it up with my manager and make myself look vulnerable and unable to resolve a conflict? (I’m trying to get into management, so this is important!) Would you brush it off and wait for him to get bored of these tactics? Or should I find a way to confront him directly in a manner that won’t result in him just sexualizing it and starting more rumors? Any tips for doing that?

Sorry if this is petty. I’m just wildly annoyed with this, and my introverted self doesn’t know how to navigate these situations."

vt9jps,3,2022-07-07,New Systems Engineer - Where do I start?,derk_klitz13,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/vt9jps/new_systems_engineer_where_do_i_start/,"Hello everyone, this is my first post here (and will certainly not be my last based on my perceived lack of knowledge). I am sure this topic has been talked to death, but wanted to get advise on my exact situation.

For some background, I have been in the IT field for about 6 years now, but it has been majoritively in part time and internship roles, with only the past 2 or so years being full time. I started as an intern at my high school doing basic things like troubleshooting projector issues, some basic PC hardware stuff, imaging computers etc. After that I interned for my University as a systems/network admin running fiber cable, doing basic switch port configurations, managing AP's (hanging them and making sure they would show up in Cisco AP manager), replacing drives on storage servers, and some other higher level things that helped expand my knowledge.

Cut to my full time work and it seemed as though I was learning even less. In my first full time position as an IT Technician, I was put under a trainer who had been doing IT for 6 months, and couldn't tell me where the C: was. On top of that the company was 30,000 users strong worldwide so we were basically just doing AD unlocks all day, or resetting people's passwords due to poor cybersecurity practices. The next job I went to gave me hope, as my title was Network Admin (which made me think I was going to do mainly networking related tasks) but no. It was 90% helpdesk. I was fixing printers, troubleshooting receipt printers, signature pads, etc. Granted I did get to do a few more advanced things (Some VMware server management, Windows server updates, firmware upgrades on various boxes, etc.) but the most network experience I got was taking a pre-written config for switches, load them on new switches, and changing the internal IP address and then throwing it back in the box.  


Cut to today, I have been hired at a company a few weeks ago as a Systems Engineer (with a focus on networking/ firewalls). We are an IT managed service company with multiple clients with different network configurations.

 I am 24 years old, and again have only just begun my full time career, and I feel like I am out of my league in this position. Guys here with some tenure are just talking circles around me, and throwing around acronyms that I have never heard left and right. And discussing protocols, services, etc that I feel as though they are speaking a different language. So I guess my question is in a few parts.

1. Is this typical for IT professionals getting into more advanced areas of the field
2. What can I do to better prepare myself for what is to come, and where should I start?

This is a position I actually am happy with my co-workers, hours, vacation, etc and I want to do whatever it is I can to succeed and learn. Not only for keeping the job, but because I truly love the feeling of solving an issue, and knowing what I am doing

TL:DR - I have had a lot of part time, and even some full time IT jobs that have gotten me a decent amount of knowledge, but the newest job has me second guessing my networking/ routing skills (and IT skills in general). Is there research I can do off hours? And if so, where should I start?"

I was lucky enough to get in even though I don't have much background in this area, but they gave me a model to create and everyone's generally too busy to answer my questions when I'm stuck, so I'm often lost for quite a long time (I do try my best to google or whatnot and learn what I don't know, but even then there are parts where things aren't clear) . 

Also, the team itself seems to be falling apart since a lot of the original lab ppl are away or most people are part of multiple projects and this project I'm involved in doesn't seem to be their priority. Is there anything I can do to make this experience more meaningful?"

vtbu93,2,2022-07-07,High Earner - Management Offer with only 3% Increase - THOUGHTS?,OverseerOfManyThingz,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/vtbu93/high_earner_management_offer_with_only_3_increase/,"Hey Folks, first some quick background before I lay out my question (s).  


\- PhD in Engineering field from top school, early 30's

\- Got job at a top-tier scientific research facility

\- Salary out of school at that job was about 127k 

\- Salary as of right now (3 years later) at same company is 155k 

\- Job offers no bonuses, stock options, etc. Just salary as outlined above.   Great benefits though: 6% 401K match + 3.5% 401K ""freebie"" contribution. Good vacation and sick time.  Good health insurance.

\- Job is low stress (40 hr/week), great people, fun projects, no drama (actually in the ""top 100 places to work in the US"" according to Glassdoor)

\- High cost of living area

\- Partner makes about 80k, so about 235k combined.

\- No kids, Zero debt, Max 401k, Max roth IRA, 8-9 months emergency savings, etc.  Basically super healthy financially and very solid financial habits.  We live great to be honest.

Now. Here comes the actual bulk of what I want to bounce some thoughts from some of you.  As you see, I have been at this company for 3 year post PhD, it is my only job outside of internships and such in undergrad.  I applied for a first level manager, got the interview and today got the offer!

The offer, sadly, is only for about 161k, which is much less of an increase than I was expecting. The obvious increase in responsibility being the line manager for engineers, scientists and technicians doesn't seem to be reflected in the offer. It honestly took me by surprise. I really was hoping for at least 10% (getting me in the 170k range).  

I plan on negotiating, which I am very comfortable doing, but I don't expect I am going to get much more than 165-167k. I suspect the low raise is due to a couple of things:  I have been getting killer raises last few years (see above) and maybe I make more than I should compared to peers with my education and experience? --- OR --- I have a feeling I will have to ""prove"" somewhat that I can handle the job and bigger raises will follow as I show that I can indeed be a solid manager even though I only have 3 years of experience. 

NOTE: I plan on taking the job. I want the experience and it only means that no matter what, I will only take on management jobs in the future going forward. Even if I stay here a few years and see how my pay grows (or stalls), I can always take the experience with me.  I am not asking ""should I take the job"" but rather trying to inform myself and bounce some perspectives as I approach the negotiation now and in the coming years.  

Now my questions:

1) for those of you who also went from highly paid professionals to first level management, was the initial pay increase significant? how much? (money / percent) --- OR --- did you see your pay increase more and more in the years following your promotion?  

2)  Any other thoughts on the situation?

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the longish read. Thank you for your time and thoughts!"
vtc1va,12,2022-07-07,SoC UROP,EthelMarieHarkness,nus,https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/vtc1va/soc_urop/,"Hi I'm an incoming y2 CS student interested in potentially pursuing research in the future. I haven't had any formal experience with research and was wondering if anyone could give some advice on how to get into the space. From what I understand from seniors, doing UROP is a good step forward and I plan to do that along with a more research based FYP if possible. I plan to do UROP in y3, and am thinking of researching more about which area of computer science I want to pursue in the coming AY. I also plan on reading up on NUS profs' work just so I have a better idea of research and who to reach out to do UROP with.

In terms of my industrial experience requirements, I planned to take up internships during y2 and y3 summer. Since I don't have research experience I was wondering how possible it is to get a more research adjacent internship as opposed to a more SWE one?

Also if I were to pursue being a research assistant in the coming AY, could anyone advice me on the steps to take to get such a role, and if they are available during the semester?

I'm very new cs as a whole and y1 of cs was my first year touching code/developing software so I'm still trying to figure out what I want to do in the future, but I feel that research might be something that I want to pursue. So if any seniors have experiences of being new to research in uni I'd love to hear about your experiences as well."

Did the right thing?,ahmedtm1,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/vtecpe/rejected_the_offer_twice_did_the_right_thing/,"Background: I have recently completed my degree. I have less than a year of experience working as a Devops Engineer. I have two associate level certs from Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure and also 1 expert level cert from Azure. Also, I'm not doing any job for the last 3 months. As, I was busy with my FYP project. 

So, I'm applying for jobs. And a few days back a company approached me and gave me an offer to work as DevOps Engineer intern and was willing to pay me nearly half of my previous salary. I rejected their offer as the pay was too low.

Then, they came up with another offer, this time they were offering me exactly the same amount that I was getting paid in my last job (which I did last year). I rejected this offer too. Because I thought it was still below average offer. They said, that we can't offer u more than that. After three months, we'll increase your salary and will offer you the permanent position. They said, before increasing the salary, we want to test your skills for 3 months.

I have already cleared their 2 assessments and still they are not sure about my skills? 

So, I simply said, I can't join you. 

Have I done the right thing?"

The thing is that I doubt about specializing in Marketing Automation since the general understanding I have from the industry and what my co-workers have told me is that there is little offer and a big demand for related jobs out in the market, but I am afraid I might be specializing too soon (this is my first proper job). and going too niche.

One thing is clear is that I wanna pursue a nomadic, remote friendly position in the future (my curent company offers me this) and have read that positions related to this field can be remote friendly and still pay well.

I don´t know if anyone has been in this type of situation before or got to the dilemma of whether to specialize right know or try other stuff. I personally like working with computers and find marketing automations technology quite interesting."
vti0qc,301,2022-07-07,i fear for both of our futures.,ohmylordplskillme,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/vti0qc/i_fear_for_both_of_our_futures/,"hi, my boyfriend and I have been dating for some time now. we're both currently 20 years old.

I am currently studying for my diploma while my boyfriend is working. he was actually supposed to be in ITE (won't say which one), doing his internship but because he wasn't interested in doing that anymore so he just deferred from ITE in general and focus on his ""business"".

recently, my boyfriend has been diagnosed mentally unwell so he is unable to serve for NS even in PES F, he's fully exempted which makes me feel bad for him at some point.

now; his business is something I am most concerned about. my boyfriend is currently doing MLM in a company (i won't say which one due to confidentiality).

i never really liked the idea of MLM. the technique is so sketchy and ridiculous because pressuring someone to pay a large sum of money for a crappy product you can get for cheaper on Shopee. the type of pay also is quite ridiculous because it's based on commissions with no base pay and no CPF contribution whatsoever. the whole thing is just sad to me.

anyways, he told me about his ""business"" shortly after we got to know each other. i told him that i didn't mind it as long as he didn't involve me in his business. to me; just because you do MLM, doesn't mean you're a bad person, right..? hahaha.........

however, 2 nights ago, it really got me thinking; is he going to continue MLM if we were to get married in the future? if he does, does he want our future family to live on commissions? our children?

i don't mind working full-time in the future for our family (if we even plan on having one) but it's kinda like I want him to get a proper job instead of relying on this MLM bullshit. I want us to be carrying equal of the weight.

yesterday, i asked him if he was going to continue MLM if we were to get married. he told me, it depends on when we get married and he said once he's done his business at the MLM company, he is going to invest on crypto and start a men's fashion company (uh)

i told him that if we were to get married, i want him to stop doing MLM. i asked him if MLM actually contributes to his CPF. this is where i started to get a headache, he proceeded to ask me what was CPF contribution. i was shocked to my core, how can he be 20 and not know what is CPF, considering the fact that most of us already learned it in secondary school, if not from our parents. I explained to him what it was for buying a HDB flat. (can't believe i was explaining it to him)

he said that houses can be bought using cash (he's saying as if like we have 1M in our bank accounts or something). bro... there is a huge reason why people use CPF for houses. cash is more reliant when it comes to utility bills, internet, etc. if we use cash for the house, where the hell are we going to get the money to pay the bills? he proceeded to jokingly ask if we can buy a house in nft. at this point, i was just too lazy to talk to him more about this topic.

what should I do? my boyfriend is a nice person, it's just that his mind is somewhere else and with his ideas, i am worried for our future. i know it's early for me to think about this at 20 when i haven't finish my diploma but i am afraid if this will happen in the years. i don't want us to live in poverty like how i am currently living right now, it's mentally exhausting.

how can I get him to wake up from his idea and realize he needs a proper job? or at least a better mindset? or do i just let him carry on with his plan and see how it goes? or do i just leave him for my own good?

please help."

vtk4jx,9,2022-07-07,"Should I go for VIT CSE (Vellore branch). Even though I am a neet aspirant i don't wish to become a doctor, I am just doing for the sake of my parents.",Leather-Mango5813,Indian_Academia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indian_Academia/comments/vtk4jx/should_i_go_for_vit_cse_vellore_branch_even/,"myquals: 94% in 10th and 93.8% (pcb with cs) in 12th(2020-21).

TL;DR: DON'T WANNA BECOME A DOCTOR, CAN TAKE CSE AT VIT AND MY COUSINS COULD GET ME INTERNSHIPS AND JOBS AT SOME GOOD COMPANIES IF I DON'T GET CAMPUS PLACEMENT.


So I am really interested in computer science but my parents gaslighted me into taking biology and become a doctor after 12th. I prepared for NEET last year but i couldn't give the exam cuz i got really sick and had to be admitted in a hospital for 3 weeks. I then took a drop year and joined a coaching but then i got sick again and my preparation is just going downhill I am only scoring 450-500 in mock tests. I decided to give VITEEE and I am positive i can get a good score. I don't wanna take another drop. My parents have accepted it. They are ready to take a education loan. Even if I don't get good campus placement it won't be a problem because one of my cousin is at a really senior position in a big IT company and another one of my cousin is a co-founder of a agro-tech startup and they have told me that as long as I keep a good GPA they'll get me internships and even a job at some good places.

EDIT: I should probably mention that VIT Vellore has a course called ""Btech in CSE with specialization in bioinformatics"" which is for students with PCB."
vtm2e6,1,2022-07-07,Help! I Need advice on whether to apply for a job or an internship,Educational_Way6565,GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/vtm2e6/help_i_need_advice_on_whether_to_apply_for_a_job/,"I'm a Mechatronics engineering student, currently doing my end of studies internship and will be finishing soon and will be ready to start for a job within a month with an Engineering degree.

The thing is that besides the engineering cycle, I did a Master cycle in Mechanics and Systems Engineering (2 years) in parallel and finished it but I have a Master thesis that needs to be validated in order to get my Master degree, I can do it later like I'm not in a hurry because finding a job is a priority for me.

I've been told that it is hard to find an entry level engineer jobs abroad and that I might find some equivalence problems in the degree because we have (in Tunisia same as France) a slight different educational system than in the rest of Europe or USA/Canada.

So I wanted an advice when applying, should I apply directly for a job and keep my fingers crossed to get lucky, or should I apply for my Master thesis in companies (internship between 4 and 6 months) that way the company would have the chance to see my work and skills and that way I have a higher chance to get a job offer with the same company maybe.

What do you guys think, and especially from a recruiter perspective, would you hire an intern, get a chance to see his/her skills while paying him less obviously because it's an internship not a job xD and if he's/she's skilled enough you'll offer him a job or would you prefer someone who finished all his/her studies to recruit him/her directly after a good interview?

Thank you in advance and I really appreciate any helpful answer."

I'm perfectly on track with my major classes but it's the extra stuff I'm behind on. My professor said I could literally take anything I want to fulfill the 12 credits so I was just thinking about finding the easiest classes possible to take. They will also be online so I can take them wherever I want to.

Is this reasonable?

vtodme,1,2022-07-07,Should I explain in my resume why it took 13 years for me to graduate?,Broad-Paper,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/vtodme/should_i_explain_in_my_resume_why_it_took_13/,"Hi, I am a CS graduate, but it took me 13 years to graduate. I am 32 now. I graduated in 2021 september, started applying to jobs in 2022 january and stopped in may. Got many interviews but no offer. I graduated from a top university in my country. I interviewed with Fortune 500 companies and big startups, I couldn't get a single interview from smaller companies. The reason I didn't get an offer was probably the salary I wanted, since I knew the salary people graduated with me got offered, I asked for the same, and it was above average. But probably that made me seem more risky? I have zero work experience, only a Machine learning internship I did at school with a professor. I am applying to software engineering positions mostly.

But now I can't get any interviews. Probably the reason is almost a year passed after I graduated? How can I explain in my resume that I am not a criminal :P I actually graduated with a good GPA and I completed my 2-3-4 th years starting from 2018 to 2021, so I am like a fresh graduate. Should I write that in my resume? Should I write that I can work at minimum wage until the end of the year or that would make me seem desperate?

When I am asked in the interviews, I tell them I took a break to experiment different things and when they ask how I earn money I tell them I live with my family and was earning some money from stock market. But taking a break after studying just a year is already strange. They really ask too many questions, even the questions about my family etc. By the way the high school I graduated is also a special one, you need to be in first 100 among 2 million students to get into in the entrance exams so that also helps somehow I guess, they also asks questions about it, like it is so strange going from that successful to being able to barely graduate I guess.

By the way, it may seem strange to you but I live in a rich neighbourhood and everyone would know it if I write that, I don't write it normally since that would make me look someone rich, doesn't need money but maybe I should include it to give more trust? Because I feel like I am considered as a criminal. Should I give that rich vibe? I also have a motorcycle licence that lets you to drive big over 500cc motors, should I write that? I know those has nothing to do with job applications but I am trying to look confident rather than desperate? \[ I am not rich btw just somehow my family has a house there and I am actually living with them, yes the house is expensive but we won't be selling it so we are just poor like that with an average salary :P When people see I drive expensive motors, live in that neighborhood and graduate in 13 years they automatically think I am from a rich family or I am rich haha\]

Also, should I tell them I got many interviews with big companies but not an offer? Like is it positive or negative? I need to show that companies want me but then they will question why I didn't start working yet since it has been 9 months since I graduated? I am confused

Somehow I need to get their attention in the very beginning so I feel like I need to write some explanation in my resume.

Any help or idea would be great since I can't get interviews already, thanks.

I can also add my resume in the post if it may help.

I am also wondering what would hiring professionals think when they see my resume, if there are anyone here please be honest if you answer so that I can get how I am being considered in their eyes.

\[Note: I need to include my university entrance date since most of the companies use a site to recruit and it requires you to include it, I already don't include it if I have a chance to apply with a pdf ( I feel uncomfortable if I don't write it though) . But then my lack of experience put me in trouble. Half of the interviews I got was from the companies that doesn't know my age already\]

Sorry for the long text :)

Edit: Here is my resume:

I had some good luck in switching to web development few years ago and a close friend of mine is switching right now to IT (from sales). 
Everyone is recommending him to start with javascript cause it's fairly easy to do stuff, but i see everywhere jobs in java, a bright future (kotlin for phones, java 8 for legacy banks, etc). While javascript is way more uncertain imho, and learning 6000 frameworks can be boring if you don't enjoy it like me. Also i had some horrible habits for years.

Given that he made good bank and will spend maybe an year off to chill and study (was even considering university), what kind of coding positions would you recommend for a beginner? There's tons of academys and internships in my zone (capital in europe), especially in java and js.

Excluding the classic ""do what you like"", i'm more interested in general sentiment since i live in a bit old country tech wise (react has just started being a thing, thanks god for remote), but the trends from example US always come in strong after few years."

Building a complete product is hard, and while I learned a lot about engineering, designing and realizing a software product, I could not finish anything, yet. Right now, I'm working on a project that I started recently, but I do not have anything to show.

There is another thing though; while I want a job, I also want energy and time to work on my personal projects. I want my own business in the long term.

Also, after the 4 years I had in university, I want a healthy life without loneliness. I need advice on what can I do now. I do not know how to find an opportunity and proceed with my long-term goals."

* *Domestic Applicant, U.S. Citizen, straight out of undergrad, UMass*
* **GPA + studies**: 3.982. Chemistry and Mathematics dual degree with a certificate in an integrated science program that builds teamwork/communications skills.
* **Awards:** ACS analytical chem award, 4.5k summer research funding scholarship
* **Summer Research Experience for Undergraduates (REUs):** none
* **Publications:** none, in talks of one from my internship and a review from medchem lab, but won't be anywhere near published by application deadlines.
* **Research Experience:** joined a nanochem/photocatalysis lab freshman spring, got sent home cause of covid and wasn't allowed access into labs until junior fall. Over covid I just attended group meetings over zoom and read papers. Did semester of nanoparticle synthesis in fall and then joined medchem lab and did a semester doing small molecule synthesis for an SAR study. A lot of UV-Vis, SEM, H/F/C-NMR, chromatographies. I did about 12 hours a week in research last spring and will be doing 20 hrs in the next year in the same med chem lab.
* **Posters:** none.
* **Courses**: gen chem 1&amp;2 with labs, organic chem 1&amp;2 with labs, inorganic chem w lab, pchem 1&amp;2 with one semester lab, biochem, quantitative analysis, calc series, linear algebra, adv. linear algebra, intro proofs class, differential equations, mathematical stats 1&amp;2, linear regression. In the fall I'm taking adv. inorganic, adv. organic, organic spectroscopy, nonlinear dynamics, data science in R. I've also been doing research for credits and some additional classes like marching band and gen-eds.
* **Some other relevant classes/experiences:** I'm taking three graduate level chem classes in the fall and will be working on an honors thesis, spending 20 hrs a week in the lab all senior year. I don't know the exact project yet, but I'll be doing a lot of organic synthesis. I'm also at an internship right now doing coordination and organometallic synthesis as well as process engineering. I also have been a TA for the non-majors organic chemistry lab for two semesters and will have TA'd for four semesters by graduation. I think my math major might help me stand out since I've taken multiple classes in statistics, applied math, and computer science. 
* **Rec letters:** I haven't formally requested rec letters, but 1 from my current medchem PI. 1 from my boss at my internship, who as a chem phd with a lot of industrial experience, and 1 from the principal scientist at my job. He's a synthetic chemist by training and has done a lot of work in academia and industry. I think the letters of the last two will be good but i'm not sure about the first one. I spend a lot of time and effort in research lab though so it should be good. I also was considering asking my old PI but I don't think he would be able to right to my abilities as well.

&amp;#x200B;

what I want to do: anything that fits under organic synthesis loosely. I'm interested in methodology, total synthesis, organometallics, etc. I'm heading more towards methodology and or incorporating some sort of metal catalysis. I had a bad experience with inorganic coursework but have had a really good time at this internship and now see myself incorporating it into my graduate schooling. 

So far, I really like these schools in no particular order:  UC Irvine, UC Berkeley, UC Davis, UC San Diego, UMich, Princeton, UChicago, Harvard, Cornell, Northwestern, Emory.

I've been working through the US news list as a starting point for the past week or two. I know that the schools I have listed are probably too selective for what I have to offer, and I'm concerned that the application pool might've had more access to research than what was available from covid. Does anybody have idea for other schools I should look at and if this list is slightly reasonable?

The reason for this is that since the codebase will be changing rapidly and it would be tough for them on time and resources side to onboard me again.

They are ready to provide me leaves for exam times but they have asked for certain hours a week. Since I have this only job offer for now, I accepted it but don’t know messed up I’ll be if I have to manage this with my college schedule.

Is it fine if you don’t make up for much of the time because of tiredness from college and their assignments. Is there a chance that they might fire me?"

I am 15 years old high school student passionate about cyber security, more specifically about penetration testing.  I am actively learning programming and at the same time I love certification exams, because of that I learn with training materials and try to pass practical cyber security exams. 2 years ago I passed eLearnSecurity's Junior Penetration Tester exam, and  6 months ago eLearnSecurity's Professional Penetration Tester exam. Currently, as an intern, I help tech companies with penetration testing projects. In the future, I want to test my skills with bug bounty programs. I am not doing all these for university applications but I just started thinking if these extracurricular activities are good and can help me to get accepted into different universities as a computer science student. I have heard from some people that these extracurricular activities won't help a lot because most of the time CS programs at universities teach you more programming/development stuff. Can you share with me your thoughts about it?

Thank you."

We share an office and she’s a really cool person.

However, she hasn’t been helping out much. She spends most of the day texting her boyfriend or looking at Instagram. For the tasks we’ve been given so far, I’ve done 90% of the work myself, and when it comes time to present, I’ve been explaining the material to her and coaching her on what to say.

She’s a fast learner and picks stuff up fast so our weekly updates have been going well. Thing is, I’m starting to feel a little petty in the sense that it feels like she’s claiming credit when in reality I’m doing almost all the work. We’re programmers so it’s not really very obvious just from looking at the presentations who wrote what.

I’ve been telling myself not to get worked up and to just focus on learning what I can and doing as much as possible since I’m really passionate about the field. As an intern, it’s not about claiming credit anyway right?

I am currently interning at one of the Big 4 and thinking about trying something new before graduation. 

Is the transition from consulting into finance common at all? 
Does the Big 4 open opportunities to say companies as big as Goldman and JP Morgan?
What are the salary differences and pros and cons of one vs the other?"
vtzw0b,598,2022-07-07,The Data Science Trap: A Rebuttal,analyzeTimes,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/vtzw0b/the_data_science_trap_a_rebuttal/,"More often than not, I see comments on this thread suggesting the dilution of the Data Science discipline into a glorified Data Analyst position. Maybe my 10 years in the Data Science field leads me to possessing a level of naivety, but I’ve concluded that Data Science in its academic interpretation is far from its practicality in application. 

Take for example the rise of VC funding of startups and compare the ROI/success rate of AI-specific startups versus non-AI centric companies. Most AI startups in the past 5 years have failed. Why is this? Overwhelmingly, there is over promise of results with underperformance in value. That simply cannot be blamed on faulty hiring managers. 

Now shift to large market cap institutions. AI and Machine Learning provide value added in specific situations, but not with the prevalence that would support the volume of Data Science positions advertising classic AI/ML…the infrastructure simply doesn’t exist. Instead, entry level Data Scientists enter the workforce expecting relatively clean datasets/sources with proper governance and pedigree when reality slaps them in the face after finding out Fred down the hall has 5 terabytes in a set of disparate hard drives under his desk. (Obviously this is hyperbole but I wouldn’t put it past some users here saying ‘oh shit how do you know Fred?!’) 

These early career individuals who become underwhelmed with industry are not to blame either. Academic institutions have raced ass first toward the cash cow of offering Data Scientist majors and certificates. Such courses are often taught by many professors whose last time in a for-profit firm was during the days where COBAL was a preferred language of choice.  Sure most can reach the topics of AI/ML but can they teach its application in an industry ill-prepared for it?

This leads me to my final word of advice for whomever is seeking it. Regardless of your title (Data Scientist, Data Analyst, ML Engineer, etc), find value in providing value. If you spend 5 months converting a 97.8% accurate model into 99.99% accuracy and net $10K in savings but the intern down the hall netted $10M in savings by simply running a simple regression model after digging into Fred’s desk, who provided more value added?

Those who provide value will be paid the magnitude their contribution necessitates. 

Anyways, be great. 

TL;DR:  Too long don’t read."
vu14b7,1,2022-07-07,"I'm heading into my first year of software engineering at college, what can I do now?",FatTony4,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/vu14b7/im_heading_into_my_first_year_of_software/,"As my first year in college slowly creeps up I want to begin doing something that can give me a head start. I've done research on where I want to end up after I graduate and how I can get there. All of this research had told me I need to be getting internships if I want to make it into any large and ""desirable"" tech company. I want to get into an internship the summer after my freshman year to give myself the best opportunities I can but I have no idea how to prepare and make myself the best candidate for these companies a year from now. As of right now I do have coding experience but it is all self taught and all very basic information. As this summer goes on I see internships for next summer starting to open up but I have no idea where to start. I apologize for having such a broad question but I have no idea what I can do now to prepare myself best."

* A program I made that uses my school's Naviance data to predict my chance of admission at various colleges (yes, I know, very meta)

**Recs:**

* **Intro to CS and APCS Teacher** (9/10) – We have a very positive relationship as I've had him for two years, and he's been involved in multiple extracurriculars activities I'm a part of. The reason I don't say ""10/10"" is because I spaced out on asking for a rec letter until pretty late in the game, and I am a bit worried it may slightly dampen his respect for me.
* **Part in Government teacher** (8/10) – Was only in their class for one semester, but knew them really well during that time, I participated in their class very frequently and we often continued class discussions after class and in office hours. Spoke very highly of me at parent-teacher conferences. Only concern is that I only had their class for one semester.

**College List:**

* Categorization comes from Naviance &amp; my counselor. Some of this seems bizarrely optimistic (see UIUC, Georgia Tech, BU).

   * SUNY Binghamton

One thing will kinda lead to another and I'll stop using a language/concept after doing a begining/intermediate project with it and I'll start on something pretty different. For example:

I started doing stuff with pandas and web scraping in python, then I made a ML model for it, then wanted to graph it so I started leaning r, then wanted to make it in to a web application from scratch so I started css/html/JavaScript. They all seem like pretty unrelated things and idk if I'm wasting my time. 

While I do find coding fun and am trying to do fun things with it that interest me, the main reason I code is so I can get a high paying job. Am I shooting myself in the foot jumping around like this or is that attractive to employers? Should I pick one thing to focus on? I was really hoping to get an cs internship next year and want to do what will help me get there. Thanks for any replies"

Coder Academy has a 1 month internship at the end that's given.

  Please bear with me with this post if it has extra fluff. 

When I was 26 years old I joined the US Army because I foresaw the huge amount of loans I was going to take out. I was going to college to be a Speech Therapist. At the time, I was living in a garage with my mom due to the fact we were poor as shit. Living in California will make you sell your soul for the GI Bil. I joined strictly for the GI Bill. Fast forward, I left the Army at the age of 30 back in Feb 2022, and I’m going back to start school. In addition to this, I applied to a couple of Registered Nursing schools back in November because I had all the prerequisites done, so I figured I should try. Last week I heard back from the last school I was waiting on, and I got accepted. I saw it as a good option, since I am married, and my wife is 5 months pregnant. I’m stuck in a bind. I guess it might be a good bind to be stuck in. 

  I know nothing about CS, or about being a developer.  But I want to major in CS. I did college before I joined, and I know I will be a better student. However, I have read some reddit posts about the field. I been reading about how hard it is to get a job as a new grad. How hard it is to get internships, and how you have to work outside of the realm of academia. On top of being a Husband, Father, and the trials of life that pop up.I guess my question is how hard is it to get internships, or a job after graduating? Are the new grad jobs field really the dark pit of despair I see on Reddit post? Will I ever find a job? It feels like some people on Reddit never find jobs.

I am going into my senior year at a T15 uni and recently got very interested in QT. I study CS and econ with a math minor. I am looking to maximize my chances of landing a full time role. I am under the impression there are two ways to do this: 

1) Land an internship, do well, receive an offer. 

2) Recruit for a full time junior role

Since, recruiting season starts soon (I plan on applying early August), what is my best bet? Should I apply for internships (use Grad School as a way to do this), or should I apply for full time junior trading roles? I also believe that for some firms I may be able to apply for both? 

Another important concern of mine would be the level of rigor when applying for the full time grad role vs. an internship. Are they a similar level of difficulty? Also, aside from prob/stat (including EV), combinatorics, mental math, brain teasers, and market making is there more traditional math on these interviews? Given I have say 6 weeks until interviews, should I spend time going through linear algebra and multivariable calculus review? I noticed these in the green book, for example, but I am not sure if this is more applicable to QR vs QT or full time vs intern.

I have a 3 hour onsite assignment, which is in a compiled language (Doing it with Java), and from what I understand I'm supposed to design a system and implement it using the basics of what I've learned in my studies.  


I've been brushing up on my Java and designing different classes/functions which are pretty simple at the moment (getters/setters/some general functions). Has anyone interviewed for a CS SAP Internship and can give me some insight on the features they may ask to implement? If not, if given the information I have, what would be the best way to prepare for the interview?"

So I worked really hard to build decent network and many of them actually got in FAANG. My question is, 
1.what’s the chance of getting interviews if you get referral? Is it kinda guaranteed? 
2. Will my first internship at Samsung help a lot to land a second interview? I know it’s a pretty huge company, but it’s not US branch. Does location matter?
3. I heard coding interview  is LC easy-medium difficulty. Is that true?
4. When do people start applying for summer 2023 interns?

I'm really interested in lower level programming, or doing some type of backend stuff. Most of my experience is with C++.

Despite this, I have put 0 effort into anything academic/professional so far. I should have signed up for an internship this summer, but it's too late for that now. The only real life experience I have is doing small freelance jobs. All within the 50-200 euro range. They're all really small projects that I can't really show off.

My grades are middling, I'm in the Netherlands, so 5.5 is a pass, with 10 being the maximum. My GPA is probably about 7.0-8.0. My portfolio is OK, I have some personal projects that I believe demonstrate my knowledge, but nothing too amazing, mostly incomplete programs/libraries.

I want to end up at a decent company making 80k+ a year in the future, and I believe I do have the skills for it. But I doubt I'd be able to make it into any major companies immediately after graduating with what I can show.

What can I expect in terms of my first job? How good of a first job can I reasonably expect to get? And what can I do in the next year / after graduating to make myself more employable?"

As I understand, Co-ops are usually done during the school year instead of classes because doing both would be ridiculous, but if I were working remotely, would it be a smart idea/would it be possible?

vuetyh,9,2022-07-08,Shady corporate behavior?,dot37dot,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/vuetyh/shady_corporate_behavior/,"Currently working at a firm that has a local office. Everything’s been pretty great so far, but last couple weeks I’ve been pretty busy and putting in extra time. This has uncovered several concerns for me.

1.) I’m not allowed to work overtime, and if I do go overtime they ask that I move my hours to a different day so it’s not “overtime” but I get payed my normal hourly.

2.) Yesterday I had my new hire meeting with HR (150 day checkup). Everything’s been great, but today my boss called and said the office is doing away with working remotely. More then half of what I do is data entry/ management on excel, it’s not necessary for me to be in the office daily. 

My Boss is constantly talking about not wanting myself and the other intern to feel burned out, but she likes to call for work updates in the evening (which I’ve started to ignore past 6pm), She just took away working from home. She has a habit of passing off large amounts of work with exceedingly short deadlines, and now has taken away working remotely. 

This is half rant/ half looking for advice."
vuevs8,5,2022-07-08,Am I taking too long on my project? Am I behind?,SnooRecipes1809,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/vuevs8/am_i_taking_too_long_on_my_project_am_i_behind/,"I’m brand new to this stuff and decided to pledge my very first project to make retirement / investment calculators.

However I’ve wasted 2 weeks on this project where I’m either undoing what I did previously or accomplishing nothing because I’m stuck on a bug. 

It first started as a Java program basic user input with the command line, but my CS friends currently in the industry said I should transform it into a UI instead. The methods and math was done, all I needed to do was display it.

So I did Java GUI. GUI planning and designing is such a foreign world to me that today, I’ve officially wasted 2 hours not accomplishing a lot and spending so much of it confusion because there’s so much I’ve never even seen. The YouTube tutorials don’t help at all because they aren’t exactly tailored to how I want to present my project.

I’ve redone this project so many times that I’m now 2 weeks deep on project number 1 with barely much working / functional.

THE PROBLEM WITH THIS:

I want to start applying to internships in the Aug/Sept while I take Data Structures, but I feel like I’m expending a very odd amount of time to GUI a very simple calculator recruiters may not give a fuck about. I’m also occupied for 3 weeks in August, so realistically, all I have for project making is this month.

Is having only 1 project okay or do I need to somehow pull out a 2nd one? In that case idk if I can crank a second quality project

I’m very afraid of not being internship eligible so I’m wondering how behind I am."

I either got pushed out the company or quit because the job was so horrible. From most recent to far back my jobs go as follows:

Site associate at homeless shelter: got pushed out company/ laid off, coworkers didn’t like me, created grand scheme to get me laid off, some of the comments I said to coworker were over heard and taken as “disparaging remarks”, I was talking about how they don’t take showers even though they have access to it. 

Loan officer at big box lender: laid off for no producing enough 

Debt relief salesman: quit for loan officer gig

Insurance salesman: quit for debt relief gig

Grad school: MBA from non aacsb accredited school, such a waste

Airbnb hostel owner: ended because county regulation on overcrowding the house, neighbors were assholes and called county 

Client services something at small investment firm: one month in, the people in company felt like family, and I felt like an outsider, they let me go, I said some remark like I’ll be here for a year and my boss overheard

Bank transaction person: temp job ended 

Wells Fargo corporate temp job something: I hated admin so enrolled in grad school so I didn’t have to work 

Truck leasing agent: left for Wells Fargo 

Recruiter admin assistant: pushed out/left to move back home to diff city. I was disgruntled at the end I do admit, I was bored and all my friends quit and my manager was acting like a b.

Government banking internship: it was so boring so I didn’t go back the third year and I’m so bad at accounting it’s the only course I got a d in my entire life 

Now I want to pursue something completely different. I chose IT because it’s just helping people with computer issues so you don’t have to talk to anyone about anything but that and I can be off to the side doing my own thing as long as I’m fulfilling request 

What do you all think suggestions?"
vufgpq,1,2022-07-08,Robotics or CompSci MS,jst1428,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/vufgpq/robotics_or_compsci_ms/,"I am a MechE Major, Robotics Minor rising senior and am completely set on going to grad school. I also know that what I want to pursue is Robotics, and currently intern as a robotics software engineer. Until this internship, I have been set on getting my masters in robotics and have allocated most of my academic efforts to becoming a strong candidate for a robotics MS program.   


I have recently been thinking that it would be in my best interest to get a CS masters instead of a robotics MS. My reasoning is that since I know I want to have a career in controls, trajectory planning, or maybe just a pure robotics SW engineer, all these jobs are really just coding/CS from a day to day standpoint. My coding/CS skills have exponentially improved over the last few months since its all I really do, but I know I won't be able to write truly good code until I have learned the theoretical background and fill in the gaps in my knowledge.   


I've done a lot of research on what the curriculum is like in robotics MS programs, and it is kind of underwhelming. In my opinion, all it would do for me is teach me how to use random tools such as ROS and the Python CV library. While these are great, I think it is more important to understand that they are mere abstractions of the fundamentals of CS. I think in the long run it would make me a much quicker learner of these tools and really just a better Robotics engineer if I were to do the MS in CompSci.  


The problem is, I am no where near as competitive of a candidate for CS grad school as I am for robotics grad school. I have been coding and learning about CS for under a year, but have years of research and coursework in robotics.   


I'm wondering what people's thoughts are on this situation. Have I misunderstood things about the robotics field? Would it be foolish to apply to CS MS programs. I have heard there are CS masters programs that are specifically for students that did not do CS undergrad. Really, I'm just looking for input from people that know more than I know and what they would do in my situation.  


Thanks in advance!"

vufvi0,0,2022-07-08,"My doctoral program wants to limit how much I can work external jobs basically forcing me to work for the school. Can they tell me what to do with my free time? [Indiana, USA]",internlegalthrowaway,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/vufvi0/my_doctoral_program_wants_to_limit_how_much_i_can/,"Using a throwaway because some of this information is very identifiable and I don't want people linking me to my main account.

&amp;#x200B;

Background info: Our PhD program is a newer one and lacks an official handbook. It didn't have a work policy till this past year. It was understood that we would not be worked more than 20 hours a week by the school to ensure that we were not overworked while also trying to succeed as students. However, recently, there was a conflict with one student working so many hours at their internship that they were basically a full-time employee of the company. This resulted in a work policy being created and served to them with the end result of them leaving the program in favor of the job. No one was officially notified about this policy, except faculty, apparently. We have many students who have worked/are working more than the suggested hours with internships and assistantships with the university, but this was considered acceptable as their advisors approved of their work (and the students having lucrative internships made the program look good). For context, we have to work at least 10 hours a week for the university to keep our tuition waiver and health insurance; we are not allowed to take a full time job while in the program (as shown by the student who left for their job).

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, I have been looking for internships that would start in the fall. I started applying for one that a few of our students have worked, and I asked a few faculty members to be references for me. My advisor was, of course, one of them. We met to discuss the internship, and they mentioned that if I want to keep my tuition waiver and insurance, I would have to work ten hours a week for the school. The internship was a minimum of 15 hours a week. This put me over the 20 hour suggested work hours. My advisor said they were fine with it, but wanted to double check with the work policy. They sent me a copy of it (this was the first time I had ever seen a work policy). I told them that other students, including students at this specific internship, were working more than the allotted hours specified. I contacted a few students, confirmed their hours, and let my advisor know. The director of the program who wrote the policy confirmed that I was going to be in violation of the policy if I took the internship and continued to work for the school. The director did NOT mention this when they sent out the information for the internship or when they agreed to be a reference for my application.

&amp;#x200B;

However, the director is leaving so my advisor reached out to the faculty and the upcoming director to ask about revising this policy to be more relaxed for internships. They had a meeting last week to discuss the issue. Beforehand, I notified my classmates that this meeting was happening and a few of us sent emails to our respective advisors in protest to this policy. I was applying for other internships, and it was obvious that no one wanted an intern for only ten hours a week. It confirmed that there is no way to hold an internship and work for the school. If I wanted to afford my degree, I would have to work my full 20 hours for the school. However, it is important to my future career in the industry to get experience in the industry so I can land a job after graduation. Working for the school means either serving as a research assistant or a teaching assistant/instructor of record (this is fine for academic focused folks, but not for industry folks).

&amp;#x200B;

It's important to note that we have not been officially notified of this policy in the slightest. We were not told when the work policy was written up last year. We were not told about the faculty meeting to revisit the policy. And we were not told their decision. There is zero information on how this policy will be enforced or monitored. The only reason I know any of this is because my advisor kept me updated on the situation as it happened. My advisor told me more information was incoming, and I waited a week to post this. However, we still have received nothing, and I have some interviews next week so I'm getting a bit anxious about it. My program isn't the greatest about communication, and I have been met with hostility when asking for clarification on current situations and decisions.

&amp;#x200B;

Can my program legally control how many working hours I have outside of school? This is considering that the internship is a paid position; there is no course credit involved. If so, can they create a policy that didn't exist when I agreed to become a student and enforce it?"

Last month, I received my bachelor of science with a major in IT. So, after having been out of university for a month, I was able to find my first IT job position in my local town. This was all after being concerned that it was going to take a while after graduating as I had no internships, certificates, or any other IT positions at all. I will provide a summarized description of the job position in quote.   


""The Deployment Support Technician will communicate with distributors and field techs, proudce product/services information, and solve emerging problems with accuracy and efficiency. Technicians will solve software and network troubleshooting, hardware tasks, complete scheduled and unsceduled tasks. Technicians will oversee investigating issues encountered during procedures and working with leadership to improve processes.""  


Personally, I am not nervous about speaking to people on the phone or any other forms of communication. The main thing is that I feel I can improve a lot before I start my job next Monday.  Would you recommend any websites, certificates, or anything else that I should do so that training and doing the job won't be too overwhelming?   


Lastly, please do ask questions if anything is unclear or needs more explanation.  Also, please refrain from simply telling me that I suck or I am too ignorant without saying why. Please feel free to suggest any advice, offer helpful criticism or anything else pratical in mind. Thank you!"

I have had two accounting internships so far--the first focused on bookeeping, the second on auditing alongside analytics/automating workflows. This is my current position--with it I have quickly realized I enjoy using my brain to analyze things, be more creative, and work together with others on solving forward-thinking problems. Jobs with more creative discretion appeal more to me--auditing is not that.

Due to this I thought I should become a software engineer, data scientist, or gun for high finance jobs. I am fairly risk averse and hear horror stories from all sides of the spectrum which worries me since I don't have formal training in C/S or internships in finance and do not believe I would be a top pick at some of the more traditional entry-level positions. With my background in finance/accounting I was hoping there is a path that combines aspects of all these fields into one. I am particularly interested in the banking, real estate, and professional services industries. However--I feel like I am someone who can make himself interested in anything (to my detriment sometimes).

I thought it would be nice to sum up my college admissions journey in a letter format. I hope this gives an idea of what it's like after all the chaos, especially for next year's juniors and seniors.

\------------

Dear past self,

idk why I'm writing this, but you got a guaranteed transfer to Georgia Tech CS... I know this is what you wanted to hear all along, so I decided to drop it right away. You might not be that happy about it, considering all the other schools you applied to &amp; prayed for. But think about GT's amazing computer science &amp; cyber security program. At least I'm thrilled about it.

Ivies didn't work out, but we both know that we're not the ivy type of person 🤣🤣 Not specifically bc of the academics, but in terms of the environment and the overall vibe you know. We don't do well w high expectations &amp; pressure LOLL that was confirmed during the SAT &amp; AP exams 😫🤡

But great job. I can't believe that this happened. Especially bc my initial GT decision was a reject (I think).

The waitlists... They didn't work out. I know we've spent a lot of time praying for them, but life can be really unpredictable. I got the GT transfer email 20 minutes after I learned that one of my waitlists didn't work out. It was a miracle bc my heart was about to shatter. But eh, now that I think about it Georgia Tech is where I would've chosen anyway.

I know all the hard work and effort you and I put in for this journey. I graduated hs and am making a lot of money w the freelance translating job LOL the one that you couldn't start bc you weren't 18 yet 🤡💀 I also got accepted into a paid internship program for computer science. It's starting next Monday, and I'm excited for it. I started going to the gym but seems like it has no effect 😐🤣

Don't lose faith. Remember the phrase mom always told us since we were younger: ""Everything will be ok in the end. If it's not ok, it's not the end.""

Enjoy your senior year. Our school does a great job on keeping us distracted from the college decisions 🤣🤣 Have fun at the Senior Disney Trip. Make a lot of memories. Get your driver's license. Oh and please look good for the driver's license picture 😫 The one I have right now is not it🤦🏻‍♂️ Also the yearbook club yassified the senior portraits so don't mistakenly think that you're photogenic 🙄

ok I ran out of things to tell you. I know you hate spoilers, but since I didn't receive anything back then, you're probably fine LOLLL ok bye

\-Future You

\------------

Haha, if only this message was sent to me 4 months ago... I wouldn't have wasted so much time feeling like a failure. I would've spent more time being excited about my future instead of being worried about it. I would've been happier and enjoyed every bit of life. But here we are.

I'm sure I'm not the only one who went through this. A lot of you out there probably are regretting right now. I mean I did have fun during my senior year, but I wouldn't have felt so guilty while having fun if I knew everything was going to be ok in the end. In the end, it's just you and the memories.

Most of the decisions came out during the senior trip (except for the Ivies &amp; Duke). So when I think back to the senior trip, of course I remember all the exciting moments, but I also remember the sense of anxiety, shame, and rejection that I consistently felt throughout the trip.

I don't want any of the incoming seniors to feel that way. Just live the moment. I know it seems impossible to enjoy life when you feel unsure about your future, but it's worth a try.

If you read all this, you're amazing. Thanks for reading my long essay 🤣🤣"
vukb1k,0,2022-07-08,I got my first job in Data Science (Data Viz) and I’m incredibly nervous,ndjdjdjdjsjal,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/vukb1k/i_got_my_first_job_in_data_science_data_viz_and/,"
So I got my undergrad in Biz Management in ‘17. Subsequently I worked in Sports Analytics internships adjacent to Data/tech and fell in love with it. In 2020 I enrolled in a Masters in CS, with a focus in Data Science and will be done next summer.

Along the way I got my first FT job at an e-commerce company in BizManagement. I’ve been bored to death for 6 months. I make 50k which is paycheck to paycheck to where I live. In 9-5 workdays I probably got everything done daily by 11-12p. I was bored, it was below my skill set, but it was a foot in the door at this company and I needed to restart after all this niche sports experience. Along the way I’ve tried to build a portfolio, and I’ve used Tableau a lot. I’ve taken Data Viz classes and greatly enjoyed them. 

Anyways, long story short, a “Data Viz Specialist” job opens at my company. I interview twice, send some of my work (basic dashboards) and got the job. FINALLY, I’m in the DS world and I’m trying to be happy about my pay (75k). Sports jobs paid me $8-12 an hour and 50k sucked, I know it’s not a lot and people on Reddit have kind of given me a hard time, but I’m hoping it’s a good start salary wise. 

Now the issue is…do I deserve it. I start next week. But my new boss had me on some of our daily standup calls to just get my face out there. They’re all nice. But of course the environment is way different. These are all very smart and technical people. I’m brand new. I’m coming from a very different segment. I haven’t worked in sprints, I really haven’t  been all that involved in this company because my work beforehand was so entry level that I began to feel checked out. But it’s agile development talk, sprints, people asking about iterating on dashboards. 

Again, I think my passion is Data Viz, I think they hired me for a reason right? I didn’t make anything up in my interviews. I use stuff like StackOverFlow and Discord a lot for assistance, but I work hard and hope there’s high earning potential here. But I feel overmatched? New words I’m not used to - smoke testing, blockers, a little more nitty gritty language overall. But I’m nervous. I’m starting to doubt myself. I’ve signed up for some Udemy classes to brush up through my company and I asked my school to help me get into an Agile Software Dev class (it’s CS but it’s agile/team based so I figure that element is transferable). But I am pretty scared. I want to celebrate. I finally got a job in this field, I love Data viz, it’s also a career that’s more high earning and I’m finally on a bigger salary. But do I deserve it? I don’t know. Am I a fraud? What do they expect? I did see some side eyeishness from people who hear where I come from. And I fully get why. But career change is possible. I don’t know. I mostly needed to vent and feel sort of scared. I want to be a team player and do well, I’ve excelled everywhere I’ve been. But I want to be good at this new thing and build a strong future for myself doing work I feel like is more of my calling and make a good chunk of change along the way. I just hope they didn’t make a mistake and I’ll be out of a job in 6 months…"

vunz13,3,2022-07-08,My workplace is low key toxic and I want to quit,AntiqueCustard,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/vunz13/my_workplace_is_low_key_toxic_and_i_want_to_quit/,"I’m thinking about quitting my job with no new position lined up. It’s not a “bad” job but I hate it. There are so many subtle things that make working there unbearable. First of all it’s a relatively small (just over 100 employees) local company. I was working food service before this and one day a family friend who works here set me up an interview. I said ok because what can be worse than Food service. Like I had full blown mental breakdowns and customers would comfort me so this office job couldn’t be much worse, right? 

And I don’t think it’s “worse “ but the lack of communication and subtle toxicity makes it unbearable.So here are some things that have happened that I hate

-a coworker was graduating with her associates in computer   They were looking for interns so she asked if she can intern doing tech. They agreed. After weeks of poor communication, they told her she would intern doing finance (aka one of the supervisors work she didn’t want to do). After standing up for herself and then putting in her 2 weeks they said “your last day is tomorrow. Not in 2 weeks” and then blamed her for not communicating despite her having emails and attempted communications

-the family friend who is a supervisor got switched to salary so they don’t have to pay him overtime when he inevitably stays late. He literally just worked 2 or3 weeks without a day off before the Fourth of July. For no overtime. 

-a coworker who has worked there for over 20 years told me she only makes $19/hour. She invoices and posts payments so the company makes money. And she still makes so little after being here almost longer than I’ve been alive 

-my job is placing orders/customer service. One time me and my other customer service coworker (there were only the two of us) were on the phones with customers at the same time. Because of our position, we are supposed to be the only ones answering phones on the company. One of the higher ups called on her cell at that moment and because we were unable to take her call, we got berated by our supervisor. 

- the biggest reason is that my previous supervisor left due to lack of communication and toxic workplace. Of course she didn’t say that until after she left and we were texting. She is a phenomenal, always had our backs from the assholes higher up, and honestly kept the place running. Ever since she left, the company has been barely functioning. My new supervisor isn’t bad but he definitely has a two face and lap dog vibe about her. I don’t trust her.  

I definitely could go on about little things and I’ve only been here since December. Especially since like 5 people in the office quit at the same time.  I do not have a back up job and I am poor but I feel like I should put my two weeks in and relax while I look for a better place to sell my time to just to afford to live. Anyways, I just needed to rant and if you have any advice, that would be appreciated."

I have become disillusioned with my original career plan, and I have a year and a half of my degree left, but the rest of it will all be part time. I’d like to try to get my foot in the door through internships etc. sooner rather than later.

My philosophy studies focused mainly on analytic philosophy - philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, artificial intelligence, ethics, and so on. My computer science studies focus mainly on artificial intelligence, software engineering, and cybersecurity. I don’t think I really want to be a software engineer, and security roles seem difficult to enter - I’ll need to start earning money soon, I’m getting hungry!

I am very interested in how technology can be used to improve the human condition, as well as in politics. I also love investigating questions, mysteries, things like that.

My philosophy grades are all A+, whereas on subjects like computer science, math, and cognitive psychology (I took a class out of interest and philosophical relevance), I hover between C and B grades, unfortunately.

I would love to do something like computational neuroscience one day, but I’ll need further study, and for now, I need money.

Any advice would be wonderful. Thanks!"

I have been debating if I should quit my job before the fall semester starts so I don't end up in the same position. I know it sounds crazy to do both but I have many reasons for working full time and quitting my job is a HUGE financial risk for me, unfortunately. 

The reason I work full time is because I'm currently living on my own. I'm an older student (26) and only have about a year to a year and half left of school before I graduate with my bachelors. I don't have the option to live with my parents and I have no trust fund or any financial help. One of the biggest reasons I'm rushing to get my bachelors is because I've been stuck in stressful customer service retail jobs for the past 10 years. I have tried to get a job in my field (digital marketing) for years but everything requires bachelors degrees or 5+ years of experience. My only way at this point out of retail is to graduate. With paying for rent (split with my BF), bills, and a car on my own it would be giant risk to leave a full time job. Before anyone suggests, my BF unfortunately doesn't make a TON either and can't pay for my share of the rent as well but he helps when he can. 

The biggest reason I'm considering this now is because I was offered a marketing internship recently. This would give me job experience so I could land a good job after graduation but it is unpaid for 6 months. I told the person who offered me the internship my situation and she was pretty shocked that I was trying to add an internship on top of a full time job and school. I figured I would spend my only 2 days off at the internship and do all my school work during any free time I had. I realized that I couldn't even handle things without the internship so it might not be a good idea, mentally and physically. 

Right now I have the option to live off on my student loans while I do this internship and I'm wondering if it is worth it in the long run since this is an investment in myself for a better job in the future even if it means I may be struggling financially for awhile? The last semester I failed some classes and I was a straight A student in the past. I also would have to risk losing my insurance because now I have many health issues that were resulted from the stress last semester and I wouldn't be able to continue treatment for awhile unless I could get medicaid (I live in the US so no free healthcare :( ). If anyone has advice on this or if they can confirm that going to school and focusing on this internship will be worth it in the long run vs sacrificing my mental health for a toxic customer service job even if it means giving up financial stability? Sorry for the huge wall of text but I appreciate anyones advice! I've asked similar questions in the past but it took me landing in the hospital to really consider this."

vus97t,2,2022-07-08,First job in the field and I’m wildly insecure already,ndjdjdjdjsjal,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vus97t/first_job_in_the_field_and_im_wildly_insecure/,"

I got my first job in Data Science (Data Viz) and I’m incredibly nervous


So I got my undergrad in Biz Management in ‘17. Subsequently I worked in Sports Analytics internships adjacent to Data/tech and fell in love with it. In 2020 I enrolled in a Masters in CS, with a focus in Data Science and will be done next summer.

Along the way I got my first FT job at an e-commerce company in BizManagement. I’ve been bored to death for 6 months. I make 50k which is paycheck to paycheck to where I live. In 9-5 workdays I probably got everything done daily by 11-12p. I was bored, it was below my skill set, but it was a foot in the door at this company and I needed to restart after all this niche sports experience. Along the way I’ve tried to build a portfolio, and I’ve used Tableau a lot. I’ve taken Data Viz classes and greatly enjoyed them. 

Anyways, long story short, a “Data Viz Specialist” job opens at my company. I interview twice, send some of my work (basic dashboards) and got the job. FINALLY, I’m in the DS world and I’m trying to be happy about my pay (75k). Sports jobs paid me $8-12 an hour and 50k sucked, I know it’s not a lot and people on Reddit have kind of given me a hard time, but I’m hoping it’s a good start salary wise. 

Now the issue is…do I deserve it. I start next week. But my new boss had me on some of our daily standup calls to just get my face out there. They’re all nice. But of course the environment is way different. These are all very smart and technical people. I’m brand new. I’m coming from a very different segment. I haven’t worked in sprints, I really haven’t  been all that involved in this company because my work beforehand was so entry level that I began to feel checked out. But it’s agile development talk, sprints, people asking about iterating on dashboards. 

Again, I think my passion is Data Viz, I think they hired me for a reason right? I didn’t make anything up in my interviews. I use stuff like StackOverFlow and Discord a lot for assistance, but I work hard and hope there’s high earning potential here. But I feel overmatched? New words I’m not used to - smoke testing, blockers, a little more nitty gritty language overall. But I’m nervous. I’m starting to doubt myself. I’ve signed up for some Udemy classes to brush up through my company and I asked my school to help me get into an Agile Software Dev class (it’s CS but it’s agile/team based so I figure that element is transferable). But I am pretty scared. I want to celebrate. I finally got a job in this field, I love Data viz, it’s also a career that’s more high earning and I’m finally on a bigger salary. But do I deserve it? I don’t know. Am I a fraud? What do they expect? I did see some side eyeishness from people who hear where I come from. And I fully get why. But career change is possible. I don’t know. I mostly needed to vent and feel sort of scared. I want to be a team player and do well, I’ve excelled everywhere I’ve been. But I want to be good at this new thing and build a strong future for myself doing work I feel like is more of my calling and make a good chunk of change along the way. I just hope they didn’t make a mistake and I’ll be out of a job in 6 months…"
vusnj6,95,2022-07-08,A Message to the Class of 2023,Flaky_Law8880,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/vusnj6/a_message_to_the_class_of_2023/,"Believe me, I know how many of you guys feel as your applications season is coming up real soon. Since my sophomore year of high school, I had scoured YouTube and watched every single college decisions video. I watched countless stats and EC videos to compare myself to others and to deem whether or not I had a chance. I lurked on A2C and ChanceMe and I felt so inferior and stressed out, believing that nothing I did was enough  - in terms of grades, test scores, leadership, ECs, etc. Especially if you are on A2C, you see incredibly high achieving people with perfect stats or the seemingly ""perfect"" application.

And truthfully speaking, I didn't really have a ""spike."" Though I applied as a Public Health/Biochemistry major on the Pre-Med route, my top 3 extracurriculars in the CommonApp activities section were 1) Student Government 2) Receiving a CNA certification and 3) Involvement in my church. Nothing crazy. No research, no internships, no shadowing, no science competitions. I didn't have a perfect ACT or SAT score. In fact, I didn't even get a 1500+ on the SAT, which many people on A2C see as a baseline to even have a shot at T20s. I didn't meticulously plan and perfect my essays months in advance (now this wasn't too smart on my part and I do 100% suggest that you start early). I hadn't even started my CommonApp essay until a week before November 1st, the deadline for early action. I wrote all my supplementals a week or days before (once again, I don't recommend this). But what I did do was let my real voice shine through and I didn't try to fabricate someone that wasn't me.

My point is, though I wasn't close to being a ""perfect"" applicant with perfect test scores and a perfect resume, it still worked out in the end for me. My words of advice are to just try your best and to not worry too much. What is within your control now and what you can do is to try and present yourself as authentically as you can. Sell yourself to the admissions officers. Not just as a student, but how you are beyond that with your character and attitude.

I'm sure that anyone from the Class of 2022 can tell you that college decisions are VERY unpredictable. Different colleges have different types of students that they are looking for but the annoying thing is, it's hard for us to distinguish what the criteria is for each school. You may be what one school is looking for but on the other hand, you might not be for a different one. So even if you're unsure if you have a chance at a certain school, you never know, so take a shot. The day before Ivy Day, I got rejected from NYU and waitlisted from Barnard and Emory. I was really discouraged and had no hope for the following day as I only had one more decision left. But to my surprise, I got accepted into Cornell. Before opening this decision and even while I was applying to Cornell, I never realistically expected to get in. I told myself and everyone around me that I would get rejected, especially after getting rejections from other schools such as Hopkins, Northeastern, and WashU. But, I took the shot and luckily, the admissions officers from UIUC, UW-Madison, Purdue, UMich, USC, and Cornell saw my application and deemed I was a good fit for their school.

And like I said before, just try your best. Even if you aren't looking into going to a T20 or don't end up getting into a T20, the same message applies. It's okay to feel stressed out - in fact, a little bit of stress is good for motivation. But, I really mean it when I say that everything will work out for you the way it was meant to. I wish I told this to myself months ago as I was drowning in stress and anxiety. Remember to be kind to yourselves during this process.

Good luck to all of you guys in the Class of 2023 and a little side note, go Big Red :))"

Please delete if this is not the right Reddit community. English is not my 1st language, so apologies for any grammatical errors/spelling.

I came to US to do my undergraduate degree. I came to US as an undeclared major since I didn't know what my passion in life is. I never knew what I wanted to do with my life. I was always pretty ok at studies(high school and uni) so it was difficult to figure out a particular strength or weakness. I am also the kind of person who doesn't have a hobby or anything like that. Anyway, since I was in US as an international student, the uni fees were a lot for my family. So I graduated with a double major in CS &amp; Econ(since I read online that these majors gave me a good shot at getting a job) so that I can get a high paying job &amp; pay my parents for supporting my undergrad education.  I was lucky to get a job in the tech field upon graduating. I never really got a chance to do any internships in the Econ field. Tbh, the job is ok but my coworkers are really nice so I am happy at work. I don't know if I see myself working in that company long-term so I don't have any passion for the company and its products.

Throughout my uni days, I was staying with friends and after graduation I was staying with my gf ( now ex-gf). After my breakup, I have been living alone and these thoughts of what my future is constantly on my mind. Also as I am an international student, my work permit will expire next year after which I will have to figure out my future plans i.e. Masters/Jobs in home country/Immigrating to other countries. Anyway this approaching deadline is causing me anxiety as I have no idea what I want to do with my life. My parents are of the opinion that I should just do ANY Masters degree since everyone else my age is doing so. But I don't know if I should be doing that especially since I have no clue what I will be doing with that. I am just lost atm. Any help or advice on helping me feel less lost or finding a passion would be helpful. Thanks!"

In university, I was being teased by some guys for not being chio compared to the other chio girls. I grew up avoiding social interactions and thinking lowly and negatively about myself. 

From 2020 (when masks were mandated), I have not met any new people. I hang out around the same classmates/friends. They already know how I look like before 2020.

This year, I had an internship so I had to meet new people. I feel very anxious and uncomfortable about removing my mask in office. We eat/drink at our desks but we can see one another’s faces from where we are (open concept kind of layout). I feel very paiseh to remove my mask because I’m afraid that they think I’m uglier than expected (when we see someone with mask, we kind of picture or have an expectation of how they actually look like). And I agree that I look better with my mask on. 

How do I overcome the anxiety about removing my mask especially when meeting new people? Am I the only one feeling this way?"

Where did you intern?

What was it like?

Do internships delay graduation?

How many internships do PSU students typically take?"

I graduated from a top business undergrad program in Toronto. While all my peers were busy networking and getting internships, I was at home building my own online business in a niche market. I didn’t do anything in university but pass classes, and go home and work on my business. I didn’t make any friends, didn’t go to any events, didn’t go to any job fairs. During Covid I made lots of money, a crazy amount of money for my age. I saved lots of money also, I’m way ahead of peers in the savings department. Made over 7 figures sales revenue in 1 year. 

But now my business is dying because of the recession like economy. The niche I was in is dead. I have no network, no interview skills, no friends. , and no work experience. I am 23. 

I can probably start a new business using the money I saved, but I want a social life. I want to get a job with a big company and meet people, and build my network. 

Any tips? How do I compete against all my peers who have work experience and large networks. I specialized in marketing in undergrad, what type of jobs should I apply to? My business is in a weird niche, it would be hard to explain to the average person what exactly my business was, and what skills I gained. It’s tech related. But basically, I was so successful because of my marketing skills. It was a tech company, but I hired people to do the tech related things. My job was just managing the company, marketing, acquiring product, and dealing with customers.

I asked some senior collegues and they told me it happened to some people but not for everybody. Do you think I can ask for that ?
2. Concerning salary, can 6 months internship count for experience to ask for a better starting compensation ?
3. I did interviews with other BIG4 but not an official offer rn, But i really like the team and want to stay, Can I use this for my advantage for getting 1) and 2) or they gonna be like wtf is wrong with this guy lol (and I don't wanna loose the deloitte offer)

vv56x4,8,2022-07-09,Unemployed for 2 years after graduating with a cs degree. Should I lie on my resume about my career gap or just work with it somehow?,tway33027,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/vv56x4/unemployed_for_2_years_after_graduating_with_a_cs/,"For my background, I had graduated back in 2020 with a decent degree in Computer Science. I didn't get an opportunity to do any internships during my time in Uni so my resume is mostly just languages I'm proficient in, two big projects I did during Uni and the degree itself. After finishing Uni I subsequently fell into probably the biggest low of my life for a very long time. I'd managed a few interviews and did well a few times, but it wasn't enough it seems. I know that mental illness isn't exactly a good excuse for a 2 year long career gap and I know I should've done more with my time but what's done is done. I'm really unsure as to what to do now though. 

My main takeaway right now is re-doing my resume to make it easier to scan through, but I'm conflicted. Some of my friends have given me advice saying that I should lie and say I worked at some dead-end Technical support job for a year, in order to make the gap not nearly as glaring, while others say that's a bad idea. After looking up advice on reddit people seem to be divided on this topic as well.

I've tried a few times to get myself to do projects to pad out my github/resume, yet every time I burn out so quickly and feel like what's the point? a single project wont fix the massive gap after graduation. It's hard to find the motivation after so many close calls and all this time passing, yet I know I need to do SOMETHING because I can't keep applying and applying to no response.

I had someone who was interested in hiring me recently ask me to explain my 2 year gap and I just didn't know what to say, so the fact that the longer this goes on the harder it'll get terrifies me. Thank you for reading and I'll gladly welcome any advice you have and answer any questions :)"

I have never had any internships (I've applied to several), my GPA is at a solid at 3.5 (not that it matters much to some employers). Any advice for getting my first job that is pertinent to a bioinformatics career? All the jobs I see for bioinformatics require significant experience or at least some (being 1-4 years) of experience or require Ph.Ds. I tried to make professor contacts but I started and will now end my masters in the pandemic so in person oppurtunities to bug professors is still limited. I read another article that said it was good to look for keywords of 'Bioinformatics Analyst' positions to start out but I dont know if I'm even able to get jobs such as those without experience. At one of the local research hospitals I live close to they have computational biology positions but they only require a B.S. and pay very little (I'm talking in the upper 30's to lower 40's at best). As a M.S. in BCBM what can I do to make myself stand out without experience?

Not trying to advertise myself, just need helpful early career advice. Another thing, the program at my school is new so there are very few people who have actually specialized in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. the labs I ahve contacted either never got back to me or said they wanted absolutely no Masters students.

Edit: I’m in the U.S. sorry forgot mention also I’m graduating in the fall 2022 semester which is the month of December (probably like mid December)."

my freshman and sophomore years I wasn’t taking very hard classes just because I had a different career part at the time and I wanted to go into digital design and marketing, so I won’t include my classes for those years but I’ll mention I’ve always been one math class ahead of the majority of my grade.

———ESSAYS———
Writing is 100% my strong suite, and I’ve had a lot happen to me in my life that that I could 100% tie into my passions. For example, being from such a small area our police are horrible individuals and I’ve witnessed a lot of corrupt actions in my community. During covid I had time to reflect on this and it really sparked a passion that had already been there, but needed that push. I’d say they’ll be 8-9s. 

——LORS—— (Planned) 

APLIT Teacher- We’re super close and I’ve had her write multiple letters for me before for summer programs, QuestBridge, etc. I’ve also excelled in her close because I’m pretty good at Literature and writing, and she’s told me she thinks super highly of me. She knows me well enough that I think the letter would be a 9/10. She’s also the advisor of the newspaper I created. 

Gopo teacher- he loves me and also calls me patient all the time bc he struggles with my pronouns. Told me he wants me to do it again and has always praised me as being one of the best students in there. I’m also a strong lead for our teams in that class. 7/10 

Hopefully someone from this program I’m going to this summer, but that’s just a maybe. 

Counselor- This is just if I need another one. Knows me pretty well but absolutely hates me. 

Vice Principal- Currently working on my main project w her so hopefully by the time I need her to write it it’ll be a 8/10. Project will be described below! 
———————————
EXTRACURRICULARS/HOBBIES
-We The People Competition- super passionate about this one. Goes hand in hand with our GOPO class, and I’ve spent a ton of time and effort on it. Also combines a lot of my interests such as politics and writing. 

-Newspaper Team- Created a school newspaper, head of it. Put my own money forth to create a website in an effort to save paper. Hand picked the team after talking w teachers to see who the strongest writers, editors, etc were. 

-Cake Baking and Decorating- 
This one is 100% a hobby. I’ve done cakes for about 5 birthday parties at this point, and I started it to make some pocket money and help out my family as well. 

-Creative Writing- 
I’ve wrote like 50k words of creative writing at this point lol, it’s just something I do on my free time but it’s a huge interest. 

— College Readiness Program —
This one is still in the works and will start at the beginning of the next school yeah, hopefully. It will be a non-profit type thing with multiple sections that all focus on different things. We have a really low amount of students who go to college, and our state universities have super low graduation rates. This is the program I’m working on with my vice principal. It was my idea but I brought it to her so I’d have someone in administration to help get it through. It will hopefully set up college days, spread information, and have a section that focuses on ACT/SAT prep that will let our tutors get volunteer hours. I’m going to have to take it outside of school sadly but I rlly want to make it work. 

CERT- digital design/social media worked for our community emergency response team. 

Student Council, Hopefully President next year.

National Honor Society

WVGHA- Governors academy for top like 100 students in the state. My classes have an emphasis on politics and government with some literature on the side. 

I’m a QuestBridge prep scholar and won a scholarship for the Stanford Envision Law program. 

I want to add that we don’t have clubs and I’ve never been able to do sports or anything that required travel due to how low income we are, like we literally didn’t get a car until like two years ago. A Lot of my opportunities have been self created because of this. Sometimes this sub makes me feel like I have no chance, but I do think that my circumstances and opportunities will play a part in admissions.

2. Did a summer internship as a software developer at a medium-sized company.

3. Interned for free at a hospital: My father is a frontline worker and was at constant risk of exposure to covid which led to anxiety and fear but his positive outlook on life and confidence in himself and the people around him inspired me to help out the community in a meaningful way. During the first wave of covid, I worked with a highly qualified team at a hospital in my area to develop models and streamline logistics by applying concepts of data science and statistics, the results helped other local hospitals to deal with increasing demand too.

4. Worked as a peer mentor for the entirety of high school and am currently a peer tutor at my current university (employed directly by the university), tutoring Mathematics, Physics, and Computer Science.

10. I am currently working on research with my CompSci professor.

11. I also maintain a blog (I post on medium and my website) where I post regularly about different computer science topics. Sometimes I also talk about historical weirdness (one of my favorites was about proto-industrialization) and fitness. I also write for my college newsletter.

12. I have developed a small open-world game recently (using UE5) as a personal project. 

13. I have published a book (not self-published) on web development. Before that, I had also published a short free ebook (this was not published by a book publisher; I did all the promotional work myself like website designing, marketing, graphic design, etc.) on how to approach learning for students.

14. I have a few engineering projects which were funded by my current university (among them are a self-balancing bike, a 3-d printer, and a Rubik’s cube solver).

15. Founder of a non-profit organization that is nationally recognized. We raised around 5k in the first month and are still going strong. We have impacted thousands of people in 10+ countries.

**Awards/Honors**

1. Best Tutor Award (at my university, directly employed by my uni) 
2. Academic Excellence award in 10th and 12th grade 
3. International student scholarship 
4. AFCEA Scholarship for my engineering projects (not naming the scholarship for the sake of privacy) 
5. Dean’s List
6. Top 1% in several categories in HackerRank

**Essays**

I will be writing about my involvement in the NPO I started, my internships and some of my passion cs projects, and how I sort of went up against terrorists:

**(I am not in the military and neither am I an American citizen.)**

A while ago I was given the opportunity to join a team of highly qualified soldiers (of my nation’s army) to combat terrorism. I, of course, accepted the opportunity. I was trained physically for weeks for the mission that lasted a few days, days in an unforgiving environment, and maybe even enemies on our trail. We had limited supplies since all of us were on foot and after a point, it is detrimental for the team to carry more supplies (you need more men to carry more supplies and in turn, more food to feed the new men; of course, there go more intricacies into all the planning but I am ignorant to that or am I?).

We camped in the forest at night, well calling it camping is an exaggeration, it was more like sleeping with just a sheet under and nothing above in the middle of nowhere. We had so little to eat and drink, I was suffering from sleep deprivation for the last few days and the paranoia of literally being oof’d at any moment was so exhausting but the time I spent in the forest with people, that now I consider to be some of the most important figures and inspiration for me, was the best time of my life. Those few days changed my outlook on life so drastically that I can’t really put it into words.

Just FYI, maybe will give you a perspective:
* I’m from a big country that is allied with the US, so it shouldn't come off as me working for US’s enemy’s army or whatever if it matters for the universities. 
* I’m currently studying in the US at a small public university as an international student. So, I will be applying as a transfer student. 
* Also, if it matters to you, we didn't engage with the terrorists but did complete our objectives. We all returned safely.

**Background Information/Demographics:**

* Gender: Male
* Race/Ethnicity: Half Asian + White (Cambodian + German)
* Residence: WA (Renton school district)
* Income Bracket: Lower middle class
* School: Underfunded school (title 1) with around 300-350 students in my class (from what I remember). Our school offers 8 APs and 2 honors classes (English) and we're starting to lose AP classes over time in favor of dual enrollment classes.
* First-generation and live with widowed parent

Now for the fun stuff:

**Academics:**

* **High School GPA:** 3.99/4.0 unweighted (school doesn't do weighted but it's probably around 4.5ish)
* Rank (or percentile): Top 5% of graduating class. Skyward currently has a few students ranked #1 in the graduating class, so I'm not sure (last updated in freshman year)
* **ACT:** 34 (this was my first attempt, and plan on taking the ACT again)
* Courses: 6 APs and 7 dual-enrollment/college courses by the end of senior year. The two AP classes I didn't take at my school are AP World History and AP Biology due to scheduling conflicts in my sophomore and junior years.
   * Fresh: Honors English 9, Dual-enrolled in Algebra 1 and Geometry
   * Soph: AP Computer Science A, Honors English 10, Precalculus online course at BYU
   * Junior: AP Calculus BC, AP United States History, AP English Language and Composition, French 3 
   * Senior: AP Statistics, AP Psychology, CWU French (university French), Bellevue College Humanities (school got rid of AP Lit in favor of a dual-enrollment equivalent), Multivariable Calculus, Physics Mechanics, Physics E&amp;M, American Government

**Extracurriculars/Activities:**

1. **FRC Robotics Club (2019-current)**: Programmer for 2 years, Project Manager &amp; Safety Captain for 2 years. For community service, I worked for around 30 hours to spread STEM, Robotics, and our team to the community at various Outreach events including a community barbeque and KingCon NW. I put anywhere between 150-200 hours each year, so this is probably my main EC.
2. **Chemistry Club President (Spring 2022-current):** Planning on getting assistance from the American Chemical Society to help fund student projects/materials for the club and community events. I'm currently waiting on my Chemistry teacher to get certified and trained to act as an advisor. 
3. **Remote Science Summer Internship (summer 2022)** (haven't started yet, but I was accepted). I will be doing computational work in systems biology (want to get lab experience and my area has nothing related to Physics and Astrophysics).
4. **National Honor Society Leadership Position (2022)**
5. **Galaxy Classification and Machine Learning Passion Project (2022)**
6. **Eagle Crew (2021):** Basically a high school community service club that helps prepare new freshmen and sophomores as they transition into high school.
7. **College Possible (2021-current):** Not a huge extracurricular, but it's an after-school college prep program for low-income students.

In my senior year, I plan on also getting a Tutoring job for teaching high school students Math (Precalculus and Trig), Physics, and Chemistry. I'm also currently trying to get 100+ hours of community service and looking into my region's Regeneron Science Talent Search competition.

**Awards:**

Honestly, not that significant. I hope to add more in my senior year w/ Renton Rotary and senior class awards.

* Invited to the National Academy of Future Scientists (apparently a lot of the top 10% in my class got this)
* Invited to attend the National Youth Forum at Georgia Tech &amp; Berkeley (one of those expensive programs you get in the mail for having a good GPA)
* Invited to attend Rice University's Aerospace &amp; Aviation Academy (same thing as before)
* National Honor Society Member (honestly, our NHS is kind of a joke. We use to do a lot of community service, but now NHS members just attend the induction ceremony and leaders help with planning the induction.
* Student of the Month: Academics, Stellar Attitude &amp; Results, AP Calculus BC, Physics A, Physics B, Chemistry, French 3, Algebra 2, Geometry, Algebra 1

**Common App Essay:**

Due to the pandemic, our robotics team missed out on our competition in my freshman and sophomore years, so I wanted to write about what competition was like as a first-year and inexperienced project manager and what I learned by being in a fast-paced, stressful, and competitive environment. In particular, how I carry the ideals of FIRST (gracious professionalism) when collaborating with others and how it's an environment I would like to be in for college.

**Final Notes:**

I'm currently looking at the following schools: Yale, MIT, Harvard, Stanford, Brown, Johns Hopkins, Amherst, Williams, The University of Washington Seattle (my state school :D), The University of Wisconsin-Madison, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Are top 20 schools possible for me? Especially schools like Yale (probably my top pick for undergrad). A recommendation of schools would be amazing! Thank you all for taking the time to read this long post."
vvdzi5,1,2022-07-09,"I have a full ride and no clue what to do with my life, how do I make the most of this opportunity when I only have a month before it's too late to switch majors?",donewithlife096,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/vvdzi5/i_have_a_full_ride_and_no_clue_what_to_do_with_my/,"I'm a rising junior college student that was lucky enough to get a full ride for undergrad, but I truly do not know what to do with my life. Not then, not now, and I'm running out of time to decide and it's eating me alive. I was a really good kid in high school (straight A's, graduated valedictorian, full ride, etc.) and everyone always had high hopes for me, but I had no clue what I wanted to do for a living so I chose computer science as a nice safe degree. Huge mistake, turns out I am not wired to understand computers and massively tanked my GPA. I had never gotten anything below a 90 in my life, and I was getting straight B's and C's in all my classes no matter how much work I put in, and nearly lost my scholarship in the process. After some soul-searching, I settled on UX design as an interesting career with decent pay and switched to psychology, with the goal of going for a masters in human-computer interaction (HCI). But the more I read about the field, the more terrified I get about job prospects. Like comp sci, there's a somewhat low barrier of entry in that you don't need a specific degree so long as you have the skills, so the entry level job market is MASSIVELY saturated. I tried so hard to land a UX internship this past year - I must have applied to hundreds of postings, and only got straight rejections. To give you an idea, a new internship posting will rack up like 400-500 applicants within a few days of being posted, so that's what I'm up against. I brought a shit ton of credits with me from high school and am on track to graduate a year early with my current psych degree, but my lack of experience has me thinking I won't even get in to any of the good grad schools. And even if I do, is it worth spending like $70k when I currently have no loans just to potentially not even land a job after? The field is so niche that there isn't much else I could do with that degree besides UX stuff, and I'm terrified of putting all that time and money in with nothing to show for it (and my bachelor's psych by itself isn't gonna do me any favors). 

I've been meeting with advisors and it's not too late to change my major, I'd have to take more courses each semester but can still graduate in 4 years + one extra semester, IF I change before fall semester starts in late August of this year. The only problem is, I have NO idea what I want to do. I've taken a million career tests and always get results like teacher/librarian/social worker, which to be fair I would be interested in, but money is equally important to me as interests and I'd like to be able to make around $70-75k ideally. Even though I wasn't good at programming, I am decently interested in tech and was looking at switching to information systems and pursuing a career as a business analyst or project manager, but the idea of doing that for the rest of my life sounds so bleak. I don't mind doing something I'm not absolutely passionate about, but I'd at least like to compromise by it not being extremely stressful or maintaining somewhat of a work/life balance, which from what I can tell is hard to do as a PM. I'm good at listening to people, managing things, and being creative, but don't know how to translate that to a well-paying career or major. I'm good at art, but not enough to make it as a graphic designer or freelance artist. I like writing, but don't think I'd be able to work my way up to a lucrative writing position. I'm not pushy or persuasive enough for sales, and while I don't think I'd be bad at advertising or marketing the idea of manipulating people doesn't sit well with me. I'm getting burnt out by school and honestly would rather be working, so anything beyond a masters probably isn't feasible - I have no interest in a PhD or med school. I'm a short, fairly weak girl, so I definitely wouldn't be great at any trades either. I feel like all my friends have internships or plans for their careers, while I'm just floating through lost. I know I'm massively privileged to not have to pay for undergrad, and really don't want to waste this opportunity, but don't know what to switch to or what I can even do that's lucrative with my major but also offers stability and good pay. All I want is job stability and decent pay at this point, but I don't know the best path to take to get there and the anxiety is taking over my life. 

I'm not really sure what I'm looking for I guess. Advice for smart majors to switch to? Possible career suggestions that are tolerable or maybe even aligned with my interests? A sympathetic ear from someone in the field or in a similar position? Everyone's been moving on with their lives, and I feel like such a failure and waste of space. I've talked to every advisor I can, taken every test, reached out to dozens of alumni, and I still can't fucking decide on a career. I only have a month left to switch. And dropping out isn't an option because I'll lose my scholarship, and any free degree is far better than no degree at all. God, I'm not even 20 yet, how did I already fuck up my life this much?"

I was pretty much a social butterfly in college going partying every weekend and drinking till 3am dancing with girls. 

For the first year of my college it has been drinking+partying mainly and having fun with my friends. I haven’t accomplished anything outside of college. Lately I’ve been so interested in learning coding (I’m a CS student but college stuff is just too basic and not very practical). So I’m on a marathon in learning to code. 

My main motivation behind this was escaping from having to work minimum wage and get an internship next spring. I’m only working part time because retail places aren’t hiring full-time. I was constantly overwhelmed working at fast food so I just quit. I’ve always dreamed of working in a big tech company like google. Apart from this, I live in a small city right now with limited entertainment options (and girls: I’m not shy to say this lol). I just wanna get into a big city go to all the music shows, restaurants, find people to travel with etc. And internship would be a great way for this as well.

Coming down to my question. Do you think I should just give up my social life and push myself to learn all of this in hope for a much better future. When I say give up, I might go clubbing around once a month. I live with friends so it’s not social isolation or anything. But no more partying and just chilling with friends. 

I want an opinion from those who have done this. How did it turn out for you?"

I am a CS student in the Netherlands and I am about to start my final Bachelor's year in September. 
I have just started an internship at a FAANG in Germany (as an SDE). My internship will end at the end of September but the problem is I will have to go to some university courses physically in September as well, while also having interviews (and practicing for them) for new grad roles.

Right now I can see 2 options :

Option 1 : Try to prepare for interviews as much as possible this summer along with my internship. Then, try to commute for courses in NL and also have interviews at the same time. This would allow me to finish my degree in 3 years, but might result in not performing so well for interviews.

Option 2 : Extend my internship to 6 months, have a free summer next year to prepare for interviews and do my last semester next year (from September-February). This option might lead to not being able to take my returning offer from my current internship (if I happen to get one) while also delaying my studies.

vvwtaw,2,2022-07-10,Lease Problem,Intelligent_Couple_2,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/vvwtaw/lease_problem/," We are 3 international students sharing a 1-bedroom apartment in Montreal. We shifted into the apartment on August 1st 2021 by signing a 1-year lease, not knowing a lot about each other and just on the fact that we would have to pay less rent. 

The situation was that my friend, let's call him X, would take the bedroom solely for himself and pay 40% of the rent and my other roommate, Y and me would share the living room and split the remaining 60% of the rent into 30% each. To sign the lease, we had to deposit 2 months rent upfront, which amounted to 2166CAD .

For nine months, X resided in the flat and was the filthiest roommate imaginable. On the floor were coffee cups, pizza boxes, and unclean, used utensils that had been sitting there for a month. You can imagine how filthy the room was because he always left his dirty clothing on the floor, never dusted or mopped his room, and only cleaned it maybe three times during his nine-month stay.

I didn't have a problem with that, as it was his room, and he could do whatever he wanted with it. When he started dirtying up the kitchen and bathroom, Y and I pleaded with him to not spread his filth in the common areas. On not respecting our multiple requests, I warned him that if he continues with this filthy behavior, I would get physical with him and beat him up. After that he at least kept the common areas clean. He later moved to another city as he got an internship. X, after moving out (On the 1st of May) gave his place to another unknown person (lets call him Z).

I initially thought that Z wouldn't be as bad as X and agreed to him taking X's room until the lease ends, which is on the 31st July, 2022. I got to know that Z is almost as bad in terms of hygiene, and dirties the common areas with equal filth as much as his room. Like X, he never listens to me about keeping the premises clean and I can't force him to do so, as he can easily mess me up and honestly I'm terrified of him doing that to me. So I just sucked it up and left the house as it is and stopped caring about it. Z has long hair like a woman, if not longer, and the bathtub is always full of his wet, dirty strands of hair, which even now I have to clean when I go for a shower.

Y too stayed for 8 months, after which he moved out, took another apartment in Montreal with his other friends, and gave his place to a very good friend of ours (Call him P), who turned out to be the best person I have lived with in terms of doing household chores and behavior, so I got some respite from my situation.

I'd like to remind you that all this moving into the apartment was done illegally and the authorities have no idea that X and Y aren't living in the apartment. Also, P and Z have no dollar amounts tied to the lease as they're staying illegally.

Now, since the lease is ending and I have to return the kays to the flat to the management, who will definitely deduct at least 700-1000 CAD from our deposit due to unclean premises. I have decided that since X and Y don't live in the apartment, I will confiscate the entire amount, give Y his due, and keep the rest for myself and all this has affected me mentally a whole lot. If I shouldn't go through with this, pleas advise me on what need to be done.

Thank you very much for reading through this extremely long post, and please help me out as any suggestions would help."

But this creates uncertainties for me as traveling outside home independently is not possible for me at all due to disability. I don't have a help to devote a whole day's time for me at the office.

vvxol3,34,2022-07-10,"YSK:If you are in 12th std or just starting your graduation then dont think about MBA much. MBA is the end game, better focus on your graduation and try making it marketable.",orientsoul,Indian_Academia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indian_Academia/comments/vvxol3/yskif_you_are_in_12th_std_or_just_starting_your/,"Myquals- MBA

If your aim is to do MBA from a top college and earn big bucks even before you start your graduation or while you are in 12th std then you have failed your schooling. It does not matter how much you scored, nothing is worst than completing school without passion and intersts towards particular subject you studied.

I am writing this post because am seeing several people asking such naive questions. For all those aspirants who want to get into top institutions here are my 2 cents.

Firstly- Placement records are just statistics at the end of the day. And stats are always manipulated, played around with to show a rosy picture. Compensation packages are structured way more differently then what you might assume. A person with 30 LPA CTC might be earning as low as 1.2 lacs per month and as high as 2.2 lacs pm. 

Secondly- getting into a top college would not prevent you from faliures. 100% placements are rare very rare. And even where there are 100% placements the bottom 20% people get very sub standard roles. 

Thirdly- MBA is all about profile buidling and the best profiles are the ones with ideal mix of soft skills, achievements, great academics, passion and motivation. If you are asking in 12th std about MBA then you are probably not even near to ideal profile. 

Fourthly- most people who get into so called top institutions are not the ones who were in 12th std thinking about doing an mba. They were great at what they were doing in graduation and were rocking there as well.

Fifth- the profiles for top mba colleges are too hard to build unless you are motivated and dedicated enough from school itself. They dont want to give you a chance to prove your metal. They only bet on sure shot candidates who can succeed even without that top mba.

Sixth- CAT only helps till an extent. At most top colleges extremely high CAT score is just an entry requirement, just a formality. It does not guarantee anything. Most of the people you would be competing with would have similar CAT score or maybe even higher. So if you are thinking you would start preparing for CAT from first year of graduation itself and that would give you a good enough score to get into this colleges then you are mistaken.

Seventh-  Communication skills, confidence, personality, ability to slog long hours matter more than most other things.

Eighth- If you have low acads in school like below 80 percentage in 10th 12th, you can almost not reach few of the top IIMs unless you score 100 percentile. And even after 100 percentile it is not guaranteed. 

Ninth- MBA is not a get rich pill in short. 

If you are discouraged from reading all this gloomy stuff then dont feel bad. The purpose of this post was to discourage you.  Now you must be thinking ""what should I do now''

Now you are asking the right questions. Here is what you should do. 

Most importantly cultivate serious interest in your subjects and what you are studying. Become an expert in your domain. If you are not interested in your coursework it is worriesome but atleast try to develop some interest in any of the subject even if it is not related to your degree. 

Do projects, internships, freelance, explore post graduate curriculam of subjects you are interested in. It does not matter if you are doing b.com or engineering you should atleast do 3 internships online/offline in your graduation. 

We can always do an MBA later on. But a Mba is not going to compensate for your empty useless degree. Be thorough with your graduation subjects, it would matter in the interviews for MBA later on..

For those of you who are already doing b.com or bba just because you want to do MBA later on please work on your profile and make it decent enough that you can get atleast a 35-40k job at any growing company or startup. Develop your skillsets, it does not have to be only about what you are studying it can be about anything. If 35-40k job sounds too high it means you have not worked on yourself in these years. Tum khud socho yarr if you do 2-3 internships, develop your soft skills, learn new skillsets why would you need an MBA to pay you 80k 90k when you can earn half of that through your graduation itself.

For the ones giving CAT in 2022 you should not even be reading this post. Better study.

For those appearing for CAT this year dont worry much about profile and try to maximse your CAT score. 

For those in early years of graduation or starting graduation focus on your subjects. Develop good knowledge of it. If by last year you dont feel like pursuing this further then think about MBA. Even then atleast work for 1 year before starting your MBA. Tumko apni asli aukad pata chalegi when you work and by how much you are paid you will realise how much market values you.

For those of you asking which is best degree for MBA then maybe you did not understood this post well.

I did my MBA from a tier 2 clg. I am currently working in a great organisation at a decent post. Completely happy with my post, profile, salary and where I graduated from. 

If you have any doubts you can ask in comments."

vvyvxy,2,2022-07-10,Career Advice,scha-BANG,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/vvyvxy/career_advice/,"Hi Everyone, 

I’ve really been conflicted as of late as to what I should do to best achieve my career goals. My current situation is a little complex, so allow me to give some background. I am 21 years old and I am heading into my final year in college. I am majoring in Information Systems with a focus in analytics. However, I have had a change of heart and I want to break into the finance sector. 

Last semester I took an introductory finance course which got me fascinated with stock valuation and portfolio management. My future goal is to pass the CFA, become a charterholder, and either work as a Portfolio Manager or Financial Advisor. Before I found my passion, I got an IT internship at a financial services company. I started working for the company this summer and luckily they have an investment subsidiary. I was able to network with a VP and portfolio manager and he gave me the advice of starting out in operations and working my way into the investments side. He said that passing L1 of the CFA during my senior year would also be a big help and show my dedication. However, I’ve heard that becoming a candidate during college isn’t the best idea as it demands a lot of time and effort. 

I’m not sure that I could properly study for L1 all while maintaining good grades as a full time student and working 20+ hours a week. Another thought that I had was to switch my major to finance, which I don’t believe would affect my graduation timeline, but I am wondering if that would really help all that much with my current situation. What would be my best course of action?"
vvz3kp,91,2022-07-10,taking a year off of school/mental health... opinions?,Internal_Ear9903,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/vvz3kp/taking_a_year_off_of_schoolmental_health_opinions/,"hi everyone, a bit about me-

I'm 21F, computer science major and about to be a senior at a competitive school in California. More about me- I'm about a B average student thinking of taking a gap year for these reasons-

**1) I feel extremely behind my peers.** after getting more friends in my major I noticed that most of them were putting in a third or maybe half of the work that I put in, to get much higher grades. Before someone says that they're pretending that they're not trying to hard, that's not the case, I live with some of them and see them study and I know for a fact they put in a really disproportionately small amount of time and effort compared to me, and usually if I'm stuck on a bug for 2-3 days, they can solve it in like an hour or so. It's extremely discouraging to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**2) I haven't made any personal projects or LeetCoded at all in my free time**. I went through a lot in these past few years- including the death of my mom, my dad's cancer diagnosis, treatment, and surgery, and obviously COVID/pandemic stuff. I've felt too emotionally burned out to set goals and meet goals of working on coding in my free time. In my darkest moments where I was helping my dad write his will, creating a plan to take legal guardianship of my little sisters, etc., I felt like it was all I could do to just put on like a TV show and emotionally numb myself out instead of like coding. As of right now, I am still struggling with some LeetCode 'Easy' problems, which is a really bad sign for someone who will be looking for a full-time position in the fall.

&amp;#x200B;

**3) My resume is not that impressive.** My only internship that I got is one at a mid-size manufacturing company that I'm currently doing this summer. Also, I am going to be a TA for a cybersecurity class in the fall. But besides that, I have no research or anything to speak of.

&amp;#x200B;

**4) Overall lack of confidence**. I just feel so shitty about myself. I feel like everyone is so far ahead of me and I hate myself for being so behind. Also, I'm dealing with some intense depression and anxiety surrounding my personal life.

&amp;#x200B;

***If I were to take a gap year or semester, this is how I would hopefully address these issues:***

&amp;#x200B;

**1) I feel extremely behind my peers.** Solution: I would LeetCode and spend my time studying computer science theory in my own time, at my own pace, and hopefully catch up to where my peers are at.

&amp;#x200B;

**2) I haven't made any personal projects or LeetCoded at all in my free time**. Solution: Goes along with the first point, but I would spend my time doing my own personal projects and LeetCoding in my free time.

&amp;#x200B;

**3) My resume is not that impressive.** Solution: Goes along a bit with the last point, but I would have more time to create personal projects to add to my resume.

&amp;#x200B;

**4) Overall lack of confidence**. Solution: I think this might honestly be the biggest thing. I would just get in some intense therapy and perhaps an inpatient program to try to get my mental health in check. (My only concern is that this might not actually help my mental health? idk. so far I've seen several therapists and psychiatrists, and none of them have really helped me in a significant way, but I don't know what else could hypothetically help me mentally)

***However, if I don't take a gap semester/year, I would*** probably still get through my degree, and I'd try my hardest to do LeetCode to be prepared for interview season, but I think I would overall be more stressed out and I tend to not be productive when I'm stressed. In addition, I just wouldn't be able to take any time off of school/grinding to get to an inpatient mental health place, so I can only assume my mental health would further decline.

Does anyone have any thoughts or experiences with gap years, mental health, being a CS major, etc.?"

HELP ME OUT,Witness_Charming,developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/vvzrmb/i_need_advice_help_me_out/,"**Back story:** I would keep it brief. Since childhood I had a dream of being a software developer not an Astronauts or a scientist. My school had computer science as an subject since 6th class, so I was an early bird to learn programming. After my 10+2 I got into good governmental engineering college (CSE stream) but due to some major issues (ragging, bullying etc) I left the college after 6 months. Ended up joining a law college. Rn I have 2 years left until graduation from my 5 year llb course. I still have an urge to get back into programming but I don't know how I will make a career in it within 2 years

**Actual Problem -** My question is can I get a job as a software developer in some good companies (Good here I mean 8lac plus CTC) within 2 years, provided only degree I will have would be of law. Right now I have decent programming skills in c++ and python. 5 star on hacker rank as a start. But I don't know how can I convert my skills into a job offer. It's hard to get an internship alone without a degree in engineering or BCA or any equivalent. I can't join BCA after law so please don't advice that coz I have already wasted 5 years in law. 

Is it even possible or I have no chance."

While my title at this internship is ""software engineer"", I am really just a web developer. I have the opportunity to stay with this company, and they have offered to hire me on full time after I graduate, but I don't like a few aspects of the company culture so I have decided to spread my wings and go elsewhere after the internship is completed.

If you have a subreddit where you think this is more appropriate, please let me know.

I've been struggling financially for awhile now and I think that I need to have some side income in order to meet my expenses. For some context, I am a PhD student in computer science (starting my fourth year this fall, doing research in machine learning) which demands a huge amount of hours with very little pay. I live in a big city with high cost of living, and I can barely meet my expenses. Every time I save a little bit of money, I end up clearing it out for car repair or something else, and I'm worried about my ability to stay above water in the long term.

Because of this, I'm looking for a side hustle. In the past, I've done plasma donation to make some extra money, and I am considering going back there. But I figured that I have some lucrative skills and maybe I can make better money doing something I actually enjoy. For context, I have an undergrad degree in math and computer science, a master's degree in computer science, one industry internship building and deploying machine learning systems, and three years experience doing academic research in the machine learning community. The problem is that I don't really have much time to give to a side hustle (10 hours a week at most) and none of that time is during regular business hours. Is there some kind of service that I can use to find part-time freelance programming work, or something similar? At the very least, I figure that I could work as a tutor for a better hourly rate than plasma donation. It feels silly to consider plasma when I have highly sought after skills: I just don't have the time to offer them during regular business hours.

Thanks for reading and I appreciate the help."

So when i got to the final round, there it was a heap problem that I couldn't answer to which basically led me to fail it. I wasn't able to answer the problem completely, because I was stunned when the interviewer was hinting towards a specific data structure. What's funny is later that night when I wanted to continue doing the AlgoExpert; lo, and behold, the next problem was about heaps and very similar to the interview problem. SIGH

I am a PCMB student and although I'm going to appear for JEE and probably NEET too next year I don't think my heart lies in either of those streams. And the thought of spending the rest of my life doing something I am not even interested in the first place, really disturbs me.

**Coursework:** 5s on all APs taken so far: AP Chem, AP World History, APHG, AP Physics C: Mechanics and E&amp;M, AP Calc BC, APCSA, APUSH, AP English Lang. Will take 5 more APs this year. I was also one of the 2 students in the world to achieve a perfect score on the AP Chemistry exam in 2021.

**Awards and ECs:** 

· USACO Platinum

· 3x AIME qualifier; 1x USAMO qualifier

· Won several hackathons and game jams

· Awards in competitive programming from Codeforces, Google Code Jam and FB Hacker Cup

· I work as a freelance web and full stack developer part time, and I’ve worked on over a dozen client projects through Fiverr.

· Created a game that went semi-viral and has made me \~$135,000 in the past 10 months. I’m the sole creator of this game and have developed everything from the artwork to the programming.

· My game had a decent media coverage and several popular game magazines wrote on it.

· This summer I’m working on porting my game to console and mobile platforms, so I expect to make a lot more money.

· I don’t have a whole lot of ECs tbh, but I spend a lot of my free time programming and learning new tools. I have worked on/completed some very technologically advanced projects independently and contributed majorly to OSS.

· Outside of CS, I enjoy reading a lot and I’m heavily interested in anthropology, religion, culture, economics, ancient history and the like.

· I’m into cybersecurity as well, so I managed to hack into a local internet service provider but ended up getting caught. Since I am under 18, I was only sentenced community service. Do you think I should share this story with colleges or will it have a negative impact?

I’d love to know what kind of colleges I have a shot of getting into. No one in my family has gone to college and since I go to a pretty mediocre HS, there aren’t a whole lot of competitive applicants so I’m unsure of the colleges I should apply to. I’ll be honest I’ve never really cared much about getting into “x” college which is why I didn’t focus too much on getting internships or research opportunities."

In my mid 30’s, started as an accountant and pivoted into a tech-focused role (product manager). Along the way, I took several CS classes at my community college (C, VB, C++, DS and Algorithms, and discrete math). I also got a Software Dev BA from Western Governors University a few years ago. I really should have made the switch when I graduated, but was too scared to do so. I’ve learned that I enjoy having the capability to create things myself and that I would be happier being a SWE. 

At this point in my career, is it better to go back to school for a second BA in CS and get some solid foundations + a chance at internships or go to a bootcamp? 

I have a good amount of savings, but do have a mortgage and family to support."

Some industry experts had their own start up and they were looking for their first full time employee for 2 roles. I fit the criteria for both and I was hired as an intern for the same on a trial basis. I did everything in my power and my term was doubled as an intern in the 3rd week of being hired. My bosses were pleased with me and were considering hiring me. They had stopped looking for other options.

Now in the month of June, my sister, the problem of my Life, revealed that she is dating the shame of the village. The only positive about this guy is his std tests. If that is not enough, she failed 6 out 7 classes in college. Now, I failed a class too, so I wasn't judging her.  This affected everything at home. I work from home, and I couldn't take calls because either my dad was yelling or my mom was scolding my sister. 

I was asked to travel with my sister to her college so that she doesn't run away from her exam hall. I was to travel 4 hours each day and then wait for her in the car while she wrote her paper. I was exhausted and I could only put 50% of my efforts in the internship. It got really bad. I explained this to my boss and while she understood, she said that she would have to find a replacement for the second role. I will be working only for 1 of their shows instead of 2. I am getting paid 3/4th of my previous stipend and I am no longer their first choice for the full time employee because they have better choices. It's not a major setback in my parents'opinion, since they want me to pursue an MBA in finance anyways and my internship is in audio production. But I don't want to do the MBA and this was possibly my only shot at working in the field of my choice.

My sister, the b*tch, has done nothing but been snarky, pushed me on a slippery side walk and called me a disgusting dyke(I am a lesbian).
She is the worst of the worst. I always have to suffer the consequences of her actions. I couldn't work because I was babysitting her ass. I don't know what to do now. My family life is in shambles, my professional life is shaken and I feel like I am going to go crazy."

I'm a IT fresh grad. It's quite some time since I started studying web development and I think I have a good foundation since I studied the fundamentals. My learning platform are - freeCodeCamp (HTML, CSS and JS), youtube tutorials, Udemy and so on. I made a static page and calculator just pure Vanilla Js (not finished yet, still have bugs), I'm not in ""tutorial hell"". Now I'm tackling React.js, learning the basics. I'm going for extension like SASS, jQuery and so on but that would be next time, one step at a time.

My question, if is it possible for me to become a junior web dev without self-projects? In addition, I'm not from any big 4 plus I have only freeCodeCamp certificates but not sure if is it recognized or acknowledge here in Philippines.

If not, is it enough the two I mentioned from above- static website (tribute to someone) and the calculator lol. This solely purpose to showcase in my web portfolio because I once encountered during when I'm looking for internship. I was asked for my web portfolio and projects. So I'm worried."

I eventually ended up with two offers: one from an absolutely sus company that didn't really have a lot of information about itself, but it pays 17$/hr and I had to move to a place that was 2 hours from where I lived in university and wasn't going to be provided any housing assistance. The other offer was from a company that looked like a proper company, comparatively to the previous one at least, but was unpaid and remote. I didnt know what to choose between them, but ended up choosing the unpaid one, at least that way, I was able to go back home during the summer too. Though am still not sure whether I made the right choice or not. Now, in the beginning, the HR side of thing with this company seemed pretty professional, with all sorts of orientation meetings and whatnot, but when it came down to the actual internship, the structure and everything was super scuffed, it was basically our Mentor and like originally the 6 of us(basically now boiled down to 3 maybe 4 of us coming to the meetings regularly) and the mentor basically taught us how the things worked on their platform and also taught us how to use react native and we are now working building front end stuff. But all of it feels very unplanned and I highly doubt if this internship will turn into an return offer considering how unstructured the internship program actually is and also the fact that this is a startup. Even if it doesn't, I'm just left with this anxiety of whether I'm actually on the right track and whether I will be a hirable candidate for companies by the time I graduate. I'm just unsure if this internship will truly help me in that way and I don't really know what to do right now. I currently am sitting on a 3.5 GPA, but I'm super sure I will be able to bump this up by a bit within the next two semesters. Now coming to the point, how screwed am I and what can I do in this situation. I'm really sorry if this seems kinda unnecessarily long and sorry for my poor English."

At the end of year 1 I applied for a ton of online internships way ahead of the time they all started, and got accepted to only one of them. They told me it was on-site only 2 weeks before the internship (2 months after the acceptance email). Had no way to move to their city at that point and my deadass didn't to just DRIVE there like any sane human being. I dropped it.

After that, a friend mentioned to me a company he works for was looking for a web developer, so I asked him to put me in contact with someone and he did. After speaking with the person he told me about (the CEO of the small company) he said he definitely wanted me on board and gave me some stuff to learn to prepare in advance.

Talked to him a few more times about what's next and everything. Only problem was the person I was about to work with never responded to his own boss, nor to me in a group whatsapp chat he made specifically for the new 2 man team of me and that guy. I just walked away not saying a word after trying to get the guy to say SOMETHING for months, and after learning web development and the Meteor framework from scratch just for this job. I hated my life at this point.

Now, I applied for mandatory summer practice for uni at a large company in the same city as the first company mentioned. I first contacted them in May about starting in July, because I wanted to make sure I get a spot. They again gave me something to learn and off I went to go thru an entire tutorial series and making an entire project just for training to not look like an idiot. In the meantime I also worked thru some paperwork with them. Contact person told me to message them one week before the start of my practice. The CEO also asked me if I wanted to stay there for a job afterwards to which I eagerly said yes.

So I messaged her today. She told me she never heard from me when she was supposed to.

She did, I spoke to her when I came to fill in the paperwork, which she didn't even fill in properly and now I have to clarify MORE shit, then I spoke to her again at a later date which was even more recent, like 2 weeks ago, after the guy in the company who told me to message him if I find difficulties ghosted me for more than 3 days.

Also told me all the practice spots are now filled and I either have to do remote or wait until AUGUST for on-site (I wanted on-site this time so I get some actual contact with a company...was hoping I'd get a job out of this).

Fuck my life, fuck this fucking administrative garbage, and fuck everything about going to work.

I want to actually WORK, not deal with this shit, I WANT TO WORK FOR FUCK'S SAKE, I've already been working by learning all the time even if I have uni in the meantime and I'm thanked with all this bullshittery??? JUST GIVE ME SOMETHING TO FREAKING WORK ON SO I DON'T FEEL LIKE A WASTE OF HUMAN RESOURCES

Colleague which spoke to them for the first time like 2 weeks ago was just told they are starting on the 18th this month :-)

TL;DR: applied to one internship, one job and one practice and they all screwed me over last second with administrative crap."
vwgbgy,8,2022-07-11,TIFU by deleting a website,Cast_Porpoise,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/vwgbgy/tifu_by_deleting_a_website/,"Basically the principal of a local school in my area is new and was having trouble getting the school's website to work, as the previous principal had created a mess of a website and not provided any documentation to support it. She had tried to get help from a couple of IT managers from businesses around the area, but to no avail. My mother (who knows the principal) works for an organisation that supports the school and since I'm currently an IT intern she says that I can help.


First problem, idk what the fuck I'm doing when it comes to WordPress. Second problem, if IT managers can't work this shit out, how am I?


Principal suggests that it would be a good idea to reset the site and start from scratch. I'm inclined to agree but still think it best to create a clone that I can edit and then go from there. 


I try to create a new website (on Bluehost) and I cannot figure out how to do this. Seriously, I had no idea what I was doing. I use a reset plugin for WordPress and save a backup of the site, then create a clone. Idk how I created it because when I deleted the clone (for another reason) I deleted the main site too. Custom domain emails, a 40GB online media library, everything. Just gone. 


Now I'm in the middle of building a new website. I'm trying to document the whole process so that the next poor schmuck who has to maintain this site is actually able to. 


TLDR: I deleted a school's website while messing around with setting up a clone and now need to create a new website."

I am not at a super prestigious school, T50 overall and T15 public schools. I haven’t taken the GRE yet, but I did get a 35 on my ACT on the first attempt without studying, so I think I could do well on the GRE. I am not super confident in being able to get into a good MFE program because of the GPA. Due to this I am considering either graduating in the spring with a 3.8 and working as an actuary for a year before trying again for master’s admission, or delaying my graduation and adding either two more majors (Econ and Data Science) or adding just computer science. This would allow me to apply with a higher GPA. Would a master’s program want me to do more school, or get work experience in a semi unrelated field?

vwgqd6,545,2022-07-11,The sad reality no one tells you about learning to code on your own.,devLookingForAJob,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/vwgqd6/the_sad_reality_no_one_tells_you_about_learning/,"I started learning to code in 2017. I'm a woman in my 30s.I learned HTML,CSS and javaScript.did all the freecodecamp certificates. created some projects and created my portfolio website and applied for jobs. didn't get any. in 2019, I got so depressed and burned out that I stopped. in 2020 I got back into coding, but I forgot everything I'd learned and I had to study again.

in 2021 I have added more projects. this time started learning react.

in 2022 I realized enough is enough. I am not lucky enough to be accepted by someone to give me a job. I wasted all these years realizing that luck and location matter.

if you see videos like Chris sean, who got a web dev job after 3 months. don't be fooled. that's  **Survivorship bias**.  we only hear stories from people who succeed and found a job in tech because they are the only ones speaking. Chris sean got so lucky. you may not get that lucky. you may fail miserably like me.

Also, consider your location.

If you live in Canada, self-taught will not work. here they will only give you a chance if you are a college or university student.

After feeling worthless and rejected all these years, while contemplating suicide and the severe depression that coding has caused, I am quitting it now.

I have to choose life. I can't do this anymore.

Yes, I am stuck in a customer service job but I will find another way out.

Currently living a lonely miserable life, broke as hell, underemployed. no future career prospects. no girlfriend. no love. alone AF.

I had to think a lot about what really makes me happy and has a guaranteed path to a secure job and now I am set to apply to medical schools and become a doctor.

my advice as a person who wasted all these years learning to code on my own and applying to jobs and getting none is: Go get a degree that has COOP. learn to code while you are a student. get internships. Don't listen to people who say a degree is useless. even if you have a degree in another field. get a degree in computer science and learn to code while you are a student. this way doors will open to you more easily. Don't be a miserable fool like me who is contemplating suicide every single day.

Note1: I have a bachelor's degree in IT. I got in 10 years ago. the fact that I suggested getting a degree was the perks the current students have, while they are a student, like COOP and internships.

Note2: For people who mentioned my post from 2 years ago.  I was offered a job but then they changed their mind so I lost it. It was the worst day of my life. and the post from 3 years ago I was asking for salary negotiation because I thought that they would hire me. but it did not happen.

Note3: My bachelor's degree is from 10 years ago. I did a postgraduate certificate course and I meant that when I said I graduated from college."

I got a small student studio half a year ago because i was taking a course at a different location and living there has made me realize how important an organized living space is to me. My parents house has been…. how to say this.. unfinished… under construction?? for as long as i’ve been alive. This is because my dad wants to do every construction thing himself but he has a full time job so he can barely work on the house. He is also working on my room right now so im kinda missing a part of my room. My parents and brother are also kinda messy people, so our house doesnt really have any fine organization and is messy but still livable. 

But when I got my studio I (succesfully) tried hard to keep it organized and clean and it was eye opening. I am an anxious and chaotic person so I felt much more comfortable and I could much better concentrate on my school work. The thing is, in my last year of school I need to do an internship but I can't find one so I'm expecting to take a half year or year off college and move back full time with my parents, but my room there is an absolute mess and I can't stand to be there. It doesn't qualify as a depression room but I just have no organization. All stuff that I use regularly is just on my desk laid out because my closets and drawers are an absolute mess. I also probaly have a lot of stuff I probably could do without. Cleaning and organizing is so overwhelming and nearly gives me a panic attack. When I tried to tell my mom about my troubles I got very emotional and she looked at me like I was crazy and told me to but new furniture or find a way to clean up my room. But I dont want to buy new furniture because I'm expecting to have to move for work after I graduate (there is nothing in my area in my field of study) so I think it would be a waste of money (I dont have a lot of money anyways) but clearly I also cant just clean my room with my current approach. Every time i try to even clean my desk i get overwhelmed.

Does anyone have a certain approach or method that would be effective in in cleaning my room and working out an organization system? Any advice would be much appreciated!

Over the course of my internships, I've realized that I do not enjoy software engineering in much. It's not that I hate SWE in general, but I would only return to 1 out of the 4 internships that I did in college.

On the other hand, I started doing research in college 3 months ago, and greatly enjoyed the experience. I'm personally more academically aligned as well.

However, given the long amount of time it takes to get a PhD in CS (\~5 years), and the fact that I have little research experience to get into a good PhD program, I was wondering if there's any research labs in industry that take undergraduate students. Most of the places that I have come across only take PhDs (and a few take MS graduates), which is understandable, but I was wondering if there's any places that also accept undergrad students.

**TLDR**: Can't see myself working in industry for long after college, would like to do research, but can not do PhD.

On a side note, how much would getting a MS help with this? My college has a 1 year MS for BS students, so I might go for it, if it can help me gather research experience for these places.

vwovaf,1,2022-07-11,Should I take the leap?,Ducatore38,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/vwovaf/should_i_take_the_leap/,"Okay, I am at the end of my first real job and now don't now what to do...

I am 27M in France. I was quite OK with study and always loved sciences (physics, biology...). Since I didn't feel any appeal or a more precise calling, I always chose the studies that would offer me the broader opportunities and that would be the hardest/most valued path. I had this mindset that ""If I fail, I can always take an easier route that would be okay to me."" So I started with engineering prep school in France, then went to an engineering school, eventually pursued a PhD. Nothing failed catastrophically, so here I am, 8 years later with a MSE in biomedical engineering and a PhD in Physics for Life Sciences. And now, I am obliged to choose, and I don't know what to do...

I love sciences and would be okay working in this... to some extent. An academic career is quite tedious with very long hours if you want to succeed, and it is not guaranteed you will. Turning to industry does not attract me so much as it would feel not very useful (I am very concerned by climate change and societal problem we have and find biotech companies are not addressing this at all...) and ethically difficult (... because my job would literally be to make money on the health of the wealthiest...). I have some interviews coming this month for post-doc contracts (few years contracts to work in a lab) but I don't feel like I should continue in academia after one post-doc...

In the same time, I love using my hands and being outside. During my studies, I used to do temp work over the summer (if I did not have an internship) as a laborer on construction sites or farm (I worked in a goat farm, as a roofer, a janitor...). Even though it can sometimes feel a bit repetitive and not using my brain kind of dull me over time, I quite liked it. I am quite sporty and practice a lot of different activities in  a mountaineer club : caving, cannoneering, climbing, hiking... I guess would love to do a job such as rope access worker, carpenter (I have a one-month internship with one in August!) or maybe diver. This work seems quite varied (a lot of different tasks), you can travel a lot and earn quite well if you are good at it... 

So here is why I am writing here : I have been indecisive for the last 9 years but stick to my studies so far as I felt I should have a degree to be ""safe"" financially. But now I went as far as I could go study wise. Now that I finished my studies, everything seems so attractive and I change my mind every other week (which drives my GF crazy...) I am a bit scared to take such a leap as their might be no way back and it is also risky : you can't be a carpenter or a rope access worker until you retire or you'll be in very poor state (if you survive until then...). 

So I write to you to discuss several aspects : 

* People in science/tech : did you ever feel such an appeal to leave completely your line of work? how did you fight it? Does it get better when working after a PhD?
* People that did such a leap : do you regret it? Would you advise doing so? Do you feel bored to move from white collar to blue collar job?
* If you work in such a trade, how would you welcome a 27 y o with a PhD?
* Am I the only one in this situation?
* You, random reader, what would you advise me? How do you resolve such a thing? What would you do in my position?

P.S. : After proofreading this, I really sound like a brat facing the ""first-worlder"" problem ever... Sorry about that... I don't know how to phrase it, or if I should rather go post it on offmychest...

And sorry for the long post...

TL;DR : After 9 years of study, a MSE and a PhD, I feel like dropping everything and turning to construction jobs... Should I do it?"

Being completely honest, I did not make the effort to actively pursue a career in IT while in school. I have no internships or experience working at an entry level job. Right now, I’m a receptionist at a medical office and the only thing I think would apply to any IT entry level position is social skills/customer service. 

The office I work at is turning into a shit show and I’m looking for a new job ASAP. I know how saturated the job market is in general for IT, but even more so for entry level positions. I feel like I’m running out of time and I’m really disgusted at myself for fucking around the past 4 years. Anyways, my first priority right now is to work on getting the A+ at a minimum. I know some people say certs/degrees dont matter, but I want to get my A+ because quite honestly, it feels like I don’t know what the basics of IT are. I know how ridiculous that sounds after 4 yrs of chasing a degree in CIS. I am also very interested in starting my own home lab, but I have no clue where to start with that.

While I’m still at my current job, I’d like to teach myself as much as possible.

Thanks."

I've interned in 4 companies (including Google) with a total duration of more than 1 year. I also have a decent open source experience, have successfully completed two Google Summer of Code projects.   


I am in final year of my dual degree (Bachelors &amp; Masters), and want to connect with companies that hire part-time engineers or interns (should be remote) and pay decently."
vwr8r1,2,2022-07-11,Full time ME SolidWorks jobs?,whoiscrankshaft,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/vwr8r1/full_time_me_solidworks_jobs/,"Hey all,

I’m an ME who studied SolidWorks in high school and college, and did an internship at a SW service provider (mostly doing front-end customer modeling support) which paid its salaried tech support employees ~$50k/yr. SW is the thing I’m best at in my life, and the only work-related thing I’m passionate about. Since college, I’ve worked two separate jobs using non-SW programs (fuck you Bentley), and I’ve recently decided that I want a career using SW 8 hours a day, 5 days a week while maybe still making some engineering decisions. However, I just started a job as an entry level Transmission Engineer making $75k/yr.

I’ve spent time on Indeed and seen that most entry level CAD drafter roles pay around the 50-60k range. Would this pay increase with my certifications? I have 11 years of solidworks experience under my belt (since high school), my CSWP, and many of the other ancillary add-in certs as well. It doesn’t seem these certifications have made me any more appealing to the ME jobs that have SW experience as a requirement.

Are entry-level engineering jobs that use SW full time common? What about self employed contract work? Would you personally take a pay cut to work with a program you’re more comfortable with, or would you tough it out until you learned the new workflow?

Thanks in advance for any input you can offer"
vwrrkm,1,2022-07-11,Is getting another Graduate Degree or Getting a Masters degree a better idea?,LuckyMango_25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/vwrrkm/is_getting_another_graduate_degree_or_getting_a/,"Hello all, just recently I graduated from my University in Finance. I thought I wanted to be a Financial Adviser, but after a year and half internship and obtaining more and more clients I found to realize the career was not for me ,so when I graduated It was too late. I love to invest on my own and financial planning (for my self), but taking care of other peoples financial plan/investments wasn't for me, even when my internship was a success and given a full-time offer. 

Now, I work for a financial service company (big 4 bank) on the IT/tech department making $62,000 a year for the past 7 months. I work as a data analyst/IT consultant/data migration....and to be honest I got really lucky obtaining this job and enjoy it a lot. I came close switching my major during my undergrad to computer science/Info Systems....but never did. 

My question is, if I wanted to switch my career into a data analytics, software engineer, type of role, would it be smart to get a masters in Computer Science or MBA in Info Systems, or go get another bachelors degree in Computer Science?"

vws4lp,5,2022-07-11,How to calculate the area of vents and power for air conditioning for switchgears,toutreck,ElectricalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricalEngineering/comments/vws4lp/how_to_calculate_the_area_of_vents_and_power_for/,"Hello!

I'm currently working in an internship and was asked to make a excel sheet to verify the temperature rise of a LV switchgear (following IEC 61439). Now that I'm done with that, I was asked to add a part for when the temperature is too high; where we regulate the temperature with vents, forced ventilation or air conditioning.

I'm using ABB's e-design ""OTC"" to verify my calculations, however I couldn't find too much information about LV switchgear with vents. I tried using Schneider's MV guides and other websites that share info for vents in MV, but that only gives approx. values to what I'm really looking for. I tried IEEEs guides but they mostly give info on MV. 

&amp;#x200B;

does anybody know of a good resources for this matter? I want to be able to get:

*  An approx size for the net free area of the vent needed depending on the power, cfm or temperature of the switchgear.
* An approx of the conditioning power needed depending on the power, cfm or temperature of the switchgear.

&amp;#x200B;

the ABB's e-design ""OTC"" gives an ""approx"" of them, however once I test them, they tend to be too low. So I was wondering if its possible to get a better calculation. 

Thank you for reading, have a nice day."

I've been applying for stuff for the fall/next summer and yet again, I'm getting rejected from everything. I could do the unpaid internship again in the fall to possibly get a stipend, but the stipend's so small that I'm not even sure if I'd actually get it. I tried to come up with projects that actually challenge me, and they're nowhere near the level what other people have made. *And I'm trying hard to learn more and more and practice programming with projects*, but it just doesn't seem to be good enough. I'm going to try to learn DSA over the rest of the summer to practice LeetCode afterwards, but I'm already behind most other people at my school that already took the actual course at my school. I know a lot of people are going to get into FAANG at my university since it's competitive, and I'm trying to make sure I'm one of them so I can say I actually accomplished something for once in my life. But the fact that I can't even get a real internship now or actually program anything good doesn't seem like a good sign to me. I'm not going to be able to feel happy or good about myself unless I get a good SWE job after graduating. Plus, my GPA's &lt;3.5 - I'm going to try to bring it up over the next semesters, but the highest I can possibly bring it up to is 3.8, and I'm going to have to somehow manage to get a 4.0 every other semester I have left."

Hi everyone,

I'm currently an international rising senior in CS. Currently doing IT intern in a bank company (no, I'm not doing quant. Just data visualization.)

I have some small projects here and there in machine learning and data science. All other projects I have is mostly just from the class or hackathon. I know only Python/C++/Java. My Leetcode skill is a bit subpar, but I'm still practicing it now.

I'm really interested in ML, specifically Reinforcement Learning in Games. Being researcher would be nice for me, except my financial situation does not really allow me to (and my paper did not get published, which make things even worse)

I just realized that applying to MLE as a fresh undergrad is almost totally impossible (as far as I heard) because most places need graduate degree at least. My family already lost tons of money to send me to study here, so they don't have money to send me to grad school, which means I probably need to find a job after undergrad.

So I would like to ask a quick question, what would be a good position to apply so that I can try pursue MLE afterward, and how should I prepare for that position? I don't really mind SWE/Data Scientist(or Analyst), but I don't really know which one would be better and what should I do now.

Thank you in advance!"

Was it leetcode? If so, what style of leetcode questions (dp, graph, array, bit, etc)? If not, how did you prepare and what was it really like?

How much do you think resume matters? I've taken my OS course, did really well, am making my own small OS for Rpi4, and want to start an OS club at my school.

Any other notes on the interview process would be great.

vwwjyj,2,2022-07-11,I've geared my whole college career to IT and cybersecurity. But now I am second guessing my choice. I think I like coding more.,Ambitious_SysAdmin,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vwwjyj/ive_geared_my_whole_college_career_to_it_and/,"Hello all,

As the title says, I have been gearing my whole college career towards security. I got my A+ Net+ and Sec+ certifications. I did 2 internships based on cyber (which turned into a part-time job) and now I am about to graduate. My current part-time job has informally offered me a fulltime once I graduate but you know how that is, nothing is for certain until its in writing. I was reading about how maybe cybersec is no longer paying as well as it used to, due to the flood of applicants. My thoughts are that maybe I should start coding for 3 reasons: First I must study something in my off time; its important to continue learning, because IT/CS folk don't last long if they don't stay on top of current tech. Secondly: Everything we use in IT was created by a programmer; I cant help but get jealous of those admirable skills, so I want those skills too. Finally, it pays well.

At my school, they have 2 tracks: CS and IT. I chose IT. But now I am thinking that maybe that wasn't the best choice. I took 2 java classes and 1 python class and I loved it all. Of all the classes I had, those 3 were by far the most challenging and took the most amount of study and effort. At times it was very frustrating. But when the code compiled and ran correctly, it was the best feeling ever. I was always one of the best in the class. I even tutored other students on the side if they paid me enough.

So I guess my question is this:

Are my suspicions unfounded about CyberSec?

Let's say I wanted to get started on ramping up my coding, where do I even begin?

I don't think I need to begin from the very bottom; I know about loops, variables, try-catch blocks, throwing exceptions, building re-usable code... Really the only challenges I found were difficult were the recursion and sorting algorithms. It took my a while until I understood it well."

I found and got an internship in my dream role at my dream company and I got my first performance review. It sent a lot of mixed signals and I don't know how to interpret it or if I've just screwed myself out of the job I've always wanted. I give 100% of my effort all the time, I work as hard as I can, and everything. I knew my performance review was coming before I got it, and I directly asked him to be honest and blunt with me because I genuinely want to improve and become the most hireable person I can be, but the review still punched me in the gut when I read it.

The review said that my performance was excellent and that my technical knowledge is great, but that I always seem unconfident in my work and act like I'm unsure about stuff.

I have an anxiety disorder and depression from years of being abused as a child, and I will admit that I have very low self-confidence and self-esteem from it, and I really wouldn't be surprised if it shows/is very obvious. I do often find myself very nervous and stuttery when talking to other people in social situations, but it's even worse when I work because I care about what I do so much.

If my manager told me that I should improve my software development processes, for example, or that I should document my work better, that's something that I can change easily and that I'd be happy to change. But I can't just turn my neurodivergence off. I've gone through years of therapy that have helped me cope with what I went through and adjust to adulthood, but I can't just flip a switch and suddenly become a self-asserted person. I wish I could do that in an instant, but it's a process I'm slowly going through and I'm afraid I'm just not 100% there yet (and I'm not sure I'll ever be completely ""normal"").

Has anyone else gone through anything like this and still gotten hired? Are engineering managers more understanding than I would think? I don't know if I should be honest and open up to him about my health issues since I'm not sure whether that would be professional (and also there is a huge stigma around that kind of stuff). Or should I just suck it up and try really hard to just fake it until I make it?

Thanks for any advice you can give Engineering Reddit :)"

While I am confident that I can do well in school, I am wondering how I will secure an internship in such a limited time-frame. \*\*In Fall 2023 I will not yet have a GPA, nor will I have Data Structures/Algorithms coursework, so I fear it will be hard to get an internship for the first summer since interviews are usually conducted \~9 months before summer internships.

I am in desperate need of some advice after barely getting any from friends and family.
This fall i‘ll be starting my Econ undergrad after switching from CS. 
I have been looking for a job to finance my studies and living costs. Right now, I am struggling to choose between two offers. Both are 16h/week (2 full days)

The first one is a standard office job where i have to dispach freight trains. It pays well but i‘ll only be doing late night shifts. The job is pretty boring but solid. 

The second is a one year internship at a digital marketing agency. The monthly salary is only half that of the aforementioned job, but they told me that the goal of the internship is to hire me for a full time job in digital marketing after that year, that job will pay as much as the office job.

My thoughts: 
Pros job nr1: nearby (10min drive), pays well and is familiar (worked in similar job before). moreover, there‘ll be way less stuff to learn which may be beneficial so i can fully focus on my studies. 
Cons: boring, night shifts and rather dull co workers 

pros job nr2: promising career field and totally new skill that i could learn, high earning potential, growing agency and very cool people
cons: pays way less in first year, it‘s not a fact that i‘ll enjoy the job as i have never worked in a similar position before, meaning it is not guaranteed i‘ll get the promised full time job. bit further away (1hr drive) and the risk that i‘ll have so much to do and learn there that it‘ll affect my studies negatively

Graduated from college a year ago, got my first television-related freelance job a couple of months ago. I work in news production, and I’m super grateful that I got an offer that’s related to my major and ideal career field.

Being two months in, I’ve realized that I do not like news, I am not crazy about the tasks (I’m in graphics and I sit a desk with computers, communicating with graphic artists and pulling images, etc), and the hours are not consistent. The software too has been much more difficult to understand that I thought it would be. I knew what I was getting myself into, and I was totally open to seeing if I’d at least be able to manage doing it for a while. I wanted to give news a chance. However, I’ve come to the point where I have no desire working. I’ve never felt this miserable at a job before. I’ve held several video and film related internships and positions before, but this is the first one I truly am just not enjoying. I feel guilty about it too. The hiring guy said they need more freelancers like me for the midterm election season. The kicker is I’m still in the training period! I’d feel bad bailing.

Is it bad that I’ve already been applying to other television jobs elsewhere? The news network that I’m at has a parent company that has a ton of television opportunities in entertainment and animation. I’ve been applying to jobs on their career site. Is it a bad look that I’m already applying? Im going to stick it out here for the time being but I don’t want to be stuck doing a position that I’m not enjoying. Life is too short for that.

How should I be about going this? Just keep applying until a new opportunity presents itself? Should I stay here for at least 3 months? Or 6? I don’t want to leave on bad terms because the parent company has other divisions I’m interested in. Any advice or insight would be appreciated :)"

I've been at this place for 5 yrs., and it was bittersweet. However, when two of the staff came to talk about what to do after we get our transcripts, they talked about trying to find some places to work at. 

At the time, they were listing a job posting for the center (but it turned out to be outdated.). Despite this, I was curious about it, and reached out to one of them. I thought I would normally have to wait for a couple of years before records get outdated/audited (or something like that), but they said: 

* ""There is really no specific amount time listed any of the ethical codes. I think it could be helpful to think about the implications of working on a team with therapists you have seen before. ""

I can't remember exactly what I asked afterwards to my counselor, since my last sessions were in May, but I think it was along the lines of ""doing what was best for me."" I know that for my internship, if I were to apply there, I would have to go to another place for counseling--which I'm glad I kept, cause the year was a doozy. It sounds good on paper, but to me, it sounds like a dual relationship taboo, especially since both my therapist and psychiatrist are there.  

Despite how much I would like to work with my counselor, this seems wrong. Then again, I am reconsidering whether I should go into this field, so in the end, it might not even matter.

I struggled a lot to find my first dev job. I never got an internship. I applied for tons of job openings only to be rejected. I very luckily got my first job as a developer.

Now about my job - I have been at my first job for about half a year now. My teammates are fantastic. They are friendly, supportive, and helpful.

I do not feel competent at my job. I feel like I am always falling behind. When my teammates are discussing all the issues that have popped up or the work that they have been doing, I just cannot follow along. I keep losing attention. I lose the thread of what is being discussed. How much ever I try I just cannot fully understand what is being discussed as a team. The work that I am assigned has to be overly descriptive with detailed instructions or I have to ask others multiple times for explanations of what, why, where, and how things need to be done. I am also always doing easier tasks compared to my teammates.

You might wonder if I have ADHD - no I don't. I have never been diagnosed. Neither do I have any other characteristics/symptoms of ADHD.

My anxiety and introversion also do not help. I do not come off as friendly because of this nature of mine.

Now, I wouldn't consider myself too dumb either. I can code most easy and medium-level leetcode questions by myself (might not be the most elegant and optimal solutions). I have been relatively studious and done fairly well in school and college. I know that's not saying much and I know that skills do not transfer to being a good developer.

So, do you think a tech career is cut out for me? Can I be a decent developer? Have any of you had similar issues and how did you overcome them?"

vx4c8w,0,2022-07-12,What job do you think I’ll end up in,[deleted],findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/vx4c8w/what_job_do_you_think_ill_end_up_in/,"I have a job internship for the first time in my life, at a sailing camp in my city. I actually like it so far, largely bc it’s actually more or less outdoors (even though obviously it can be easy to get dehydrated.) I know we definitely don’t get sunshine year round, but for me personally it can really boost my mood :) 

I help out w small tasks and today helped lead the kids, sort of, just on walks (which I actually liked even though I felt one or two probably didn’t like me lol, I j kinda wanna be a mom one day I think.) I found that writing an email was harder than I expected only due to the specific criteria my manager wanted at times. I like waking up for it now even though I hate getting up early partly bc it doesn’t feel terribly “hard” (I feel I can handle a challenge but) and my supervisor seems nice enough (fake but nice.)

I’ve hung out w 2 ppl in the past week at the park… and smthn I was reflecting on today, whilst also reflecting on how happy I am in spite of how much my brother has changed due to the drugs that he seems to be getting help now… is that part of the reason as to why I’m so depressed year round is due to lack of healthy socialization and also that I feel like I have never just fully prioritized “enjoying” myself.

I tend to be more depressed during winter, I think. Summer, particularly this yr, is when I feel happiest 

Like I feel like I know how to follow tasks and I’m technically introverted and am generally good abt being consistent, but I feel like I spent so many yrs worried abt college (j to choose to start at community) when I should have been enjoying my youth, trying to make friends (but then I remembered that sometimes in the past it j hasn’t been that easy… even as recently as this yr. I don’t have “good social skills” but tbh some ppl j don’t act like they are interested in friendship) 

I find the subject matter of nursing interesting, I know I rlly want to help people. It would honestly probably be unhealthy for me to have a job where I couldn’t rlly socialize at all. I also find psychology and mental health interesting 

I’m not the “assertive” type but do value having a work ethic and like to be consistent abt my work 

I deal w depression but am working on getting better abt managing it. I don’t think I do great w big changes (I can handle it but change tends to sort of stress me out, not entirely but it can.)  

I can have trouble w ppl not liking me and wanting the validation or approval of others. I’m j being honest here.

My enneagram is 6w5. My family has been having financial problems more recently (my mom refuses to get the vaccine mandate and therefore quit her job as a social worker. She has been working online and crying abt it bc the computer keeps shutting down in the middle of it… she’s an ESFJ.) 

I feel like I am relatively self aware in general, I feel like crying almost daily due to my brother’s predicament (I’ve j realized how depressed he must have been growing up, he’s in rehab) - I have j noticed how generational trauma has really negatively impacted my family.

I’m also noticing how much I tend to focus on validation from others, to a point where I’ve cried even recently abt ppl unfollowing or blocking me on Instagram (but I’ve been realizing that it rlly doesn’t matter that much, actually… at all. That I’m young and nothing I tend to worry abt will matter when I’m an adult. I’m starting to regret having spent so many years depressed and stressed out.) 

I promised myself abt an hr ago that I will make an effort to save up enough money to move out of my state

I was also sort of reflecting on why I can be so inclined to be cynical or pessimistic, and what I realized is that it’s partly a way that I sort of became when I was younger due to “feeling” a lot? 

Like I remember being a bit cold toward my brother and regret it (I was partly this way bc my dad favored me) as now that he is in rehab and I am older and I have become more self aware abt the family’s generational trauma I’ve realized that my own emotional abuse toward him was horrendous. I’ve realized that I was just not helping someone who’s as already going down a bad path.

- BCA (Bachelor of Computer Applications), 2021 - 8.74/10 from a tier 2 university. (3 year undergrad).
- Pursuing a 1 yr PG Diploma in CS &amp; AI from IIIT Delhi (Online). CGPA till now - 10/10
- Completed summer courses on Machine Learning and Data Analytics and relevant projects from IIT Kanpur.

GRE : 323 (161Q/162V);
TOEFL: 114

Work Experience: 2 yrs (at the time of matriculation) as Associate Engineer at one of the Big Four as an AWS resource. AWS CCP and AWS Solutions Architect - Associate Certified. Hopefully will get Terrqform Associate in a month too.

Projects: 2 Machine Learning focussed. 2 on Analysis/Visualisation. At least 3 more in progress based on Machine Learning and Visualisation.

No research papers.

Extracurriculars: Was part of the Core team of a departmental group that organised annual college fests in undergrad. Head technical editor for the only technical magazine of my undergrad university (published articles on trending topics such as Big Data quarterly on the uni's intranet). Other volunteering experiences such as NSS. Part of Rotaract club.

LORs: Hopefully from the professors of my pg diploma or my iit kanpur course professors, and my current manager, if required.

Looking to apply for MS in CS programs and MS IS (Information Systems) and MS IM (Information Management), with AI/ML/DS specialisations, if available. Open to universities in USA, UK and Canada.

Couple of questions that I have-

a) Would my studies as 3yrs+1yrs affect my application negatively even if they fulfill most USA unis 4yr undergrad criteria? Same question for unis of UK and Canada.

b) Whom should I approach first for the LORs? From my pg diploma (iiit delhi) or summer courses (iit kanpur). And would having an LOR from my manager who is from the USA be beneficial or not?

c) Should I give GRE again? I'm aware my marks in quant are lower than general for CS, but GRE is optional for a lot of unis. So how much weightage would they give it given my profile? Would better marks make my chances better given that I have a 3 yr undergrad?

d) Is doing 1 yr masters in the US worth it? Or it it too difficult to find a job afterwards since we don't get an opportunity to do an summer internship?

e) How helpful are certifications like Amazon Web Services (AWS) or terraform in th application?

f) How are the job prospects in the UK and Canada for cloud, ML and DS?

g) Would doing a specific masters like MS AI or MS DS restrict job opportunities a lot?

I have started shortlisting universities since a couple of days and the ones I have so far are (these are not ranked or categorises as reach, moderate and safe right now so bear with me please)-

1. MSc. CS, Oxford (just because)
2. MS IM, UWashington
3. MCS, UIUC
4. MIM &amp; MS IS, UMaryland- CollegePark
5. MS CS, UBuffalo (SUNY)
6. MS IS, Northwestern
7. MS IS, NYU
8. MS IS, UT Austin
9. MS IS, UPittsburgh
10. MS IS, Northeastern
11. MS CS, ASU

Will probably apply to around 15-18 programs overall, and wanted to understand where I stand so thati shortlist programs according to that.

Many companies came to my college, looking for interns, they have eligibility criteria i.e. More than 60% in 10th and 12th grade, and More than 70% in Engineering without any backlogs. 


I have 85% in my 10th and 75% in engineering.


I am not called for interviews because my 12th-grade percentage was 54%.

For me I thought this was easy at first until I noticed that the input from the main program was a string like '98765' and not a list like [9, 8, 7, 6, 5].  What I tried was converting the string first to an array before calling the sort function, and then returning back a string containing the values of the sorted array.

It was working with quicksort and bubblesort but not with mergesort; the sorting was working up until the final sorting stage (sorting the two final sorted arrays) the sorting just kinda messed up. Final output looked like the inner sorting didn't work and it just swapped the two big arrays. Program was working as well when the input was an array and not a string.

Any insights to what might be wrong? I'm worried I might not be selected for the internship because of my wrong mergesort impementation. Any reply will be appreciated."

I am a veteran. I am in my 30s.  After the service I went to college for cyber. In undergrad I couldn’t afford to get an internship for various reasons. I graduated during the pandemic and lost the 2 full time offers I had. It took me 7 months to land an entry level admin job. Before landing the position I would go to online recruiting events held by government contractors but they would only respond to people who have a security clearance. Since I live in the DC metro area most of the cyber jobs are government related and require a clearance. I gave up looking for a cyber position once I landed a job. 

I’m worried since I can’t get an afford to get an internship since I have a family and bills, I will end up not not receiving a full time offer after graduating. 

Since this is a post bacc program, a lot of us are doing this program as a second chance at landing a dream job. Is there anyone out there that has graduated but couldn’t land a job after?"

I'm trying to select the optimal MATH sequence (my university has 3 different math sequences after calc 1,2) for my future aspirations. 

Specifically, I'm currently wanting to work on future shaping (consumer) products in the industry, either in research or engineering / eng management roles. The CS/ECE fields that currently interest me the most are: Computer Vision, graphics, AR (software and hardware), smartphones, wearables, computer architecture, safe AI/security. Basically, I want to work on consumer products and something that is visual (not purely theoretical), but I do not want to be a typical SWE working on like the comment feature in an app.

Since I've heard math can be really important in certain CS fields I am not sure which sequence to choose:

1. engineering math sequence which focuses on applications (not focus on proofs that much) and is divided into multi calc and linear algebra. Does multi in 3 dimensions. (workload: \~8 h/w) This is the normal sequence for eng college.
2. arts&amp;sciences sequence: lin algebra and multi combined and distributed to 2 classes and covers multi in N dimensions (workload: \~8h/week)
3. theoretical math sequence: lin algebra and multi combined, 2 classes (workload: 20 h/week). Focuses a lot on proofs and developing mathematical maturity.

**The questions:** which sequence do you think I should take? is the extra workload worth it for the theoretical class given the areas I'm interested in? Could I learn the extra math needed in higher level classes?

*PS: I'm planning to join a project team in the fall, apply to internship and either do research during the summer or in the second semester or year.*

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for your advice!"
vxfj9c,7,2022-07-12,How difficult is it to get a new grad SWE role with one internship?,herfailure,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/vxfj9c/how_difficult_is_it_to_get_a_new_grad_swe_role/,"It's a pretty good internship at a private SaaS company in SF (worth $10B, don't know if this part is relevant). I should also mention I go to a ""T5 CS school"" but am an average student. Please assume average projects &amp; GPA, tech club involvement, no awards.

I can basically do another internship if I take 3 more semesters of college (must return to school after summer '23 internship), or I can graduate in 2 semesters without an internship if I get a new grad role after school ends (a job that begins summer/fall '23 onwards).

How much more difficult is it to gun for a new grad SWE roles with 1 internship rather than the standard 2? I prefer to save on tuition and rent and finish school, since working this internship made me realize how comfortable and less intensive work is when working in industry compared to school."

3. Fencing (5 days/week at most, fluctuates, 2019-present): not many comments to be made, I kinda just went yk. Tho i might be able to add on by developing an app/website that the club is in desperate need of alsjldhs

3. AP Eng/Sem Teacher (6/10): Taught 2 classes, so knows me pretty well, was pretty good in eng, not so much in sem, but hopefully it was good enough? (This ones mostly for the schools that don't take CS cuz it's not a core subject)
4. Guidance Counsellor (7/10): Always talking w her/booking meetings, not much to say but I think it'll be ok

ESSAYS HAHHAAAAA... I haven't started. I think I'll be ok tho since writing about ourselves in a semi-causal tone was literally all of eng class so 7/10?

&amp;#x200B;

**Schools:**

CMU BCSA - ED &lt;----- I'm kinda scared for this one cuz there's a risk that I'll just end up in their arts school so maybe SCS im not rly sure;;;

University of North Carolina Chapel Hill (whys the name so damn long), + most of the ivys, U o f T, Waterloo, (if theres any other schools that might be good,, lemme know hahhhh)

vxftgt,1,2022-07-12,is my boss dodging on giving me the raise he promised a month ago ?,alltheluck_chaotic,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/vxftgt/is_my_boss_dodging_on_giving_me_the_raise_he/,"hello hello !

my current position is my longest running job so far , three years . i make 16$ right now , with my last raise being in july 2021 . i had asked my boss if i can have a raise in may 2022 , as i do a lot of things at work , ranging from field repair to document control to engineering and development . i've even managed to fish him out of legal trouble at least twice , and i'm the most senior in my department - yet i'm paid the least .

for brevity's sake , this was while my role was more that of a quality assurance and manufacturing technician .

i received my first writeup two weeks ago . it was a bit of a mess - yes , i did make a mistake in a product i had built . the mistake stemmed from my tool being buggy - when i used it's ""test"" feature the tool overwrote a value to default . usually i notice it immediately , go back , and change it back to the actual value , but in this case i didn't , and a faulty product left the floor . \[ edit : after this writeup , i went to that tool dev and asked him to fix that issue right away - it was in his queue but , queues . . . \]

that said , the mistake was something that could be fixed remotely if a small cord was sent out . i don't really understand still , but my boss sent out a technician and overnight-sent new components instead of sending a cable , costing him around 2000$ . i wasn't told there even was an issue until after this had happened - if i was , i would have suggested to send the cable and offered to do it myself , since the mistake is genuinely that easy to fix .

is it bad that i made the mistake at all ? yes , of course . however, this 2000$ nonsense didn't need to happen , and only happened because 1) he didn't know that it could be fixed that easily , or 2) the customer ""wanted to see the factory fix it"" . he jumped from 1 to 2 after i explained that it could have been fixed with the cable . \[the phrase in 2 is only in quotes since that's what he said , and i don't know what it means . i asked but he just ignored that . we're not really a factory , and the tech he sent doesn't actually work in the building - wouldn't it have been better to do the cable anyway if they wanted the factory/manufacturer (me) to fix it ?\]

today , i went to talk to him about the promise he made in may , and he brought up this writeup . i explained my case that the writeup was objectionable for the above reasons , and he kept changing the reason i was written up . initially it was since i cost him 2000$ , then it was negligence with the programming , then it was that i didn't follow last year's testing procedure - i only followed this year's procedure since it was the latest one .

then he said that i have actually sent out several faulty machines and he just didn't tell me about it , and that i was responsible for a former intern sending out faulty machines - though , at the time of the second event , i was on my ""off-week"" and my coworker was in charge of the intern .

this is what's been rubbing me the wrong way the most , in addition to the above . is that a thing ? i don't think that , one , i'm responsible for that intern when i'm not even truly the manager , and two , that i should have something denied because of something he never mentioned to me until now .

another edit : i don't really trust my boss to keep true to pretty much any of his promises as of late - he's been paying new-hires 20$+ , tried to convince me that my last raise was actually 3 months ago when it wasn't \[it's recorded in the pay logs...\] , and tried to convince me that he didn't actually do that . when i last went in to talk to him , i had my phone recording the audio of our conversation , is this wrong ? of course i'm not going to post it anywhere , but it's more for my own sanity when he tries this again , since i think he will ."

vxhjk3,10,2022-07-12,Grad School Application Resume,Sudden-Response-4058,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/vxhjk3/grad_school_application_resume/,"Folks,

Can a grad school application resume go beyond 1 page or do we have to restrict it to one page for the better readability as it would be quickly reviewed?

Also, what is that the person who would be reviewing the resume or more particularly professor be intrested to know from the resume? Is it the skills? 

Because, my story would already be in the SoP.

I am thinking to add the following sections to the resume:
1) Undergraduate degree, University name, GPA 
2) Relevant courses 
3) Work experience including internship 
4) Projects
5) Skills (more specifically tech stacks which I know)
6) Leadership/extracurricular
7) achievements

Note: 
1) I'm having an experience of around 2 year's apart from the intership.
2) Would be applying to Masters in CS.

Any tips/suggestions based on the above details?


Best regards,
Stark"

I can’t also secure any other roles as I don’t have experience or skills. I have been here for 9 months whilst other people are getting promoted after being in their roles for less than 4 months, I see myself stuck and I have not had any luck. I feel like I’m wasting my time. Whilst I was interested in finding a role in cloud or devops. I cannot see this happening.

I was very excited at first to get my foot through the door and rushed to find classes/courses to meet their requirements. So far most classes I find online are bootcamps that are 5-10 months long and cover all 3 major cloud services aws, gcp and azure. And after some more research it seems that aws is more in demand. So I’m trying to decide if I should focus on one azure or aws or just learn all 3 and be a jack of all trades but master of none.

I’m not one to make long posts like this but I do not have peers IRL that are in this field. Summary at the end if you don’t want to read the novel.

Just a little backstory to understand where I am coming from and why I’m posting in the first place:

I was an audio engineer/producer/in bands for over a decade focusing mainly on mastering but did mixing and some recording as well. Even though I worked my absolute ass off, got as many clients as possible, and was constantly networking, which did lead to moderate success, it didn’t change the fact that it’s a niche industry that is ironically quite over saturated making it unsustainable as a solo gig as I had to supplement income by working 3-4 nights in a kitchen. Combine that with other issues like losing my studio (long story involving being fucked over by someone), my band breaking up, and having to file for a consumer proposal, amongst other bullshit that was going on in my life with a general loss in love for making music and dealing with artists as clients, I decided to call it quits in 2019, which In retrospect was a great decision given how COVID really fucked things up for the music industry.

So like a lot of people at that time,

and even before covid, I had an interest in coding and wanted to shift careers anyway, so I looked into coding Bootcamps as I wanted to get in the industry the quickest way possible, however, I was immediately turned off, not only because they seem to pigeonhole you into web dev, they remind me of the same audio engineering/music production “schools” that were popping up around the 2008-2014 bedroom producer era, promising a career but also not elaborating on the difficulty of actually getting you a foot in the door.

Thankfully I never went to said schools and took the self-taught route for audio, which inspired me to take the same route for programming since audio (especially when working with windows) forced you to be computer savvy and I just developed a general love for computers and tech. I decided to do App Academy Open because research said web is the lowest barrier to entry, did the intro to programming which went well, but then the next module had a huge spike in difficulty and asked a ton of Logic-based questions (which were not web-related) that I just could not wrap my head around, which, at the time, made me feel incredibly discouraged.

Since I was not that into web dev any way and have way more interest in games/graphics/ML/AI/digital audio, I decided that I needed more fundamental logic skills and training and wanted to take the school route instead, so I started to upgrade my high school math and work towards my GED so that I could get into the 2 year co-op diploma program at BCIT in Vancouver.

One thing to not if it isn’t already obvious is that I am a high school drop out and my whole life I NEVER was good in school and in general just had a Fucked up upbringing, but to my luck, I dont just excel at math I also really ENJOY it and am sitting at a 95% average in PRE-CALC. At this time, I decided to also simultaneously learn web dev from a different set of courses alongside my math since I heard that school does not really teach programming, and I did manage to finish the HTML/CSS course and built a responsive web page, as well as a few simple games in pure C++ and unreal from Udemy courses, however, this quickly was proving itself to be impractical and inefficient, as I was and still am working 40+ hours a week, and trying to code in the evening after an 8 hour shift and 2-3 hours of math in the morning is exhausting. I decided to stop a few months ago to focus on finishing math just to get it over with since i will be finished upgrading by fall.

Things were going well and Doing math with some programming was very empowering and made me infinitely more confident about my intelligence, but unfortunately, poor financial luck has recently struck again, long story short because of CERB related issues here in Canada (not to mention our government shit financial management but I digress) I now owe the government 4k on top on my remaining consumer proposal payments, which has basically fucked over my plans to start school in the fall as I need to get a second job, and, the 2 year program is no longer viable as it’s full time and made very clear in the program that having a full time job, let alone 2, will compromise your school work. There is a part time program that has pretty much no barrier to entry but it’s pay per course, and with the average price being 5-700 dollars it’s significantly more expensive than the 2 year diploma.

To add salt to the wound, coincidentally about a week after finding out this news, I ran into an old freind who basically did the self taught web journey and got their foot in the door in only a year as a front end dev, then I shit you not a couple days later, ANOTHER freind who did a Bootcamp and now basically intern with good pay at a start up. Combine this with recession paranoia and hearing about hiring freezes In the industry, I practically had a mental breakdown because I feel as if the last 2 years has been a huge waste of time learning math when I should have just bit the bullet and put all my focus into programming, but even if I drop math now and focus of front end, the industry is saturated as fuck with junior devs now racing to get a bite at the tit, and, I still know I won’t feel as full-filled in web as being in The other aforementioned fields of interest.

This is when I finally ask, god forbid, has ANYONE been in a situation like this? Do any senior devs out there have any advice of what path that is relatively LOW RISK an insolvent 35 year old with very little time and money but a huge interest for math, games, 3d graphics, ML/AI, digital audio should take? Is it even possible to find a career that intersects of all these fields that you can attain SELF TAUGHT or will I have to work 2 jobs for 2-3 years to pay for school? (keep in mind I am insolvent and can’t take out a loan/ my family has no money as my parents are dead bears and one is an ex addict)? Should I just bite the bullet and learn web dev in whatever free time I have while working 2 jobs just to get my foot in the door or should I focus on passion and interests? Are there even transferable skills for people who have 10 years of audio experience into programming? I know it’s a lot of questions but this is my Hail Mary at this point and I feel so beyond fucked by things I can’t control.

Any advice of any kind would be amazing and thank you so much for reading all of this if you did.

Summary of everything in question form

I’m 35, an ex-audio engineer/producer that has very little money or means to get anymore than I make (I work 40+ hours a week), I am insolvent and ridden with government/consumer debt and need a better career via the self-taught coding path that is relatively low risk and TIME EFFICIENT that is optimally not web dev to get out of this hell I am in so I can make the life I want for myself and my GF. If it takes 2 years or more THATS FINE, if the learning is difficult THATS FINE. I don’t need to know what language does what for what as I have done all that research, I just need to know what the path of least resistance (not in difficulty but in terms of time and money) that is not web dev related into, a career in software engineering, I can’t waste my time again like I feel I did with learning math first to get into school which I can no longer do because of being fucked over by the government.

&amp;#x200B;

\* what are the possible 100% self-taught paths that are not Web dev related that I can take that align with my interests? (Games/game engines/3d graphics/ML/AI/Digital audio). Remember loans and school are not an option now it has to work 100% self-taught.

&amp;#x200B;

\* is game development actually as shitty as everyone says even if I focus on the engine/audio programming and not the design aspect? I have a strong interest but again I am not willing to take a huge risk to get into a career that supposedly pays shit and has long hours only to be potentially laid off is a project doesn’t work.

&amp;#x200B;

\* Does anyone else go from audio engineering to programming? Are there even jobs in audio/programming that are lucrative and not super niche? Since I have over a decade in this field I am hoping there are some kind of transferable skills from audio to programming.

&amp;#x200B;

\* school is not a viable option in the near future so should I bother with math even with my skills? Where can they take me from a self-taught perspective? Can you even get into graphics/ML/AI without a PhD?"

They didn’t even tell me how long the interview will be. I have taught myself to be language agnostic and will commit myself to learning whatever is needed ASAP but I am afraid I won’t be able to pass their interview.

Also, I got to school in a small town with non-existent tech scene so this is probably the only shot I have at an internship. (My school does not offer Co-op)

I know C++, some Java and Python and familiar with data structures but that’s about it.

I’m 35, an ex-audio engineer/producer that has very little money or means to get anymore than I make (I work 40+ hours a week), I am insolvent and ridden with government/consumer debt and need a better career via the self-taught coding path that is relatively low risk and TIME EFFICIENT that is optimally not web dev to get out of this hell I am in so I can make the life I want for myself and my GF. If it takes 2 years or more THATS FINE, if the learning is difficult THATS FINE. I don’t need to know what language does what for what as I have done all that research, I just need to know what the path of least resistance (not in difficulty but in terms of time and money) that is not web dev related into, a career in software engineering, I can’t waste my time again like I feel I did with learning math first to get into school which I can no longer do because of being fucked over by the government.

* what are the possible 100% self-taught paths that are not Web dev related that I can take that align with my interests? (Games/game engines/3d graphics/ML/AI/Digital audio). Remember loans and school are not an option now it has to work 100% self-taught.
* is game development actually as shitty as everyone says even if I focus on the engine/audio programming and not the design aspect? I have a strong interest but again I am not willing to take a huge risk to get into a career that supposedly pays shit and has long hours only to be potentially laid off is a project doesn’t work.
* Does anyone else go from audio engineering to programming? Are there even jobs in audio/programming that are lucrative and not super niche? Since I have over a decade in this field I am hoping there are some kind of transferable skills from audio to programming.
* school is not a viable option in the near future so should I bother with math even with my skills? Where can they take me from a self-taught perspective? Can you even get into graphics/ML/AI without a PhD?"

Also, is there something where someone can't be considered for both simultaneously (like should I wait for the AWS application to come out if I'd rather be considered for that?)

vxq24c,1,2022-07-12,Which type of internship is better? One where you work on actual company code base or where you develop proof of concepts?,royalopera,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/vxq24c/which_type_of_internship_is_better_one_where_you/,"Hi Everyone!

I have a few internship options for the fall. The first type are those where you get to work similar to a full time person and contribute to the actual company product by completing tasks assigned regularly. (Data science, software eng .net stack, mobile dev)

The second type is in the R&amp;D department of the company where you get to create Proof of Concept applications which are creative but the scope is not defined properly and may end up doing different stuff every couple of months if the upper management does not accept it.

I am currently a senior so I want to choose an option where I have more chances of obtaining a full time offer later once I graduate.

Throughout high school, most of my ECs have been CS based and point to me being a CS major in college. However, I have realized that I don't think I would enjoy a career in CS. I don't hate coding, but I can't imagine it being my career. I am open to minoring in it though. I am much more interested in doing mechanical or aerospace engineering. The more I think about it the more I realize that I've always wanted to do engineering but peers/parents/others have always pushed me to CS bc I'm pretty good at it and CS majors make more money. 

Looking at my ECs, I should probably apply as a CS major. However, I'm def much more interested in engineering. Now I am worried that I've wasted my high school years in ECs for a career I probably will regret and not enjoy and I'll be left wondering what my life could have been if I pursued engineering. But then again CS is a stable career path and I could prob eventually get into aerospace with it by becoming a SWE it wld just take longer.

Now I am debating whether or not I should apply as a CS or Engineering major. I'm worried that if I apply as an engineering major, colleges wont like it bc it doesn't go w my ECs and I will end up getting rejected more. Also they might see it as me trying to apply to a less selective major just to transfer and ""get in through the back door"" bc CS is rly competitive for asians (engineering prob is too, but i think less so). 

Should I apply as a mechanical/aerospace engineering major or stick with a CS major?

Need help and advice.",idsjoe,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vxv8w0/hi_new_here_need_help_and_advice/," Hello, I am from India. I am about to graduate high school, and I wanna work for a software company in the future. The only way to achieve that in India is to do engineering, most preferably in computer science or IT. So, you know how Americans have the SATs to get into colleges? In India we have JEE, and a bunch of other entrance exams, in which, unlike SATs, they test your Math, Chemistry *and* Physics in one single paper of 3 hours. I really don't know why I require chemistry for software engineering, but anyway, I'm shit at chemistry. I'm decent at physics and good at mathematics. So, understandably, I couldn't get into the big daddy colleges \[Tier-1\] (Harvard/Oxford equivalent in India). But fortunately I was able to get in a good \[Tier-2\] college. So in this particular college, good companies like Microsoft, Wipro, Amazon etc. regularly come to offer in-campus placements, and the college is supportive as well. The only concern is that they don't really teach you programming at a high level, so you're on your own for placements and to boost your programming skills. Some of the languages that they teach are C, C++, Java, MATLAB and Python, in that order.

Though I've been exceptionally busy for the past two years preparing for entrance exams, I did not take CSE as an elective in high school. But, I did try to learn coding and programming, and I know the basics of C. I love the endless possibilities programming provides, and honestly, it's the present and future job to do in India, alongside with machine learning and A.I. I want to learn programming, because I'm rather well-versed when it comes to computers, and always wonder how certain things work.

So, finally coming to the point, sorry for so much background info lol, talking to some people studying in this college, they have made it clear that this college provides you a good opportunity to get placed in a good company, but you have to do the hard work and learn coding yourself at a higher level, participate in hackathons, test your skills regularly, get internships, paid or unpaid in the 3rd year of college etc. So I'll be having a 1-1.5 month break in 15-20 days, and apart from relaxing, I wanna learn how to code, for free(My parents are paying for my college, so I don't wanna take their more of their money). The first language I wanna learn is C, and if reddit could kindly guide me how to go about learning C, and coding in general, from which websites, YouTube channels etc, I'd be honored.

Thank You."

I started my internship like 5 weeks back.Manager has no clue of what’s going on and is on PTO since the past 2 weeks (would be returning next week) . Mentor is some architecht level guy who has no clue of the tech stack I am working on (its JS and React,he is a Java/Kotlin guy) and he is not even part of my manager’s team(he is under the same org as my manager and both report to the same person) . He fricking asks me to do stuff which is not even doable in the given time frame which is like 3 weeks more(judging by the domain knowledge I have and the application he is asking me to make) So he asked me to make an API authoring tool like [stoplight.io]just coz it costs 225$ per person if the company tries to get a license . 

Initially I was freaking out as to how I am gonna go about building it , the first 2-3 weeks were real bad as even the UI design was on me(he was like use that stoplight application as a reference and build it) but the form itself was so complex but somehow i made it . Also there’s no code review or anything with a senior engineer , not that I am writing bad code but its just that maybe we can do X stuff in a better way . Furthermore [stoplight.io] in its own is such a complex application itself and I am overwhelmed/surprised that my mentor wants me to build it all alone . 

Honestly I don’t think I will be able to build it in like the next 3 weeks (I will try my best no doubt but still its very complicated for me and i am overwhelmed by it) . I am concerned about my mid internship review and FTE , I wonder on what basis my manager would decide on taking me for FT, It would be very very unfair if he would go to my mentor and ask as it would not even make sense .I wrote so much , struggled my way through and build whatever has been done till now. Manager is managing interns for the first time in his career(he himself said that and i can see that now) , until now there have been no one on one’s . I feel its not fair to give such a huge task to an intern and it seems like the mentor did not research what issues could be faced , how does that application work and stuff.

Everyday I feel anxious and stressed out . l feel overworked too . Any advices would be really helpful."

One of these companies is Microsoft, to which I applied to a SWE Summer 2023 internship, and completed an OA that I thought was extremely easy compared to what I have been studying for Leet Code, the questions and my approaches to them are as following - I know this is long, but to be honest I need help, but I just don't understand where I went wrong! (Received rejection email this morning)

1. The first one was a debugging question. A function was shown that is supposed to sum up all of the elements in an array and return this sum, however it is broken, and we can change up one line of code to make it work as is intended. The code was something like this:


def arraySum(nums):

     res = 0
     for i in range(1,len(nums)):
           res += nums[i]
   
    return res 


I stated that the issue came from the fact that when we declare the for loop, we are not adding the first element of the list to res because of how we set up the range function. I changed it to range(nums). I didn't do a null check as we are only allowed to modify one line of code. I am highly uncertain that if I completely goofed one of the questions, that this one is it. Or maybe it's just so simple I'm missing out on something crucial.


2. The second one was a debugging question that was a little bit more involved, but still simple enough after thinking through it, I think, for about five minutes. The function is intended to return whether or not if for some list we pass in, and an integer K, if the sub list 1,...K, exists in the list, given that the list is sorted. The code looked something like this:

def func_name(A,k)
     
     for i in range(len(nums)-1):
        if A[i] + 1 &gt; A[i+1]:
              return False

      if A[0] != 1 and A[len(A)-1] != k:
             return False
       
      return True

We were allowed to make modifications to two lines of code to fix this function.

I found the first problem to be with the first if statement in the for loop. That comparison is only relevant for values that are in between 1 and K, so I added that A[i] &gt;= 1 and A[i] &lt;= K-1
(I explained more in the actual comments of the code)

I found the second problem to be with the last if statement, as there can be values less than 1 and greater than K, and if A is sorted, then 1,...K can still exist in A. So given A is sorted, I said that if the first element is greater than one or if the last element is greater than K, then 1,...,K cannot possibly exist in A, as if A is sorted and the first element is greater than one, then of course 1,...,K is not there - and the same logic applies to if the maximum element is less than K (I don't say ""not there"" in the code comments, I delve into it)


3. For the third question we had to write a function, where given an integer N that is between one and 100 inclusive, we must return an array that sums to 0. For this question I first dedicated the first N-1 steps to 1,...,N-1, then in to get the sum of this array I didn't want to use a for loop, or use the sum() function, so I plugged in N-1 into the Gaussian sum formula, and the resulting algebra calculated the sum each time. Then I add the negative of that sum as the last result, resulting in O(n) time and space complexity

4. This one I kind of blundered and I think has the maximum chance of the one that cost me the interview. We had to implement a button in angular that can increase the count on a header tag. First, we had to assign a class to an associated h2 tag and the button that will be controlling the count displayed. I commented that I don't know angular, but tried to do
My best on the question by reading angular documentation, actually on my resume I specifically mention I'm well versed in the PERN tech stack. 
Of course I was able to assign the correct classes, but the event handler written in java script that was to increment the count did not work.

The first three questions took me thirty minutes, and then I used the remaining one hour and 40 minutes on the last one, going through the documentation and trying to make something work.

Originally my comments on all of the Python questions were detailed and rather long, but then I went back and made them a bit more concise, realizing that a recruiter will not read such long comments. I think maybe though the fourth question is what got me - maybe it raised some red flags for then that I spent so long on it and that I was trying to cheat?

I would be fine if the issue is with the fourth question, because I understand what went wrong, but im just scared maybe I also bombed one of the first three Python questions - and if I did, then it's concerning because I really don't know if I did anything wrong with them, and am confident I did not"

I have been interested in software development and programming and hence decided to take up this major. However, I'm not quite sure what CS majors typically apply to/get involved in, in terms of internships/extracurriculars like hackathons/any conferences/other programs that CS majors tend to pursue to further their interest? I'm just trying to gauge what sort of side projects or anything other than academics do CS majors do in order to get practical exposure to this field.  

Also, what's a good place to start looking for internships? Any resume building tips for applying to CS internships? How do people usually find opportunities for interning at tech firms? And when is a good time to start looking for one? Say for the summer or the academic year? 

Any insights/comments/advise would be great. Thanks in advance!"
vxxcj5,1,2022-07-13,Do you think university clubs/organizations are worth it?,safaribrowserram,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vxxcj5/do_you_think_university_clubsorganizations_are/,"By  this I mean clubs that have an entire application process to join. I  applied to a few and spent a lot of time on the take-home assignments  they gave, but I still got rejected. This happened twice in the past two  semesters. Both times, I thought I did very well and I made sure to  include comments where necessary and write documentation to explain my  thought process. I also have decent side projects and have done two  internships, so I honestly thought I would get in considering I do have  some experience.

But after being  rejected twice, I wonder if it's worth spending all the time writing the  application responses (short essay style questions) and doing the take  home assignment. I am currently doing an internship for the experience  and I mainly wanted to join a club for meeting other people in the same  major and making friends.

I might  be completely wrong about this, but it does seem to me that a whole lot  of beginners. One of the club I applied to hosted a ""meet the team  members"" event. Majority of the people in club were beginners before the  joined and they even said they hadn't coded anything other than hello  world. This is a club that mainly works on web and data science  projects, so I'd assume that they'd want people with a bit of experience  at least. They did say that the most important trait they look for in  applicants is ""drive"" and the ""hunger to learn"". They do make the take  home assignment considerably easier for people with no experience, but  for those with experience, we had to build an entire mini web project  (frontend only) that communicates with an API.

So  back to the question, do clubs make a difference if you have some  internship experience? Would you suggest trying to apply again next year  or spend the time working on personal projects instead?"

The day of my 13th birthday I was awoken at 3.33am by my dog growling at my bedroom window. I got out of bed and looked out and there he was. The man on the lawn.

 

Stood in a pair of white briefs, his throat cut, face ghastly white, starting intently at me from the garden below. At first, I rubbed my eyes sleepily, I moved my head to the side, as did the man, copying my movement. His bright blue eyes gleamed in the nightlight. Panic set in I screamed and ran to my parents’ room. “Mum!!!” “Dad!!!” I shouted. “There’s a man outside!!!”

 

My father jumped out of bed bat in hand and ran to my window. “Where?” he asked. I told him what I saw, and I saw his face look confused. He went down to check. He came back and said there was nobody there.

The gate was locked and the fence far to high for him to have scaled it so quickly.

“You were just dreaming,” said my mother. Too much “cake and ice cream,” laughed my Dad.

Go back to sleep. I got back into bed and stayed awake for the rest of the night. At 5.30am I got up and snuck a peak outside. There was nobody there. Perhaps I really had been dreaming.

 

Over the next few months, I learned to believe what I had seen was in fact just a dream, a bit of teasing from my parents but life stayed the same until it was time for my 14th birthday.

 

3.33am I awoke with a start, my dog clearly agitated and staring at my bedroom window. I had forgotten all about the man, but as I pulled back the curtains. There he was. Even paler than before, his stare fixated on me, he looked the exact same only now wearing suit pants. I looked at his neck, blood gushed from the hole, and he seemed to have moved 5 yards closer than the previous year. Blood fell to the perfect lawn and splattered. I watched shaking from head to toe. He copied my exact movements then pointed a long finger at me.

“MUUUUUMMMM”!! “DAAAAADDDD!!” I screamed with tears in my eyes. They burst in and I turned away from him. “HE’S BACK!!!” “THERE!” “LOOK!”

 

I turned back to face the window and he’d gone. “But but but he was there! I saw the blood gush onto the grass” “Wait there,” said my father. I watched him check the garden and stand where he stood.

“No blood here babe, nice joke, one year on you got us with the same joke, ha ha very funny” said Dad sarcastically.

 

A year later I turned 15. I set my alarm for 3.30am. I was determined to get to see where he came from if he did show up. My heart thumped out of my chest. I waited and waited and waited. 3 minutes seemed like hours, I watched as a murmuration of birds took off and my gaze left the garden for a second to admire their beauty. I looked back and there he was. 10 yards further forward wearing a new item of clothing, this time black socks and blood-stained shoes. Once again I screamed to my parents. They came running and my father got cross with me.

“Look babe, this is getting ridiculous now.” A joke is a joke but this has gone to far he scolded me.

 

This would happen again on my 16th birthday 3.33am. A new item of clothing, this time a crisp white shirt. Blood all over the shirt. Moved further forward to the patio

 

17. 3.33am This time a blazer, he was by the front door looking upwards. I saw the hole in his neck, his blue eyes piercing me.

 

When I turned 18. At 3.33am I pulled back the curtains and he wasn’t there. I let out a sigh of relief and went back to bed. Maybe I had imagined it after all these years. As I got back into bed I heard a creak on the stairs. I made my way out of the room and peered down the stairs.

 

There he was. I screamed. He was fully dressed covered in blood pointing his finger at me, my screams woke my parents and I turned to see my Dad running from his room. I looked back at the man on the lawn and he’d gone.

I sobbed uncontrollably as my Dad berated me for making things up and watching to much T.V

 

That fall I started collage and the following spring I met my future husband. He was so handsome, he was an investment banker, an intern at the time, with dark blue eyes, and he dressed to impress. As my birthday approached I stayed in his home. I didn’t tell him about the man but at 3.33am I woke and turned all the lights on. My boyfriend didn’t wake. He stayed fast asleep. I checked the garden from his window above and checked the stairs. Nothing. He hadn’t come. I felt so much relief. It was finally over.

 

I write this now happy and content with my life. My husband and I married two years ago and I’ve not seen the man on the lawn since my 18th birthday. We live in a beautiful home, my husband’s suit is ready for the morning pressed and smart, his shoes are buffed and they’re like mirrors.

Excuse me for a moment, that was odd, my husband’s phone just rang three times. It’s his secretary. Strange she’d be calling so late. It’s 3.33am. No worries. I’ll ask him about it in the morning"

I have always been fascinated by the integration of so much computational power into very small chips. They have always been like little black mystery boxes that I wanted to put light onto them and learn all the designing, testing, and debugging processes takes to build them.

This is where it actually began and I first started learning microcontrollers and processors, getting familiar with how they work, how you program them, how you communicate with them and generally how they work. I got comfortable with high-level programming languages like C/CPP, and Phyton as well as low-level languages like Assembly language and learned the architecture of microcontrollers and microprocessors things as registers, timers, RAM, ROM, EEPROM, etc. Then I got interested in embedded systems and even get into things like flight controllers, motor drivers, and flight mission cards for some projects that I worked on (but didn't go quite as I expected...). Then I wanted to focus on hardware design more and less on the software side since that wasn't really the field that I was interested in. I started learning schematic and PCB designing and even started designing my custom STM32 microcontroller boards with some of the most popular EDA tools. It was going all like this for 3 years and suddenly a couple of weeks ago when I was visiting companies for an internship I talked with a guy who asked me about if I know about FPGA programming? After doing some research and digging at home my whole perspective suddenly went from 30 degrees to 180 degrees. I learned about many concepts related to VLSI, ASCI, SoC, and RTL design in both analog and digital. More so about languages (HDL to be more specific) used to build RTL designs like the Verilog and VHDL. I learned about FPGAs and how they differ from ASCI in terms of designing processes and pros/cons. What kind of software is also used for various other things like testing, simulating, debugging, etc. I found about big companies like Cadence, Synopsis, and Mentor and their expensive software for building silicon-based products. I already knew that I needed to go for a Master's degree if I want to work in the VLSI industry so that wasn't a piece of new information.  I also found out about the Xilinx and Altera about FPGA programming and their product which also have a free version and I am actually planning to get a paid lesson from Udemy and buy an FPGA development board for learning about RTL design and get familiar with the HDL like VHDL or Verilog.

If you were able to get through all of that, my question is what the frick is going on? Jokes aside, I am utterly confused and feel like I fell into a bottomless pit. Is there anyone who could tell me where should I start? Is this the right path I am trying to go through for my goals? If you have an answer, please write it as if you are writing it to someone who is new to all of this but wants to get into working for it as fast as possible.

Edit: To expand my question a little more here are a few more:

1- Should I go for FPGA first to get familiar with the HDL programming.

2- Analog or digital? Does it matter now or can I choose which one I like more later? Because I am interested in both. (Maybe mixed-signal then?)

3- What kind of Master's programs should I be looking for?

4- How many years should I expect to become a qualified engineer in this field?"

Assuming that salary is not a factor since the big4 APAC region pays peanuts for their internship anyways, which should I lean more towards? 

A lot of advices I have been given so far is that tech consulting does not differ much between the two firms and I should get the relevant data analytics experience at EY while some say PwC has better overall prestige and that I should factor that in too so I am pretty lost basically.

What should I do?",polarbeerd,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/vy2oug/26m_stuck_with_my_life_trapped_in_a_problematic/,"I want to keep it as short as possible by giving some educational and positive information up front, followed by some emotional desires and sincere necessities I have.

I have studied in one of the most reputable universities in Turkey, got Electronics degree which I am not proud, since it was not the real interest of mine. Families and teachers directed me to study it because of my science and maths classes being good. At least I've got to take wide variety of classes from Western Art and Music to Economics, widening my area of interests and getting to know more stuff about world's different topics.

If you'd ask me to contest the significant events that the college taught me, single handed, I'd say the opportunities I had to experience abroad studies.

1- My first long time internship in Germany, 3 months. Blessed to improve my skills on how to form strong connections in a country that I don't know the language of, socialize, spending the 1k$ to my rent, healthy nutrition, going out with friends and having fun plus putting some bucks to my savings account. Felt 10x more productive, happy, free, sexy.

2- 6 months of erasmus studies in Madrid, 3 years ago. It's almost impossible to explain how in every aspect I improved myself. It really feels like those 6 months are the only months that I could remember exactly moment by moment. Maybe the only months that I've felt alive, real and free in my whole life. Being vulnurable and opening my real self to people, having pure, meaningful and long lasting sexual and friendly relationships, getting out of my boundaries, travelling, falling in love, crying a lot, regretting a lot, getting to know bunch of people, learning a language and a culture that I've fallen in love and learnt, sleeping in the streets, learning new skills, drinkink, smoking.. and trying to balance everything with health and school, basically surviving with less then 1- 1.5k$ monthly. The way that I felt and the person I became in that period of my life was by far the best version of myself that I've always thought of. But as soon as I came back to my home country, Turkey, everyhing has eventually faded off.

Right now, I'm living with my mom in Turkey. I've got a job as a Junior JS developer a month ago and I'm trying to learn it as quick as possible to use it as a gateway for my exit from this sh\*thole. It's been 3 years that I'm thinking to become that person again but I don't know how to do it. I've seen that with the economical, political and social state of my country has, it's almost impossible for me to excell myself again in any aspect possible. Personally I'm seeing living in EU again, especially Madrid, as the only option for me to achieve my goals and happiness.

I don't know where I'm doing wrong. I consider myself as a skillful individual that more or less capable to learn stuff quickly. I speak 3 languages, learning German now to increase it to 4. I've got an Electronics Degree, I look good and healthy. I do lots of sports and play guitar. I have good relations with people I know and tend to leave good first impression. I know how to survive abroad..

I hope I was clear enough both introducing myself sincerely and my desires. I am widely open to all negative and positive feedbacks and advices. Love you all &lt;3"

I have a best friend, we have all the same interests and the same friends. I lived with her for 2 years before she got a girlfriend who moved in with her and I moved out. Luckily I moved into a flat in the same building, so I joined them for dinner most nights and hung out with them loads. 

During that time I lived alone I started seeing an intern from work. I wasn’t looking for a relationship but it just happened and we fell in love. It’s his first relationship ever and my second.
It worked well because at the time, we were in the middle of the pandemic and I had loads of free time to see him.
He had to move 2 hours away for a year last July, which was fine, we made it work. We knew he’d likely be moving back to my area after the year away.

My friend split up with her ex November last year so I’ve been hanging out with her all the time. So we’ve spent almost all our time together for the past 7 months. But I’ve seen my boyfriend a lot too, visiting him and him visiting me almost every two weeks or so.
My boyfriend got the news that he’d move back to the area in March, back working in the same team as me, and we decided that he’d live with me as it was the logical next step and it’d be cheaper.

I could see myself marrying him, and although he doesn’t believe in marriage he said he’d do it for me. He doesn’t want pets but I do.
We’ve spoken about the future and he’s been hardline no to kids, and as I was never too bothered, I accepted it. But in the last 6 months i’ve thought hard about it and I think I’m disappointed that he doesn’t. But I’m not sure if I’m just using that as an excuse.

My family really like him, although I had a conversation with my parents (whom I’m very close with) in April and they were a little upset that he’s not bothered about marriage and doesn’t want children.

We were fine and I was happy, we went on holidaearlier on this year and had loads of fun. A few weeks later we were on video call and as he was talking my brain just went BREAK UP. I was shocked and pushed it aside as an intrusive thought. But then it’s played at the back of my mind since. I think I kind of brushed it off each time as fear of big change.
But now he’s here, I find myself wishing it was just me and my friend.

I don’t know what to do as he’s just started his job and just moved into the flat with me. He’s lovely and very very much in love with me and I’m starting to feel a little smothered, even though it’s only been a week.
When we spoke about living and working together when he found out he’d got the job and it just seemed logical for him to move in.

I feel guilty that he’s moved here to be with me but I ruin it. I know he’ll be absolutely devastated if I end the relationship.
I’m a very busy person with lots of friends and he isn’t. I don’t want to be his only friend he actually talks to.

I went away for 2 weeks with my family in mid June. He started his new job and moved in while I was away, as we had agreed. But I realised I didn’t really miss him while I was away and am starting to have real doubts about the relationship. 

So we’re working and living together now. 
On the weekend we’d had a great discussion of our expectations of living together and routines and I started the week feeling great and looking forward to our life together. We’d agreed to drive in separately to work the next day because I wanted a little alone time, which he said he was fine with.
But the next day, he had a bad day at work the other day, which I could tell because I sit near him. So I messaged him throughout the day and he just read them and ignored them. He gave me the silent treatment all day. It felt like emotional whiplash to me. 
So when I got home I wanted to talk to him about what was wrong, it was like pulling blood from a stone. 
Eventually he told me he felt like the relationship was one sided and I don’t show enough affection, which we have discussed before. He then said that he’s the one the puts all the effort in, especially at the start when we saw each other every two weeks, which absolutely isn’t true. The reason we did that was because we were in the middle of lockdown, we shouldn’t have been seeing each other at all!
I was shocked to get the silent treatment and did not appreciate it at all.

I don’t want to throw away something good but I miss being by myself."

vy3f4i,1,2022-07-13,Looking for a full time job but got an internship.,MrRealWhiteWolf,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/vy3f4i/looking_for_a_full_time_job_but_got_an_internship/,"Hello Everyone,

Hope you all are doing great !

I need some guidance and some advices.

A friend of mine encouraged me to apply for a company he started working for a year ago, as I'm finishing my master degree in computer science this september and currently looking to kick off my career for real and find a good junior role.

I have a BS and a master degree in CS in the work and I did about 6 internships during my studies(all of them are in the range of 3 to 6 months) also I have a 9 months solid work experience for a big company and currently doing another 6 months internship that ends in september.

I have a good enough portfolio with all kind of projects (about 54 projects) (I really just love to code and work on projects and I just enjoy trying to build a forever lasting projects with good architectural design, in each project I work on I try to implement pattern designs according to my needs and I always try to write clean well documented code, I truly try my best in every project or work I do to challenge myself and learn something new simply because it's just fun and enjoyable for me) from web dev to game dev, VR dev, AR dev, automated systems, a bit of AI and machine learning etc, but my main focus is web dev.

Anyways, sorry for the long introduction, I just wanted to tell you everything about me so I can get the best advise.

So during this company application process, I've passed a first RH get to know interview that went good then I was asked to do an online assignment that I thought it was fairly simple for a junior role, I had a one week to work on it, I thought I did great working on it I did everything they asked for and even added a bit of small touches to show my motivation, and I've even sent it back at the same day they sent me the assignment.

But I was surprised to be informed that I was only being considered as an intern, I know that I still got a lot to learn and a long way to go as I'm just starting my career and I'm actually excited to learn new things always, but at the time I really believe that the current skills I acquired could land me a junior or an entry-level position and I genuinely trust myself and I really hope I'm not being too arrogant.

If I had this offer a year or 2 ago I would've accepted gladly with no second thoughts whatsoever. I have to say that I was really disappointed when told that I wasn't good enough for the role and my skills are lacking.

I guess what I'm trying to ask, do you think I'm being too arrogant or ungrateful and I should take another internship, or keep looking for a junior or entry-level position ?"

vy4ddr,4,2022-07-13,Vent / Seeking career advice,willy261,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/vy4ddr/vent_seeking_career_advice/,"Trigger Warning :  depressive

So... Ill cut to the chase , I am in my final year of BTech from an IIT  and to be frank I haven't achieved much , I am talking like , 1 POR , no Gsoc or anything , minimal competitive programming , or any coding achievements . All in all I am as mediocre as they come .

Maybe this was due to the fact that I succumbed to the comforts Covid provided and stayed home . Also I didn't have many connections in the institute to begin with . Ultimately I spent 2 years at home studying online , when I could've gone . FML

Its not that I am completely useless ( I have no backlogs and have secured a shitty intern I'm slogging on) , But I suffer from really high levels of procrastination and anxiety . I mean like will take about 4 months to complete a 2 day job , just because I'm too pussy to start .  Don't know the scientific name but these are astronomical levels of crippling anxiety and depression . I've also though 1-2 times about killing myself but I love my parents way too much to leave them , (not that they depend on me).

On top of it , My parents are urging me to Go to US for MS CS (natural course of action lol), and they are aware of all my mental woes . But they tell me to soldier through it  (US me toh sabka job lagta hai shit) .

All this with upcoming placement season and return to campus has pushed my psyche to a point where critical thinking is out the window , and I cant muster up courage to talk to my peers . I just stare at my computer all day  watching friends , HIMYM on repeat and fucking crying, afraid of being left with my thoughts and worrying about the gap between me and my peers , no clue on what to do.  How do I pull myself out of this ?  For fucking once I want to feel as if I am doing something useful in my life .

Sorry for the rant , I know , its pathetic . *But I am willing to change* , I feel like I can hack being a software engineer , but depressive thoughts have got me fucked up , cant think of a way out.

TLDR : burnt out college senior , seeking advice  or maybe something to relate to I guess . Feeling fucking lost right now ."

I had 2 weeks to prepare and during that period i was (and still) doing another internship from 9 AM to 6 PM,

I was able to do 30 LeetCode medium, 5 LeetCode hard and 7 LeetCode easy, so i wasn't 100% prepared but i wasn't super bad.

2 Interviews of 60 minutes each back to back, both with Behavioural+Technical questions. The first technical question wasn't really hard but i struggled a lot to get the answer (anxiety?), in the end after a lot of hints from the interviewer i was able to get the right answer but i didn't have time to code it.. Behavioural went well in the first interview (they told me that it was a good story and good answers).

Second interview with a young guy who's been working at Amazon for 1 year, his manager was in the call too. Only one behavioural question but he kinda went really deep with follow-up questions, couldn't really apply many Leadership principles there. The technical question was a LeetCode hard, i came up with a solution but the complexity was too high (and i made some little mistakes while coding it, he had to correct me), he asked me what the complexity was and i answered with ""Polynomial"" while it was exponential LOL.

After a lot of hints i gave him an explanation of the solution and he agreed, but we didn't have time to code it (again).

I really don't have a good feeling about this, what do you think guys?

vy4s8k,44,2022-07-13,The Cameras Are Always Watching,NoxiRed,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/vy4s8k/the_cameras_are_always_watching/,"There's nothing more terrifying than the feeling of being watched. At least with horrible monsters, you know the extent of the horror based on their image. There is, however, a deep-seated fear within us all. Fear of the unknown, the mysterious, the unfathomable, unseen horror that lurks just beyond where you cannot see with your eyes.

The presence of cameras should come as a comfort against that horror. They show you, hopefully for the better, what the thing is lurking around the corner. They show you areas you cannot see, thus there shouldn't be any fear of being seen by something you cannot see. This is all to say, cameras take away that fear. What is that fear replaced by then, when the cameras begin watching you?

I'm working this summer as an intern in an office, not a cubical farm by any means, the offices are separated from one another down one hallway. The hallway has two glass doors at either end, both lead outside. There's also a large conference room towards one end of the office, right next to one of the doors leading outside.

Most of the time, me and my fellow intern are alone in the office. Ever since working from home became a big thing, other co-workers don't show up nearly as often, while the two of us are required to come in. While this was a little aggravating at first, it's actually been great. There's no one to come in and tell us what to do, we can work at our own pace, and we can generally do whatever we want. This is within reason, of course, we're still expected to do our work. Usually, this translates to working hard for a bit, goofing off for a bit, but still meeting the deadlines the company has set out for us. I usually come in the morning at 8 AM, this gives me some time to get coffee and get settled in before starting work.

The office has also gotten into setting up cameras around the place. There was already one pointing at the parking lot out the back door of the building, just to see if someone tries to break in. It also served the purpose of finding out who didn't lock the door when they were the last ones out of the building. It's mostly used for the latter, tracking them down and telling them about the importance of keeping the office space locked. Other than that camera though, there are cameras sitting around the office space. The company is only testing them for right now. Instead of drilling holes in the walls to mount them, they decided it would be better to set them up and see if they work well before actually putting them up. The cameras are sitting on top of buckets, and they are pointed around various angles.

As you enter through the back door, you're immediately in a hallway that leads to the front door. The back door leads out to the parking lot behind the building. If you turn immediately left, there's a short hall, about twenty feet long and fifteen feet wide, that leads to another door. I don't ever go in there, it's a rental space that the company rents out to another company, I don't know the details. Going forward, the hallway that leads from the back to the front is about a hundred feet long and similarly about fifteen feet wide. The office has dotted along either side of the walls doors into office spaces for different people. On the left wall, the rooms are as follows from the first door to the last door:

Storage room, break room, hallway that leads to restrooms and warehouse, office.

Similarly, the right side is as follows:

Manager's office, office, office, conference room.

It's also worth mentioning that the hallway where the restrooms are down is about five feet wide, and fifteen feet long. It ends in another door with a small window in it that leads to another office space connected to a warehouse. There's usually only one guy that works in there, and he pops over every so often.

The conference room is where me and my fellow intern, we'll call him John, do most of our work. We have company-provided laptops that we do our work on and we just sit at the big table, our screens away from the door. John usually gets into the office at 9 AM, an hour after I arrive.

Now, about the cameras, let me tell you where all of them are.

The first camera was to the left of the back door, down the hallway as you enter, aimed at the back door. The second was further in the center hallway, aimed from the outside of the second office towards the front door, could see the hallway leading to the restrooms and the front door. The third was settled across from the second, at the corner of the office leading to the restrooms, it could see the three offices on the right side of the office, and the storage room and break room on the other side. It also had a good view of the backdoor. This one I could see from where we sat in the conference room. The last one was situated outside the conference room and aimed at the front door.

All of these cameras had a small camera feed in the storage room that could be connected via USB. They were constantly recording, and all of the data was saved to the cloud on a daily basis. Anyone could look at the camera feed by plugging in a device to it, so it was pretty handy to people inside the office.

The first day this happened was a day like any other day of the week. It was a Wednesday, John and I had been working on an application for the company for the past couple of weeks, and we were just chatting. I was about to break from my laptop to go get lunch, and when I looked up from where I sat, and out into the hallway, I saw the camera. The camera had been sitting atop the bucket of paint, like normal, except the camera had been turned to face down the hallway towards the other office's door.

I stared at it for a few moments, a chill running down my spine. I looked over at John, I had been sitting next to him since 9 AM, but asked anyway, ""Did you move that?"" I pointed at the camera.

John looked up and over at the office camera, ""No, I didn't"".

We both stared, dumbfounded at the camera that had seemingly moved by itself. My mind fired off explanations for this occurrence but was struggling to come up with anything coherent. Eventually, I landed on the idea that the other guy from the next office dropped by and bumped the bucket. He doesn't park in the same parking lot, so it would make sense why we wouldn't know he was there.

I glanced up and down the hallway. Nobody was by the front door, and nobody was by the back door. All of the offices were closed and locked, no cars were in the parking lot save for mine and John's. We were alone, like normal, but it didn't feel like it anymore. I went over to the camera. It was just sitting there, turned to face the wrong way. I reached down with my hand and spun it back to face the proper direction. I walked down the hall to the break room and got my lunch ready.

After that, nothing happened for a little while, the next couple of days were pretty normal. The next thing happened after the weekend, on Monday. I was in at 8 AM again, and I was alone. John hadn't arrived yet, and I was sitting in the conference room, nursing a cup of coffee and trying to get a little work done. It was about 8:45 when I heard a noise. It sounded like a light scraping. When I looked, I was startled to see the camera again, except time instead of pointing down the hall to the restrooms, it was pointed directly at me. I stared into its beady little red dot, and it stared right back at me. This time it was even more hair-raising, I was certain I was alone, and John was not here to move it. I didn't hear the other office door open or close either. I stood up and walked to the door of the conference room, I glanced up and down the office again, but no one was there. I reached down, spun the camera back into position, and kept looking over my shoulder as I walked back into the conference room.

If this was some kind of prank, it was elaborate and well done. I thought it would be a good idea to go check the camera feed, to see if I could tell who was moving the camera. I brought my company laptop into the storage room, set it up, and plugged it in via a USB cord.

The camera feed was live, it was aimed properly down the hallway after I moved it. When I started my internship they walked us through how to operate the cameras and told us there are a few seconds of delay between real life and the live feed. I clicked through the application to find the saved recordings. I found the date that matched today and clicked on it. It popped open a new window in front of the live camera feed with a fifty-minute video. I clicked through the hour and watched the camera feed of the problem camera. I could see myself in the start entering, dropping off my lunch, heading to the conference room, etc. From there it was silence until around forty-five minutes in. I heard the same scrape I had when I was in the office but through the camera feed. There I was, sitting in the conference room, I looked up at the same time the scrape stopped and the camera feed cut over.

I saw myself get up, walk over to the camera, and turn it back to normal. Then I saw myself walk into the storage room with my laptop, where the video ended assumedly because I accessed the feed. I stood back dumbfounded, there was nothing else in the feed, but *something* had to have moved the camera. I remembered last week when the same thing happened and closed the window to see if I could look at last Wednesday's recording.

The first thing I noticed was that the lights around the office were blinking in the live feed. They were beginning to fade, then jumped back to life repeatedly within a few seconds of one another. Then I noticed something else,

there was someone on the live feed.

I looked down the hallway, just outside of the room I was in, and there was a person peeking around the corner that lead to the other office space by the back door. It wasn't a natural kind of peeking, as natural as that can be. Their head was perpendicular to the wall they were peeking around, at a strange 90-degree angle. Where the head was, was unnaturally tall, seven feet above the ground. The thing had long black hair that drooped down to the floor, longer than seven feet, it made almost a pool of black tangled mess. The most terrifying thing of all, however, is that it couldn't be mistaken for a human. The thing didn't have a face.

In place of a face, eyes, nose, a mouth, it had the large black lens of a dome camera instead. In the center blazed a large red LED light, blinking on and off, staring down the long hallway towards the room I was in. Even in broad daylight, it was hard to tell what it was with the blinking lights. The lights above made it almost disappear when they went out, save for the red light which still blinked out of rhythm with the ones above.

I recoiled from the laptop. It was all I could do to just stand there and watch. I was too afraid to leave, too afraid to run, too afraid to even move. I looked back at the door, then back at the screen. Its head began to move. The red light disappeared as it creaked back behind the corner, its long mess of hair dragging on the floor behind it. It disappeared, the lights stopped blinking, and it was quiet. I stepped over to the door, peeked out, and nothing peeked back. I slid along the wall and peeked around the corner the thing I saw was standing, nothing.

I was well, and thoroughly freaked out at this point, I started whipping my head all around the hall to see if there were any other people. I was still alone in the office space.

I went back into the storage room, and accessed the camera again, this time looking at the other camera it had to be standing in front of while it was peeking. Nothing, no person peeking around the corner, not a car driving in the parking lot, absolutely nothing. I abandoned my laptop where it sat and walked back out into the hallway, checking around once more. The cameras were all pointed properly, all on and recording. I froze in my tracks and heard the back door open. I yelled out loud as I looked.

""You alright man?"" It was John, and it was 9 AM.

I took comfort in having another human being there, and I eventually calmed back down. After explaining everything, John tried to reassure me that there was nothing inside the building and that there must be some reasonable explanation. It worked to calm me for a while, but after moving the cameras back into position, it didn't stop me from checking. I moved the camera feed as well, from inside the storage room, to inside the conference room. I did this just in case I needed to quickly check. Every so often I would just hook it up to my phone and cycle through all the cameras, to see if something moved. Constantly streaming the camera feed was hell on my battery life, but it was worth it to make sure.

Then the end of the day came.

John usually arrives later and leaves earlier than me. He has a second job he usually runs to at around 2 PM, but we were happy for such flexibility in an internship. This usually means that I'm alone again after that time between 2 and 5. It's when the sun gets a little lower, the quiet gets a little more eerie, like being in a liminal space. Maybe in the morning, you're just too tired to care about how alone you are. At night, your senses tend to think a bit for themselves. You become hyper-aware of sounds and draw macabre conclusions about the circumstances. Then you write it off as just being paranoid. There's something different about a place when you feel like you shouldn't be there, something deeply unsettling.

By the end of the day, it was raining. Darkness ate the light outside and you could hear the clap of thunder after a brief flash of bolts across the sky. Rain should be comforting when you work, a relaxing patter ran across the windows of the conference room as I typed away. I was paranoid now, however, that comfort for me was damaged by an incessant need to look up towards the door.

That paranoia had its own curiosity though. I remembered last Wednesday, the first time I noticed the cameras moved. I accessed the cloud recordings of the day on my phone and looked at that first day when the camera was turned towards the other office. As lightning flashed, the feed pulled up. A dull rumble went through the room as I swiped my finger over the time, looking for something, anything.

I found what I was looking for. There was someone in the small window leading into the other office. The lights began to blink in the office space beyond the door as they did over here the first time I saw the creature. In between the pulses, there was a single red light visible in the window. When the lights came back on, it was there, the thing with the camera face. It peeked through the small window connecting the two offices. The lights continued to pulse in the office, it just stood there for a short while.

Finally, it moved, between one of the pulses I saw its head move THROUGH the door. Its body was half stuck in between the two offices, as it began pulling itself through without the door being opened.

And then my phone died. the battery had run out.

Chills ran all around me, and I suddenly had the unnerving feeling of being watched. The lights outside the conference room began to pulse again. They pulsed like they had when I saw the thing the first time. I glanced up at the camera outside the conference room just as a lightning bolt streaked behind me, bathing the room in a fading eerie glow. Then the low rumble of thunder shook my core. I looked to see the camera pointed at me again. The lights in the office pulsed, this time it was all of them in the building, from the hallway to the room I was in.

I quickly pulled the chord from my phone and jammed it into the laptop, not taking my eyes off the camera. The rumble of the thunder finally stopping. The live feed showed me tinkering on my laptop, with a few seconds of delay between my movements and the feed. Then I saw it, the thing peeking around the corner and in the other office...

Right outside the door.

It was just out of my view, standing on the left of the frame around the corner of the door. The head of the creature was cut off of the upper side of the frame, but its long black hair still trailed across the floor. At that moment, its body was visible. It looked like a long gown, ragged and tattered. The skin was sickly and pale, as though coated in a sheen of white paint. The limbs were the worst part, long, lanky, unnatural. At the end of its hands were sharp, jagged pieces of what looked to be a film reel.

I saw its legs beginning to bend, the knees bent inwards. I heard a sickening crack from outside the door, its legs shook and faltered as it lowered its head into the frame. The dome head of the camera lens came into view, staring into the camera, staring at me.

The next pulse of the lights made the hall go dark, when the feed had returned the creature was standing upright again. I saw it lean forward, its hair dragged across the floor. It was unnatural, with no muscle, just sinewy movement that cracked and churned. Its head started moving towards the door, to look at me.

I looked up at the door, watching, waiting for the thing to come into view. The lights continued to pulse. I stood up and stepped away from the laptop. I started considering my options.

Run up and close the door? I was on the right side for it. There wasn't any way that could work though if it was right next to the door. Jump through the window? I was on the ground floor, but I'd need to somehow get enough force to ram into it. Smash the window. Smashing the window was my only option.

The lights went dark, no longer pulsing, off. I grabbed a chair and threw it at the window, not a crack. I heard a sharp sound from behind me, it sounded like someone saying *psst*.

When I turned around, I couldn't see the door. It was dark outside, raining, and the lights were all off. It was so quiet, so silent you could hear every drop of rain. I saw a red light in the doorway, blinking, staring at me.

Then the lightning flashed, illuminating the room for a moment, and that was all it needed.

I saw it, in the doorway. It was crawling underneath the door frame, bending down to walk under it. Its head tilted at me as the flash erupted, janky and quick, I thought I heard its neck crack as it did. It looked emaciated, thin, lanky, but with enough control to pounce. It creaked deeper into the room as the lightning faded. I was once again plunged into darkness, its red light simmering on me.

I felt like screaming but was frozen with fear. It didn't move for a few moments. The only other way out was through the door it was standing in front of. It just stared at me, taking me in. It stood there for as long as the thunder rumbled. We stared at each other, perhaps waiting for one to make a move.

Lightning fast, another lightning flash coated its body. It clambered onto the table in front of me on all fours. I saw a deep gaping maw appear on its face. The dome camera split in half, when it opened this god-awful, mechanical mouth, I could see hundreds and hundreds of human eyes within, writhing, watching me, staring at me. Its maw extended deep into an unseen void that descended forever. I was gazing into a valley of stars, though it was just glints of light off of the iris of the eyes. Blinking, watching, recording, they all gazed upwards to a light that would never be reached.

*MOVE!* My mind screamed, as its head gnashed towards mine. I ducked my head, scraping it against the creature's chin. I heard the crash of glass as its face reconnected at the center of the seam. I dove underneath the conference room table, rolled to the other side, and sprinted into the hallway. The thunder rumbled under my feet as I hooked around the door, towards the back door of the office, and towards my car. I could hear the thing fumbling behind me, the table sounded to almost being thrown across the room. I heard the scrape of metal on metal as it let out a howl so menacing it cut me to my soul. It sounded like a deep, metallic scream of a man in pain.

I shouldn't have looked back as I sprinted towards the back door, when I did I saw the red light gaining quickly. Lightning flashed again, its arms were stretched outwards towards me, its mouth agape. The jagged film reel fingers reached out towards me, trying to claw at my back. I sprinted harder, and eventually crashed through the door leading outside. I felt the rain coating my face, and I stumbled down into a puddle at the foot of the door. I crawled the rest of the way out into the parking lot.

When I looked back, the lights in the office were blinking again. The creature stood at the door, staring out at me. In between pulses, seemingly without moving its body, it got further away from the door. I saw it move back a few paces, move back a few more on the next pulse. Then, it went into the storage room, its head peeking out of the door. Finally, on the last pulse, it disappeared from view. The lights stayed on after that, solid, bright, powerful, and safe if you didn't know what lurked inside.

I ran to my car and got the hell out.

I never went back to the office. Part of me wondered if there was another reason why work from home was so popular amongst our co-workers. I told John not to go into the office if he could help it. I didn't bother answering calls from the company and did everything I could to find something else.

I don't know what that thing was, and to this day I still have a striking fear of dome cameras. I stare and wait for them to split open, to devour me whole."

I'm still hanging on but sometimes I feel like I might crack if one more person talks or laughs too loudly. Right now it is already getting harder to concentrate especially on bad days and I get very moody often due to just the amount of people around me. I sit in the corner facing a wall so it is easier to shut out but with the new, larger place we are moving to I might not be guranteed that kind of seat (yes, its an open office L)

Now 2 of my coworkers know I have some kind of social anxiety although they don't know the full extent and specific triggers and one of them is HR (whom I'm relatively close to). As a friend, they might empathise and care for me but as a HR personnel it is something they might have to bring to upstairs and I'm scared that people will think I'm weak, I'm trying to slack off or that I'm receiving special treatment.

So I kind of want advice on what I should do. Do I discuss with HR about a possible work-from-home arrangement if I try and really cannot handle it? How do I even navigate without going into the full extent of how bad my social anxiety really is?"

Cool, I can do that, took me a bit of time and I eventually got it done granted I had A LOT of help from my roommate who’s well more versed in Python than me. 

Now they want all that data that was being parsed into an excel file to be parsed into database tables. I have 0 absolutely 0 experience or knowledges with databases. i’ve spent 3 weeks trying to learn my ways around Postgresql and how to incorporate it with Python and i’ve gotten no where. It’s honestly making me hate data engineering and that’s the last mindset i wanna have because data engineering is a really good career. 

I don’t know how to tell them that I have no idea what i’m doing and I don’t want them think that i’ve just been doing nothing. I’ve made overall progress and i’ve definitely learned a lot but right now i’ve hit my biggest road block since i’ve started coding."

Master's in Statistics?
Master's in Data Science?
MBA?
Master's in Business Analytics?
Online Master's Degrees?

Does it matter which one? Or just get a Master's?

Thinking about applying to a program at my University that is Data Analysis for Social Science ... but wondering if that would be considered too ""soft""?

I have solid math and statistics skill, but having gone to school through the pandemic have less-than-stellar references (because we weren't on campus and professors didn't really get a chance to know me) and only one internship. Teaching myself SQL and Tableau, have strong R programming skills, mid-level Python skills (but that was used to good effect in my internship).

How do you survive this?

Of course, we have very few girls in CS (in my class and in general) and I have just finished my freshman year, so I guess half of them were just taking a minor or exploring. Anyway, so there is this one person, who was my good friend. I have been in a bit of a slump but have always meant well. She got her summer 2022 planned out and everything and WE CELEBRATED, I was genuinely so happy for her. I had nothing the entire time and had been content with it.

After a while, it turns out her summer plan fall apart, and she starts following me. Like, I was visiting many professors by taking appointments and she would have the research assistant (who was her very good friend apparently) of that professor call her up whenever I had an appointment or meeting. So basically, she was tagging me to see what I was doing for the summer and if she could get the same thing. She even went on to mess with my internship by saying she'll overwork like 50hrs/week. She basically used to sneak in and I felt so weird I feel retarded to even feel this way but I just hated it, she could have come to me and talked but no instead she chose the other way of sneaking around.

This environment is just so competitive, so toxic. Everyone is your friend until you are not their competition. How do you survive this? At this point in time, I find myself having 0 friends from my classmates, only friends from outside whose major isn't CS (that isn't something I intentionally do but end up with) Usually boys stick with boys but I wish we women could also stand by each other.

I have like 3 years ahead of me, and I don't know how it will go. I love to code on my own but it gets really really lonely at times."

The problem: I got back from work yesterday (around 5:30) and the electronic keypad I used to enter the apartment was gone. In its place was a regular lock. It didn't look like a break-in because the door was not damaged, it looks like the keypad was just unscrewed (which would have required access to the inside of the apartment). I obviously had no idea what was going on and do not have the key to unlock it. I messaged my host three times, no response. Airbnb is involved now to get contact, but it has almost been 24 hours with no response.

So some weeks ago I finally had my first experience in that field via an internship. On the first days everything was just perfect and I was able to finish the exercises, which even were in a language I wasn't as familiar with easily.

Then some day I got quite a big challenge, but in my best known language, Java. I understood the whole concept of how the program should work. I just needed to figure out how to express that into code. It went quite good until my trainer looked over my unfinished code, asked about my strategy and told me to change certain aspects of it. The changes were counter-intuitive to me as they would conflict with the idea of the challenge. Later he looked over it again and asked why I changed exactly that. I replied that he told me to, which he refused.

This is just an example of what kept happening over the course of the internship. He constantly gave conflicting information and then acted as if I wouldn't understand basic logic. Pointing out the conflicts didn't help as he then quickly changed the topic. He even told me to ignore access modifiers, which riddled my code with bugs.

I can get over this internship being a waste of time, but I actually really have issues with coding now, which I didn't have before. I feel like I was bombarded with so many conflicting statements that I have a really hard time understanding how to actually approach my projects now. I wish I could just turn back to before that experience. Anyone else experienced something similar?"

vyf6yl,2,2022-07-13,UW-Madison Junior Applicant | Looking for help on bolstering my chances,PlasmusAng,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/vyf6yl/uwmadison_junior_applicant_looking_for_help_on/,"Hey guys, I'm a rising junior who will be an early grad and right now UW-Madison is my top choice for a CS-Physics dual BS. I want to see what I can do to be my best by the time I submit my applications, I've attached an edited [brag sheet](https://imgur.com/a/NvF8r96) with a good chunk of info that I sent to my teachers for LoRs as a reference and also attached my schedule(+ any extra credits that are going to be on my transcript) for reference on what I'm doing this year. I'm planning on taking the SAT but also wanted to ask if there's any reasons I should consider the ACT over it based on what you see. Asking only because our school blindsided us last year and didn't tell any Sophs about the PSATs until the week before, so I got a 1230 instead of what I could have got had I studied in advance. I'm in Cali so my main worry is that doing CS + being OOS puts me at a huge disadvantage compared to other applicants, especially since I miss a year of classes that could make me look even better. I might get an internship as an IT guy for a Color House near me but in case that doesn't happen, what are some good HS level internships I should look for to bolster me further?"
vyfolt,2,2022-07-13,Internship Question,Gregmaster15,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vyfolt/internship_question/,So I recently started an internship as a student software engineer this Monday and I'm already creating pull requests and pushing to their code base. I felt like there would have been more time from when i started until i actually started to work on their product. This is my first internship/cs job and I'm still a student in college. Is this normal?
vyg51u,228,2022-07-13,Does being in a “smart” major ever make you wish you chose a different major/profession?,Panda_Pineapple,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/vyg51u/does_being_in_a_smart_major_ever_make_you_wish/,"Some days, I feel like the engineering stereotype of it being a “smart” major makes me wish I had never chosen it in the first place. Of course, engineering is a hard degree to get; there’s no doubt about that. But I almost feel that the people around me don’t really care to get to know what I study/do for a living because they think it’d be too hard to understand. Like I’ll talk about a project I’m working on at school/my internship, and nobody will ask me questions because they don’t want to put in the effort of understanding what I do. My family/friends will just give me a glossy look and say things like “oh you’re so smart” without asking or trying to get to know anything more about that part of my life. We spend a ~third of our life working, and it feels really isolating when I’m the only one who knows/cares to know what’s going on in that part of my life."
vygaez,2,2022-07-13,How do I negotiate part-time remote work during the school year and beyond?,Distinct_Village_87,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vygaez/how_do_i_negotiate_parttime_remote_work_during/,"I've been offered part-time remote work duing the school year and an offer for next summer at the company I'm currently interning at. I'm currently being paid about $25/hour. This was the first offer they gave me; I took it because I just didn't have any negotiating power at the time.

Between accepting that offer (in November) and starting (in May), I received an offer to work for a startup as a contractor paying about $50/hour, working around school. I took that offer on the condition that I could work ""on the side"" (i.e. less than 5-10 hours a week) during my internship and come back once that is over.

Now that I've received this offer from my company, how do I use this to negotiate higher pay? Do I just say ""I've been offered $50/hour elsewhere, do you have any room on my compensation -- I like the work here and I see myself starting my career here""?

They probably won't match, but that's fine with me because I don't strictly _need_ the money, I enjoy the work, and this job probably leads to a more stable career path than the startup. For instance my company today said that they're aggressively hiring, while other companies are worried about recessions and rescinding offers. However: should I ask ""can you match"" or ""do you have any room""? I'm a little afraid by asking ""can you match"" because they could just say ""no"", but at the same time I don't really _need_ them because I have the startup offer I can fall back on. However, I don't want to shoot myself in the foot or burn a bridge, because I could realistically see myself starting full-time here.

Also, I'm on the same team as a grad intern and I'm doing similar work as that grad intern. I suspect that grad intern is being paid at least a bit more than me -- an undergrad about to start sophomore year. Do I bring that up too?

Finally, if I want to find another company to intern at next summer to just have the experience of working for more than one company, how do I tell this company that I want to take the summer off to intern elsewhere without losing ""my foot in the door"" for possible future work? FWIW, there are many full-time employees who jump from my company to big tech, and after a year or two they come back for the WLB and they are welcomed back, so is this even a valid concern? (I unfortunately don't want to name any companies or dox myself.)

Thanks!"

My thought behind it is that I'll have those classes finished by the time my (potential) internship starts next summer, so it would be okay to put them on it right now.

I managed to get an internship which will look good on resume, but I want to make sure it looks as nice as possible

No previous coding experience prior to this. So far I've take intro to CS, DSA, and comp. arch. I have no real personal projects that aren't simple course projects.

Over the Summer I've been working full time at an IT internship and also taking 7 Summer credits, leaving me with little to no time to study CS (I've tried to do Codewars at least a little here and there to stay fresh).

My main concern is I simply won't have enough time in the day in the coming month or two to catch up and make a solid project or two and get decent at coding interview questions in time for Fall apps.

What would you guys say is the most efficient way to use my time to not miss out on the chance at a 2023 internship? I'd really prefer to not have 2 years of an IT internship if I can avoid it. Should I focus primarily on Java and just make Java projects, and really hone one language? I'd love to do more Python but I feel like I'm gonna be spread thin + my actual college courses this Fall (none of which are CS related)."

Idk if this counts but I go to Pilates Classes (once) and Gym (twice) everyweek

1. I want to know if I should continue my job and internship past summer because I've heard mixed thoughts about how much value it holds in college applications.
2. I need some more ideas as to what clubs I can join as a Business Major. Since I moved to a whole new state I was at a disadvantage at the start of the school year for starting clubs and joining clubs. I know that I will definitely join FBLA but if anyone has more ideas lmk.
3. I also want to start a club since I basically have no leadership positions so if anyone has any ideas about what ones I could start do let me know. I am also looking into starting a small business but I don't know if I will have the time to manage this because of my soccer.

Moving is definitely no excuse and I am getting scared about how my friends and peers are getting national recognition and winning prestigious awards. As an Asian my parents make me feel like a letdown. I haven't taken any AP courses until this year. I do not plan on applying for T20s. Again thanks for responding and feel free to ask questions!"

I’m currently an intern at AWS finishing in the first week of August. I expect to get a return offer as I have performed well and fully implemented my project. I also think I am getting along well with my team and honestly enjoy working there.
I have however been hearing talk of a recession and hiring freeze at other companies.

I am wondering if AWS is affected, some people I know finished their internship 2 months ago and have just recently gotten a return offer. I’m surprised as it should usually take 5 business days to get one.

Does anyone know if the return offer rate has dropped or if there is a large delay between internship completion and getting an offer? I am in Canada by the way.

# Reason for the refusal in Certificate Science and Technology

*You are lacking the required mathematics and physics courses necessary for entry to the program.*

**I need advice.** 

What now ? I am lost I won't lie that's all I ever wanted...Always wanted to do engineering, but traveled a lot during my life and wasn't brilliant in math. When I came to Montreal, I studied Economics and Political science but it wasn't what I wanted but I liked the degree, also feeling bad for not following my dream studies...I self taught myself how to program during my last year of university and my first job as a Business analyst and currently working as software engineer. I am more than ready to go back to college to study aerospace engineering, or mech so I can work in that field even if I have to finish my studies at 34.

***There is one problem though and it's a cumulative grade point average***, I applied for university transfer because one person working in customer support told me that even if you graduated from a university, you have to apply for a university transfer. Does that mean I am screwed? Because I have GPA of 3.0...

Is there any other options out there like ETS ? I can do a bachelor degree in mechanical and master in aerospace + I get 3-4 internships. 

How would you deal with this situation ? Thank you for taking the time to answer I swear to god in matters so much to me and I love you for this. Please take care of yourself; I regret my previous life and I hope that a miracle happens so I can become an engineer."

**Two semesters/two quarters of approved first-year Calculus** 

**One year of computer programming courses\* in a single object–language (Python, Java, or C++). Object-oriented programming language courses that do not directly articulate to I&amp;C SCI 31-33 can be used to satisfy the admissions requirements. Introduction to computer science courses do not meet this requirement.** 

 [assist.org](https://assist.org), is stating that it is **required** that I need to take the equivalent classes of SCI 31-33 in order to transfer which would be CSCI 1 and 30 in my current community college. Unfortunately, CSCI-30 needs a pre-requisite of CSCI 2 (the CS class I will be taking in the spring). 

**If I don't meet one class requirement from the major preparation courses, will I automatically be denied in the admission process?**

*If not*, the following are my EC's:

* Veteran Status- U.S Navy (5 years)
* Junior Staff Accounting Summer Internship with a mid-tier accounting firm. (Present) - Will be finishing off the internship to have a good reference, regardless of my major being switched.

I would just like your honest opinion and advice on what my next steps should be! My worst case scenario would be to extend my stay at my community college for another year. Thank you in advance!"

As I don't have any experience in any of the companies so it's becoming harder for me to find an internship as all companies just want prior experience. I m really very curious to learn that how everything gets managed in real world, how problems are being tackled, code is being maintained, teams manage/work but unfortunately I understand if I will not work in any company I won't being able to understand that. 
Though I have been following some of the open source codes and they have helped alot but I feel working under some guidance, in a team would be kind of an amazing experience. I have been making some side projects like kind of a whatsapp clone , A store locator web app and currently working on spacex website clone but I feel clones aren't going to help to get an internship.. isn't it? But I really love them making as they give kind of a challenge to implement certain ui/ux or backend things..

1. What projects should I make or work on to boost my resume to get an internship. 
2. Any way I can get the experience of production code? 
3. What steps should I take to stand out as a computer science student so as companies may approach me rather than I...

I have about a year and a half of experience programming, mostly in Java and Python (with some C# at work, and some JS at school). I'm at the point where I feel like a generally capable programmer and I'm doing an internship at great tech company. I feel like my fundamentals are at the point where I can understand and develop most ideas I have into workable code (although, still learning new things every day). 

I'm interested in going down the C/C++ path. To me, that seems like a reasonable next step in becoming ""good"" at programming. I've had a few false starts where I started learning C++ (I'm doing Abdul Bari's course on Udemy), but I can't make it ""click"" for me the way higher level languages do, and eventually I get a bit disheartened and end up focusing back on Python, etc. 

For new-ish programmers who found a great to learn the C languages, would you care to point me in that direction? I did Google this, but as always, the breadth of options available online leads to paralysis by analysis since there's so many different ways to go.

vyqdjz,403,2022-07-14,PSA: Stay away from Dr. Vafaie's practice in Westwood if you're a premed. It's a shitty place to volunteer and you're likely to be exploited!,operafanatic5,ucla,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/vyqdjz/psa_stay_away_from_dr_vafaies_practice_in/,"***Context:*** Dr. Vafaie is a local dermatologist with an office in Westwood. In online student groups, she [regularly posts](https://imgur.com/fyQZckv) to solicit and [recruit UCLA students](https://imgur.com/a/T4NQqT3) to volunteer at her practice — mostly premeds eager to find a resume building gig. Although she sells the opportunity as a pathway to gaining ""clinical experience,"" it sounds more like an **unpaid administrative assistant internship**. According to volunteers who shared experiences on r/UCLA, it's a shitty gig where students are allegedly unappreciated and yelled at and berated on a regular basis. Some volunteers believe Dr. Vafaie exploits students for free labor and implicates them in potentially [unlawful](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2021/10/ftc-puts-hundreds-businesses-notice-about-fake-reviews-other-misleading-endorsements) fake review campaigns.

It's alleged that she yells at her volunteers for something as simple as messing up her coffee order, is passive aggressive to them, and expects them to work hours on end without breaks. There seems to be a toxic culture of fear in her office according to former volunteers. The following [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/vwqukh/drvafaie_in_westwood/iftx43h/) speaks to this:

&gt;Worst volunteer experience of my life. The reason they keep hiring new volunteers is because the old ones most likely quit. Beware that this is not a clinical experience but more like personal assistant/office work. She made the volunteer get coffee for her every morning and if the order was not correct she would be pissed. She would yell at the volunteers and treat them terribly. Everyone was stuck doing office work such as sorting her old files of patients for like HOURS AND HOURS with no break. She is a bitch and really stingy when it comes to money. I think there was only two people getting paid in the office and everyone else was treated like shit. Don’t work here and fall into this trap

Posted originally by [**Cameron\_zhang222**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Cameron_zhang222)

It's also suspected that she coordinates a steady stream of [fake Yelp reviews](https://www.yelp.com/biz/vafaie-dermatology-los-angeles-7) with the assistance of staff and volunteers, which is squarely against Yelp's [terms and conditions](https://www.yelp-support.com/article/What-is-Yelp-s-review-solicitation-penalty?l=en_US). The [1-star reviews](https://www.yelp.com/biz/vafaie-dermatology-los-angeles-7?sort_by=rating_asc) on Yelp are said to be more indicative of what her practice is actually like. There is even a YouTube channel called Fake Review Watch who [profiled Dr. Vafaie's practice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YNj8c0HxZM) and provided evidence of an organized fake review campaign. This youtuber's research about Dr. Vafaie was featured on a popular NPR radio show. At the timestamp 38:45 - 43:30, you can [listen to the NPR segment](https://revealnews.org/podcast/catching-amazon-in-a-lie/) about Vafaie Dermatology. There's also a transcript available on that same site, just Ctrl+F search ""Vafaie.""

If you'd like to see a preview of Dr. Vafaie's acting skills, there's this [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/b9JvI3viv80?t=13) where she promotes her practice and brags about how selective her Dermatology residency was: (.025%) according to Dr. Vafaie. The following 1-star yelp review attests to her proclivity to boast.

&gt;Who writes these reviews?! Paid out of pocket for an office visit only to be seen for maybe 45 seconds. **She spent more time telling me about how long she's been in practice instead of actually listening to my concerns**. I felt as though that she could care less about her patients. Then pushed a steroid prescription without going over how to use it (which can have long term effects if used improperly). I even told her I didn't want to use steroids. Would never go back.

Furthermore, a number of reviews claim she has a lack of knowledge and a tendency to push onto patients expensive products that she sells in-office.

&gt;I can only speak to Dr. Vafaie's medical dermatology knowledge, not her aesthetic dermatology practices. I went in for what appeared to be a rash on my chin and part of my cheeks. **She took a cursory glance and determined that I should begin using a retinol cream (her own brand, sold in office) and a vitamin C cream (again, her brand, all totaling $200).** do NOT go to her for any medical issues. She will just try to sell you products that she makes.

To combat an influx of negative reviews on her Yelp page, Vafaie Dermatology allegedly instructs students to find and incent former patients with discounts in exchange for deleting bad reviews. In essence, student volunteers who show up thinking they will learn about a legit medical practice might be there only to file paperwork, fetch coffee, be yelled at, and possibly coordinate phony reviews. Here's a Yelp review that attests to the alleged scheme:

&gt;If I could give 0 stars, I would. Hours after posting this review, I was contacted by Vafaie's team to discuss it. Additionally I was offered a 50% refund, \~if\~ I took down my previous review. Well, I don't sell out, especially when it's at the expense of body image.

Although there was a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/vwqukh/drvafaie_in_westwood/) a couple of days ago about this topic, it didn't get much traction and one of the juiciest [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/vwqukh/drvafaie_in_westwood/ig1hk5x/) was only posted today, long after the thread left the front page. Premeds beware. 

Overall, the idea of a doctor doing this seems very unethical: the use of fake reviews to trick prospective patients into expecting a quality of care that the practice may not have any interest in actually providing. One of the 1-star Yelp reviews touches on that very point, stating:

&gt;Found Dr. Janet based on great Yelp reviews. Unfortunately, I had bad experience.

I feel bad for these patients who are duped by phony reviews, and I'm bothered by the idea that students may be mistreated there. So, I am speaking out. I think it's important to keep Westwood businesses accountable and warn students about abusive volunteer gigs. 

For further reading, below is the aforementioned comment that was posted today about what it's like to volunteer at Vafaie Dermatology.

&gt;I worked there. She does fake her Yelp reviews, and the head student volunteers help her do it too. During working hours, her staff (UCLA students) looks through the negative Yelp reviews, and they try to figure out which patient left the review. Makes sense because her negative Yelp reviews involve testimonies of patients getting called up by Dr. Vafaie's staff where they basically try to convince the patient to take the review down with an incentive, or bribe them with a discount on their bill.  
&gt;  
&gt;If your practice is really that renowned, you and your student volunteers wouldn't be doing that shit in the first place lol. Caught the doctor being passive aggressive at the other volunteers one time too, and I remember she was saying something along the lines that her volunteers were unappreciative and unthankful all because they didn't complete a task. I think a lot of UCLA pre-med kids volunteer there because they can get experience, so they put up with the toxic work environment so they can bolster up their resume.  
&gt;  
&gt;Not a bad thing if you want your resume to look prettier, but if you're okay with being exploited and having a shitty volunteer shift, then go for it :) Some of the other student volunteers are nice, and some are bitchy asf. I did witness one fellow experienced volunteer was training three other newbie volunteers, and she loudly berated two of them because they already didn't know the process for something... I also could tell that both the newer and experienced volunteers did not enjoy working in the office.  
&gt;  
&gt;I was working at the front desk and this same volunteer said out loud that the office took advantage of others and something else (can't remember as of right now). I was shocked because she literally kissed the doctor's ass and the topmost assistant's ass, but was talking shit about the practice while in the office. Patients were also sitting in the waiting room, but I'm not sure if they overheard... Super unprofessional experience because some fellow experienced student volunteers literally shit on newer volunteers for asking questions, and then would be stressed out that tasks weren't being finished.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Most volunteers spent hours in the office and came in a few times a week, and they also weren't getting paid. If you're going to volunteer here, imagine doing a part-time job, not getting paid, scared of the doctor, and depending on the mood of others, you can witness another volunteer getting yelled at, or you yourself. every. single. fucking. shift. Highly recommend avoid working here. Worst experience of my life.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Obviously the doctor is able to run the practice however she pleases because she owns the place, but I'm surprised at the amount of student volunteers that work there, when they straight up know that what they're doing is unethical. Patients leaving an honest 1 star review is something you should seriously take into consideration, rather than sitting at the front desk and gossiping about it, and brainstorming ways to cover it up/take it down. The student volunteers literally don't give af about the patients. They'll do anything to please the doctor and get that letter of rec smh

vysxoo,1936,2022-07-14,Personality matters way more than you think,No_Ice8923,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vysxoo/personality_matters_way_more_than_you_think/,"This happened a few months ago. I had a technical interview for a SWE summer internship at a tech company you probably know. We went on to do live coding (me, two interviewers) and I was told we'll start with the first one of two. At the time, I never practiced Leetcode or anything else.

So we get to the interview and the question is: we have a method that has a string argument. Check if it's a palindrome or not (e.g., bob, true, cook = false). It took me 40 minutes and I was unable to solve it. I did every trick I could think of: for loops and all kinds of crazy constructs on it. It didn't work at all and after 40 mins I basically had nothing working. Now, I just laugh, because it's literally a matter of (in pseudocode):

    bool palindrome(string word) {
        if (word.Reverse() == word) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }

At the end of the interview though, they told me it went great. I have to admit: I was quite witty / gave them a good laugh a few times (by of course being just myself). So I got invited to a final personality interview round and got hired. 

I honestly had a similar experience a few other times (one interviewer even giving me two (!) more chances after a technical failed interview, first year in college, because he said he really liked me and sees potential). Personality matters way more than some of you think. I see a lot of focus on grinding Leetcode all day and optimal solutions, but it's not the only thing by far. If you're awkward or difficult to talk to, it's going to be a lot harder to vow for you even if you did every technical thing right."

What you probably didn't know is that I referred to myself (kinda) in 3rd person and after reading some of the comments, I've started to feel like I'm not ready for a job. I'll explain why:

1. I've never had an authentic CS internship experience where I've done the work properly and gotten paid. My HS internship was gotten through a parent's friend and I did absolutely nothing. My other 3 internships were research-related and unpaid. One of the professors dismissed me and deleted all of my work because my work was ""less than satisfactory"".
2. I've not done any side projects thoroughly, all the projects I've done have been half-assed. The only cool projects I've done have been school related.
3. I don't think I'm very good at asking for help. If I'm struggling on a CS project, I don't always go to TAs but I will go to my friends (you probably know what I mean).
4. I feel like nothing on my resume is legit and I'm always in a state of ""learning something"" to ""cover up an experience"" or just deleting the entire experience on my resume.

Maybe I'm still competent to get an SWE job at a small company but I guess my ego doesn't allow it since I've finished all my degree requirements in 3 years instead of 4 which means that ""I should be capable of doing well at MAANG"".

What should I do? Should I completely delete all of my ""bad experiences"" on my resume or ""fill the gaps"" and find a meaningful way of talking about it?

FYI: I'm an upcoming senior who technically could graduate."

I'm currently an intern working IT Infrastructure at a large enterprise. We're currently using altiris as our patch management solution, but management wants me to do some research on some alternatives. 

This solution is mostly for our on premise servers within our primary datacenters, but if it works with edge devices that's a plus. 

If anyone has experience using AWS Systems Manager, Azure Update Manager, Ivanti Neurons, or any other patch managers I should consider, I'd love to hear about it."
vyy7m6,3,2022-07-14,SDE job with a MCA degree ?,Kojirou_Shinomiya,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vyy7m6/sde_job_with_a_mca_degree/,"Is it really possible for someone with a non-C.S. degree in their Bachelor's to get a SDE job at FAANG (eventually) and other major MNCs after completing a MCA (Master of Computer Applications) degree in India ?

People say that it's possible but it's incredibly hard to find instances of people who've actually done it. I'm asking because the general consensus is that all companies prefer candidates with a Bachelor of Engineering or Bachelor of Technology degree for such jobs. 

I was initially planning to study everything on my own and then try to get into the industry as a self-taught SDE (or a different position/internship that would lead to a SDE/SWE job) but it seems that it's definitely much more difficult to get through even the initial CV screening and the interviews without any C.S. degree so I've decided to go for it as I believe that I would anyway need quite a bit of time to study everything so I might as well complete this degree (with relevant subjects for the job) in 2 years time to take care of this obstacle. 

I've been studying C++ and Python on my own and I've even started solving the Easy questions on Codechef and Leetcode as I would like to get started with Data Structures and Algorithms and Competitive Programming ASAP so that I have sufficient time to become good at problem solving and gain confidence. 

I plan to build good projects and to try and get 2-3 internships in my CV as well during this period of 2 years. 

If you've ever worked at such MNCs, how often do you meet someone who got their job without a B.E./B.Tech degree, if at all ?

Thanks in advance for your responses."
vyypb7,5,2022-07-14,I lost my Practicum Site 5 weeks before the semester begins,Windows98Fondler,therapists,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapists/comments/vyypb7/i_lost_my_practicum_site_5_weeks_before_the/,"Good day everyone!

First time posting here for me, but I want to start by saying thank you to everyone here as it has been wonderful being part of this community. It has helped me immensely in my journey so far.

Sadly, two nights ago, I received an email from my practicum/internship location alerting me that they no longer offer me my position. It was at a University Wellness Center, which was exactly the environment I wanted to be in. But, supposedly, both supervisors left, and they couldn't replace them and waited until this week to alert me of this situation. Before getting this placement, it was a pretty giant mess finding a placement, and the only options were at locations that I had no interest in working in or were more than 90 minutes away from my home.

I am freaking out. I will be 31 next month, live in an unhealthy environment with my parents, struggle to pay my bills, and already feel pretty diminished and unmotivated in the field. In addition, almost all our internships are unpaid, and for 2-3 locations I interviewed prior, they were trying to push us to do as much as we could do instead of meeting the requirements set forth by CACREP, which I refuse to give much more than the minimum due to financial circumstances.

At this point, I am worried that my only options will be placements I do not want from a client or work environment standpoint. I currently work at a group practice as an office manager in a different state and didn't attend my home University because of their perspective with CACREP and thus went out of state. I am considering transferring since I can apply to my home University and have potential placements at two different group practices.

I feel as if I am drowning and filled with regret around my decision to attend the University I am at. So naturally, the loss of placement is not their fault, but the fault is with how poorly their placement situation has been run and the fact they even think a 90-minute commute is acceptable.

For me, taking an extra year to complete my program is a massive problem because of my living situation, my own mental health, and the fact I will be in a program that I don't trust with my future anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

Update: Thankfully, the CMH site before that offered me a position and facilitated my joining their team. The downfall was that I had a few days to decide because of the need to get clearances done. I have an interview with a group practice also coming to see if it would be a potential place to switch to (if things don't work out and also to just network). "

I am 24 years old and still feel like I can't decide on a major. I started out in Music, then Biology, then Computer Science- and now, after participating in a remote internship this summer, I have realized that much software engineering work makes me constantly anxious and depressed. I haven't been able to socialize much while being a computer science major due to the amount and nature of the work, and I think that's taken a major toll on me as well, especially since I don't have that many people to socialize with to begin with. I'm also beginning to feel that I want a more meaningful career. So I've thought about potentially going to school to be a PA. I know that this will require me getting a master's after a bachelor's, but it's a STEM-related career that would feel more meaningful to me. And I've thought about switching my major to Interdisciplinary Computing with a Biology track for my bachelor's, since I've taken classes in Bio and Comp Sci already. There's two issues though: my GPA has suffered from my Computer Science work (and the COVID year) and I have no experience in a clinical setting. How do I overcome these challenges? Can I shadow a PA? How do I make sure that this is the career path I want to take so that I don't change my major again? Thanks!"

If we didn't do any research, what data are we supposed to show???

To add on, we have to present this to so many people. I don't know if I can handle this. I want to yell at the people involved for not taking into consideration people like me who worked on computer science based stuff which doesn't involve any research."
vyyy9e,6,2022-07-14,When is it safe to assume things when designing ? (Mechanical),m8094,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/vyyy9e/when_is_it_safe_to_assume_things_when_designing/,"Sorry if my question isn't clear, but I'm currently doing an internship where I do a lot of design, and after discussing with my supervisor (who is a mechanical engineer, as I will be), he told me that it's a great thing that I'm spending so much time doing calculations on most aspects of my design, because it is something that will have to carry an important load. However, he also told me that people who design those things generally don't put that much effort into making sure the part is strong enough, because with experience, they know intuitively and from observation that certain structures will be able to withstand expected loads without issues. They still do calculations for certain things, but from what I understood, they seem to be in the business of making things sturdier than needed instead of optimising it for being able to withstand what's expected (including a factor of safety).

So basically I would like to know, is it ever safe to cut corners like this ? Is it a common practice or what ?

I do feel like I've been spending a LOT of time calculating the stresses in my parts, but it's also my first bigger project where loads over 2000 kg are implied, so I sure as hell don't want to mess it up. 

&amp;#x200B;

By the way, he wasn't being condescending while saying that, he respects the fact that I've been analysing my project that much, because it does give my a better intuition as to how much stress my parts are under, and he has never mentionned that I was taking too much time.

I’ll be a senior ME student this fall, and I’m trying to decide where I should focus my efforts on applying for my next internship/job. I would consider myself a competitive applicant in the auto industry. I just don’t know where to apply without cutting myself short. 

I was originally looking at companies like Ford/GM/Tesla/CAT/John Deere, but after my last auto internship where we had a lot of consultants come in, I would also like to look at companies like Bosch, Roush, and places like Edelbrock/Holley. 

What’s considered the more prestigious, harder role to get? Are these aftermarket engineering firms typically a more demanding role or is it the OEMs that hire the best of the best? If you received an offer from Ford and Roush, how would you compare the two? 

I think in summary it would probably come down to the actual role/project available if I had two offers on the table, but for now I’m looking to “rank” my preferred companies. I’d consider myself career driven, so Im looking for the most responsibilities/capability of going vertical after graduation.

vyz1z5,3,2022-07-14,Any Harm in delaying grad school applications by a year (physics major).,Planetwo,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/vyz1z5/any_harm_in_delaying_grad_school_applications_by/,"Hey guys, I have recently graduated with a bachelors in physics and astronomy and am a bit unsure of what I should do in terms of applying for grad school. I already planned to take a gap year and as such to not apply for grad schools until after I graduated. My original intention was to apply for grad schools this fall and to take GRE's in September or October. I am beginning to start to have doubts about whether or not I feel ready to go through this process at the moment. I still feel burnt out from the stress of earning the degree and the difficulty of the last couple semesters. I already have a research internship lined up with a national lab for the SULI program in the fall, working in the same area I worked with previously at SULI last summer, I'm hoping I'll also be able to continue in the spring if possible, so I hopefully have a full year of working at this Lab ahead of me. 

I feel like getting additional research experience also couldn't hurt me considering I don't have the greatest GPA in the world in undergrad (3.42) with some disappointing grades (I mean genuinely disappointing, B's and C's) in a few upper division physics courses. I feel like applying for grad schools now before spending at least another semester at this Lab would be rather pointless as applying next year would allow me to have much more experience to put on my application than doing so right now. Applying next year would also allow me to properly take my time next summer visiting schools, writing essays and completing the applications which I don't feel I've done now as I've been trying to relax to recover from the burnout from school. My only main concerns are that if I wait another year to apply to grad schools I would be an extra year out from my degree and also I would need to figure out what to do in the extra year between applying next year and hopefully getting in. 

Have any of you guys been in a similar position to me? Would taking another year to spend time working at the Lab and building up my experience and waiting to be less burnt out before applying be beneficial for me or would it only serve as a detriment? Would be happy to hear your guys thoughts."

vz0tz5,0,2022-07-14,Can I still negotiate my salary after signing the contract but haven't started working yet?,Peeenoise,phcareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/phcareers/comments/vz0tz5/can_i_still_negotiate_my_salary_after_signing_the/,"Hello! I'm a fresh grad and very new to this. So I applied to a company that is very far from my province thinking that I'll use it to practice my interviewing skills and thought that they might not hire me as I'm not near the site. But unexpectedly I got accepted and was offered a slightly above-average offer and in the end, I signed the contract. The process took a month so it's not a rush. During that time, I also submitted my CV to other companies but none called back.

However, now that I'm just waiting for my start date to come, one company that is near my area reached out to me to send my cv, so I sent it to not regret passing up this opportunity and because they are a bigger company than the first. I passed their panel interview but declined the final interview as I think it breaches my work ethics since I already signed with the first company.

Now this second company messaged me and ensures me that they can offer competitive JO. This is where my dilemma starts. Both are foreign companies and known for great benefits and good starting offers. (So I don't know if the second company would offer any higher than the first)

Secondly, I felt more rapport during my interview with the first company as my supervisor really tried to know more about me and the interview took about an hour if I remember. This second company just asked situational questions and basic interview questions and took for 30mins only as there are other candidates during my interview (I may be biased since I feel like the interview is so short compared to the first one)

So for pros and cons....

Company A PROS

\-Prompt HR, the interview process was really fast (They call me immediately to notify me about the results and they're very enthusiastic about it)

\-Felt more rapport with my supervisor

\-Above average salary and HMO and leaves (Around 28k monthly)

\-WFH as of now (might be a disadvantage tho when RTO comes)

&amp;#x200B;

Company A CONS

\-Way too far from home (6 hours travel just to get there in moderate traffic I think) so I think I won't be able to easily come home whenever I want to

\-Will rent an apartment once RTO was ordered (indefinite)

&amp;#x200B;

Company B PROS

\-Probably will offer the same package or offer it a little bit higher

\-Workplace is near our area (2 hours of travel in moderate traffic) but I could easily go home every weekend

\-A More well-known company in this industry

&amp;#x200B;

Company B CONS

\-I don't like the vibes of HR (I applied for their internship twice already but ghosted every time so might be biased, different persons tho)

\-I will still rent an apartment for convenience

\-On-site working

&amp;#x200B;

The On-site setup might be a dealbreaker for most here but I think it's fine for me because I've spent 2 years of my college online and I'm having an imposter syndrome because my achievements feel superficial so meeting them face to face might bring change, however, considering the location of Company A, well, it's great that I'm at WFH setup hahaha!

I feel like working somewhere really far will help me get out of my comfort zone and contribute a lot to my personal growth, so the cons of Company A being far are really just me worrying about not being able to go home conveniently during special occasions considering the state of our public transportation.

Now my question is, what if I went to company B instead, am I liable to company A even tho I haven't started working yet? (I haven't received anything yet but their HMO paid for my medical exams)

or

Can I still negotiate my benefits package with company A even though I signed the contract already but say that another company is trying to recruit me?

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post, I feel like it's a great way to organize my thoughts and get your opinions as well."

Original post: 
My boss is driving me absolutely crazy

I will try to keep this short. I am F, 25, and started a new job this past November as a writer and editor after 3 years of trying to move out of social media. All I wanted was a true journalism job that gave me the chance to do what I truly love, which is to write. After 7 months of applying, I finally landed a my current job and was absolutely thrilled. I was away from the toxic environment of the tabloid newspaper I was working at before, and suddenly had more responsibility than ever: writing 3-4 articles a day, creating social media posts, and managing a team of 5 interns. The problem is that my boss, the 75-year-old woman who founded the media company, is driving me absolutely off my rocker. I don’t like the person I am at work on a day to day basis because I am having such a hard time keeping my cool around her. Let me explain as simply as possible.

She is always on my case about….well, everything. I work out of her apartment, which thankfully is huge and I have my own office away from her desk. But she, and I am not exaggerating when I say this, comes in to my office at least once every 5-15 minutes, all day, every day, to ask me if I’ve seen this email, if I’ve followed up with that intern, if I can change her lightbulb, call her printer manufacturer, check how much money she’s made that day so far, reach out to her book publisher with a promotion question…you name it. Keep in mind that these administrative tasks were not at all disclosed to me as part of the job description at any point during the application or hiring process. I almost never have time to complete a task before she gives me one or two or even three more. 

When I write an article, I make sure I use only government sources because they are the only ones she deems credible, but still she will sit with me for sometimes an hour or more afterward checking and then double checking and then triple checking every detail. She often doesn’t know words, like medical terms, and then spends a bunch of time having me Google them for her and read the definition. 

Today she fretted for almost 20 minutes about whether it was safe to say that cutting down on alcohol and illicit drugs can potentially reduce your risk of stroke, even though I was citing a CDC source. This is just one example, but it’s the type of thing that she will get stuck on. Today, I got so irritated that I swear I almost stood up and said I can’t do this anymore.


I feel absolutely awful because she knows I am frustrated and I am awful at confrontation. I feel so guilty over the fact that she knows I get irritated because the truth is that I respect my elders and am a huge people person, and feel like a failure for struggling so much with this. On multiple occasions, I have told her that I feel she doesn’t trust me and I want her to be able to feel comfortable stepping back and letting me do my job. More than once, she has promised me she will step back, and she always goes back to how she was before within a few hours or a day.

I don’t want to have to quit the job. I am so disappointed with myself for being unhappy in what should have been my awesome new job. But I don’t know what I need to do to get though my days without losing my mind.

Please, do y’all have any suggestions?"

I feel absolutely awful because she knows I am frustrated and I am awful at confrontation. I feel so guilty over the fact that she knows I get irritated because the truth is that I respect my elders and am a huge people person, and feel like a failure for struggling so much with this. On multiple occasions, I have told her that I feel she doesn’t trust me and I want her to be able to feel comfortable stepping back and letting me do my job. More than once, she has promised me she will step back, and she always goes back to how she was before within a few hours or a day.

I don’t want to have to quit the job. I am so disappointed with myself for being unhappy in what should have been my awesome new job. But I don’t know what I need to do to get though my days without losing my mind.

Please, do y’all have any suggestions?"

Helloo, I relatively recently switched to computer science and am now looking for summer 2023 SWE internships. My resume needs some work, but I'm not sure how exactly I should change it.

\- Does the solutions advisory internship bring any value? Should I just remove it?

\- How are my bullet points for my dev internship and side projects? 

\- Should I drop the extra curriculars at the end?

Thank you in advance!"

The manufacturing internship (6 weeks) is mandatory here, so most people don't include it. I didn't detailed it, since I haven't done it yet. Is there something silimar in the US?

I am a 19(M), soon to turn 20. I have found interest in programming, specifically frontend development eversince I hired a fullstack developer and watched him work for my own company earlier last year. Most days, lets say 4-5 days a week I spend 1-3 hours either programming myself or watching tutorials / reading courses to learn.

I currently have (planned for 3-4 more months) a well paying job, where the company covers housing and most living expenses. However, this is in a line of work where there is no climbing the ladder. I also am not interested at all in doing this the rest of my life.

On the Side of that I run My own company which is at a stage where I choose not to pay myself any salary as that money Will be better spent within the company for further expansion.

I had thoughts in quitting my primary job and mainly focusing on learning programming for ~6 hours a Day. As well as keep building My own company. I Will financially afford to go without any income for 6-12 months, which gives me plenty of time to learn programming hopefully enough to eventuelly get an internship / job.

I would like to hear your guys thoughts about this? Any advice on how to efficiently become a Good frontend developer? Is it a bad idea overall to turn my head from a well paid and secure job in order to hopefully work with somethign I Enjoy?

As a bit of background: The small company I work at is definitely data centric. It provides an analytics service to large companies in a specific industry - we receive data from the client, and have data feeds with relevant data provided by third party partners, run it through our modelling code (designed by data scientists, not myself) and then provide the results back to the client, helping them to measure the efficiency in their own processes, identify trends and try to predict future changes etc.

My role within the company is officially ""Backend Software Engineer"". This can involve bugfixes/troubleshooting and small changes almost anywhere in our code, but the particular speciality I have found myself in is developing adapters for ingesting the data, especially when we sign up a new client or need to integrate with a new third-party data provider. Most of my day-to-day work is in Python or Scala, working a lot with Pandas and Apache Spark. Many of the problems I deal with would be easy to do for one row of data, and what I need to do is figure out how to do it efficiently and at scale - likely dealing with 100s of gigabytes of data at once.

I've been at the company for almost a year now, and while I do enjoy it I am considering moving on and have been looking at job postings online. A lot of the jobs which take my interest and make me think ""that's similar to what I do just now"" have the title ""Data Engineer"". To be honest I'm not too familiar with the term - it's not something I was aware of until the past couple of years, and I never learned about it at University or anything. 

So, while I definitely work with data, am I a data engineer? My worry would be that if I applied to one of these jobs I'm sure I could tell the interviewer all about my work, and talk about things like optimising Spark partitioning efficiency, but then if they hit me with a data engineering 101 style question I wouldn't have a clue! So then the second part of my question is what could I do (either at my current company or on my own time) to learn more about data engineering if it's something I'd like to do more of in future.

If relevant, my background/experience is that I did a CS degree graduating in 2016, spent 5 years at various small tech companies/startups first as an intern then software developer, generally being a ""jack of all trades"" backend dev, before starting at my current role in mid 2021."

hello guys i just got admitted into NUS’ computer science program (CS Courses). for context, i moved from singapore to the US after secondary 2 (grade 8) and did the IB here (houston, texas). applied to NUS for fun tbh, at the point in time of applying it was on a whim and i did not give proper thought about attending whether or not i got in.

since NUS needed IB results before they released my decision, i have long committed to a US university, even before i sat my final IB exams. i committed to UTD on the national merit scholarship + college sponsored scholarship which works out to be a full ride (tuition, housing and meal plan almost fully covered; maybe i have to cover ≈$100/ sem for my first year)

when i checked the portal and saw my acceptance this morning, i wasn’t shocked per se as i did not think much of it. however, over the past few hours i have been heavily considering it and i do think that it is a very good option for me. it is significantly (significantly) higher ranked than UTD. i plan to work in the US after graduating and NUS is probably more recognised than UTD outside of Texas.

the main points that prevent me from picking either school rn are (pros listed):

UTD:
- in the US (more opportunities? for internships and US connections)
- my immediate family is here
- i love the opportunities to explore hobbies and stuff here
- NUS is prolly too academically rigorous for me to enjoy my uni years
- free for me to attend

NUS:
- significantly higher ranked
- some friends and extended family (also a lot more ppl of the same culture)
- better facilities than UTD id say
- likely to more globally recognised

i am in desperate need of extra perspectives 🥲 tysm for ur time if u did read up to here 🫡

(also tuition at NUS is &lt;25k USD for all 4 years and room and board are a lot cheaper than anything in the US)"

Long story short I graduated 7 months ago and have been job hunting every since. I've had interviews in cyber and general IT and gone through the long process of getting rejected from majority of the job opportunities up until recently that is.

I reached out to my former infosec internship boss/mentor asking for career advice. He mentioned that they couldn't find an intern for the summer and asked if I was interested. So, I said yes and pretty much accepted that position, the next day.

All while that was happening, I had just finished interviewing for another general IT, non cyber position and they just formally offered me the position. The position is a remote full time salaried position troubleshooting tech problems. From the interview process, the majority of the tech problems seem to involve troubleshooting Linux applications and possibly not much else (some windows). I'm worried that this position won't allow me to obtain the skills I need to get other jobs in the future (cybersecurity jobs).

Info about Infosec internship:

* remote
* paid no benefits
* able to get more a few more months experience in cyber
* previously worked with the team/company (awesome group of people)
* in the field I want to be in
* not guaranteed a job after internship ends

Info about full time non cyber position:

* remote
* full time salary with benefits
* job stability
* troubleshooting Linux problems and some Windows
* non cyber, not the field I want to be in

So which job would you all choose?

I appreciate any answers or comments!

TLDR: Stuck deciding between two jobs: summer only infosec internship or full time non cyber general IT position"

Luckily, my supervisor assigned me a “side project” to write embedded software and I LOVED it. For my first full-time job, I’m definitely considering applying to some embedded software positions, especially since they seem to pay quite well. There’s only one thing holding me back—the interviews.

I absolutely hate coding interviews, they’re one of the biggest reasons why I avoid applying to software positions at all costs (in addition to pure software not being super interesting). I would really prefer not to grind out Leetcode for hours just to get an embedded position where I don’t even need to invert a binary tree or implement a complicated algorithm. Has anyone here interviewed for embedded positions before? If you have, do you mind sharing what were the interviews like?

vzdtvx,3,2022-07-14,Need more effective/qualty middle school/high school/college counseling for exposure to cyber field,inquisitive-phoenix,cybersecurity,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/vzdtvx/need_more_effectivequalty_middle_schoolhigh/,"&amp;#x200B;

1. **High school career/scheduling cousenselors discounted students who weren't already great at / immersed in/ and-or interested in STEM.** Ergo, for someone like myself who had no prior exposure to it before HS and had been doing humanities it didn't even occur to me to be interested in it. Conversely in the other direction, this also applied to me as someone who effectively lead the HS campus gardening club... no one told me that the field of landscape architecture existed or I might have gone into that. Or how no one told me in AP Environmental Science discussions of sustainability/waste management that chemical engineering is a field and those practitioners are among those who can create/research materials science to produce, among many things, new materials for packaging for anything from produce and food to technology and products
2. Conversely, **for someone like me who had done other STEM stuff -** Sally Ride Summer Science Camp, AP Environmental Science and getting hooked on system resilience - it didn't occur to me // **no one pointed out the spectrum of paths that these could evolve into**, i.e. ""Here's where you can take this down the road if you're interested...."" e.g. My interest in systems resilience with regard to hazard mitigation, disaster recovery of energy and water systems as it related to resource management... if someone in HS or College had highlighted that there is a field for making these secure - e.g. industrial control systems engineering and security, you bet your ass I would have leaped at the chance. 
3. **Discounted neurodivergent students** \- i.e. whether by sheer mental boredom/apathy/derived depression thereof/learning style struggle, it was my experience and others I know of that we were never were given the opportunity to learn stem in a different style (that's its own discussion but even things as simple as given pre-recorded class notes so we could focus on the problem demonstrations in class than worrying about taking notes, and fewer problems but more focus on comprehension than on having to regurgitate right answers just to scrape by and pass the class) that would enable us to get over the barrier to entry in order to have the exposure to be able to discover passion and/or enjoyment and/or tolerance (i.e you don't have to *love* what you do to be good at it or content doing it) of it.   

4. **Such a focus on ""Must go into CYBER/stem! see money!"" that the on the other end of the spectrum of ignoring/discounting students who might have not been exposed to it/already immersed in/or already interested in it, those who shepherded students into the field may have ushered swaths of people into it who weren't really interested into it/suited to it**. Two different sides of the coin. How many people started to go into it, discovered they didn't like it, changed fields at some point either in education/during or after a scholarship/or later after working in the field. Different field (because I'm just getting in cyber I don't personally know many people in it), but demonstrative of broad concepts - and old friend of mine got a full ride to GA Tech for engineering. They worked in engineering for just over a year, then decided they didn't like it, now does fabrication and art. Cool, good for thm. But this could have turned out differently had people like them had opportunity to not only explore the field, but perhaps do internships and the like and get a feel for the field before entering college and getting fully funded to be able to decide if it was something they really wanted to go into. Then others who went through that or the cyber equivalent and had a different ""Hell yeah, I *do* love this!"" reaction, could have been the ones to go through and get some or all of that kind of funding to overcome the barriers to entry. 
5.   **ck**, **I kind of think that these scholarships and the like nowadays should have repayment stipulations in them where if you leave the field, you gotta pay it back.** This would incentivize getting to know the field, perhaps in a not-dog-and-pony-show get to know the field experience ranging from a week or two to a month long field or job shadow before someone commits to the field to really know if it's right to them."
vze2ve,0,2022-07-14,OMSCS + Cal Poly Bachelors in CS vs GaTech Bachelors in CS,bel_cant-sing-o,OMSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/vze2ve/omscs_cal_poly_bachelors_in_cs_vs_gatech/,"Hey guys! So, I'm an incoming freshman for my undergrad in computer science. I'm committed to Cal Poly but also have a guaranteed transfer next year into Georgia Tech. My question is: do you think it would be worth transferring or should I stick out my degree at Cal Poly and do OMSCS after?

Here's the situation:

\- Because of transfer credits from DE courses in high school, I can graduate from Cal Poly in 2-3 years while it would take me the full 4+ years to graduate at GATech.

\- Because of in-state tuition and scholarships, I also have a full ride (room and board + stipend) to cal poly that I would not be getting at GATech (I'm guessing \~30k/year).

\- I want to maximize earning potential in my career and pursue either quant or AI/ML positions. Cal Poly has really great FAANG placement rates (I also already have a FAANG internship lined up for my freshman summer) and I feel like I'm going to come out of school there as a pretty good engineer but placements in top HFTs from the school is more lacking.

\- I was thinking that instead of doing 4 years (and getting 120k+ in debt) at Georgia Tech for my BS, I could just do 2-3 years (w/ no debt) at Cal Poly for my BS and spend the next 1-2 years (with minimal debt) on OMSCS.

With all that considered, what do you guys think is the best course of action? Will an MS from GT help me get interviews at top HFTs (Jane St. etc) or increase my salary more or less than a BS from GT? Do prestige-hunting employers (like quant firms) look at OMSCS differently from undergrad schools?

TL;DR: I have the opportunity to complete either my undergrad at GT and no master's or my undergrad at another school and OMSCS in the same amount of time. Which should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

(Edit: I'm getting the vibe that I'm coming off as pretentious, ungrateful, and holier than thou and I'm really sorry if I did. I don't think I'm smarter or more deserving than anyone here and realize that I'm just extremely lucky, more than anything else, to be able to choose between 2 options that have both been my dreams for years. Just wanted to post this to see if anybody had experience with either side and could share a little on how it affected their career trajectory. Sorry again if this was elitist in any way)

Edit 2: Alright. The consensus is that debt is not worth it, especially when my career is gonna be about the same, and that I should chill out. Advice taken and processed. Gonna focus on getting excited for life at Cal Poly now and enjoying my last summer! Anything you guys regret not doing in your summer after High School?"

Data science piqued my interest last year and I have done relevant certifications and a few projects. But I have 0 idea about how to move forward now. Because anywhere I look for internships or jobs, they require atleast 3-4 years of experience, which I obviously lack. If you guys have any advice, that would be very helpful."

I’m currently in university due for graduation may, 2023. I was doing geology but due to it requiring too many classes still, I changed my major to interdisciplinary. So currently I have upper level geology courses, administrative courses and some gis courses in my transcript. 

I am a beginner in GIS with some knowledge  in cartography. So I was wondering if it’s self teachable. I do have a certificate from coursera but it didn’t teach me much more than what I already knew. 

I also know I need a project or multiple of them in my resume to be able to find a job. So I have about a year to learn all I need to apply for GIS internships (less if that’s possible). I was wondering what I should focus on. 

I’m thinking maybe learn some Python, some SQL, more cartography (where do I find projects to apply them?), and lots of excel. 

So my main questions are: 
Is GIS self teachable? 
Is a degree in GIS absolutely required for a career or will knowledge be enough? 
Where do I find projects to work on? 
 

Thank you."
vzge80,2,2022-07-15,All I had was myself and my own mistakes to learn. I don’t want my sister to be the same,silent-voice13,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/vzge80/all_i_had_was_myself_and_my_own_mistakes_to_learn/,"I’ve been through a lot during covid, and I think it was for the best. In eight grade of 2020 I completely stop assignments and almost failed. I was over it and didn’t care until the last minute. I remember one day I cried from not wanting to fail, and with some help my mom gave with me asking, I passed. I did it.

During the summer I went online, found Amino,and found friends. I dated one, got more confident in myself and improved myself, and then we broke up. I went way more down than before I dated her. I regretted ever dating her since it was too early in our friendship to do that.

Then ninth grade came and I was doing good until I wasn’t. I almost quit all together, until I got into huge trouble with an internship program the high school I went gave to students. I never joined the meetings or did some of the projects since I was so tired of it all. I got yelled at by the dean and my supervisor for it, and worked my ass to fix it. Also in freshman year I had no friends. I ate alone, I sat alone, and kinda wanted to be left alone even though I wanted at least someone I could speak to. I eventually found a friend, and then she moved away. I found anther one, and she got different days she went to school since we did hybrid and all grades were in A and B. I found another, but we had one class and we could never talk in that class so I never got to know him. I hated every second in that damn school and every second I worked on my missing assignments. I almost wanted to kill myself, but I knew my family would be even more sad during the whole covid pandemic. I also had goals I wanted to see through. Everyday it was on my mind, but I knew someone has to care about me, there was no way nobody didn’t. I knew my goals were worth carrying out, and they will be soon. I worked my ass with this in mind so depressed everyday, so alone, so suicidal, and yet I passed. I did fail a class, but I did two days of summer school and passed. You bet my ass summer was the best, even if I was alone.

Then sophomore year came and the same girl from before who got different days started talking with me, and after some internship training at the beginning of the school year we meet two other people, I got to know the other dude from last year better as well, and a friend of mine from middle school switched to my school. I was happier than ever, these people knew I was something worth being around, and I see them the same. If I had killed myself a year ago I wouldn’t be with these amazing people, they would’ve never got someone new to love being with, and I would’ve never gotten the chance I deserved and what we all deserve, happiness. I improve myself for these people and a bit for myself knowing that I have worth and the worthiness to be with others. I don’t completely love myself, but I’m not expecting myself to do so in a snap. I’m taking my time. I also don’t see being alone as burden, I see as a chance to do whatever I can do. I can work out, do a hobby, and play games I find amazing. JRPJs definitely helped a lot. Hell, I started asking that girl friend to hangout with me just us, eating alone and waking around, and I think we’re slowing seeing each other eye to eye, but I’m taking it slow.

All these mistakes helped me realize what is wrong with my life. Without covid, I don’t think I would end up here.

Now my sister, she’s not even a teen or in elementary. I can tell she hates herself. I always go to her bedroom and say hello for a few minutes or so, and go. She’s had her heart broken by dudes and chicks, people disrespect her, show and tell her horrible things, and leave her all alone . I know she hates being alone, and almost all her issues are like mine, and I want her to see what I see. She’s definitely worth being around, and all these people she’s meet are online. She has like maybe 5 irl friends, but I guess that’s not enough. I want her to know I love her, people love her, and she doesn’t need to be surrounded by others to feel loved. I talked many times about this, but she never understands, she’s always nihilistic. I think maybe I should give her a hug, something. I never had a good relationship with her day one, we used to fight a lot verbally and physically. We don’t as much as before, and I think that’s why she never listened to me once, but I really want her to understand me before I never get the chance to. I don’t want to walk to her empty room one day. Fuck man, I want her to feel better, nobody our age range deserves to feel this way."

I also have approx. 1 year of professional experience in the field.

This summer I am interning in a well-established and known tech company from SF, and they offered me to continue part-time internship (co-op) throughout the Fall. I really enjoy working there, they are hybrid but they allow fully remote as well, and the pay is good. However I am scared that it can jeopardize my studies and my Masters offer that I wish to pursue.

My question is, is it worth the hustle? Will the Fall internship make me standout in recruitment or I would really just be doing that for the pay and my own enjoyment? I know that this is highly subjective and depends on the work ethics of a person, but I am just curious as if there is any benefit from undertaking that besides the obvious ones."

I’m also upset bc I sort of got the impression he was interested in me or that it may have been going somewhere… but realized afterward that even though he’s cute and likely to be high income, he’s neeverr had good morals.) 

I am introverted, and am honestly more inclined to be cynical/pessimistic than I am to be optimistic. I’d say that I am more emotional than logical though I have had people who felt I was a good combination of both. At my internship I notice I’m not in a super social mood but then again I’m not at school either. I haven’t walked around talking to everyone, I j try to complete the tasks so I have my hours complete by the end of the month. I don’t have “good social skills.”

I find mental health interesting. I’m into MBTI and have been since 6th grade, even though I know it’s arguably pseudoscience. I’m curious abt mental health disorders and the brain and how they develop, but am also curious abt the human body and diseases. 

I don’t mind socializing im j not sure that im super naturally great at it or would be at a job 

I have never intended to get anything more than my bachelors as it’s most convenient for me. I’m admittedly trying to deal w unresolved childhood trauma which is partly why I always look so tired 

I know that I want the man I marry, if I do get married, to be high income. 

I’ve always sort of known this, but it’s smthn I’ve been thinking abt lately. I’m black and am below average looking in the face (like a 4) due to stress and I guess lack of makeup/idk so it will be harder for me… but my city is expensive to live in and I don’t know who I’ll meet so. 

I used to j want my husband to be black, but my family is having financial problems rn to a point where I’m not eating as much as I once was and I don’t find white guys entirely unattractive at all so I’ve realized that I’ll have to be a little more open minded. 

Although what I have realized is that I really have to focus more on my education than a boyfriend. I know that no high school relationship will last more than a few months, and that even if I didn’t sort of mess up w that cute boy who is likely to be high income who I’ve heard is homophobic anyway, we likely wouldn’t have dated for more than a few months even if he did ask me out. He realized that becoming a housewife in this economy would be difficult and that I need to have a job and my own money first. That if I take care of myself and have an education I’ll find someone.

I’ve tested as an ISFJ in the past, want to say that my enneagram is 6w5. I think that I come off like an IxFP when I am depressed.

I’m honestly not sure as to when I think I’ll be healthy enough to date someone. I’ve already had a boyfriend but I’m realizing that even though the situation that led to the guy blocking me was totally partly my fault, maybe in a way it needed to happen as it led to me realizing that the fact that I’ll be ending high school having had only 1 boyfriend is fine and that I reaallyy don’t need to date again until I feel good about myself. I see a therapist but can’t guess when I’ll have attained that kind of progress

I think it would be fun, and beneficial, to work with someone else where we can share resources, maybe give each other tips on roles we’ve interviewed for and have ones that are coming up, giving mock interviews, etc.

vzo0gb,0,2022-07-15,Am I Being Irrational?,MissFrijole,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/vzo0gb/am_i_being_irrational/,"I recently accepted an offer at this job that stated I would be on a 6-month probation before I would be eligible to work from home one day per week. I just spent the last two years working remotely and had no issues (aside from the world burning.)

In the three weeks I have been at this new job, I noticed that other staff get two or more days to work from home. I feel like I'm being treated like an entry level person, fresh out of college, when I am actually mid level with seven years of industry experience. None of the work I do requires me to be physically in an office.

Additionally, I have been put in a cubicle with very low walls. I am also witness to the chatter from my cubicle neighbor, who does sales on his phone all day, and noise from the interns, and the VP types. I am very introverted and like my peace and quiet. It has been difficult to concentrate. I feel like everyone is watching me (I know, so paranoid) but when your cubby is where everyone walks by to get to the bathroom, it's hard not to think that. Plus, it is freezing cold.

No one really talks to me, which is fine, but also, I am the new person, so why hasn't anyone even asked how I am doing? My cubby neighbor has talked to me and other than my two bosses, he is whom I have spoken to most.

The work is rather mundane, but that's the least of my problems. On Fridays, the receptionist works from home. I am not sure how that works, but since she is not here, I have to be the one who lets people in the building.

I have worked hard to get the experience I have and I feel like an outsider at this place. The dudes who work in sales (it's all sales for real estate) are the stereotypes who grew up in rich families. Their conversations are boring and annoying to listen to. Their hobby is golf. Diversity is non-existent here. I am job hunting, again, but it took me 9 months to get this job. I am not confident I will find anything else. Am I wrong to feel like an outsider with fewer ""perks?"""
vzq6ir,19,2022-07-15,My father doesn't approve of my bf and it is really effecting our relationship. He wants me to choose him or my boyfriend...,fbimostunwanted,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/vzq6ir/my_father_doesnt_approve_of_my_bf_and_it_is/,"To give a little context, my bf and I are about the same age (23)  and met a year ago. He is a comp sci major and has a good job. I currently just got out of school and I am working as an intern -- though recently I got salaried position. We are both very much in love with each other and it has been a year since we met. Since we both recently graduated, we still need to make more money before we can move in together and we are both living at our parent's homes. I introduced my bf to my father 3 months into the relationship. After meeting , I could tell my father did not approve of him and tried to match me with a man he approved of (comes from a rich family, has fit/good looks, ivy league education, doctor/lawyer/ engineer).  Those are all wonderful characteristics, but I fell in love with my boyfriend for who he is. Those things are not that important to me.

&amp;#x200B;

My father eventually expressed to me why he doesn't approve of him..

1. he did not like my boyfriend because my bf's family and my family come from different income levels (my bf's family is in the lower middle class, while my family is in the upper middle class). He questioned my bf's ability to take care of me and believes that I will make more money than him.
2. My father doesn't approve my bf's comp sci's major and thinks that that major will not take him that far.
3. My father  (was the youngest and only son in his family) believes that my bf (is also the youngest and only son in his family) is very similar to him. He argued that the youngest and only son in an asian family is very spoiled and difficult. I told him that even though they are similar in that regard, my bf is a very different person. My father refuses to accept this.
4. My older sister and I always had friction. I don't understand why but she's always been very cold to me and has a grudge against me. On a regular basis, she usually falsely accuses me of doing mean things to her and stirs up trouble. During the early stages of my relationship with my bf, my sister accused me of talking crap about her and other stuff. I was very upset about this and my bf was worried and asked why I was crying. I confided in him and told him what had happened. A couple weeks later, when we first met as a family during thanksgiving, she accused him of not smiling at her and not being attentive to her (my bf might've acted this way because of how I confided in him).  Another incident that occurred is that when we were saying good night at the door, she unexpectedly came in. We all were startled since we did not expect her to come in suddenly. We then stepped out of the house briefly and she purposed locked the door on us. I did not have a key, so my bf knocked on the door and told her to let us in. She eventually unlocked it and ran to her room. The next day, she lied to my father and accused him of scaring her on purpose. My father says I should stick to my family because ""blood is blood"". He believes my sister and truly believes that my bf purposed scared her, which was clearly not the case. He believes that even if your family member is in the wrong, you must stick with them no matter what.
5. My father thinks I spend too much time at my bf place. To him, I can only visit him every 2-3 weeks. He hates when I spend the weekend there. He has threatened me that if I spend too much time there, he will kick me out of the house and family. He tells me that I am choosing my bf's family and betraying my own family by spending time there. I don't know if my father would actually kick me out, but I am very scared. My bf's parents are very nice, but I don't know how they would feel about me moving in. I'm also worried that if I move in, my relationship with my mother will be damaged and severed. My bf and I have discussed moving in together, and next year would be a viable option, but right now it's just not due to our current circumstances.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like my father is making me choose between him and my boyfriend. I don't know what to do anymore since it is severely affecting my mental health. I really love my boyfriend and he is the person I want to spend the rest of my life with. I feel really angry about the way my family treats him.

Please don't tell me to move out because I really cannot at this point."

vzr6mq,3,2022-07-15,Comparison of human and mouse retina specific splicing (RNASeq),Osiemen,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/vzr6mq/comparison_of_human_and_mouse_retina_specific/,"Hi guys. For my internship project I have to compare mouse retina RNA-Seq data with human short read RNA-Seq data to identify common retina specific (pseudo)exons. I will need to gather RNA-Seq data for both species and than I will need to find bioinformatics tools to align/map this dataset to a reference to finally compare them. I was wondering if you guys could advise me on which tools I might use for this purpose. For alignment/mapping I was considering to use STAR (Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference). Im not sure which tool I could/should use to compare the exons between the two species. One possible idea I had was to look at the differential expressed genes in both species and from there on compare the genes and exons between the two species. I think tools like DESeq2 or DEXSeq could be used for this, but im not sure. If any of you have done something similar or used similar tools or have tips in general please help me out :) 

And a second questions I would like to address is: ""Which splicing motifs and factors regulate retina specific splicing in humans and how similar are these to the ones identified in mice?""I am not sure how to tackle this problem or which tools I could use to help me answer this questions. If you guys have any idea's or suggestions, I would like to hear them.

Thanks in advance!"
vzrsta,1,2022-07-15,University starts in a bit more than a month and I think I will hate my course,SirDevilKinSogeking_,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/vzrsta/university_starts_in_a_bit_more_than_a_month_and/,"So I am enrolled in CS in one of the best universities.. should be happy, right? But honestly I have done cs for a long while through apps and what not, and not only am I terrible at it, but It also makes me so stressed. I absolutely deplore the mental burden and also there is just always so much to do, not only are the classes difficult but there are so many side projects thay I do not have the motivation to do nor do I think I have enough ability. I saw what the other kids could do at hackathons and that could never be.

I always put this internal pressure on myself that I had to do cs from I would say age 13.. for whatever reason. I did courses and everything but the WTF moment was when a friend made me help him make a swift app.. I could not do anything. I just dont see myself in the future being someone who works in web development or a similar field.. if anything, I wanna work in Machine Learning.

In school, my friend subjects were Math and Econ to be honest.. I wanna do math but it just isnt as prestiguous you know, and what are the internships. Econs probably has my fav related jobs.. I could be a quant or algo trader, but again that is such a hard winding path and if it fails I cant earn as much"

vzs1gp,1,2022-07-15,What do I do about homophobic comments at my new internship?,External-One-1021,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/vzs1gp/what_do_i_do_about_homophobic_comments_at_my_new/,"I (21f) began an internship at a PT/OT clinic last week. I picked a place that had a lot of connections to my school. The guy that I’m shadowing, my supervisor, used to be a prof at my school. He’s very well known and I figured he’d be a great and knowledgeable person to do an internship with. 
I quickly realized this may have been a mistake. While I’m completely comfortable working with people whose political opinions differ than mine, there has to be a professional way to go about it. My supervisor is very outspoken about his beliefs and shares them a lot with his clients. I find this very unprofessional, but almost all his clients think the same way. It’s usually something I can get through but yesterday things got a little out of hand. 
A client was telling a story about his trip to the ER the night prior. While he talked about being blatantly disrespectful to hospital staff, he also made hateful comments about a gay couple in the waiting room. My supervisor was doubled over in laughter. I couldn’t hide how uncomfortable I was. I have a shaved head dyed rainbow colors, and I wondered how he could say that in front of me as a visibly queer woman. He looked at me and said “I’m sorry, I’m just old fashioned! Can’t help that!” And continued to laugh while shaking my hand. There was a lot of other red flags in that conversation both from my supervisor and the client, but that was the part that really shook me. 
Most of the clients are over the age of 65, so it’s more than likely they are more conservative. I don’t mind conservative people, but I can’t finish the internship if I’m going to be hearing homophobic comments and I worry if it gets worse if I will feel unsafe. I don’t know if I should report it and if so, who to report it to. I don’t want to risk my grade as it’s important I get an A and that I finish the hours. I’m not really sure what to do."

I’ve had two previous web development internships and looking to get my foot in the door with an opportunity in a company.

I’ve had two previous web development internships and looking to get my foot in the door with an opportunity in a company.

GPA: 3.72 uw, 4.26 w

5 APs (3 more senior year-- i have taken all the ones available to me)-- two 4s, two 5s

ECs: Competitive / Sideline Cheer (JV for 2 yrs, Varsity for 2 yrs, National title), MUN Captain (3 yrs), lead of my school's biggest club, a couple paid internships in politics, directing / writing for the theatre department (1 published play, directed a major production), a TON of volunteer work in voter registration and media for political groups, editor for the school's literary magazine and newspaper, some other leadership stuff 

Intended major: some merge between politics and philosophy

**Here's the issue:**

I go to a pretty conservative Catholic high school in California. I'm very lucky to be able to be able to go there, but there's a few issues regarding extracurriculars. I'm an atheist and lean left politically-- meaning that I do a lot of advocacy work for issues that don't necessarily align with the Catholic Church. My school will not allow me to log those volunteer hours, meaning that I'm vetted from awards that I would otherwise qualify for (which doesn't really bother me). **The main thing I'm worried about, though, is that my counselor (who is writing my recommendation letter) is very Catholic herself.** My most impressive accomplishments deal with LGBTQ+ and reproductive rights issues, but she doesn't like discussing them with me. I'm nervous that her recommendation letter will only be about my in-school accomplishments, which only show a small portion of my leadership and don't necessarily reflect my interests. 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I be worried? What should I do?"
vzx7u2,1,2022-07-15,Is it easier to get a job as a Full Stack developer?,techgirl8,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vzx7u2/is_it_easier_to_get_a_job_as_a_full_stack/,"I am currently learning full stack development. I'm still in college but I will be graduating in December with a double bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Cybersecurity. I'm currently doing a full stack internship. I feel like I have learned so much. I like learning everything I can about it front and back end that is why I chose to do do full stack development. This internship ends in a couple weeks and if they don't extend my internship into the fall then I will be out of a job in 2 weeks. I am a 30 year old student so I have to have a job to pay my bills. I really don't want to go back to working at a job I dislike. I REALLY enjoy this job and it doesn't even feel like work because I am passionate about it and I spend all my free time learning even when I'm not on the clock. 

So main question is, if I have to get a job/other fall internship before I graduate will being a full stack developer make this job search easier for me? I have applied to a bunch of fall internships but haven't heard back yet from any of them. I would much rather stay at this company but that Is up to them if they will extend my internship."

I'm currently taking cs and math courses at a local community college, with plans to either get a second bachelors or a masters. I'll most likely apply to several of both types of programs and make my decision based on where I get in, cost, etc., but I'm curious how things have gone for those who've already gone down this path.

Do you feel that having just the masters prepared you for a career in cs? Did your lack of a bachelors in CS or related field ever come up in the interview process? And if so, did it hurt? help? was it basically neutral? Were you able to get any internships while doing your degree? Any FAANG internships or job offers?

My gut is to get a second bachelors, and from what I can find it sounds like people who take that route do fine, but I haven't come across any posts specifically about people who took the masters route."

I have 3 years of work experience and 6 months of paid internship experience in my organization. I had 72% cgpa in college ( Tier 3 Private University) , 320 GRE ( 168 Q 152 V ) and 8 IELTS band. I am thinking of applying for a masters but I'm not sure if it is for me , since my cgpa is low I'm not sure if I would get a good college and consequently no job maybe, and if I stay here I'll get around 40-50lpa by 5 years of experience maybe more if I switch. But now the thing is, a friend of mine who worked as a manual tester got placed with Amazon at a package of $150k after her master's so I'm tempted to take the chance. What should I do? My family is fairly well off so money is not a concern ( I also have fair amount of savings and prefer being independent).

 Please help me since I belive this would be the biggest decision of my life."
w01leg,0,2022-07-15,"A substitute for ""real work experience""",NightestOfTheOwls,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/w01leg/a_substitute_for_real_work_experience/," Hi, I'm a 4th year (graduating with a bachelor degree in 2023) CS student and I'm struggling to get a job. It's obvious that we're currently living through crisis and tech companies took a blow but I imagine this was the case for all undergrads. I also think I need to mention that I'm **not from the U.S.**  
So far I've only been offered unpaid internships and job offers with insane hours and pitiful pay.

I understand that I'm probably the least attractive candidate of all applications but the first complaint from the interviewers I get is that ""I don't have commercial/enterprise/actual/real work experience"". None of the interviewers actually explained to me what that means but from the peers I understood that's ability to meet deadlines, ability to produce a commercial product, ability to follow the TOR , cooperate with the team, etc. I've even been given take-homes a couple times, full with set deadlines and project specifications but after completing it it's back to the same argument. ""It's evident by the work you've done that you don't have real work experience"".

I don't have problems passing technical interviews. Usually it's the easiest part. I spend a lot of time on leetcode so at least that paid off, I guess.  
So, is there anything I can do? On one interview they straight up told me that ""nobody gives a damn about your projects"", so that's clearly not the right way. Is my best bet to suck it up and accept a poor offer for a year, until I graduate?"
w03skp,6,2022-07-15,Are these projects enough to get an interview?,thenotsofunnyfriend,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/w03skp/are_these_projects_enough_to_get_an_interview/,"A Java CRUD app with swing gui (school project), a chrome extension that implements an api (deployed on chrome web store), and a full stack app that I plan to finish this summer. 

Should I try to work on more YouTube projects after this or just focus on learning DSA and leetcode?

I know this question gets asked a lot but I’ve been looking at other resumes and they seem to have more. I’m a rising sophomore with no previous internship."
w04k5b,1,2022-07-15,How can I find a remote job by my December graduation?,futuremillionaire01,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/w04k5b/how_can_i_find_a_remote_job_by_my_december/,"I'm a senior at UCF in Orlando, FL studying economics. I'll be finishing a semester early because I dual enrolled my senior year of high school. I have a ~3.2 cumulative GPA and I'm currently completing a 12-week summer internship program. I'll be completing training in Power BI and data visualization there soon, and I've utilized Excel in this internship and for my entire academic career. I'm looking for remote entry-level jobs, preferably business, data, or pricing analyst positions. I'm not sure what industries to target and how to craft my resume and cover letter to target remote positions. I would like to schedule career counseling with career services and the College of Business, but my full-time internship would conflict with that. Any tips to stand out and secure a competitive remote job? Focus on companies I'm more familiar with? TIA :)"

Physics teacher - (6.5/10?) I had her for chemistry for one semester before and she was very happy to write me a LOR but I’m very introverted and I’m terrible at Physics

Counselor - (9/10) During my junior year I reached out a bunch to talk college stuff so I think this one will be good

**Essays** I haven’t started but I might connect my FG(LI?) identity with community service and then my cs major (like coding something to help others)

**Note** during my junior year I had the college app awakening so have a bunch of random leadership positions lined up for the senior year lol

Since I’m a Maryland resident, UMD seems like my best shot as a CS major, but I would like a few oos target options that have decent financial aid. I will be avoiding any unprotected abortion states and LACs tho"

However, this is after spending a semester resolving an incomplete grade and then waiting another semester for my graduation application to go through. I graduated with a 3.1 GPA with no internships. In that time, I've been wondering what to do next with my time. 

I've been feeling like I've been pigeonholed into CS since I started college. I don't find coding particularly enjoyable. I've tried doing Leetcode in the year that my degree was in limbo but I just felt miserable doing so. I've shot out a few job applications for associate/junior SWE positions and all I've got were rejections. Internships in my area are few and far between since a majority of the CS ones are for students only. I'm not sure how else to touch up my resume beyond posting school project details. 

Recently, I've been doing Coursera since my state covers certifications for free. I'm almost done with a certificate in Project Management and I'm thinking about doing more certifications in UI/UX or Data Analytics. But lately, this has also been feeling like I've only been going through the motions instead of doing something I'm genuinely passionate about. 

So what do I do now? How do I find something that I genuinely want to do with the rest of my life?"

**Hook:** I currently live in Seattle, but I have lived on 3 different continents (WA &amp; OR, Germany, Singapore) and spent a lot of time in foreign countries (25+) because of the accessibility.

It makes me more considerate about the situation/circumstances that an individual might come from which makes me a more compassionate leader. 

Colleges:

* Stanford is top choice rn
* Ivies (Harvard, Princeton, Cornell)
* Top CS/Data Science schools (not Illinois tho lol)
* UW Seattle CS (in-state)
* Top Canadian Schools"

    I need a small suggestion related to work. I’ve got an internship at Amazon for Summer 2022 where I will be working on an ML related task(tuning Deep Neural Networks and pure ML stuff). I’m from a Computer Science background and specialisation in systems(Operating systems and Networks). I have last worked on ML in 2019 and decided it isn’t my area and moved on from it. I worked one year as a Backend engineer and really enjoyed building the stuff. I’ve worked with Java, Kubernetes, Elastic Search, Kafka and enjoyed every aspect of engineering built into it. I used to work 12-14 hrs a day and was never stressed about it, I loved it. In my current internship I’m given an ML task and I’ve no clue what to do about it. I’m not getting the intuition from the data I’m working with. Also after 3 years I’m pushed into this forcibly. I don’t see my future working on ML related stuff and it’s very disheartening to me to start the work daily. Didn’t like the team either, most of the work is stale and  isn’t exciting at all. I’m feeling clueless and so stressed given the current financial situation for the other companies(Most are doing hiring freeze). My mentor told sorry for the Team mismatch during introduction. I’m a December grad and an international student as well. I need some help in this situation? 
I’m getting self doubts if I’m walking away from a challenge? If I’m good with the job. Honestly this wasn’t what I prepared for as a career. It’s four weeks into internship and I haven’t met a single new intern. I’m so stressed. My mentor is on PTO for a month now. I don’t see progress on the project. Please let me know from your experience what I can do here."

The major I want to declare is Computer Science (ENG), but I have some issues.  My current schedule is chem 125/126/130, Engr 101, rob 101, and entr 407. I really badly want to be able to apply to internships at the start of my sophomore year, but I've read around on Reddit and a lot of people are saying that EECS 281 is a very important class due to most companies wanting somewhat knowledge in Data Structures and Algorithms. A class that is needed for eecs 281 is eecs 203 (discrete math), but my issue is that it is not available in the summer or spring so I would have to take it this fall or winter semester. Is it worth dropping general chem, taking eecs 203 rn, then taking eecs 280 in the winter, and finally taking eecs 281 in the spring and general chem 125 in the summer? Also, ive heard that eecs 203 is an extremely difficult class, is it worth me just waiting till sophomore year and taking it my first semester?  


Extra info: I've passed math 115 and math 116, so I'm in the clear to take it. I have most of my general electives and intellectual breadth too. Also, I have to take engr 101 this semester and 100 next semester."

I recently got 2 job offers, but I'm having a hard time deciding which one to go with. I'd appreciate any insight and advice.

**First Job: Government Job (internship return offer)**

- Location: Hybrid remote/in-person in CA

- Pay: $19/hr (~$40k annually) for the first year (the probationary period) after which it can jump to $39/hr (max pay for this position)

- Job Title: IT - DevOps Specialist

- Notes: I interned here for the past year. I love the people I work with and the WLB is great! It's close enough to home that I can still live in my childhood home (thanks to the parental units), plus they're really supportive in terms of mentorship and learning. The biggest issue is that the pay is way below market value and the job title is not Software Engineer (SWE).

**Second Job: Private, large, non-tech company**

- Location: Hybrid remote/in-person in OR

- Pay: $85k/year, but salaried, exempt position

- Job Title: SWE

- Notes: I really vibed with this company during the interview process and everyone I've met seems pretty happy. The biggest drawbacks are that it's located in a high COL area and it's out-of-state (so I'd have no support system and would basically have to start over in terms of social life and knowing where everything is). It's also an exempt, salaried position and I've been told by family/friends that it could mean that I would work lots of overtime for no extra pay and have horrible WLB since I don't know what team I'll be on yet (but company's reputation seems like this won't be the case, hopefully).

**Final Thoughts**

I've never lived away from home before and have been assaulted in the past, so being so far away in a new location is kind of scary for me. On the other hand, I've heard that taking a position with the SWE title and higher pay is better for long-term career prospects (and my friends think it would be a nice chance for independence for me, though I don'treally mind living at home). I think my long-term desires for a job line up with the gov job, though, despite the low returns.

Thanks in advance!"

I would like to know your insights about my current situation. Naoverwhelm po ako sa mga opportunity na naencounter ko po recently, thus having the difficulty to decide.

A little background po, I have an undergrad degree in healthcare. I am also licensed. Hindi ko na lang po sasabihin anong specific na field dahil feel ko may reddit ang superior namin lol. Anyway, hindi ka in-demand ang field namin sa Pinas, at mababa lang ang sweldo, kadalasan sa mga private clinic/practice. Medyo may kataasan pag hospital setting, lalo na pag public. Nagtry ako mag-apply pero nahirapan ako. Nagkaexperience naman ako sa clinic, pero saglit lang dahil narealized ko na highly anxious ako when handling patients, at nagiging nerbyosa ako when performing clinical duties (I discovered this one during my internship year). 

Nagtry ako magventure sa academics (na related pa din sa course ko), kaya nag-apply ako as instructor/lecturer. Natanggap naman ako despite the lack of teaching experience. Motivated talaga ako matuto. Part-time lang ito, bale babayaran kami per hours of teaching na assigned sa amin. Dahil part-time, limited hours of teaching lang. May opportunity naman na maging full-time, pero kailangan mag-master's or doctorate, magparticipate/magpublish ng research, umattend ng mga trainings/seminars, maging member ng mga organization, apart pa sa internal evaluation ng school sa amin. Once full-time ako, there's a chance that I can be a permanent faculty. Mas tataas ang sahod, and madami benefits. Okay naman ang teaching part, don't get me wrong. Masarap sa pakiramdam na gabayan at tulungan ang mga students, lalo na't napakachallenging ng online learning environment. Pero now, nararamdaman ko ang burnout because of increased demand sa work, pag-empathize at pag-support sa mga students, working beyond hours of teaching (na hindi maiiwasan kasi may mga tasks ang teachers na kailangan gawin aside sa pagtuturo). Hindi na din ako nakakatanggap ng other part-time offers/side hustles dahil sa burnout. At dahil part-time pa lang ako, di compensated ang hours beyond teaching (yung wala sa plantilla), and wala akong additional benefits (aside sa government-mandated ones). 

Ngayon, may naencounter ako na 3 opportunity:

1. May tita ako sa Japan na nakakausap ko from time to time. Last year, nagoffer siya at ang pinsan ko na magsponsor sila para makapag-aral ako ng Nihongo sa Japan. After ko matapos ang course at makapasa ng certain level, pwede ako maghanap ng work or ituloy ko ang pag-aaral ng vocational course na gusto ko para mas increase ang chance na makapagwork. Una tinatanggihan ko dahil ayaw ko din maging burden sa kanila, pero hinihikayat pa din ako ng tita ko na itry ang opportunity. Plan ko din mag-ipon muna para shoulder ko ang school expenses, pero recently pinapahanda ng tita ko ang mga documents para sana daw next year makapunta na ako dun.
2. This year, meron din akong nakitang opportunity na makapagwork sa Europe. May school na nag-ooffer ng German language course para sa mga healthcare professional. Need lang makapasa ng B2 level (professional-level), then pwede mag-apply sa employer na may connection sa language school na iyon. I think mashoshoulder ng employer ang nagastos ko once pasado na ako ng B2 at sa interview nila.
3. Opportunity din sa Europe. Meron akong former classmate na au pair sa Europe, na ineencourage akong mag au pair din. She shared her plans of studying another course there after saving money from au pairing. She also encouraged me to do the same if ever applying for my field was not successful. 

Now, gulong-gulo ako at overwhelmed sa ano ang path na i-aaccept ko. Any advice po kung ano ang mas best na i-accept? I know from myself that I am still lost in life, and I still have difficulty in deciding for myself. I have plans to avoid being stuck and lost, to improve my self-confidence, and conquer my anxiety at work. Makakatulong sana ang inyong mga insights as I contemplated what is my next step to take while also working on myself.

Maraming salamat po!  


tldr: Need advice about choosing whether to pursue full-time faculty position, accept family relative offer of helping me study in Japan, to study German to apply for a job, or to be an au pair. This lost soul just needs help and guidance. :)"

I just got offered an internship with a Fortune 500 company for their Internal IS Audit team. The main highlights of their recruitment process emphasized how well respected the team is WITHIN the company, and how almost all of their C-suite positions across the country are filled by former Internal Auditors. 

My main concern is that I might be limiting my exit opportunities with my first big boy job being in Internal Audit. It just generally seems like jobs in tech and strategy consulting (no guaranteed offers in that sphere, but recruitment hasn’t really kicked up for big 4 consulting firms) are much more respected across different companies. 

However, the culture within these consulting firms is SO toxic. I haven’t really met anyone who I’d want to emulate in all of the networking I’ve done in consulting.

What would y’all do? Is it a bad idea to limit myself with this company, even though their culture is a far better fit for me?

In my head I can hear my dad saying “one in the hand is always better than two in the bush.” What if I turn this one down and struggle to find an opportunity with as much promise?

I am working in a research internship and am the only embedded developer. In the simplest way to explain, I am building an autonomous vehicle controller that provides a single interface to control the entire vehicle with a separate computer. I am utilizing an STM32H7 dual-core dev board which on it's own is a rather complex device, but the fact that it is an AMP architecture has been giving me issues. My question centers around how should one approach testing and debugging of the system when the UART-USB is already used for the actual application and due to the system being a bunch of high-priority tasks constantly triggering the USB\_Transmit feels like a waste of system resources. In a lot of my embedded projects I am used to using the UART serial as a quick debug tool to make sure that data is going in the right places, however on such a complex device it feels wrong to do. Maybe I am just overreacting. I have tried using the built-in STLink debugging tools inside the STM32IDE but I still need time to learn how to utilize them best (also doesn't let me set enough hardware breakpoints). Since I will be needing to learn something new, any suggestions on topics I should look into regarding the testing of RTOS based systems? Thank you."

w0khv1,4,2022-07-16,Should I start a job or take some time off.,notsotechtechie,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/w0khv1/should_i_start_a_job_or_take_some_time_off/,"I've just graduated as an international student from a university in the UK. After 3 years of not visiting home mainly because of work and on some occasions because of COVID, I'm finally home and because of my job, I can't even stay here for 3 weeks.

To highlight my CV a bit, I've worked as a part-time software engineer throughout university, have 1 FAANG internship, multiple TA positions and I'm currently working as a research intern on a privately funded high-impact project which is being worked on by multiple universities (including mine). This internship finishes in September.

In my final year, I applied to multiple universities for a master's. I was rejected by all 5 universities. I had perfect LORs, and good grades: First class - the UK, 3.9 GPA - US, and overall a strong profile. However, I became overconfident, made loads of mistakes in my apps, and half-assed my SOP, I also only applied to top-tier universities which was my biggest mistake. I also think since I was doing too many things at the same time I didn't pay appropriate attention to my apps. Because of my naivety, the last few months of my final year were miserable, I was overworked with my dissertation, part-time job, TA work, and coursework. On top of all this every rejection I got basically made that time more and more depressing.

Extremely panicked, I applied for a few jobs, by that time the normal recruitment cycle was ending so there weren't many jobs available. In March 2022 I got an offer from a unicorn, which was redacted by the company because of some internal hiring issues and was told to keep in correspondence in case new roles opened, which I wouldn't have to interview for. This made me even more miserable. In May 2022, my thesis supervisor offered me the research internship as I somehow managed to score a first in my dissertation (which I accepted). Soon after this, I received a job offer from a large UK-based FinTech (which I also accepted). Now, I basically have to travel back to the UK early for VISA stuff, which I was fine with but since then some things have changed. First and the most important I didn't know how much I missed home these 3 years and I want some more time with my family. Secondly, I have mixed feelings about working at this company (partly because of how it handled recruitment and team allocation - it was very very weird). Lastly, I only get a holiday of 4 days between my current internship ending and the job starting (I've been working non-stop for 3 years, in all my summer vacations and even after graduating).

While the thought of taking a break always put my mind to ease, what scares me is the fact that other than working part-time and applying for a master's, I'd basically be doing nothing for a period of approx 8 months. On the other hand, I could be working and earning money but I also don't want to put myself in a position where I half-ass my apps again. Also, the fact that I have to leave home so early just breaks my heart (Currently I'm working from home for my internship). However, I also feel that I'm being very ungrateful that I got this job and acting like a brat when it comes to the company I'll be working at (does it really matter where you start as a Grad), and part of me also feels like I need to get over not having a break and just start the Job.

I don't know what to do, it's stressing me out quite a lot. Any advice would be highly appreciated."

1. I have been looking up tips for CVs and one of them is showing my achievements in the workplace while describing my job (e.g. improving sales by x amount). All of my work experiences have been student work experiences and very short, and I obviously can’t have had an impact on the workplace. Should I just list what I did at the jobs?

2. I have completed some Data Analytics courses with CPD credits, so should I just mention I got the credits or do I have to say how many credits I gained? Also, should I just add this under the skills section where I mention I can use Excel, Word...? I have read that it’s under the education section, but according to my school’s template this doesn’t come in.

3. Finally, what could be considered a good level of Excel, Word, PowerPoint? I have started with Excel this year, and I can do pivot tables, vlookups, charts, among other things."

**First Job: Government Job (internship return offer)**

- Location: Hybrid remote/in-person in CA

- Pay: $19/hr (~$40k annually) for the first year (the probationary period) after which it can jump to $39/hr (max pay for this position)

- Job Title: IT - DevOps Specialist

- Notes: I interned here for the past year. I love the people I work with and the WLB is great! It's close enough to home that I can still live in my childhood home (thanks to the parental units), offers a pension, plus they're really supportive in terms of mentorship and learning. The biggest issue is that the pay is way below market value and the job title is not Software Engineer (SWE).

**Second Job: Private, large, non-tech company**

- Location: Hybrid remote/in-person in OR

- Pay: $85k/year, but salaried, exempt position

- Job Title: SWE

- Notes: I really vibed with this company during the interview process and everyone I've met seems pretty happy. The biggest drawbacks are that it's located in a high COL area and it's out-of-state (so I'd have no support system and would basically have to start over in terms of social life and knowing where everything is). It's also an exempt, salaried position and I've been told by family/friends that it could mean that I would work lots of overtime for no extra pay and have horrible WLB since I don't know what team I'll be on yet (but company's reputation seems like this won't be the case, hopefully).

**Final Thoughts**

I've never lived away from home before and have been assaulted in the past, so being so far away in a new location is kind of scary for me. On the other hand, I've heard that taking a position with the SWE title and higher pay is better for long-term career prospects (and my friends think it would be a nice chance for independence for me, though I don'treally mind living at home). I think my long-term desires for a job line up with the gov job, though, despite the low returns.

Thanks in advance!"

w0nvzl,0,2022-07-16,Feeling constantly stuck and blocked at work,MasterpieceOverall63,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/w0nvzl/feeling_constantly_stuck_and_blocked_at_work/,"A month ago I took a new-grad role with a large well known company (not FAANG, think something more alike to Tesla in terms of size and longevity). I'm very grateful for the opportunity, and like the people I'm around, but am doubting my ability and fit for the role.

First off, I don't think I know how to do anything. I have 16 months of internship experience, but they were all in r&amp;d and research. The places I worked were also no where near the size of this company. This team is more applied, and while it's a machine learning team, my role is more of a backend engineer. So when they are talking about various services, utilizing APIs, and creating modules that interact with other components of their system, I quickly get lost. After a month, I'm still stuck on the most basic tasks of running and debugging things. In past roles, when I wanted to develop/debug/test code, I would clone it to my ide, connect to their server, and run the code. Here there are so many different repos and services for deployment that I still can't figure out how to approach the tasks. 

For one task, I need to debug an API on the US server (I have specific access as a citizen that most people on the team do not) and I was shown how to open a webshell and create an object, but on my server I don't have the token. The docs are really confusing and I'm still stuck on waiting for permissions from various managers. Another task is to add a small piece of information to an error log, but I still cannot figure out how to debug this repo. I tried to get permission for a service that supposedly used this repo,  but once I did and opened a webshell to look at the code, it turned out that it didn't actually use this code. The repo has barely been touched in the last month, and I reached out to the last person that used it, but he's in a different timezone and said that the repo is hard to work on.

The other issue is that a lot of the team that I need help from, both in terms of permissions and understanding things, is not in my timezone (or the US). So I often feel stuck waiting for help.

Is this normal? Does anyone here have advice for my situation? I know the team is paying me really well and are not being mean or treating me poorly, and I want to do a good job and make the most of this. I just can't help feeling useless all the time. Any input is super appreciated."

Though I think I study more than enough I have a pretty low grade average, I really can't seem to get the grades I'd like. This imho does not automatically translate to a lack of skill in future jobs, but I'm worried about how this could influence my possibilities. So I'm going to ask a few questions

\- I will have to look for an internship soon, how can I make my cv look decent? I genuinely have not done anything significant that I think I could put there to make myself look decent, of course I have a few projects that I created for solving problems that I encountered/automatizing stuff, but they are not polished/ready to be presented publicly at all and most importantly are very different in terms of technology used most varied stuff, it's not like a web dev portfolio, it's really just a collection of the stuff I at one point needed and coded for myself

\- Does a low grade average significantly hinder job search? I hoped I could move abroad (within the EU) just after uni, how hard would it be to land my first job in another EU country if I'm not anything special? If that is relevant, I think I'm above average skilled at interview stuff, leetcode and the likes, but that's it. And how hard would it be if instead I worked for some time, say 1-2 years in Italy and then tried to job search abroad?

I have a computer science internship this summer that’s 40 hours a week. It’s an AMAZING opportunity, I’m getting paid a fuckton of money plus other awesome perks and if I get a referral I can come back to the company next year as a SWE and get to fly out to the west coast. This year I’m doing the internship remotely, all from home. It’s been… okay. It’s a little frustrating having to work from home with other people around, but it’s overall been alright. Manageable. But here’s the issue.

My parents want to take a vacation. My internship ends August 5th- they want to go the 29th to the 3rd. I told them I’m working, but they’re insistent that I can work in the car while we’re traveling(6+ hours!) and then at wherever we’re staying. But I have a TON of meetings and calls that week, plus it’s crunch week. I’m no doubt going to be working 8-10 hour days. I don’t want to do that from the car, and I REALLY don’t want to do it from some random house. Plus, the timing of my hours suck. I’m on the east coast and the company I’m working for is on the west coast. My internship runs from 11AM-8PM generally. That’s the whole day. So I’m going to be inside at my desk while everyone’s enjoying their vacation, and then have like 3 hours in the evening to.. eat dinner. I have a few hours in the morning, sure, but like if I  get up at 8 I have 3 hours to do what? I usually work before that. Check my email and stuff.

All that to say, how do I tell them I don’t want to go and let them leave me at home for a week? I tried bringing it up already, but the response was “cry me a river.” This whole thing feels like bullshit, but I don’t know what to do."

I’ll have ~$50k in loans when I’m done; I have 2 years left of my degree. I’m worried about paying off my loans after my degree, that I’ll have trouble finding a high enough paying job to pay them off quick enough before the interest accrues to a ridiculous extent.

When I'm doing a test I usually like to have a mountain of papers to scribble on. So I thought that I could use some of it to shit on. I took some paper and slowly slid it down my pants. Then I released my bowels...

The shit clumped up on the thick layer of paper and when satisfied I took out the papers to throw it in the trash bin.

w0xa2b,11,2022-07-16,Can I improve my chances of getting into grad school _after_ completing an undergrad degree? Please advise.,MoonShiner999,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/w0xa2b/can_i_improve_my_chances_of_getting_into_grad/,"Hi all! I’m wondering if anyone has advice on improving your chances of getting into grad school *after* finishing an undergraduate degree?

Background: I didn’t know I wanted to go into grad school during my undergrad, but now that I’ve been out of school for a few years, I’m considering applying to some graduate programs. The thing is, my grades weren’t the highest in my undergrad (my gpa sits slightly below a B+ average) but it technically meets the minimum requirement for my top program. I had some personal issues that affected my grades at specific points during my degree (which resulted in one “incomplete” course that sits at a 0, unfortunately) but I’ve had some strong semesters with A averages as well.

The real issues that I’m having are:

a) I didn’t make very strong connections with my professors during undergrad, and I’ve been out of school for a few years now. I think this will make it awkward to ask for academic references and I don’t really know how to go about it - I’m not sure any of my profs will really remember me that well, if at all.

b) I didn’t pursue an honours thesis in my undergrad. The program I want to apply for is interdisciplinary, so my lack of science background shouldn’t be an issue, but one of the entry requirements is a “four-year honours Bachelor's degree, equivalent or Bachelor's degree with evidence of independent research capacity.” Now, I’ve done research papers/projects within regular coursework, but I’m not sure if that really qualifies as the “evidence” they’re looking for, and I know it certainly doesn’t make me stand out.

I guess this might be a strange question, but are there ways to go about finding opportunities to work on research projects outside of an academic institution? Like, could I theoretically find a project to volunteer on that would provide me similar skills that I would have gained had I contributed to a profs research in undergrad? If these opportunities exist, how could I find them? Are there other things I could do to make my application more appealing, that don’t involve going back and re-taking courses to try and boost my gpa?

I’ve had internships and contract jobs in my field of study, so I have real world hands-on experience, but it seems like grad school applications are so focused on undergrad academics that I’m not sure I have a shot at getting in, and I don’t know how to improve my chances. Has anyone had a similar experience? If so, what did you do to boost your skills/application?

Thanks so much for any advice!"

I heard that even if you clear the interview it can take weeks or months for you to be placed with a project and team. Having my candidacy delayed might lower my chances of getting placed into a team in time (even if I get selected). Not sure if 3 weeks would be enough to complete the placement process for a Fall internship

I am looking to immigrate to either the US, Canada or the EU, however, before applying to actual work in those countries, I think it would be much better if I have some work experience working at a US or EU or even a Canadian company, it increases my chances of finding a better job later on.

I was wondering is it possible to find **Remote** and **Entry Level** or even **Internship** like work abroad? The pay is not a big deal as long as the company is legit and the people are actually trying to help me out and guide me instead of exploiting me just to get cheap labour.

I did research online and on job boards, I didn't really come across entry level jobs, almost 90% of the jobs are for seniors which I am not ATM.

This is the first time I have resigned from my job after such a short time (my other jobs, apart from my internship, I stayed at for a minimum of one year). I am applying to jobs and am always being asked by recruiters and interviewers why I am looking to leave my current job which I started not that long ago.

I need a short and direct answer which I can confidently say that won’t raise a red flag but I am a really struggling to come up with a good answer.

The real reasons why I am resigning, are many:

- My manager was also new when I joined, only having joined a few months before I did, and she is the most useless manager I’ve ever worked with. Not only is she incompetent but also a micromanager, giving me wrong instructions, blowing up my personal phone with long text messages…I could go on. I was told by a colleague that the previous person in my job left because of her.

- Due to the workload and the size of the team (3 people but really only 2 doing the actual work, me and my manager) my manager has had no time to train me. Well, I quickly realised she actually wasn’t able to train me, because she didn’t know any of the processes herself. I’ve had to learn everything by myself. They hired me knowing I had only 6 months experience in the field as an intern, and this job was a big step up for me with real responsibility, so I thought they would be happy to spend time to mentor me and train me. They tell me I’m doing well and learning things quickly, but I really don’t know what I’m doing sometimes, and I don’t feel like I’m leaning in a good environment from an experienced and supportive manager

- Having to work while sick or on holiday due to workload and no one to do the work 

- Affecting my mental health and experiencing for the first time in my life severe work related stress. I had a nervous breakdown at work and would come home crying home every day 

- A stop to hybrid working/working from home and mandatory return to 5 days in the office. I want a job that allows me to work remotely for at least part of the week. I can’t stand the thought of being in an office 5 days a week

- A job has never made me feel so unhappy and depressed in my life like this one has. It’s affecting my personal life and relationships.

Please can someone help me with what to say when interviewers ask me why I am looking for a new job without saying the wrong thing….I have an interview tomorrow.

Thank you so much to anyone who reads this"

To be honest, in the first year, I didn't know anything about hardwork and only knew that I wanted to develop games. Since I was 14, I had started to observe how video games behaved, and figured it out that they might be programmed, and in my mind, I used to break down/figure out the logic and approach behind a certain event of the game while playing it. That got me interested in programming and since 14, I have been learning it on my own, but during those days it was all for fun and I used to come up with interesting programs of my own.

By the end of the first year, I developed and published a small game, and then a couple months later realized that financially, this career will take me only so far, so I decided to focus on learning software development and give up on game dev. Stupid me didn't even research
 the market and simply started learning desktop app development using Java, which isn't even in demand. I developed a couple of nice projects, including a small AI-based game, but I wasn't able to get any internship since these things weren't in demand. So the second year ended without any internship which discouraged me a lot. 

But then I learned React Native and built some nice projects in it and got an internship, and when my college rejected me leave for the internship, I did both college and internship together, which was pretty tiring. Also, an year ago before this internship, I had already taken courses on Data Structures and Advanced Data Structures and did about 150 questions on Hackerrank and 200 questions on GFG. Then I also started Codechef, but it was tough so I struggled to even get to 3-stars but somehow reached there. I just never remained unproductive in these years. I used to work on something daily, usually 3 to 4 hours of productivity everyday no matter if it's programming, projects, internship or something else.

My classmates were stunned when I got this internship and used to say that they aren't good enough because they aren't at my level, and I used to encourage them and help them at this. Most people at my university didn't have an internship experience at all. So I was seen as a achiever even at such a basic achievement.

Fast forward to six months i.e. today, almost all of those people are placed somewhere while I am unable to get into any company/startup, and I feel so discouraged looking at how plenty of first/second year students are having incredible achievments and internships at the best companies. I feel so down and so bad, because I had big ambitions and I worked hard and still they didn't get fulfilled. I didn't achieve anything big. Any competitions like Google Kickstart, CodeJam etc seemed too tough to face even after doing a ton of programming. 

It's discouraging me a lot nowadays and honestly makes me feel like a failure, and I have lost what I loved the most about myself -- ambition. It saddens me most becuase the prime motivation behind these was my childhood spent in poverty and I feel even after so much hardwork, I still won't be able to bring prosperity to my family. I hope I had been good enough to fulfill my ambitions."

Now that I have some work related experience, I am able to gauge some questions/concerns I have about my programming abilities. I love programming and see myself having a future, however, I tend to overthink so i was wondering if a SWE would be able to answer one or some of the following questions I have below... 

thank you!!

&amp;#x200B;

1. Do you recommend exploring different types of development (Front-End, Back-End, Full Stack, Game Development, etc.) while I am young into my career?
2. How many hours do you put in every week at your job and how are you able to balance work-life and the stresses that may come with it?
3. Do you spend time outside of your job learning new technologies and keeping up with Software Development, and if so, how many hours do you typically put in?
4. What is your end goal when it comes to software engineering? Would you transition into systems engineering or would you like to work up to being a lead SWE?
5. When did you first learn to program and what advice would you have for someone like me, who took an interest in programming while in college? Sometimes I feel like i am further behind than others because i took an interest in SWE later. 
6. Do you deal with imposter syndrome and how do you remove those negative mental blocks? I sometimes struggle with this because I tend to stress myself out when i don’t understand something right away or don’t know how to implement or build something initially
7. Do you recommend anything I can do in my free time that would separate me from the competition or elevate my skills to becoming a better SWE?
8. How do i get myself out of “tutorial hell” ? it feels like when i try to learn a new language or technology, i am constantly falling into tutorial hell and it is causing my learning and knowledge of programming to become stagnant?"

I'm currently nearing the end of my Master's, with 1YOE as an intern. I am currently undergoing interviews and I (half-unknowningly) said my salary expectations ranged between 45-60k per year. They said they could be met, but towards the lower end. These represent gross income.

The job is for a data-centric role with some back-end work as well.

I looked up some things and did some math, and I believe this would correspond to about 2.6k net monthly.

2 questions: is my math correct? And are these values acceptable to work/live in Amsterdam?

Thanks in advance."

I've always been good at math and I enjoyed programming courses I took in high school, so I landed on a combined CS/Math degree. I figured that I'd take some classes and through that experience I'd get a sense of what I want to do for work, and I could go from there.

Now flash forward to me today, I'm graduating in 6 weeks, and I'm still just as clueless. At best, I've narrowed it down to the things I don't want to do, but outside of that I'm really having trouble finding a role that suits my skills. Hopefully if I tell you all a bit about myself you can give me some advice here.

* I do not want to be *just* doing programming at my job, I can't be a software dev. I think to do well in a career like that you have to be *really* committed to being a ""CS guy"" which I just can't bring myself to do. I enjoy programming as a tool to help me solve problems in my work, but I do not enjoy the process of actually developing complex software.

* I'm a big numbers guy. I think my best bet is a career that is somewhere in the range of data science/statistician, but for all of those careers not only is entry level work seemingly super overpopulated, but I also lack a lot of the formal experience I would need on that front because I've been doing just general math/cs stuff. I've taken a few stats classes, I have some experience with Python and SQL, but like, no Tableau, no PowerBI, no R, no super heavy DS/stats classes, etc.

* I'm very willing to start from zero on any career, as long as its something that fits within my degree. If what it takes to get on the right career path is working a stupid internship for a few bucks over minimum wage to gain the skills I need, I'm totally down to do it. What I need is something to work towards that I actually have some interest in. I've been coasting off the guide rails of ""do well in school, get a good degree, worry about the rest later"" since my junior year of high school at this point. I've always been an ""excellent student"" aka I'm really good at gaming tests and putting in the exact amount of work necessary to maintain my grades (graduating with honors I pulled the 3.51 GPA lol). Now it's time to commit to something, and I want to commit to something that actually interests me at some level.

* I'm open to getting a master's at some point. At my current university I already would automatically get some of my grad school tuition covered based on academic record. I imagine if I waited a few years, did some work in a chosen field, and then went back and aced the GRE's I could get some serious financial aid at most colleges.

Hopefully I wasn't too long winded. If there's any other questions you have feel free to ask, I've left this pretty intentionally open-ended as to not accidentally rule out any ideas."

I got my first FT job at an e-commerce company in BizManagement. I’ve been bored to death for 6 months. I make 50k which is paycheck to paychec. I probably got everything done daily by 11a. I was bored, it was below my skill set, but it was a foot in the door at this company. I’ve tried to build a portfolio, and I’ve used Tableau a lot. I’ve taken Data Viz classes and enjoyed them. 

Anyways, a “Data Viz Specialist” job opens at my company. I interview twice, sent some of my work (basic dashboards) and got the job. FINALLY, I’m in the DS and I’m trying to be happy about my pay (75k). Sports jobs paid me $8-12 an hour and 50k sucked, I know it’s not a lot and people on Reddit have given me a hard time, but I’m hoping it’s a good start salary wise. 

Now the issue is…do I deserve it. I start tomorrow. But my new boss had me on some of our daily standup calls last week to get my face out there. They’re all nice. But the environment is way different. These are all very smart and technical people. I’m brand new. I haven’t worked in sprints, I really haven’t  been all that involved in this company because my work beforehand was so entry level that I began to feel checked out. But it’s agile development talk, sprints, people asking about iterating on dashboards. 

I think they hired me for a reason right? I didn’t make anything up in my interviews. I use stuff like StackOverFlow and Discord a lot, but I work hard and hope there’s high earning potential. But I feel overmatched? New words I’m not used to - smoke testing, blockers, a little more nitty gritty language overall. But I’m nervous. I’m starting to doubt myself. I’ve signed up for some Udemy classes to brush up. But I am pretty scared. 

I want to celebrate. I finally got a job in this field, I love Data viz, it’s also a career that’s more high earning and I’m finally on a bigger salary. But I don’t know. Am I a fraud? What do they expect? I did see some side eyeishness from people who hear where I come from. And I get why. But career change is possible. I don’t know. I mostly needed to vent and I feel sort of scared. I want to be a team player and do well, I’ve excelled everywhere I’ve been. But I want to be good at this new thing and build a strong future for myself doing work I feel like is more of my calling and make a good chunk of change along the way. I just hope they didn’t make a mistake and I’ll be out of a job in 6 months…"

So, long story short : I cannot start my masters degree in law this year. I have one year before I can apply to colleges again. 


My main goal is to improve and become smarter, I’d like find things to do, related to law (internships, etc) so I can gain some more experience and improve, start my masters degree with more knowledge.

BUT this is the first time I ever have one year “free” of anything (school, work, etc).
Although the thought of having so much free time is soothing to me as I have been dealing with a very busy schedule due to law school for five years, I am also a bit scared of having so much free time and I worry I might feel something is missing (miss how busy I was). ButI know it’s very unlikely something like this will happen to me again (near future, as I am still young, I mean). I have MANY interests and using this year to improve on all of them seems unreasonable and unrealistic (unless you think otherwise?). 

Art, sport, science, literature, religion, etc.

How can I maximize my time and what can I do to change, grow as a person, become smarter, better?

Have you ever found yourself in a similar situation?

My fear is to come out of this year the same. I would very much love to improve and change completely for the better.

I am a PCMB student and although I'm going to appear for JEE and probably NEET too next year I don't think my heart lies in either of those streams. And the thought of spending the rest of my life doing something I am not even interested in the first place, really disturbs me. But, again at this point I'm not sure what I actually want to do in life. So, yeah maybe I'm the only one but it would be of great great help if I could find a detailed article about this.
* 12	Everything you need to know to apply to foreign schools and how to estimate your chance of getting into one.
* 13	Why are JRFs forced to do a PhD?Is it just because the university wants save funds as it is cheaper to have a PhD candidate than a JRF? Or are there other motivations?

* 29	MS experience from abroad, special focus on Jobs
* 30	career path and scope of engineers working in VLSI design and computer architecture in India.
* 31	different career paths for a computer science student or a computer science engineer. It should give students an insight about what they may have to do at work or to try for a different position.
* 32	Part-Time sources of income for students in schools and colleges \[advices concerning an Indian-Specific environment\]
* 33	step by step guide on foreign education after high school in india
* 34	Could we have people who are working in some xx field post a detailed guide on  1. how to find employment off campus in their field, and  2. what online courses/projects etc we could do while still in school to be more competitive
* 35	Detailed review of &lt;your college/university&gt;  1. Which course/year you are in  2. What are the Pros and Cons of your college, in academic, non-academic and placement scenarios
* 36	BCA vs B.Sc (Computer Science) vs B. Sc (Information Technology) vs B. Tech (Computer Science Engineering)
* 37	Which engineering branch is right for you? This is so that people don't blindly run after cse and actually choose the branch they would enjoy and can excel in it
* 38	Scope of BDS course and books, instruments required in it.
* 39	BDS vs BAMS course, which one is better?
* 40	humanities courses in delhi university? Their scope? Course over college? How to maximize the experience?
* 41	CAT and general MBA advice. Like is MBA right for you, when is the right time to pursue it, what should be the expectations, what are the pros and cons.
* 42	Using various digital platforms and softwares to aid learning by visualization, active learning,using other blended learning techniques etc , especially for science students.For ex- There's desmos a graphing calculator and similarly geogebra for 3D calculator, geometry etc, these softwares can enhance student's math learning experience.Similarly there's molview for chemical compounds and bonding visualization which can enhance chemistry learning experience.Likewise there would be many such services/softwares and we should also make a list of them to help students learn better!

* 44	Syllabus needs to include real life topics like parenting, mental health, home maintenance, how to enjoy life, financial planning, etc
* 45	lesser-known professions or sector which the general public think aren't good enough, but surprisingly pays well or have some other advantage like good work-life balance.

w1nomr,5,2022-07-17,The case against CS master’s degrees,reddit_rar,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/w1nomr/the_case_against_cs_masters_degrees/,"I am considering pursuing a Master's Degree in Computer science. Why? Because I want to learn the fundamentals of computer science as well as apply such knowledge elegantly and extensively in applied project work.   


However, I've heard from multiple sources that the majority of Master's programs within the United States are *cash cows*. What I've heard repeatedly is that the ideal route is to complete a rigorous undergraduate degree in Computer Science and receive internships at good tech firms.  


Unfortunately, I made different choices. I chose to complete a Sc.B. in Biomedical Engineering. I only did a few courses in C.S. out of cursory interest, and I'm currently a Technical Data Analyst as a healthcare tech company. However, I would like to truly be competent as both a computer scientist and as a technologist/engineer. So I was interested in pursuing a Master's degree in CS.  


But I recently read [this article](https://ozwrites.com/masters/) and now I'm questioning whether my path is correct. What do you all think? And obviously the most credible input will come from those who have either pursued Master's programs themselves or decided against doing so."

Should I quit work and dedicate my time to being a better candidate for future jobs??"
w1olg2,1,2022-07-17,Choosing between a job and last year of master’s degree,Timetosailaway,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/w1olg2/choosing_between_a_job_and_last_year_of_masters/,"I started grad school last year, and with the encouragement of my advisor, I got a summer internship. We both agreed it would be good to do because I planned on going to industry after grad school. 


I have 3 classes left to take, and a thesis to write, and the plan was to do this over the next do semesters and graduate next spring. However, now that my internship only has a few weeks left, I find myself really not wanting to leave. I’ve been trying to get ahold of my research advisor the last few weeks, but he’s been MIA. 


My job has expressed interest in hiring me, and they have a position they’re looking to fill right now anyway. They also told me that there would almost certainly be a spot for me in the next year after finishing school. I just don’t know if I would come back next spring after leaving though. I would have lost momentum on all my projects, and I would be more inclined to find a job that feels more new and exciting. 


I’m thinking I could do one class a semester online for the next few semesters while working full time. I did take an accelerated class this summer, and it wasn’t always fun, but I did it. And I think the pain might be worth it if I get to keep doing a job I really enjoy. I might have to pay out of pocket for tuition though if I’m not on campus to do an RA or TA job which isn’t ideal, but doable. 


I would love to hear thoughts and advice from others who have been in or seen a similar situation. Should I stay or should I go back to school in person? 

TIA"

Data Structures at my university is the de facto class for becoming ""hiring ready"" in terms of competitive interviews involving data structures and leetcode type questions. I'm assuming that taking this class will help the internships following it to be at better companies. 

I can choose one of two options:

A) Graduate in 4.5 years with 4 summer internships, 1 of which is after Data Structures

B) Graduate in 4.5 years with 3 summer internships, 2 of which are after Data Structures

Which should I choose?"

I'm not sure what would be better in terms of finding employment and long term stability. 

If I went the CS route, I'd be finished by next summer. Is associates enough to get an internship somewhere, or would it be better to finish a BS?

The Web Dev is a year long and I hear its pretty intense. If I went the Web Dev route, I would have a portfolio with the assignments I've done. It might be easier finding an internship by specifying in just Web Dev.

I'm 36 and started self learning in January (mostly JS) and decided to take 3 programming courses at the local college (PHP, JAVA, SQL). I should finish with As.  

Programming is something I'm definitely going to keep doing. I'm just not sure what the right path is. 

Any insight would be great."

I've seen plenty of ppl with no college degree, really young, no advanced training, etc start successful businesses and just do it.

I see myself doing that, but for the past 5 years I've been in school, gaining technical skills, etc. I paused school to work and wanted to start a business then, but had no ideas I wanted to go with so enrolled back in school (CompSci). And now I'm considering doing a Fall internship, delaying my graduation by a semester. And hopefully starting a business after graduating and working.

I tell myself I want to offer real value to the world so I'm focusing on developing my skills, but I see plenty ppl offering value without focusing on that, so sometimes I think what's the point? I'd be happy with a successful venture whether I have the technical skills or not.

Successful entrepreneurs of this subreddit, have any of you felt like you were stalling or delaying too much before starting your first venture?

I got a Computer Science degree from one of the most renowned schools in the US. Not only did I graduate, but I got a 4.0. However, I actually can't code at all without using google. For instance, I do not know how to create a single executable program in any coding language without help from google. I also don't know much programming terminology without looking up what the terms mean. I was only able to get through school with a lot of help from google and by having a a near photographic short term memory. I also worked a pretty decent internship and made some impressive projects (all with the help of google).

&amp;#x200B;

Today I had an interview with a large tech company, and I could not answer any of their technical questions or complete any of their coding challenges. One of the people conducting the interview appeared frustrated and started berating me, and told me that it's obvious I lied about my education and that I can't get a job through lying since companies will contact the school for my transcripts. I told him I wasn't lying but he was not convinced. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I did so poorly in an interview that I was told it obvious I was lying about the education that I 100% did receive.

Edit: some people think I’m bragging about using google for everything. That’s not the case, I’m actually deeply ashamed of how little I know"

w1ufr8,2,2022-07-18,Change location and service line after internship,atlanta_w,Big4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Big4/comments/w1ufr8/change_location_and_service_line_after_internship/,"So I’m interning in Assurance at one of the Big4 in the UK. For background, I study Maths and Stats at a RG uni, on track for 2:1. Throughout my internship, I’ve been weighing up the pros and cons.

I love the company and the people, but I haven’t been enjoying audit much. I’m also doing the internship closer to uni (Birmingham), but I’d wanna be further north for a grad job, so I’m thinking Edinburgh or Leeds.

I’ve been looking into the other roles, and a couple of the others sound much more interesting to me: Consulting - Quantitative Advisory Services, and Consulting - Sustainable Finance. 
Basically, I wanna work with data, find patterns, work with my team, visit the client, etc. The thing I don’t like about audit is how much it focuses on the past, whereas I’d wanna be thinking more about the future too. And it’s important to me that I can keep up with the gym outside of work - which seems like it’d be a struggle in audit in busy season. 

Last week, I managed to arrange a call with someone from the QAS team and I hope to have a call this week with someone from Sustainable Finance. I’m hoping that this helps me make my decision, but also shows that I’m proactively looking into the other positions.

From reading this page, it’s unlikely they’ll let me change service lines if they were to offer me a grad job. My dilemma is whether it’d be worth changing location only, working in audit until I get qualified, and then switch? Three years seems like a big commitment.

As a side note, I was wondering as a CoE student (CE or EECS) what are some other things that would help be get internships early on? Does research experience in relate fields work? I really want to get an internship ideally next summer or even earlier if possible."
w1vgt8,1,2022-07-18,Should I take an unpaid internship? (UK),Camster3000,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/w1vgt8/should_i_take_an_unpaid_internship_uk/,"I recently graduated from University with a games degree and have since been looking for work with little to no luck. However, I recently interviewed for and was offered an unpaid internship with a start-up company but I am in two minds whether to take it or not.

On one hand, I could accept the role, get some industry experience behind my back and keep applying for paid roles whilst being ready to jump ship if I were to get one.

On the other hand, I'm not sure if it's something I should lower myself to. In the interview it was stated that they would be showing the project off to publishers and as soon as they were granted money they would start paying wages and this all sounded believable at the time, but it sounds a little like they may be exploiting people at the beginning.

This is why I'm slightly stuck on the issue. At the moment I am slightly leaning towards taking it as I'm not really doing anything during the day anyway apart from applying for jobs and a role of 20 hours a week where I'm getting experience may be a beneficial use of that time.

What would you all do?"

Does it have to be an internship to qualify for this visa do you know or can it be just a regular job in the area of computer science/software development? 

It seems USIT is the most popular company to go through the process of obtaining the visa however they don't help with securing the job, any tips/advice on this part would also be of help!

And it's not easy work or anything, it requires you to spend at least 30 mins - 1 hour just working through the details. Apparently this is considered ""voluntary consent"" to work overtime..

My work timings are from 8.30am - 5.45pm, but everyday I only get to leave around 6.30pm - 7.30pm. I don't get paid overtime nor any benefits so it's really starting to stress me out over the extremely long working hours. 

Contemplated to tell my supervisor that I did not want to work overtime but I'm afraid that it would affect my internship marks..
Tried to bring up this case with my care teacher but was just told to suck it up if I didn't want to fail my internship. My parents and friends also told me to just deal with it for a better future..

I'm really stressed out and my mental health is probably declining progressively as well. I can't even take medical leave as our maximum is 5 days of MC, and anymore than that? Well, gotta stay at the company much much longer.

What would you all advise?"
w1y4c2,497,2022-07-18,When you can no longer provide support because the VoIP config kills the site-to-site VPN tunnel,notthatjohncena,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/w1y4c2/when_you_can_no_longer_provide_support_because/,"*(Second time trying this post, apologies)*

\------------------

 

When  I was but a wee intern working toward my role as a Infrastructure  Security Admin, I was at one SMB that had purchased an even smaller SMB,  and the entire IT team consisted of myself and my manager. Given the  nature of the team, we had to rely on telecom support and consultants to  complete large scale projects on time. For our story today, the  colorful cast of characters includes:

&gt;**$me**  
**$con: our external consultant**  
**$mgr: my manager**  
**$tel: telecom rep**

One  of our primary goals after the acquisition was to transfer their  network systems to our domain, and prior to $mgr being able to go  on-site out of state, we asked $tel for a list of the deployed hardware  to ensure compatibility. We knew we had to upgrade the local systems to  Windows 8.1 to match the systems on our domain, and at least Server  2008R2 at that time. $mgr and I compiled the inventory list, wrote a  plan out for joining servers in a particular order to the domain, and  the steps needed for a smooth transition such as demoting their DCs at  the correct time.

The first step  we wanted to execute was establishing a site-to-site VPN tunnel. Not  only for the IPSec encapsulation, we wanted to ensure that our RADIUS  server would be able to allow them to join our older VPN client. This  went off without a hitch, although their was expected latency due to the  physical distance and being on different network classes (A for ours, C  for theirs). That's when we got worried...seeing a 192.168 IP on a  domain isn't necessarily bad, but when we noted that **ALL** the IPs were in the *same subnet*, that raised alarms. $mgr called me on my cell.

&gt;**$mgr: Houston...we definitely have problems.**  
**$me: Oh? How bad is it?**  
**$mgr: Well, you saw the IPTable, right?**  
**$me: Yeah...**  
**$mgr: Do you see any hostnames?**  
**$me: Now that you mention it, nothing has populated in DNS---oh fudge!**  
**$mgr: Yeah, they're all on a workgroup. No domain. They have one server running on Core and connects via Telnet.**  
**$me: So cancel any PTO for the time being?**  
**$mgr: Might be a good idea.**

This  being Tales From Tech Support, there is support upcoming; I wanted to  give you a good idea of how badly cobbled together the telecom company  had made this ""domain,"" it was a home setup in a corporate office.  Printers were on DHCP from the basic low power router provided by the  ISP. In fact, all devices were on DHCP, without an actual server in  place. Everyone saved locally to C:\\ since there was no file server in  place. Everyone had local admin permissions, and installed whatever  software they wanted to use. Traffic logs showed heavy usage of  Farmville on Facebook daily. Houston, we have all the problems.

We  were attempting to copy their files over the VPN tunnel to our file  server, but the network traffic was throttled. Fair enough, our network  speed was fine for our traffic, but we knew we needed to up the speeds  adding a remote hot site to our network.I received a phone call from an  end user regarding a printer being out of toner; I asked if they had  existing service contracts, or if they ordered supplies directly. While  discussing this, the network ***goes down immediately.***  WTF? Was it the large files being transmitted over the network? I hang  up to investigate, and soon thereafter the ping resumes and traffic is  restored. I receive a call from $mgr again, this time from a ""landline.""

&gt;**$mgr: What's going on? I lost connectivity.**  
**$me: Well, it looks like you're about to lose it again...and it's gone.**  
**$mgr: What are you doing over there?**  
**$me: Troubleshooting something on Exchange, but I keep my eyes on the traffic.**  
**$mgr: I need you to--*****silence***

Oh man. Phone call dropped, this can't be good. $mgr calls me back on my cell after a couple minutes.

&gt;**$mgr: I tried calling back on the office line, I think I know the problem.**  
**$me: Oh good, looks like the network is back up too.**  
**$mgr: About that...these aren't landlines. These are VoIP.**  
**$me: Didn't they say their wiring is a Bonded T1? And they're running VoIP?**  
**$mgr:  Bingo. Now that we have an S2S Tunnel, if they receive calls, it's  going to kill the network. I have to get $tel on the phone.**  
**$me: Should I call $con?**  
**$mgr: Absolutely.**

After  the ordeal, we arrive at the conclusion that some calls need to be  made, and with $con's assistance I was able to remotely disable their  end of the VPN tunnel. Following some words of ~~anger~~  encouragement from $mgr, we got $tel to arrive on the scene rather  quickly. A few troubleshooting scenes later, we got the credentials  needed to login to the console to change the codec from G.711 (64 Kbps)  to G.723.1 (5.3-6.3 Kbps) and ordered PoE switches since there were no  UPS or switches in place to manage the softphones. First order of  business was getting new lines installed at the facility, Bonded T1  (1.544Mbps on our network) was not going to be suitable.

$tel  admitted that they just pulled hardware off the shelf whenever  convenient, so we had them order the same make and model of phone for  uniformity as well. Once everything was settled, we were able to  reinstate the VPN tunnel and have phone calls without killing the  network. Once everything was finalized overall, $tel was told their  services were no longer needed and an on-site admin was hired.

TL;DR:  telecom put high compression VoIP on a Bonded T1 which killed the  network once it was joined to a domain. Users tried calling in to complain, further killing the network."

Is there a special or best place to look for jobs within the software world? (Indeed, LinkedIn, Google, etc)

Is there a internship type job for self taught engineers? 

All the internship positions I see specifically state attending a university. But I’m not quite ready to be considered entry level I don’t think. I can continue learning but wanted to know if there was a way to get to work sooner."

Looking for some advice on how to progress my GIS career. I am currently about to be a senior in college and I’m in a GIS internship right now. I am a Geography Major and will be getting my GIS certificate in the fall. I took an intro GIS class to see what it was all about and have been obsessed ever since. We use an app called Cartegraph and whatever data we collect is automatically linked to ArcGIS online. Ultimately, it’s more technician field work than anything else. I have a friend who’s in another internship and he’s been able to create more maps, has been learning Python and Tableau, and other types of programming stuff. I feel like he’s getting more out of it than I am. I’ve seen so many cool maps and data he’s been working with and that’s the kind of work I want to get into. I’ve been working on learning QGIS this summer and have joined the GIS association for my state and have been taking the online MOOC course. I also do have a storymap made with all of my personal projects I’ve worked on in GIS. I will be taking a Python class during my senior year to see if I enjoy programming and may take some boot camps with programming if I do. I would have done this earlier but I actually had a career change after my sophomore year. I know programming is a good way to go up the pay scale in GIS (I know still less than other software engineers). Looking for some advice on other things I should be learning for GIS so I can add some fluff to my resume besides this internship. Any suggestions would be appreciated on what I should be learning!"

My goal is to  be at the top of the hierarchy. IDK what exactly is the top.

I  know that most companies have tech positions like: senior developer,  tech lead, architect, and on the top, someone like the owner of the  company, or some VPE, CTO, etc.

I'm confused about the top position that I can get at.

I know that in a hierarchical vision, have something like that:  
Intern  &gt; Jr. &gt; Mid level &gt; Senior, and here maybe a senior can choose  some position that is in horizontal choice and not in a hierarchical  vision, like tech lead - maybe a project manager or something like a  software architect. I trying to say, if you're a senior dev and want to  advance, you have multiple choices in the same hierarchical position,  maybe.

So, what can I be? In this  case, have two scenarios: working for companies or being an  entrepreneur, and maybe both need similar knowledge.

For  now, I have in my mind to follow the path: Jr to Senior and choose the  next option. Like tech lead, specialist, or architect.

I'm very confused. Can you give me your two cents?"

I've come to learn quickly that robotics or hardware related careers do not interest me at all and that I'm being heavily influenced by my hopes of a 6  figures salary. I'd rather be more content and not miserable at my job than to make lots of money. I'm majoring in computer science and I recently started minoring in political science hoping that I can get involved with big data analysis, digital sociology, or social simulations. I took a data structures and algorithms class last semester and I enjoyed the class a lot despite it being difficult. I'm a big nerd for 'getting the big picture' that I enjoy learning about psychology, philosophy, history, and political science in my free time reading. I'd like to put it to practical use with my major in computer science in the prospects of a computational social science career after university. As a top second, I also considered doing data science but I was thinking I would have to change majors and I would have to stay in school for at least a couple more years.

Is a computational social science career feasible in today's job market? If not, what other careers do you suggest fall under what I've described above? I'm open to all suggestions.

After finishing high school, I applied to US for student visa but got rejected. So I have been doing bachelors in my home country in a mediocre college. I started C as first programming language and then Java. Afterward we studied web languages: JavaScript and PHP. Unfortunately, there was no Python subject in my syllabus, so I thought of learning on own. Before I used to browse r/learnjava  and used MOOC Java from Helsinki University. Then I also saw 'Introduction to Python' course, and as I was already familiar with the site, I started to learn from it. My additional material was Mosh Hamedani video from YouTube. Then from this sub, I also got to know about ""100 days of Python"" and bought the course. I have watched some of her videos and also did small project: Hangman and Cyphertext. Then I started to do CS50p after finishing my 4th semester exam. It is going quite well and am finishing exercises faster than I though. I also have not watched much of lecture videos but focused on problem sets.

At this point of time, I have got materials to learn but not much guidance, team work and and job opportunities. I frequently see top posts (month) from this sub, r/learnprogramming, r/cscareerquestions and r/csMajors to know different ideas on learning programming and job related things. While I am able to do tough questions after some time, when I see the original solution, I am disappointed for not doing similarly and also not improving in future. I also don't seem to have roadmap on how to learn Python further. In my country, there are very few opportunities for programming related jobs. I am thinking of completing CS50p as fast as possible. When I get the certificate I will post it in LinkedIn for remote intern opportunities. Or am I missing something and that just learning basics to somehow intermediate Python is not enough for getting intern? Also are there any people who I can learn python with. I am open to learning in group."

I have so far been enjoying my time as an intern (assurance) in a relatively large office (Midwest, that is as specific as I’ll get however due to anonymity) however I am getting more and more scared by the hours.

To put it in perspective, everyone on my team is working 12 hour days 7 days a week and I have jumped along with them usually doing 10 or 11. 

Everyone on my team seems to be acting like this is normal, but my fear comes from not only their lack of work life balance but also their lack of interest in work life balance. 

They talk about things such as seeing no advances in their romantic relationships and how they won’t get married or have kids due to career limitations with doing so. 

My concern is that I don’t want to be this person. I get it, in my 20’s it’s very doable and it is what I am planning on doing but my fear is coming from how genuinely sad everyone seems. They all seem so tired all the time.

My overall question is is this really normal for all Big 4 teams? Is this actually the lifestyle? Or am I circumstantially on a relatively overworked team? 

I don’t actually mind the hours or the work, and my team is all very nice I just genuinely am sad seeing how work consumes them to this extent and don’t think it’s something I could do in the long run."

For background this is my first job in my field(Software Engineering)out of college. I was desperate to get a job since I had no internship experience so I accepted a fairly low salary offer when I started (About 15% from the average in the state I live in).That was 2 years ago now.  At first The area I lived in was cheap enough to survive on that but now the cost of living has jumped so dramatically that I am struggling to survive any longer. The company is a smaller company about 150-200 employees and my SW team is fairly small(7 full time people).


I have volunteered to take on more responsibility and I am now the expert on a specific piece of technology within my company. I am the only person knowledgeable and I enjoy that I have been able to help with customer issues but that has taken away from my time developing software. 

Recently my boss has been hiring more junior engineers to help us out and has said out loud to me and other managers that I am a valuable engineer and he would like me to be able to prioritize software over customer issues.

Outside of 3 members of the team who are 10+ year veterans in the field I am the most senior member on my team. But I am being looked over for interviews for new candidates in favor of a junior engineer with less than 6 months experience. I understand that he may want a fresh college students opinion on candidates but I can't help but feel I'm being overlooked. 

I know I am paid less than these new younger engineers and I have taken a lot on my plate. I don't know how to approach my manager about my compensation and my want to stay here and drive this team forward. 

Can I ask for some advice/reality check if I'm just being delusional?"
w2c601,5,2022-07-18,Need advice regarding how to move forward in programming,Wajeehrehman,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/w2c601/need_advice_regarding_how_to_move_forward_in/,"Not sure if this is the correct subreddit to ask if not let me know I will remove this post at the earliest.

So I currently work as an IT Support and for the longest time since in my college years I was really bad at programming I did not know what an array or functions were fast forward now I got the hang of the fundamentals in python still struggle in OOP though and can write a program that is not too complex for example how to fetch data from an API and perform a specific task that much.

But I still believe I am still not good enough and sometimes even struggle with the basics that would be obvious to another one on the spot or would take a lot of time to figure out a solution or it could be my own perspective

I am self-learning I tried different Moocs but quit halfway either I am not getting it or the instructor is boring or I can't understand the concept

I did an online internship and they had me build a full stack app that was the most fun I had and made a full stack app by giving specific requirements it took me 2 months with a really bad front end and just a good back end. But I believe I will never get a chance again because that application was not as per industry standards.

However, at the same time, I thinking of going back to college for CS but it is too expensive.

So I ask the community how should I proceed as follows particularly in web dev as I wish to ditch my Support job.

1. Ditch the courses and just start developing stuff doesn't matter how long I take to make
2. Get an online boot camp (udemy) and stick with it then start making my projects
3. Grind leet code and then proceed with making projects.
4. Go back to college
5. Do more practice problems via a book and have a strong fundamental foundation

I hope I don't get much criticized I am just confused cause it still appears that though I am making a bit of progress when I get stuck I believe I get back to square one.

Thanks in advance"
w2cahr,8,2022-07-18,"CS Masters students, what’s your experience been like?",scooterjake2,UIUC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/w2cahr/cs_masters_students_whats_your_experience_been/,"I am currently planning on graduating in spring 2023 with a bachelors in psychology &amp; philosophy with a minor in computer science! Sadly I found my love for computer science much too late into my undergraduate path to fully transfer.

I am writing this post because i saw the other day while checking my minor requirements, that the online masters program provides guaranteed admission to cs majors or minors provided they have a 3.0 gpa within the last two years and a 3.2 gpa for cs courses.

I found what ive been studying in cs fascinating and i would like to learn more, my hastily constructed plan was to apply for an internship this year, work for next year, and apply for graduate school for fall 2024.

My questions to the cs masters students are:

-for the 3.2 gpa requirement is this per cs class or overall cs class average? (I make both requirements currently but i am just curious incase i struggle with the higher level course work)

-i have currently complete the minor pathway up to cs173 and i am taking 225 in the fall, i am not worried as i find data structures fascinating and i dont typically struggle in a class when i really want to learn something, however my question is for my two 400 level courses, what courses should i take to prep for grad school?

-what’s your experience with grad school been like? What was your undergraduate experience and how do you feel thats effected your grad school experience?

Thanks for taking the time to read/respond to my questions and im excited for what you all have to share!

Edit: Guaranteed admission for cs minors and majors for that meet gpa requirements is for the *online* masters program specifically"

w2f07u,1,2022-07-18,What should I do? Crush on my fellow intern.,throwawayyy3738382,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/w2f07u/what_should_i_do_crush_on_my_fellow_intern/,"I have a bit of a crush on one of my coworkers, we are doing a summer internship together. There’s an entire group of interns, but he’s the one who I talk to the most and am closest with for sure since I am generally a pretty quiet person.



He’s a very friendly and kind person, and super out of my league in personality, looks, and achievements. In addition, he is quite socially adept, in contrast to me. I hung out with him this past weekend and I had a really good time, I think he also had a good time but I am still a bit worried he is just trying to appease me/feels bad that I have had trouble making friends with the other interns. I’m not sure if he can tell that I am into him, either - I have zero idea how to flirt.



What should I do? I want something with him, but I am not sure if it is worth embarrassing myself."
w2f631,2,2022-07-18,Reaching the end of my paid internship in the Soft Eng division of mid-size company and was offered to be brought on as a part time employee during my next school year in university. Should I ask for my rate to be raised to match other companies’ part time software engineering rates?,DnA_1120,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/w2f631/reaching_the_end_of_my_paid_internship_in_the/,"As background, here’s some info and worries:

For my internship I was making around $20/hr after taxes and this was full time 40hr/week scheduling. Part time would be exactly what it sounds like; I work less hours while I go to school and study, until next summer where the internship cycle repeats.

As for my worries, I know I don’t have my degree yet so I’m sure that will affect my prospective rate, but I’m also unsure because I know that I’d still be considered a part-time employee in their company just as anyone else would be, degree or otherwise.

I also know that my team really enjoyed having me on and I’ve provided a lot of substantial work that they say they’d expect out of a full-time hire post-undergrad. I’m not sure if that should factor into me asking for a higher rate, but university is expensive (I’m US-based as you can tell after reading that) and I really hope that I can do this work and benefit from the good pay and the experience I’d get while in school.

Any help/insight would be really appreciated!"

w2go1r,11,2022-07-18,chance a mid indecisive asian gal for duke + more,rosyyuanfen,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/w2go1r/chance_a_mid_indecisive_asian_gal_for_duke_more/,"if you know me irl... no you don't 😊 sorry this is so long but i tried to be detailed (also mid as in ec's in context to my school not test scores lol)

**Demographics:** female, chinese-american, competitive public magnet (t100 high school lol)- usually sending off \~10-15 kids to t20s each year, upper middle class

**Hooks:** regional area ig if that means anything? (think deep deep south, hurricane hotspot lmfao)

**Intended Major(s):** psych/public health/health policy (possible paired w math/stats but most likely not applying for those majors) - if you can't tell i'm indecisive

**ACT/SAT/SAT II:** act 35, sat 1550 (writing 10), psat 1490

**UW/W GPA and Rank:** uw 4.0, we don't rank but if i had to guess i'd say top 5-10%

**Advanced Coursework:** ap human (5), ap euro (5), ap physics c mech (4), ap calc bc (4), ap eng lit (5), apush (4) , local coding class w/ certificates in both advanced/basic levels back in soph year

**Senior Year Courseload**: ap physics c e&amp;m, ap lang, ap gov, ap microecon, ap macroecon , ap stats, ap spanish, linear algebra + diff equations

* science olympiad state comp award
* national award for work as secretary in service org
* pvsa gold (this summer)

2. paid psych internship at state flagship (competitive application/interview-based summer program) this summer
3. founder + president + editor in chief of literary journal- debuting 4 new literary journals this fall, won national award for one of our publications (vague to avoid getting doxxed)
4. vice president/software team director/city council rep for region-wide service org/youth council- raised $2k for disaster relief, led drive for over 1500 donations for homeless shelter, leading annual period drives, leading semesterly mental health awareness seminars, volunteering w local organizations, working on leading development of our own club website

6. speech and debate officer- qualified for nationals 3x 
7. science olympiad officer  

tbh i don't really know how to order the following extra activities bc of the 10 activity common app limit, but here are additional activities:

1. tri-m music honor society officer  
2. vice president of chinese culture 
3. volunteer physics tutor  
4. volunteer vocab tutor (\~200 service hours)
5. writing- published in small online literary magazines  
6. piano- competing in local comps

as u can tell i'm very much all over the place lol and i'm gonna have to trim these down bc of the activities section limit; also thinking of starting psych-related passion project these coming months to make my narrative more cohesive

**Essays/LORs/Other:** 

* essays: i'm a good writer but i'm also the most boring person i know so we'll see how that goes
   * for supps tho i think i'm decent at gauging fit factor so hopefully if i don't procrastinate **😁**
* lor 1: physics teacher, going to have had him for the 3rd year now. not super close but i say hi everyday and he's told me how much he appreciates me being considerate + helpful to my partners; his letter def carried my cs summer program app too bc i had no stem in there LMFAO.  gave me outstanding physics award but that was back in freshman year so hopefully the good opinion is still there. tl;dr probs 6-7/10
* lor 2: english lit teacher, has told me in google doc comments lol and emails how much he likes my essays (made my ego go &gt;&gt;&gt; bc he's known for being a notoriously picky grader) and used them a lot of times for examples but we're not very close and he's writing like 40+ lor's so i'm a little worried lmfao. tl;dr probs 4-5/10
* lor 3: counselor lmfao. working hard to construct a cohesive narrative for the counselor rec sheet forms she sent out to us and once again i say hi to her on the daily so hopefully decent (as far as a counselor rec goes lol). tl;dr probs 7/10 for a counselor rec

i landed my first job 3 weeks after graduating college and had some experience from internship. i accepted the first job offer that came to me and it was for a small (worth 30mil) logistics company working from home. this job is quite stressful and i have to do a lot of customer relationship creating and maintenance, i dont mind that because i am a people person. have 95 clients in my region (i am a manager) and 200+ independent contractor drivers who report to me. i understand my expectations. however my responsibilities have piled on. 

i have been working here for about 5 months now and i’ve noticed these red flags :

1) i did not receive enough training when i started , maybe 2 weeks then i was thrown into the fire 

2) my old supervisor told me he doesn’t have time to be on the phone with me for daily tasks i heard this the first time about  3 -4 weeks after i started. and i still hear it from my new supervisor when i need assistance or if i want to notify him something 

3) as per #2 this is what a lot of my supervisors have said to me … am i being too needy? i have been here for 5 months and it’s a lot to handle 

4) the turnover rate is really high 2 people quit within the span of a week and the week before my supervisor was fired.

5) my supervisors constantly trash talk old employees (calling someone who quit before me an alcoholic, calling my old coworker an idiot, trash talking my old supervisor after he left) 

6) it doesn’t feel like a team, it just feels like everyone blames things on me because i am new and the youngest person in the company 

the list goes on but these are some top issues

what do you think? am i just sensitive or am i in a toxic workplace"

I'm finishing up my bachelors in supply chain management in December and been working in an internship since January. I use powerbi for my internship and learning SQL and R in my free time. I really want to get in data analysis, but I'm unsure of my chances of getting a junior analyst position out of college. Do you think the skill and experience I have mentioned are enough to get a junior analyst role or do I need to shift my focus to other skills to get hired easier?

Thank you"

w2lnnq,2,2022-07-19,Career Path Advice,Crazy_Werewolf_1283,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/w2lnnq/career_path_advice/,"Need a sounding board/some advise: 

So, I’ve just completed my second year at university. I’m doing the BSc. Economics and Finance Program, offered by University of London (academic direction by LSE), in India- so the degree would say UOL, but I’m from India. I’ve done the IBDP program (International Baccalaureate) and given the IGCSEs. 

Currently, I’m doing a two month summer internship at BNP Paribas- Equity Research- I’m part of some initiation reports and have explored a bit of modelling. I’ll give the CFA Level 1 in November. 

I want to make a career in finance- of course IB is always one’s aim, but for now, I’m still figuring out and looking for the right opportunities (IB/ER/Asset is what I’m aware about as of now in terms of entry- I could be off about this, so more info on what I can realistically aim for would be appreciated). 

Primarily, I want to make a career in the UK/Europe.

These are my options- 
1. Apply for Masters in Finance immediately (utility dependent on my grades- during my first year of uni, I got a first class, second year results are not out yet- will come out in August, but my exams were brutal- I’m extremely worried about this)

Pros- Since I will get an international degree albeit from UOL, there is less security since I’m not in a UK Campus. Being physically in UK will increasing my chances of jobs, since there would be more networking. 

Risks- Masters options are limited due to the 3-year undergrad thing- can’t apply to US. 
Will have to give the GRE since the applications start on 1st Oct. Will I able to do this with the CFA plus college? (since I’ve already spent a lot of time on my intern). 
Not sure if an MBA will be feasible after this? (Due to duplicacy- CFA, MSc Fin and MBA- all are overlapping). 

2. Work in India for a few years (utility heavily dependent on the type of jobs I get), give the CFA level 2, and then go for masters in UK, or directly an MBA (don’t know if a 3-year undergrad degree is enough). 

Pros- Will not have to give GRE immediately in August (I haven’t prepped for this yet- so tons of cramming will be saved- would be able focus on the 3rd/year of college as the term begins in Sept. 
Plus, I won’t have to do an MS fin. 

Risks- Will an MBA option work out with only 3 years of undergrad? 
And the longer I work in India, will my chances of breaking into the UK market be harder? 
Plus, won’t get the security of a uni network as with the case of MSc. Finance. 
And won’t be able to apply to US MBA courses- since all require a 4-year undergrad (speaking of US since have heard that in general, US MBAs are more worth it, I’m not rich so getting my money’s worth is important). 

- Someone suggested- do a masters program in the UK and an MBA in US. But the problem is that the I’ve never seen anyone do both a Masters and an MBA in finance- it’s only more of the same. So, I also need advise on how I can cap up the fourth year of study (what course can I take up) to do a MBA course in US. 

Also, the ViSA issues + work experience/jobs thing is another problem applicable to both the options I’ve mentioned.  

Since, I’m kind of lost, I would really appreciate some opinion on my current situation. What would be a good plan/what would be most logical/how would you go ahead/should I look for other countries or other plans? Just anything would be useful- grill me/ give advise/ tell me off- do anything, but please help a girl out.

I’m trying my best to not make any mistakes with my career- I’ve learnt so much till now and hope to learn much more- so hopefully things will come to fruition. I’ve always wanted to study + work abroad, but I need a solid plan. 

So, I’m willing to take any kind of feedback, you don’t have to be nice, just be honest."

Yet at the same time I do enjoy coding and math but only selectively- maybe only a couple times I really enjoyed coding or finding the answer to a math problem (is this just depression or something...).

I’ve been searching for jobs even before I graduated, but it hasn’t worked out and it’s hard to get interviews. 

I’ve sent out about 100 cold applications through job portals and 10 applications with referrals. I have referrals from people that graduated a year or two earlier than me from their companies. I even got a referral to LM and got a rejection through their portal two days later. I’m a Latina that’s a citizen of the US (which where I’m applying for jobs), though I don’t know if that affects anything. 

I think my largest resume flaw is my lack of professional internships. Not to get too personal, but I was in an abusive situation all throughout college. It left me with mental health issues that made it hard to function and I struggled to graduate. I’m away from that situation now, but I’m struggling to get back on my feet professionally.

So far, I’ve had two interviews.  One with a startup I talked to at a career fair. I didn’t pass their second interview where they gave me three hours to make a game that met their specifications. The other was with google after applying to an early career position that didn’t require a college degree. My interviewer says I can re-interview in December, but I’m nervous about getting closer to the 1 year mark of unemployment.

Am I approaching job hunting the wrong way? I struggle with prioritization, so I’m not sure wether I should focus most of my energy on personal projects or changing my application strategy."

Also VERY LONG STORY.

Some quick context: I am a white cis male who would like to best identify as a stereotypical progressive/liberal/lefty who is accepting of all people and would like to achieve an anti-racist status. I continue to struggle with this as I grow two separate social networks of friends who are a majority of black friends I have from college, and majority of white or at least white-passing friends from high school. Both of our groups have similar hobbies of just enjoying throwing elaborate house parties. Rarely am I able to mix the two groups but on special occasions, like this one, I was able to.

So just over a month ago, I threw probably one of the biggest parties I’ve done at my dad’s house. It was going great. This was something I’ve dreamed of doing like it was feeling like a college or high school movie at my dad’s house. My closest friends from High School were coming out for us to have our one day all together over the summer before I headed off to another state for an internship for the next 10 weeks. One of my BFFs from college came to the party and brought his cousins along as well. For context, he and his cousins are Black. My friends from high school were most  of the people there and they’re mostly white or white passing half Latinx / half white. The rest were also friends of friends who were Asian and Latinx. 

So as the night progressed, one of my friends from high school made a mistake by inviting one of his dates from Tinder and she invited three random dudes who we did not know. These guys were also Black. They arrived before my college BFF. Just before he showed up. The three random dudes and the tinder girl were getting really rowdy and way too drunk and started making everyone really uncomfortable because one of them even started to sexually harass the tinder girl, eventually a little rough housing between the two and breaking a decorative plate my dad had on display, next to a few awards he got from work. By this time everyone who I wanted to be at the party was there except for the three random guys and the tinder girl. I didn’t wanna be a dick but lowkey wanted to kick them out because they broke a plate I thought my dad would be pissed about and they were making everyone else super uncomfortable. I was also pretty crossed at this point so I didn’t know what to do. My BFF from high school took me aside and asked if I wanted them out and I said I guess. He then kinda took initiative but was misguided on what the right thing to do was. He gave his girlfriend the simple instructions to kick out the three random black guys and the tinder girl. She had not yet met my BFF from college and his cousins, so when she saw them standing with the random dudes next to each other, she sorta panicked and screamed in their faces that she would call the cops if they all didn’t leave. This then caused an argument to explode and my college BFF called all of my friends racist. I also freaked out at that point and said nah bro she’s chillin. At that point, my BFF from college told me he felt betrayed by me defending a racist. The rest of the night is was a disaster to say the least. Now my BFF has less respect for me and said I will have to redeem myself somehow. We’ve been talking occasionally but it’s been cold. Moving forward, it seems my college BFF is expecting me to drop everyone he suspected of being racist. That would cause a lot of problems as it really only includes my high school BFF and his girlfriend, who are an important part of my life and the friend group we have back at home. Is there anything I should’ve done differently? Is this a tricky situation? Is there a right and wrong party in this? Should I just tell all my high school friends to check their privileges? I would ideally like to be able to invite all these people to my wedding or whatever big events we may have."

I'm an incoming college freshman majoring in Computer Science. I'm looking to buy a new laptop that I could use for the duration of my college years. I'll be using it mainly for school and work if I could find one while I'm studying. 

* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:**  
Have a budget of around ₱80,000/$1500 or less (Philippines)
* **Are you open to refurbs/used?**  
No
* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?**  
1. Performance 2. Battery life 3. Build quality
* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**  
Slightly important since I think I'll be bringing it to school from time to time, although I think I can handle carrying something a bit on the heavier side. 
* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.**  
14-15"" ish
* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.**  
I'm not sure what programs I'll need since I'll be starting college in September but I'm majoring in Computer Science. As for games, I only play light/casual games like stardew valley, crosscode, phoenotopia, and life is strange. 
* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**  
Games like stardew valley, coffee talk, and crosscode. 
* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?**  
Would prefer something that has a simpler design like the MSI GS66 stealth? Just something that does not look alieny..? Maybe a minimalist/modern design. Although I like the zenbook 14x space edition design so there's that. Would also like a laptop that has a great battery life. 
* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**  
I'm looking for a laptop that is reliable and I can use long-term. I'd be using it for the duration of my college and will be using it for internships or work that I can find while studying. Having a camera is not that important but a plus, since I have the option to buy a separate camera that I can connect to my laptop during zoom meetings."

I tried picking up Python and HTML when I was younger but couldn’t get into it. I could see the cool stuff people were doing all the way along with code though so I picked a Computer Science course that covers a bit of Java, Python, R as well as a small bit of Javascript, CSS, HTML. I wasn’t enthusiastic about programming until the end of first year where I got bit by the DeFi bug and started learning Javascript, because it’s what the web3 library links into. I turned my focus onto JavaScript at the end of first year and over the summer studied React, Solidity, Typescript, Node, SASS and am currently building a Wordle replica in React.  I’d like to make a Typescript casino app afterwards and build out a portfolio. I’m now super enthusiastic about JavaScript and have also bought courses to learn Docker, Kubernetes and GraphQL. 

I’ll graduate then in 2025. What do you reckon I should do in relation to internships? Is a 1 month internship over Christmas worth it? Should I build out my portfolio and use that to get a junior role or at least an internship next summer? How much experience would you need to get into a FAANG (After you’ve done your prep work for interviews)? Is entrepreneurial experience (During college, building working projects with real-world applications) just as good, pound for pound, as an internship, in terms of CV weight and learned content?

My company, however, does offer an option to work and study for graduate students, and even offers partial tuition reimbursement. I’ve double checked with the recruiter, who was surprised to learn my manager would say such a thing, and also I’m looking directly at the policy right now. I slacked the manager the screenshot of the recruiter sending me the details of the program, and he essentially just told me that he spoke to people who know better and I actually can’t…

I’ve been doing well in the internship from a technical standpoint. I’m always ahead of the tasks that are assigned to me, and go beyond. For instance, I finished implementing a feature he presented as “would be good to have, but we don’t expect you to get there in the short time you have.” He consistently praises my work... 

But, between this and him saying things like “well, you have my LinkedIn in any case…” I think he’s laying the groundwork for me not to receive a full-time offer despite the company being pretty transparent about wanting to hire most interns back. Is there anything I could do? Any recourse I have? Do I just talk to my recruiter about this? How big of a role does a manager who leads a 6 person team, or so, have in the decision of hiring an intern?"

I (21F) apologize a lot. Saying sorry is a bad habit of mine that I developed as a kid. I had a really strict Dad whow ould get mad at me for every little mistake I made. Because of this, I apologize for every small mistake I make, because I feel as if I've majorly messed up, even when I haven't. 

I'm aware that I apologize too much and have been going through therapy to try and break the habit. Its taking time, and I'm making some progress but I still do it, especially when I make mistakes or feel like I'm bothering someone.

One of my coworkers (22M) who I started working with about two months ago has started stopping me mid sentence when I apologize, and started making me ""correct the sentence"". Essentially, he expects me to say it back to him in a way that does not include an apology.

While I get that its annoying that I apologize so much, I hate that he does that. I feel like a little kid again. And honestly its not really helping and just making my social anxiety worse because I feel like I'm always messing up when I talk to people.

I don't know what to do about this situation and would appreciate some advice? We are both long term interns, and he's leaving the company in a month so I don't have to speak to him again after August. Some of my friends have told me to talk to my manager, but he really wants a job at this company after graduation while I do not, and I don't want to ruin his chances over something so minimal.

Thanks."

My opportunities for internships were canceled because of COVID and every remote thing I applied for got back filled so I didn’t get an internship that summer.

Between graduation and now, I worked a few jobs to make ends meet until last year in September, I got an IT job with a large company. It makes good money, I hate the hours and really want to do stuff beyond basic scripting. I’ve applied to a lot of place since graduation and have had a large handful of interviews since then. However, every single time I’ve gotten rejected, and don’t know why. 

Now I don’t have any motivation to apply to anything else or even to keep my skills up because I’m just tired from work. Each time I apply somewhere I either get rejected or get an interview and then get ghosted. I’m dedicated to the gym every evening and I feel like I never have any time for stuff that will further myself in this career field. I’m starting to regret majoring in CS. 

Is this something anyone else is struggling with or has and gotten through this. How did you overcome the hurdle?"
w2u6e4,3,2022-07-19,Should I go after an internship?,IntrovertiraniKreten,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/w2u6e4/should_i_go_after_an_internship/,"Hi guys,

so I had a timeout, which is now more than a year in duration, and am currently still talking to companies.

I have been studying through the AWS interview process and going through LC during the last few weeks and got burned out just by that itself. I did far too much in far too little time(about 200 problems in 2 months), and needed a week just to refresh from it.  
Right now I am doing mainly dailies to keep the LC habit in my schedule. I really enjoy the site, but it is really hard to constantly challenge yourself over there, at least for me, since I don't recall ever seeing many of the things there, even going through a CS degree.

I am probably a bit too harsh on myself in the process, but I would still like to compete and work in a competitive environment.

Now the questions comes to mind if I should contact companies to just give me an internship instead of a full time role, mainly focusing on big companies.

I have 4yoe behind me, but this experience was slightly better than doing nothing in my honest estimate, and I would really like to be able to contribute to the team I work with.  
The last job I had didn't really have any mentors for me that were not in managerial roles. The few seniors were either too unfriendly to give you any advice or straight out overworked on a daily basis so that I didn't want to bother them any more.

I am not a student, nor am I interested in academia itself, so I am not sure how I should approach an internship. I am afraid that companies might see this as ""yeah, I am shit, teach me"" instead of ""yeah, I don't know enough, give me a mentor"".

Should I proactively ping the companies for an internship, or am I lowballing myself into oblivion by this action?"
w2uwfb,1,2022-07-19,I feel trapped in my life,Not-Giving-Up-Yet,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/w2uwfb/i_feel_trapped_in_my_life/,"26F (about to be 27) I finally moved out of my parents house to live in the city near my boyfriend and his friends. I took a full time office job, my first grown up job ever.

I thought this would finally make me happy, but I’m still miserable. I’m getting overwhelmed by adult life and I’m feeling like it only gets worse from here.

My boss is super rude and condescending to me on a regular basis. I run myself ragged every day and I’m super anxious because I’m so afraid of making any mistakes that might give her an excuse to bully me more. But she still treats me like I’m lazy or like I don’t  deserve to be treated with basic respect.

Before I started, she told me she released the schedules 1 month ahead of time and I told her that I really appreciated that. Turns out, she only releases it literally 1 day ahead of time. This makes it extremely difficult to schedule things in my personal life. I tried talking to her about it and she straight up said, “I never said that.” She doesn’t care how her actions affect her employees.

On top of that, it feels like I have less free time than ever before. I seem to barley have any time for myself. Whenever I finally do get a day off, I have to spend it running errands and doing chores. Right now I’m sitting at the car dealership for 3 hours because I can’t afford an Uber to take me home and back.

Despite how hard I’m working, I’m still so broke all the time. I never get to go out or do anything because I can’t afford to spend the money or take the time off work.

I keep applying to jobs in my field of interest (advertising). But no one wants to hire me. Eventually, I gave up and started just applying to anything I’m qualified for that pays a living wage. But every one of those either doesn’t want to hire me, they have terrible reviews on Glassdoor, or it’s showing signs of being a scam, etc. Not to mention how difficult it is to find time to do the phone calls and interviews necessary to land a new job.

I feel trapped in my life. I don’t even have kids yet, it’s just me and I’m barley hanging on. Technically not even that because my dad still pays for my utilities, car insurance and phone bill.

It feels like all the hard work I’ve done in college and in my internship was just a waste of time.

I feel like I’m never going to get to live the life I want. By the time I start making decent money, it’ll be time for me to have kids and then I’m in the hole again and I have even less free time.

I never thought I’d say this, but I miss living with my parents. If this is adult life, then I don’t know how long I’m going to last.

How do you cope with the fact that this is life and even worse, that we should all be thankful to get to have any of this anyway?

Does it ever get better?

TLDR: I recently moved out at 27 and I make very little money and have almost no free time. I feel overwhelmed by adult life and I’m not sure how to cope with the idea of things staying this way and potentially getting worse for the rest of my life until retirement."
w2v0wf,0,2022-07-19,Is a contract position for 90k a year worth it?,techgirl8,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/w2v0wf/is_a_contract_position_for_90k_a_year_worth_it/,"So I'll be out of a job in two weeks. I risked a lot to take this full stack engineer internship. I quit my shitty job in order to do it. I know experience is important and I'm graduating in December and that is my only internship. That is why I took the risk even though I can't afford to go without a job(bills). I don't regret it I have learned so much! I'm 31 and a woman which leaves me at a disadvantage. I also live in a rural area and cannot relocate. Anyways I thought if I did well enough this internship might extend my internship through the fall but unfortunately they told me yesterday that they don't do that but since they are so impressed with my work they want me to do this program(rotation program for 18 months) with them when I graduate. I know they recognize my hard work seeing as I put in a lot of extra hours because I love programming. It really is my passion and I love this company. Unfortunately I can't go without work until December so now I'm back job hunting. I've applied to a bunch of fall internships and no answer. Also applied to developer jobs in my area(there aren't many).

So I have an interview for a contract position. I've never done a contract before and it would last until December. But they want to renew the contract eveytime it ends and wants someone who will stay there for a long time. But they told me since it's a contract that means no benefits. No paid time off. No retirement plan no nothing. I could take time off but I won't get paid for it. The recruiter told me that since I will be making 45 dollars an hour that will make up for no benefits. Also I've never made that much money in my life. The most I've ever made is what I make now which is 23 an hour.

 It's also python scripting. I am mostly experienced in full stack web development. Specifically C# .NET, Javascript, Angular etc. and thats what I enjoy the most. I have experience with Python but not scripting so I don't even know if that's going to be something I like. I have to look into it.

Anyways I do have other opportunities possibly but nothing is a guarentee. I'm just not sure if I should take the contract because I might want to do that program when I graduate in December. I do have a lot of recruiters reaching out to me on LinkedIn now that I have some experience on the job with my internship.

Should I go to the interview? Or should I hold out and wait to see what happens with these other companies? I don't know if this is worth it. I don't like the idea of having no benefits."
w2v6hz,1,2022-07-19,Looking for some advice on a possible job transition from US to UK,Necessary_Main2102,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/w2v6hz/looking_for_some_advice_on_a_possible_job/,"Hi everyone! I was hoping to just gain some opinions and thoughts from others on plans I have for moving from the US to the UK. To give some context, the reason I'd like to move is to live with or near my partner whose current job contract requires him to be in the UK until the beginning of 2024.  I would also need visa sponsorship.

A bit of information on my current job. I've been with the same company since I graduated university so I have about 3.5 YOE with them including my internship experience.  I work on an air traffic control program for the FAA here and so the main languages I work with are Ada and C with a little bit of C++.  As such, I've been searching for jobs within the UK that use a similar stack and to no surprise, pretty much all of them are related to some kind of civil or defense work.  How likely would it be for those kind of companies to be willing to sponsor someone from outside of the UK to work on a UK defense work contract?

Of course another idea I've had is to work for company I work for now but remotely from the UK.  My company has presence in the UK and so I've been lucky enough to start a process that MAY allow me to do this remote work.  I currently have an application started within my company that requires due diligence from multiple sectors of the company to review my teleworking request.  I still have about another month left of waiting to see what these results are.

I know that if I were to leave my current job for one in the UK that I would most likely experience a significant pay cut but I'm willing to deal with that in the future.  There's a part of me that would love to get a UK based job (I know that will not be easy of course) to experience the actual work environment there because while I do love the people I work with now, the work/life balance I deal with now is something I'm not sure I'd like to have for the rest of my career.  Is it too naive to think it'll be any different in the UK?  I'm also now a bit worried that my current tech stack just may not be good enough for a lot of positions I see in LinkedIn that seem to really want front-end or more modern language experienced people. 

I'm sorry for the long spiel and I hope I've reached the correct forum for these questions. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated!"
w2vgk2,1,2022-07-19,Bruh Amazon OA?,aingeliic,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/w2vgk2/bruh_amazon_oa/,"hey, just finished my freshman year of CS and completing my first “tech” internship this summer. I’ve only done introductory CS courses in python n java and I don’t think that makes a difference. 

im not sure how to prep for this &amp; i have 14 days lmao. 

to people who’ve done the amazon oa before: would you say they’re easy/medium/hard leetcode questions? (I can barely go through easies n im rusty rn), is there anything i should do to prep other than leetcode?"
w2vi4v,0,2022-07-19,Types of internships.,dnp407,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/w2vi4v/types_of_internships/,"I am surprised to find out that there are so many variations to type of internships and many people haven’t heard of co-op/pep programs or refer to them as something else.

In my university, we have:

Co-op program: It is a simple work-study structure where you study (4/8months) go work in a company for 4/8 months and repeat the cycle till you graduate. 

PEP (professional experience program): This is basically 12 or 16 months of student working with a company in a single stretch. Highly encouraged for 2nd and 3rd year students, once done, most students go back to school to finish their final year and graduate with a whole year of uninterrupted experience. 

Both these programs are run by the university’s Co-op department for CS. They get the student-specific job postings from companies, help students with resume, interviews etc. They also do visits every 2 months and students need to create goals, record the work they do and write reports at the end of every 4 months. 

I am curious to know what form of other internships have people here done? Did you like it? Or any thoughts on what we hav"

w2vv2c,1,2022-07-19,Chose the wrong degree and got the wrong internship. Is there still a way in?,KAYTACHI,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/w2vv2c/chose_the_wrong_degree_and_got_the_wrong/,"Hello Redditors, I am an aspiring software developer about a year away from finishing my degree in IT and I'm currently doing an internship for IT Project Management. I can't say that this internship experience has been useless in terms of achieving my future goals because I'm learning how the IT side of things work in the corporate world, and common practices devs follow. But like I said, I want to be a software developer, not a project manager (don't ask why I'm in an internship for PM, I was in a rush to get job experience before I graduated).

I know how to code, in fact I am quite proficient at it. I specialize mainly in Java and C++ but I've dabbled in making websites and web applications too. But seeing the way my resume is set up right now, it would seem like I am more suited for other things. I am thinking I will be able to leverage my degree and my job experience working in IT to get a role in software development, but I am worried if I will be able to compete with people who chose to get a CS degree and a more relevant internship. Is there still hope for me or will I have to pursue more education after college?

(TLDR: Getting a degree in IT, got an internship in Project Management. Will I be able to become a software developer?)"

w2wwsu,1,2022-07-19,I hate living in the happiest country. I feel my mindset is the problem atm.,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/w2wwsu/i_hate_living_in_the_happiest_country_i_feel_my/,"I am posting through a throwaway but I will be here for the next 24 hours. This post mentions violence and contains strong language. Also posted this in other places but like didn't get any comments mostly upvotes so posting here.

I moved to Finland years ago in my mid-teens to do my bachelor's degree at a university of applied sciences. From week one, things were callous and only improved over the past half a year. I had many bad experiences living here, and I don´t know how to move past them. I felt eaten up by this negativity and overwhelmed.

To put it into perspective, I've been homeless twice and struggled financially during most of my life here. When I was burnt out from working several jobs and studying, I had no friends to turn to since most people only seem to care about parties and are superficial as hell.

In my second year here, I was beaten up outside my house by a group of guys who proceeded to go through my stuff while the police didn´t even respond (I never filed a report since there wasn't any severe damage, and my parents didn't want to agitate the locals more and I was still a minor). It was the same experience when my bike was stolen from my workplace (the guards refused any help even though I parked it under the cameras). That time I tried to file a report with the police, but the person just pretended that their systems were down.

Working here was crap, and last year I realised how under-paid I was, and even that salary arrived at random intervals. A couple of times, the company forgot to pay me. This set me back financially since making estimates and planning was just super hard.

The health care system IMO is a joke. It took me half a year and hundreds of euros to get the treatment I needed for my leg. This could have been resolved much sooner, in my opinion. Instead, I had to work through pain until it was painful for me even to stand, let alone walk. When I did get a time, I was refused treatment on the original date and had to come back a week later (I got a new time only because I threatened legal action).

My university didn’t provide any support and just wanted to get me out of their system asap. In my opinion, my degree is subpar since I learned more things by taking online courses and doing internships. I didn´t have access to student healthcare or my student card until last year.

At the very start, I tried hard to make friends locally and be involved at first. Most of my Finnish language skills originally came from hanging out with the locals (which was a surprise for many when I took up lessons). But as life progressed, I saw many locals as being superficial, backstabbing and cold. Shit, even my girlfriend´s family's reaction was to ask her if I was a criminal!

Right now, things are better. I have work (not in Finland), I have settled my debts (paid in full both in enforcement and outside of the system), I am with the person I love, and even her family seems to have warmed up to me a bit (they are still super cold to me but at least not questioning my integrity as much). I also started working out and taking care of my physical health more.

But my mindset is just fucked, I feel lonely, like the system, and everyone is out to get me. I started isolating myself from locals over a year ago during my burnout and after I recovered from a heavy illness. It has gotten so bad that I cut off people who show genuine interest in being friends with me. I hate my mindset. I have no control over my anger (I feel like I am drowning in it). I want to change how I think about being in this country, but being treated as some criminal, piece of crap, and third-class resident by almost everyone makes it super hard. The cherry on top is being lied to and cheated by people on multiple occasions just for their minor convenience.

I want to change how I feel, but it feels impossible, and this resentment takes up so much of my energy. I don´t know where or how even to start the healing process. This all sounds like first-world problems, and I understand that, at times, I should have been wiser (particularly with my finances). I don't want to come out as someone who only complains; I need to get this off my chest and maybe get some pointers on how to feel better.

tldr: Life in Finland is not how it's being marketed and I hate living in this place. I need to stay for another couple of years for a diverse set of reasons, and really need advice on how to try and change my mindset that is seemingly causing a lot of discomfort."

If so, is there any specific consulate that would give me a better shot. 

Applied to 6 universities, got accepted into 3. (7th university directly stopped my application stating minimum GPA requirements) Got my i20 for MS in Information Systems at Northeastern University. Have over 2 years of work experience(excluding internships) in India, and currently earn 25lpa. Completed my undergrad in Computer Science from one of the newer Indian Institutes of Technology in 2020(Probably counts as Tier 1 in India). Family is financially stable enough to support me for the complete duration of my program - still took a loan of 40 lakhs, almost equal to the tution fees, since those with approved loans apparently have a higher chance getting visa. GRE 328, toefl 108. 

The biggest reason i couldn't get into more competitive programs was my CGPA. It's 6 on a scale of 10, and 7.8 in my final year of undergrad. Completely wasted 3 years playing games, reading novels, &amp; music. Still banked on the my SOP to show off ny profile that was always in the top 1% easily at everything i did, and the strong LORs from my professors, especially from the prof who evaluated my final year bachelor thesis and gave me a 9/10. Got a strong work LOR from the VP of engineering at my company too. 

Had my interview today. Went like this:

How many universities did you apply to, and how many admitted? - 6 applied, and 3 admitted

How much was your undergraduate gpa? - 6 on a scale of 10, 7.8 in my final year.

When did you graduate? - 2020

Please place your 4 fingers on the scanner. Sorry to inform you that i cannot approve your visa now.

I said thanks and left. Was kinda shocked to face this. I knew that the low GPA would hit my admits hard, but didn't expect that visa would prove to be the biggest hurdle.

Edit - I was handed back my passport, along with a copy of Section 214(b) - Did not overcome the presumption of Immigrant intent, as the denial reason."

I've been offered a fixed 8-month-long research assistant position at the university because they've liked my work. While this will surely help my Master's applications (I'm planning to apply for the 2023), I was wondering in case all my applications fail, will I still be eligible for grad roles even if I take this research associate position? If not, will a research position in any way disadvantage me for more industry-oriented roles or will it hold similar if not the same value as experience in industry?

To give a little more background about the research position, It is a high-performance hardware simulator mainly written in C/C++, the project has both private and government funding and is being increasingly adopted by some companies for hardware design and manufacture.

  
As far as my CV is concerned, I have previously worked as an intern at FAANG and as a part-time software engineer for the last two years of my university. I have also been a TA at university (last year)."

Any ways to bounce back?",iZaxer,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/w305q6/trying_to_give_my_best_at_internship_but/,"I love my job this summer and try to give it everything I can. The company is really lean in staff (our team is only 4 people) for its size and doesn't really give out return offers, but it's the first work I've found fulfilling through my 3 years of school and I really enjoy it.

But I've always had an issue with getting up in the mornings and, while finally medicating my ADHD last year has drastically improved this to be manageable, its started impacting my work. I forgot to set an alarm earlier this month and scrambled to apologize and get into the office around 1. I thought I could put that behind me and worked late to make up for the mistake--my boss and direct report have both been really happy with the level of my work since then. But today I did it again, forgot to set my alarm and messaged my direct report at 11am that I was feeling sick and would wfh..

I know I need to give more attention to this problem now, and I trust I'll be able to stop it from happening again in the 3 weeks left of the internship, but communicating or making up for today seems hopeless. I already struggle with the soft skills more than anything, and I feel like I'll just be marked as a smart but unreliable worker if I ever do want to apply here after graduation or just ask for a future reference. I just genuinely care about this role a lot and take pride in my work... this morning just seems to paint me the opposite. I don't know how to work out this with my bosses and I don't know why I thought wfh would be better than scrambling into the office again.

I'll definitely try to work later tonight, come in early tomorrow, and address the late notice honestly and apologetically. I'll make sure it doesn't happen again and give extra effort these last few weeks. But I really don't know what I could say to isolate this as a mistake, not a character flaw, now that its happened twice. Is there just nothing really to help about it? I understand if this is just something I need to accept and get through without unrealistic expectations, but if you guys have handled oversleeping issues before or have any ideas about how to control the damage I really do appreciate any help. Thanks so much."
w30ald,2,2022-07-19,How to handle a job offer after summer internship with a semester left in school?,chefboa-rdee,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/w30ald/how_to_handle_a_job_offer_after_summer_internship/,"I have a summer internship at a large company within their finance team. It has gone well this summer and I verbally accepted an offer to work part time during my last semester at school. I graduate in December. The team I am on had a recent job open up and I have been told that it is mine if I want it. They have decided to put the job opening on hold rather than leave it as open so I can make a decision. I feel as though this is far too early to make my full time decision and I want to gather as many offers as possible without being disrespectfully to the company that is holding this job for me. This is my only current full time offer at the moment. 

In a meeting about it today, I reiterated that I am grateful for the offer but it is early for me to commit. They seemed slightly discouraged by that. 

This is a very solid job for me to have coming out of college. However, there are definitely jobs out there that garner a bit more interest from me. This job keeps me close to home and I could save a lot of money working here and living from home for a year or two. I am definitely going to pursue the other opportunities that I can in the coming semester. However, the big fear is obviously that I lose my opportunity here in search of another opportunity and end up with no opportunity or a much less favorable one. 

Any advice? Even just tips on a mindset to approach it with? What to say to my current company to keep this open?"

I’m in a little bit of a dilemma right now - I just got into NUS Computer Engineering (undergrad) but I have a few questions. It would be great if someone on the course / who’s graduated from the course / who knows a lot about it could share some insight: 
1. How intensive is the course? For eg, how many hours of work do you have to put into homework problems / exam revision each day ? 
2. What are the internship opportunities like ? 
3. How’s the culture ? Is it ultra competitive , collaborative or somewhere in between ? 
4. With respect to getting into a postgraduate degree in the United States, do a lot of people from NUS undergrad comp eng tend to get accepted ?

I've been working for a company for around 7 years and I can confirm without a doubt that working hard only gets you more work and less pay.

For the first 1-3 years I killed myself. Showed up to work an hour early every day, consistently doing more and more every day. Never took time off, personal or vacation, everything was scheduled around work. This whole time I was making roughly $11-13 an hour.

The next two years we had a massive company overhaul, mass layoffs, and hiring, my department grew by a few and I thought I could finally grow into a role I was killing myself for.

Wrong.

What did happen though was watching the new hire sleep at their desk, routinely show up late, take extra long lunches, cause chaos in our environment with no accountability, and lastly implement half-baked solutions then drop the projects halfway through anyway. The kicker? He was hired at twice my pay. 🙃

For the last few years I have slowly been automating my job, reducing the projects I take, pushing off work to our interns, and in general, doing less so much to the point I'm bored.  Magically I get a pay jump from $13 an hour to $20 over the course of that two years.

So where am I at today?

Salary position, my own office, hand picking what projects I feel like doing at a snail's pace, no stress, no care, and a youtube history list a mile long. 

Corporate America is so broken it's not funny."

w31no1,2,2022-07-19,I (22F) am considering moving to the other side of the US because I'm really unhappy where I'm at.,Ackermance,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/w31no1/i_22f_am_considering_moving_to_the_other_side_of/,"This is going to be super long and complicated so my apologies, but a little bit of backstory on this: So a couple of months ago my dad disowned me right before receiving a terminal diagnosis. I tried leaning on my friends for support because I have always done that for them, but instead, I have been cut out of most if not all of their lives. My home life has become a toxic environment, I don't really have any friends anymore and my three jobs are slowly killing me on top of all the emotional mess I'm going through with being excluded and cut out during my time of need. I tried making new friends and that didn't go too well because I have a really different personality that not a lot of people understand (obscure, oddly specific humor) I've also been told that I intimidate people because I'm super smart and can tell you a random fact about almost anything- which results in the tendency to nerd out over topics I know a lot about. 

In my search for new friends, I met a guy (22M) that actually meets me on my level and vibes with my sense of humor and actually tags with it. As much as I feel silly to admit it, I really, really like him. Like a lot. He's currently living here on a summer internship so he will be moving back to his home state on the other end of the country. Since I've already thought about moving and I'm super unhappy where I'm at, I'm thinking about moving to his home state. 

Before you freak out, he does like me back. He's mentioned casually that he thinks I should get out of my hometown at least and take a gap year from school and find myself a little bit. We talked a little bit about me moving to his hometown and he didn't come off as against it, but also made the point that I really need to think about it- which is understandable. 

My main concern is finding a place to live and transferring jobs. The only con about the job that transfers is I cannot move to any of the surrounding states due to my District Manager. I'm currently being severely harassed by her so If I moved somewhere closer, she would just make my life miserable there too. I've talked to the business I'd be transferring to and they are in fact looking for a full-time associate so they'll get back to me sometime (hopefully).

Another thing I should add is I only plan on living somewhere else for a year. Not a permanent living situation, but long enough to get away from everything that sucks in my life. Does it sound like I'm being irrational? The main reason I'm considering living where he's at is that I know if I go anywhere, I want to know at least one person. This also severely limits where I can go. Frankly, the thought of moving terrifies me, but I know it's probably something I need to do for myself. Would it be too weird if I followed him across the country? It that creepy? Is that clingy? I know I would be making this decision for myself and not for him, but I feel so internally conflicted right now on what to do.

TLDR; I'm conflicted about moving across the country to escape my unhappiness.

Also, there may be some stuff that I left out so feel free to ask questions on things I've considered (and maybe not!)"
w32wft,2,2022-07-19,Stress during the interview,lhexagone,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/w32wft/stress_during_the_interview/,"Hello! I had a sad interview experience where I got super stressed. A very old topic, however, if anyone can share some wisdom again, what are the best techniques or maybe practices everyone is using to improve stress handling during the interviews?

I am a junior/mid engineer having an imposter syndrome which I am trying to improve. It comes from not having a degree in computer science or not being a genius that solves everything in 15 minutes. I switched career by doing Boot Camp because it was quicker than 4 years of degree and I had small living savings. However, I do want to complete CS in the future to improve my fundamentals since everyone keeps mentioning this to me and I want to be better.
I know inside I am not dumb, there are many people who experiences this and also having issues with interviews. However, no matter what I do, I freak out during the live coding sessions, I stress so much I can’t concentrate on finding a solution, I start crying without control (my usual stress body reaction).

The things I did before:
- prepare well and practice
- have a small meditation
- talk in front of mirror
- listen to tutorials that walk though do’s and don’t during the interview (how to ask questions, what to discuss and how to ask for hints)
- code in docs( to lift stress of not having a style helper and etc)

I tried to analyze what is triggering it and I think it mostly comes to:
-  the feeling “I am not good enough for this company, so many smart people work there and they sound so impressive during the interview” examples like “I coded from 15 years”, “I have 2 engineering degrees and internship at IBM or some other big name”. And I am not a genius, I can’t say that if you give me a problem I will find solution right away. I am a very average employee. It’s like a competition I will never win. 
- talking to a stranger (i don’t know if it’s social anxiety, but I barely can talk to strangers because I can’t see them, and especially when they got weird voice that makes you feel like they are tired or indifferent, like I am taking their time to watch my struggles solving a simple task). As soon as I know a person I feel better and can talk more normal.
- having friends around that get jobs quickly. Compared to me, they are super extroverts, bold, and confident. Which I admire a lot but it makes me think if I should change my personality? I don’t know if companies are inclined to hire more outgoing people in general.
- also, as a side effect from watching tutorials how to do live coding interviews. I think it possibly stresses me too. The feeling I have to control every word and movement (be a perfect collaborator with interviewer).

I want to be better and I appreciate any comments!"

College placements have started and needless to say I'm not eligible for any 'good' company (other than tcs, infosys) because of my branch, all the opportunities are for IT/CS or electrical at max. 

So what can I do? My options:

\+ Try off campus opportunities like through careers page, I don't really have confidence that I'll be able to even get an interview because of my bad college, branch and cgpa (7.5 expected after 8 sems).

\+  Try to get referrals? I don't have any connections, like none.

\+ My brother said do something like CDAC course after college and then you can get placements chance at their campus.

\+ or should I try to get into those placement agencies which take a big fees after your placement and try to place you? (I'm don't really wanna go this route)

\+ or just get placed in whatever company through college and try to switch after 1-2 years? (I don't want to do this but who cares what I want)

you opinions? also I can't afford higher education but will do some 6-7 months course if that's the last option."
w34890,1133,2022-07-19,[Amazon Offer] - My experience interviewing for entry level DevOps position at Amazon,copiumimporium,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/w34890/amazon_offer_my_experience_interviewing_for_entry/,"Hey all, posting this because I haven't seen much talk about the interview process at Amazon in terms of DevOps (the official titles at Amazon are DevOps Engineer and System Development Engineer).

I recently accepted a position as a System Development Engineer 1 on one of the teams at AWS, and just want to outline the process. For some background - I have 1 year of experience as a software engineer at a small, not well known company.

This may vary by team, since each team / department at Amazon / AWS is pretty independant from one another.

**Step 1 - Online Assessment**

I had 2 Data Structure / Algorithm questions to complete on Hackerrank. They gave me 90 minutes to do so.

I could not find them online, but they were extremely similar to these two:

[https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-right-side-view/](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-right-side-view/)

[https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-length-substrings-with-no-repeated-characters/](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-length-substrings-with-no-repeated-characters/)

I answered both with optimal time / space complexity in approximately half the given time. So I made sure to comment as much as I could explaining my thinking process

**Step 2 - Phone Screen**

Brief introductions and small talk, then she asked me about my past work experience, projects and internships. Again quite brief.

I was asked a Leadership Principle question ""Tell me about a time when you couldn't meet your deadline?"" with follow-ups

Then I was asked the two following questions:

[https://leetcode.com/problems/score-after-flipping-matrix/](https://leetcode.com/problems/score-after-flipping-matrix/) (this was the exact question asked)

[https://leetcode.com/problems/design-browser-history/](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-browser-history/) (not exact, but very similar to this)

I struggled with the first one, I was able to come up with a brute force solution but needed the interviewers help to arrive at an optimal solution. She was extremely kind and helpful to me so I appreciated that a lot.

The second question I answered optimally (constant time for all operations) and she seemed satisfied.

We closed the round by having brief small talk again.

**Step 3 - Onsite Round 1**

Brief introductions / small talk.

I was asked the following questions:

[https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-steps-to-make-two-strings-anagram/](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-steps-to-make-two-strings-anagram/) (exact question)

I was able to solve it with optimal time / space complexity in around 15 minutes.

Then I was asked various questions about Object Oriented Programming concepts as well as Database Management System concepts. I had to design a small system with OOP (ie: name the different classes and their relationships) as well as a database schema (er diagram) to support the system.

After that, I was asked a Leadership Principle question ""Tell me about a time when you innovated and exceeded the expectation""

**Step 4 - Onsite Round 2**

Brief introductions / small talk.

I was asked a Leadership Principle ""Tell me about a time when you had conflicting ideas with your teammates and how did you resolve them?"". With several follow-ups

I was asked another Leadership Principle ""Tell me about a time when you were mostly through a project and realized you had the wrong goal."". Again, with several follow-ups

Then I was asked about troubleshooting questions / system design questions such as:

1. ""What would you do if your website was getting unexpectedly large traffic, how would you handle and scale it?""
2. Explain concepts like database indexing, sharding, nosql vs sql, horizontal vs vertical scaling, etc
3. Explain the OSI model’s layers with protocols of each layer, what are protocols of the transport layer, explain what is TCP and UDP, explain how the TCP mechanism works. 
4. Explain OS concepts such as process creation / management, memory management, different scheduling algorithms and the data structures used to implement them, etc.

After all of this, I was asked the following question:

[https://leetcode.com/problems/design-in-memory-file-system/](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-in-memory-file-system/) (pretty much the exact question)

I struggled with this question a lot, and the interviewer was not very helpful. I was not able to come up with a solution with the remaining amount of time I had left. I was extremely disappointed and thought I had failed the entire interview process because of this.

**Step 5 - Onsite Round 3**

Brief introductions / small talk.

I was asked to solve the following two questions:

[https://leetcode.com/problems/find-root-of-n-ary-tree/](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-root-of-n-ary-tree/) (exact question asked)

[https://leetcode.com/problems/network-delay-time/](https://leetcode.com/problems/network-delay-time/) (exact question asked)

I solved both of the questions with optimal time / space complexity pretty fast. I could tell the interviewer was happy with my solutions and pretty impressed with how fast I completed them.

After that I was asked the following Leadership Principle: ""Tell me about a time when you made an important decision without consulting your manager"", with several follow-ups

After that, because we had some extra time, I once went over my DevOps projects with him and I talked about tools and technologies that I've used (docker, kubernetes, AWS, terraform, etc).

**Step 6 - Offer Letter!!**

After the interviews, I was so mentally exhausted and tired. I felt like I was not going to get it, but I did!

Unfortunately the job is not remote, so I will have to relocate (they provided me $10,000 relocation).

In terms of compensation, the offer was for $150k , which is more than double what I am making now so I obviously accepted it.

**Final thoughts**

It was a really grueling process. I had to know so many different concepts, from Data Structures, Algorithms, Databases, Networking, Operating systems, Programming, etc. But I am glad that I spent so much time prepping, it was all worth it in the end."

w34gau,87,2022-07-19,Becoming a doctor : Part 5 - Time,11docdoctor11,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/w34gau/becoming_a_doctor_part_5_time/,"Becoming a doctor : Part 0 - Prelude  
Becoming a doctor : Part 1 - Death  
Becoming a doctor : Part 2 - Violence  
Becoming a doctor : Part 3 - Court cases, Litigation &amp; Jail  
Becoming a doctor : Part 4 - Threats

I am the first doctor in my family and coming from a non-doctor family, there was a lot I didn't know about the profession and I am hoping to shed some light for aspiring doctors.

Much before becoming a doctor and a practicing surgeon, I was aware that doctors are busy. But the true scale of it was something I hadn't imagined.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

&amp;#x200B;

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

As a doctor you can have anything; be it fame, money, recognition, awards, but no matter how much you plan or strategize, you will never have time

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest sacrifice you will be making, on your journey to becoming a doctor is your time. *Skip to Post Graduation subheading for a shorter read.*

**Pre College - &lt;18 years  :** You will spend your prime years behind books. Most kids do, not just those trying to get into medicine.

**College - 18 - 24.5 years :** You will spend your entire college life again buried under mountains of knowledge, early college is relatively free just like Engineering etc but it gets busier towards the end. You spend a busy internship year, you will have personal time here but it will be erratic. Another year or two go towards working for the government as per your bond.

**Turning point**

You have become a doctor, you have achieved your dream. You can now use the suffix Dr. with pride and you're beaming. Your parents rejoice, your teachers are happy, your neighbours heap praises, your relatives put you on a pedestal and name you the family doctor. You are elated and at the top of the world.

It is exactly that, you are at the top of the world now, you have climbed the mountain and reached the peak.

The problem with reaching the peak is, everything from here on goes downhill. Not in a bad way but, you will never achieve this kind of elation again.

**Entrance Preparation 24.5 to 25.5 years :** This is a grueling preparation phase all doctors enter, after the initial high of becoming a doctor. This is life manifesting itself and it hints at the tough road ahead. You get a sense that things aren't going to be as rosy as it has been until now. Again this phase is tough for all branches but especially so for doctors as the MS/MD seats are far lower than the MBBS seats.

**Post Graduation 25.5 years :** Brutal. The three years of residency are one of the toughest tests of life for a doctor. You will not be prepared for the sheer amount of strain and stress you are going to face hereon. Your physical and mental limits will be tested. You will be physically starved, mentally distraught, the lack of sleep and adequate rest will age you 6 years in these 3 years, there is also a lot of abuse and unnecessary mental torture involved, which is considered a rite of passage by seniors. You have to be mentally strong here. As for time, you will have enough to sleep, bathe and sometimes eat (optional).Most doctors lose 5 to 15 kgs in the first year of residency. The latter years are not as tough but it will keep you busy, nevertheless.

**Specialist 28 / 29 years :** Your life from hereon will completely dependent on how you approach life but in most cases the path will be set. You will see time pass by surrounded by hospital walls. Almost every doctor has to take up a 9-4 job and then work 5-10pm to keep up with the competition. Time that you would use for your family; gone. You will not able to be there for your ailing parents, you will not be able to watch your kids grow; you will catch only glimpses of them. Most kids who are born to doctors don’t receive the same amount of attention as other professions. You cannot work around birthdays, graduations, festivals and ceremonies; they will all accumulate in the end towards your lost memories. Also no matter how much you earn you will not have time to spend it. 

**Senior Consultant &gt;40 year :** You are busier than ever. Your kids are growing up faster than you can catch up with them. You have to help your ageing parents with caretakers. The only affection you can give your kids is through things that can be bought with money. They will soon be going off to college and you will still be stuck in your grind. You are still competing, trying to be the best. 

**Retirement :** Doctors have a lower lifespan than general population due to the unhealthy nature of their work. The tendency to overwork while ignoring their own health catches up with them and cuts short their lives. In the end, time is not only money, time is life itself. You finally look back and all you have is your life's work and hoping you made a difference. 

&amp;#x200B;

You have just spent half your life studying and the other half working. In the end you forget to live. The only respite is that you will live on in the countless lives you have made better and saved. 

This is the greatest asset of a doctor. You give away your time and face death with a smile, knowing that all the time you have invested in your patients will bring dividends for eternity."

I'm also trying for internships again for this year/next summer, and that also feels like a waste of time. I'm also not really good at programming - I tried to come up with projects that actually challenge me, but they're still miles behind what I've seen other people make. I got an online assessment offer sent to me and the questions in the practice are genuinely too hard for me to figure out. I'm sick of people that had some internship or other experience saying that you don't need something in your freshman year - like why would I listen to you? My school's competitive, so I was trying to get into FAANG because I know that many other people are going to get in, but I don't know if that's going to happen now, and it feels like a waste of time trying."

I would just like some input from other students, as I’ve already asked my family members for theirs. For this upcoming semester I have 2 programming classes, calc, sociology, and a slow-paced language class on the side. The language/sociology is not required for transfer but helps complete GEs. 

I get responses from my internship applications in august, so if I do get the internship then it’ll be 5 classes + 10-15hr of work a week. 

The kicker in this scenario is that I had put in my two weeks at my current job (barista) because of my busy schedule, but my manager offered to reduce my hours and for me to only work one shift of the week (6 hours). 

My big question is: should I continue to work at the coffee shop? If I get the internship I’ll probably quit anyways but if I don’t get it, I’m not sure I can balance even 6 hours of work and 5 classes. My parents advised I drop sociology/language in order to work but that’s because they want me to continue paying bills. Advice please?"

I am currently interning at a big 4 (not PwC) as an audit intern, but I've always wanted to go to PwC. There are a quite few reasons behind this decision, but mainly because, and I'm sure a lot of people will agree, the name ""PricewaterhouseCoopers"" is **super sexy**.

I also need suggestions on the service line / role: I've done audit and didn't really like it. I'm hoping to get a role in analytics / consulting (doesn't have to be strategy &amp;)

I am a rising senior and an incoming master student (I am doing a dual degree) at a top 20 US university. I'll be graduating around December 2023, but I'll also have my 150 credits around May 2023.

*Here are my specs:*

Bachelor Major: Accounting; Master Major: Business Analytics (currently learning R, Python, and SQL) 

GPA: above 3.7, Three Dean's Lists

A couple of Accounting Internships (mid-sized), Consulting Co-ops, and a big 4 audit internship

**Would anyone be willing to suggest me a full-time role (any open positions)?**

**ALSO for current PwC employees, if you could refer me, that would be extremely grateful.**

Thanks!!!"

I want to finish asap because I feel like I shot myself in the foot not doing all this earlier (I’m 20 atm) but I’m starting my first internship next week and wanted to know how realistic do you all think it would be to take 15 credits per semester on top of summer classes while trying to work a part time job in CS?

w3arvr,124,2022-07-19,Is CS the Highest Paying Because It Requires the Most Effort Outside of Classes?,Iridience,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/w3arvr/is_cs_the_highest_paying_because_it_requires_the/,"Every interviewer asks about your personal projects and experience. In other engineering fields you just need to have a high GPA to get an internship, whereas for CS if you want a good job/internship you have to drill leetcode like a maniac and spend many extra hours outside of classes slaving away at personal projects. I'm already pulling my hair out at some of the projects we have to do for classes.

Everyone raves about CS being so high-paying but it seems it's just a fair trade-off - it pays more because you have to work so much harder to get that salary. No other major requires so much outside effort in personal projects and interview problems.

If you don't like CS/have no motivation or passion to create your own coding project, is it even worth studying CS? I can do math and stuff relatively decently - I've been good in school my whole life(1550 SAT, 5s on the STEM APs), I just want a decent paying job and I don't want the stress of doing a personal project that requires tens of hours if not hundreds on top of CS classes. I don't have any passion for coding and any personal project would just be an extra chore to do for me."

I was in the military, so I started college later than most. I am the old guy in a fresh out of college position.

I have bachelors in Finance with a concentration in Investments and Securities. Unfortunately, I was in a car accident and having three kids prevented me from doing any internships. Now, I am currently in the MBA program and finish in the spring.

I start my new position next month, I will be an operational development excellence program analyst. Job starts at $60,000 with a $5,000 bonus. I have no experience in the corporate world of finance, only schooling and a job I had before the military. 

Every position I applied for before this was wanting 2-3 years experience. This position is a two year program that takes you through all departments of the banking industry. Once finished, they place you in the department that was best suited to you through the program.

Will this position, after 2-3 years, help push me into better positions in banking or finance in other companies through the experience? 

Will I be able to apply my skills of my MBA to a position sooner than later, or am I on a 5+ year train of experience before I can move up into anything significant? I started my MBA so that there would be no road blocks for positions with requirements of preferred MBA or MBA required.

My grades were good, my MBA GPA is better. 

Will this experience in this, entry of entry level positions, give me the experience needed to move to much better positions at a faster rate due to the MBA degree?"

I did it last summer and basically all my friends left to go home or to work at an internship, making me feel incredibly alone. My summer classes were fast paced and it felt like I was drowning in work. I didn't have a car or scooter, and couldn't even afford a bike for most of the summer, so I would get harassed any time I walked anywhere. My mental health completely plummeted and I will always remember June and July of last year as being some of the worst two months of my life. I was so depressed that I nearly failed all my summer classes and barely had the motivation to move.

If you are experiencing something similar this summer, just know you are not alone. There are a lot of people in Gainesville who aren't going to house parties or having a perfect summer. Things will get better in the fall, you just need to keep pushing through with your classes. Don't hesitate to get the help you need, and please remember that it gets better."

So around 1-2 months left.

I plan to take DSA in my freshman spring, but I recently realized the freshman-only programs like Google STEP and Microsoft Explore also involve LC-style interviews. 

Some people on this subreddit said that the questions shouldn't be that hard for those freshman-aimed programs, and others even said that one could probably solve it even without having any LC experience.

Honestly, I was surprised freshman-only programs have OA regarding that they expect us to know leetcode even before entering college. Regarding that I don't have DSA background, have 1-2 months, and am only aiming for freshman programs, what tips would you guys give me in terms of prepping for coding interviews?

I’m preparing to quit (writing a 2 weeks notice and all that) and possibly find a new job. Though I worry if or when I get a new job this time it will not do me any good too.

My classes all have DBAs (discussion based assessments) with the teacher on a call. Every time I set them up my only time available is after work just as their day is supposed to end (I explained to them my times available are Sundays and after 3:30 pm for Mon-Sat). I find it difficult to prepare to have the DBA after work with not a considerable amount of time to prepare in between. 

I was thinking of waiting for my classes to end before finding a job or till I finish college / internships open up through the school. While I definitely am at an age where I should have a job I finish this (juggling classes and work) to be hard. I know there are people out there capable of doing both but I myself cannot. 

Should I just postpone having a job for a bit (a few months) or find a new one while having classes?"

I have not had any official CS research experience before, and have been looking into doing formal AI research at my university.

However, I’m worried that if I add that to my fall semester schedule, I will be overwhelmed. During school year, I have been working part-time at a startup in my area. In addition, I was given a pretty big leader role in a CS club. 

If I were to get the research role for AI, which would be the least important for my plans of finding a job in a year, then getting a MSC in AI?

Note that all activities will probably have some tangential relation to AI as well. At the part-time job, we have been working with AI, and in the CS Club, we base a lot of the activities on student feedback, and since my school is primarily a research school, that is likely a major thing we will be working with.

In addition, my internship right now is having us work with a project involving AI technologies with talks about potentially extending the internship if they think the project went well (I’d replace the part-time job).

Edit: I’m also helping a friend build out the backend for a startup that I see potential in (and he has already reached out to potential customers). But we probably wouldn’t touch AI for a few years."

I will have a lot of CS related classes for my major, but that's not what I necessarily want to focus on.

My question is, as an incoming freshman, what should I be looking for to prepare a resume and get ready for an intern? I can nepotism the way into an interview (maybe even bypass it but I'm not going to test my luck just yet) but I still want to be prepared for the job and what it will entail. 

Relevant coursework for freshman year is calc 3/diffeq and discrete, some cs courses, mechanics and electromagnetism based physics.

Adding things to my github but don't think this will help much. I also bought Digital Design and Computer Architecture by Harris and Harris but not sure if reading that will allow me to show employers I know my stuff. Not sure how to learn like VHDL, Verilog, circuits, etc. earlier on. And even if I could, not sure how to display this for employers.

I could maybe switch to electrical eng but the major map looks a bit iffy to me...

w3ohdq,1,2022-07-20,How can I help,NutralMcNutralGuy,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/w3ohdq/how_can_i_help/,"I have wanted to be a congressman since I could remember, I saw so many changes in government that would help people, I have been keeping a running list since high school. I am a third generation Irish immigrant here and my family helped build our state capital into what it is today, from actual construction of the empire plaza to organizing soup kitchens and using our house as a boarding house for those that needed it, community planning and participation, and half of my cousins went on to serve our country in one way or another and I wanted to be just like them. I wanted to help people. I still want to help people. 

I am 25 years old and so far have dedicated most of my free time into preparing myself for a future of being one of the leaders of this country, all throughout my education I was one of if not the most involved kid, I would throw myself into every extra curricular activity and club I could while still spending as much time with my friends and just talking to people about what they wanted to see out of their country, then I would cram in my education in while I would wake up 3 hours before anyone else. I was a good student, I got good grades, was part of the student senate and on all the committees, I was a radio assistant, the VP of the young democrats, an active member of debate club, a reporter for the school paper, secretary of the film club, captain of the epee squad for our fencing team, volunteered to work on research projects. All at least in part to help round out the education I felt I needed to make the best decisions for my country. 

I graduated in December of 2019 with honors with a degree in cognitive science (mostly AI) and psychology, with a minor in public policy. Then I applied to and got into a data science masters program at the university of San Francisco but my family begged me to stay as I could barely afford to move out there let alone rent and tuition for an intensive program I was expressly not allowed to find a job during as they would have us do free internships with the big Silicone Valley companies. 

Unfortunately I simply couldn’t afford it, I bounced back and joined my first congressional campaign to unseat a certain Republican that attempted to assist the coup attempt. I felt great like this was the right track upon first meeting our candidate, he had had decades of experience at a high level for international aid, he said he wanted to put environmental issues at the forefront and that he could leverage that into creating thousands of jobs for his potential constituents, I was sold. I was the new co policy writer and social media manager. I was so proud when I started. Then I realized this guy doesn’t have a plan or if he does he doesn’t care about it. We spent the better part of 7 hours a day for two weeks hammering out a platform that me and my co policy writer could be proud of while still not going quite as progressive as we would have liked, we knew there wasn’t support in the demographics but we were damn proud. We had the team check it over and they loved it we published it to the site and were excited for a push for real positive change. I honestly felt a little like Josh Lyman in West Wing having just found my Jeb Bartlet when we first got all together over zoom. In the meantime while we were fixing up the policy we had our candidate out doing local interviews fluff pieces just to have something to post 3 times a day. Our candidate latched on to that specifically interviewing shop/ store owners, it can be a great motivator to see a place you know so we’ll supporting a local candidate that wasn’t your normal everyday bureaucrat. The only problem was that seemed to be the only thing he cared about even after we finished our policy, we know he never read it and suddenly only seemed to care about promoting small businesses and promising to get rid of regulations that stifled their growth. This became a bit of an issue around 3 months in and I had put together a great team of highly dedicated volunteers that were making good on message content unfortunately the candidate would veto almost all of it and when we had a meeting to discuss the direction he wanted his messaging to take he kept dodging the question until the meeting was over. After six months of this my team and I (all volunteer mind you) were getting burned out by the lack of leadership, while the rest of the senior staff were facing the same problem. Eventually the team fell apart, campaign manager left first and that was a tough blow because he was the only thing left to keep any of this together, then one of the event and fundraising coordinators left, then I was asked to downsize my team, that’s when my team and I and the co policy writer left. He’s still running, he has no shot or platform or ideas but he’s going for it. 

Honestly I was pretty disheartened by the whole experience, if this guy who had been in such a powerful position was this aimless what does that say about the rest of American leadership. It also gave me some confidence in a weird way, like if my competition is made up of internet illiterate, geriatrics that are totally out of touch with the people and only seek power then I, someone that actually lives like most Americans and wants to make this place better and has way more ability online, then I have a real chance to convince and show the people. The problem was actually reaching the people, because as you can probably surmise I’m not wealthy but through communinity outreach and participation I thought I had a chance to overcome even that hurdle."

I've been told that by one of my acquaintances who's working in the field. He explained that ""Juniors are a risky investment and often net-negative, and with current situation on the market no sane company will hire one, unless it got money to spare"". I feel like it's too dramatic, but he also has a point. I've graduated with a CS degree this year but didn't have an opportunity to intern during university, now working full time in an unrelated field and trying to break into tech. I live in a poorer region of UK and likely wouldn't be able to accept an unpaid internship now.

I have a couple questions regarding my value as a potential employee. If I understand correctly, employers are looking for entry level workers who need minimal mentoring. Currently I'm familiar with JS and TS, MERN, and MEVN stacks, git, can solve LC easy and some mediums, learning Jest and unit-testing in general, as I heard it's a demanded skill.  
Please share some tips. Would creating more pet-projects focused on forms and authentication be better than any other kind of project? Should I try startups instead of corporate? HRs, what are some qualities that can make you consider hiring a person with 0 YOE? Middle/senior-developers, what would you expect from a freshly-hired junior in your team?"

What I had today at work was something way different. 

As an intern there was a quarterly ecom meeting that I attended along with everyone in the company. Wasn’t nervous going in because I knew I didn’t have to speak. Then the speaker said something along the lines of “… we will go over a lot of things and also have the internships introduce themselves”. Not knowing anything about this I immediately started violently shaking, sweating and was very hard to breath unless I was clapping. I’ve never had such a reaction to anything it was so scary. Even more weirdly, up until the point where it was time for the interns to be introduced, it was actually our project managers introducing us. Right when my mind figured this out, the shaking, sweats, and hard of breathing stopped right away. Just knowing that I didn’t have to speak stopped every bit of the panic attack. This was my first one and I never want to experience that again. Seeing a therapist in 2 days."

Hey all, I wanted to make a post seeking advice for transitioning out of a tpm role into a game dev.

So three years have gone by and I’m scratching my head wondering how to get out of this career path. I don’t hate it I just don’t have any passion for this role and will not be doing this for the rest of my life. Ideally, I would like to become a game dev /game producer (I have a fair amount of coding experience) and am wondering if anyone had advice about transitioning? 

It feels as if the only way I can do it is by going to graduate school or amassing a large portfolio which I don’t know how I would do with my limited time at my current position as that's a large amount of advice I see here.

If you said something wrong or acted disobedient in even the slightest, she would snap and get really violent. For example, my sister struggled to swallow a pill when she was sick and my mom assaulted her brutally. I vividly remember her ripping chunks out of my sister's hair while my sister screamed out for ""daddy."" My dad never really intervened, he would just stand there and tell her to stop without doing much. I witnessed my uncle beat the shit out of my mom and try to murder her because she was beating the shit out of me. Violence and abuse has ran in my family for as long as I can remember and I just grew desensitized to it.

As a child, I always wanted to go outside and play with the other kids. I was always so happy and looking forward to a future where I would finally be able to move out and actually begin my life. However, I started to become more depressed, hopeless, and lost the desire to go outside. I always felt like something was wrong, and it got to a point where I couldn't sleep for 2 days straight, because I would hear screams that weren't even there.

As I got older, our house became filthier and more cluttered and I grew accustomed to never going outside at all. My performance in school became much worse, and I almost failed out because I just didn't want to be alive any more. I remember every traumatic memory I've had ever since I was 3 and have it replay in my head on loop constantly. To cope, I was addicted to YouTube, playing video games, watching porn, and laying in bed all day. On top of this, I was constantly bullied at school because of the way I looked, and didn't have any social skills or confidence. My bullies knew about my family situation and would constantly taunt me about it.

I mustered up the courage to ask for help from my parents while I was tripping on LSD, and my mom said that therapy would only lead me to getting hooked on antidepressants. She said it was my fault I was feeling the way I was, and that I should just get over it. She said I had demons and needed to pray to God to heal my inner wounds. She then proceeded to break into my room, pin me down, put a crucifix in my hands and threw holy water on me. She tried performing an exorcism on me, screaming as she was attempting to cast the demon out of me.

I tried committing suicide and was hospitalized. I was diagnosed with CPTSD and major depression, and put in a program where I was put in therapy and was prescribed drugs to treat me, but my mom would constantly yell at me and my dad trying to get me out of it. When I ran out of antidepressants, my parents stopped caring and I eventually dropped out of therapy because that wasn't helping either.

My long distance girlfriend has grown so concerned for my deteriorating health, that she called my dad recently and pleaded to put me in therapy. She described every symptom I was having, but my dad acted clueless and tried flipping it on her as if it was her fault I'm this way. I've realized now that my parents don't really give a shit about me at all.

I'm going to graduate college next year and I have no idea what I'm going to do after that. I picked a useless major (Music Technology) because my mom forced me to attend when I didn't even want to. I have a 4.0 GPA but have no connections, internships, and I don't really do anything to study. My professors treat me like I'm special and want to work on individual projects with me outside of class, but I honestly don't care at all.

My girlfriend has a detailed five-year plan and has been busting her ass off to the point where she's guaranteed a high paying job after graduating. In contrast, I genuinely don't have any plans at all for when I graduate next summer. My girlfriend  is very understanding and says I can live with her and her mom in Cali. They know my situation, but I feel so guilty leeching off of them like this.

I thought that moving in with my grandma for the summer would help motivate me to find work, but it's completely unlivable. It's hoarded just like my old house, and there are hundreds of mice, fruit flies, and wasps roaming around every corner. I thought moving in would help motivate me to get a summer job, but my habits of doing nothing at all have gotten worse, along with my PTSD.

All I do is surf the internet, play video games, watch porn or TV. It's the only escape I've ever known and I don't know how to stop. If I do, all of my darkest, repressed memories start to take over. I still feel like I'm 10 years old, suspended in time and forced to relive all the horrible shit I've witnessed and experienced.

I've exercised daily, ate healthy, and only focused on school for 6 months, but it hasn't really helped much. Every time I try to help myself, I always fall back into the pit and remember how I never had a real childhood. I honestly don't want to do anything with my life anymore, and just want to waste away until I die.

I'm very much at a breaking point and the only thing that gives me the slightest glimmer of hope is the thought of my future with my girlfriend. She's always been there for me even through long-distance these past few years, and I don't want to give up while I still have her. I want to turn my life around but I honestly have no idea how at this point.

w3wio7,57,2022-07-20,Struggling with getting my first entry level job,muse_kimtaehyung,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/w3wio7/struggling_with_getting_my_first_entry_level_job/,"I’m a new grad with an engineering degree. I’ve applied to ~300 in the past 3 months, and completed interviews with 15 different companies so far (with 0 offers). My behavioral rounds go quite well, and interviewers give positive feedback about my confidence and the way I talk through the interviews. However, whenever a company moves onto the technical round, I end up completely bombing it. I feel that I’m decently good at coding in general and did well in university, but as soon as the interviewer shows me a problem I completely blank out and struggle to have an answer ready in such a short amount of time. No matter how much I practice for these technical interviews, I end up completely screwing the pooch when the interviewer throws coding questions at me. 

Does anyone have good advice? I’m so worried because it’s been months since I graduated and being unemployed is not looking good ☹️

Also, one of the companies I interviewed with (back when I was in school and bagging internships) had a take-home exam, and I did really well with that format, but I haven’t found any other company like that since. Do you guys know any companies that don’t test candidates like this? 

I apologize for the rant, I bombed another interview today (Python/SQL interview for a QA role) and I’m so bummed because I worked so hard before it and still blanked out when they started asking me their questions. As soon as the interviewer started questioning why I was writing the statement a certain way, I started anxiously stuttering my way through.. and it’s frustrating because I feel that I can do really well on the job if a company just gives me a chance 😓"

I'm still not very used to The Reddit and my IQ drops every year :(

I think I've hit a rock bottom in my career as I'm heading into my Senior year with 0 internship, 0 relevant work experience, 0 research opportunities, and a mediocre independent skill set of several languages and that's all.

To summarize what I'm working with as a Rising Senior in University:

- 3.6 GPA CS Major with a concentration in Cybersecurity in the Honors program &amp; Upsilon Pi Epsilon honors society (instead of showing relevant coursework, I had a 1-paged cover letter covering my best works and skills learned during my Cyber courses. Wonder if that was my red flag?)

- Minor in Psychology that I'm honestly a lot more interested in than CS, but discouraged by peers and family to pursue a career in.

- Python, C, C++, Unix, Lua, Powershell, and HTML are the strongest lamguages under my belt (but too stupid to understand Java and related)

- CompTIA Security+ certified

- Work experience is from 2017-2020 working at coding camps for kids as a program coordinator and helped packaged code to support non-profit organizations during these coding events (stopped after Covid started and did not pursue more jobs as I wanted to focus entirely on school work since I'm a dumbass); none after that.

- Sent only 12 apps in Sophomore year, 30ish during Junior, and over 80 starting February 2022 up till now.

- Asian

Out of over 120 apps I recieved 3 Inter- nevermind I think I need to redact this paragraph because I'm pretty sure its this I word thats triggering Automoderator. This cry for help isn't about those, as I am struggling to even get into the first round. All one needs to know is the first one I failed a LeetCode session and never skipped LeetCode day whenever I sent a confident application since then m, and the other two went fairly well but got ghosted for unknown reasons.

Honestly, I would have been a liabiity anyways as the cybersecurity program in this University is pretty primitive and I'd probably do more harm than good for their security. We don't cover Pentesting at all and only starting Junior year do we learn Python adaptations of writing malware and security systems. They were far from useless, but I'm certain this is quite insufficient compared to other applicants.

I understand the anti-imposter sigma grindset here is to grind Leetcode and independently learn to make a repetoire on Github, and while Leetcode has now made me fluent in doing coding challenges in Python &amp; C, I'm struggling to pick up some languages (particularly Java) and I've had awful focus in completing and publishing projects. I've started and prematurely terminated many projects for one or more of these reasons: loss of interest, incompatible with my computer specs + VM issues, couldn't find nor attain the next subgoal until the brick wall of skill issue, &amp; discovering someone else already published their work on Github + more to it. I'm also struggling a lot to learn basic Pentesting as well. Yay!

Thank you all very much for reading if you haven't clicked away in 2nd hand embarassment already! I would appreciate any advice for my predicament here whether it may be to continue going for that 200 internship apps milestone, give up and just focus sheerly on LinkedIn networking, or even just ""git good"" (literally).

For a little context I have an internship this summer. Super great work life balance and I’m proud of what I have, it’s not faang or any big names, but it’s good enough for me. When I told them about the offer they were seemed impressed but that was really it, which I did not care at all.

Internship starts and it’s fully remote. A week in they begin getting upset with me about how I can’t be working remote like this all day. I too agree that from 9-5 it’s not ideal to be sitting like this so that’s why before work I run, and after I usually hang out with friends, you know, like a normal person. Oh and I’m not doing this eating garbage food all day, I eat 1000-1200 calories a day of vegetables and protein and once in a while I’ll throw in a fast or something. Another few weeks go by and they are livid me every-time I do anything. My dad works outside everyday because he likes taking care of the yard. I help out every chance I get. Recently he decided to cut and trim every tree in out yard, easily 20+ trees and it would have taken us a few hours worth of work. He asked me to help and I said I couldn’t at the time because I had work, and both my parents blew up talking about how it’s bullshit i can’t help my father and that I don’t really work which is very frustrating because I do work, I worked hard to get here, and even if it’s not backbreaking work outside it still is work I can just get up and stop while I’m on the clock. I never speak around them anymore.
They asked me to come to their room to talk a few days ago bc they notice I no longer interact with anyone in the house which I do on purpose because it’s always an issue. They basically said I need to get my life together. 

My dad finally approached me a few days ago and asked me if I could build something that he can send to clients like an online portfolio for his woodworking business. I said I can absolutely do it for you but with my internship it could take maybe 2-3 weeks to be functional. 

Tonight at dinner he brought it up and I said to him “Yea I would love to, do you think u would pay me or anything?” And that’s where it was. That comment ruined it. They said it was selfish and wanted me out of the house that I would even ask that. At the time I actually didn’t think it was a big deal just as friendly conversation and I didn’t think it was unreasonable for 3 weeks worth of work on top of my internship. I was literally like thinking $50 lol. 

My parents hate what I do, and I would have no problem with that, but every chance they get it’s a stab at me for what I do and how it’s not right and stuff. Our relationship is gone. We don’t speak and not really sure how to fix it. Does anyone else’s parents hate what they do? Software engineering and this lifestyle is rather new for traditional parents which I think is the issue. Idk, maybe it’s me"

w41mqt,1,2022-07-20,I’ve been working as a vet assistant at a clinic for 3 weeks now and I’m thinking on quitting,Chubby_Kitty29,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/w41mqt/ive_been_working_as_a_vet_assistant_at_a_clinic/,"Please bear with me as this is a long read:

The title says it all. I’ve (20F) had years of kennel experience but I need to get more experience in treatment before I apply to vet school. I know how intense working in the medical field is, but this specific clinic almost made me reconsider my career choice. 

During my first week, I kept forgetting to label bloodwork and put it in the fridge which happened a total of three times on two different days. I owned up to that situation and have been improving since then. 

They’re very inflexible with the schedule. During the interview I explained that I’m currently in school taking summer courses but the manager brushed it off and I never got the chance to talk about what days I needed off. Upon hiring me, they originally scheduled me to work 36 hours a week. It was such a hassle trying to talk them down to 30. When fall semester starts next month, I have to reduce my hours to 25, as I’m taking 17 credits. I already know that talking to the manager won’t be easy. 

As a VA, I have to start exam rooms by taking a medical history and communicating with the doctor. The vet that I’ve worked with the most says I’m doing a great job, but there was one day where the practice manager was shadowing me to see my progress. I got really uncomfortable with her micromanaging that day and kept messing up certain tasks or stuttering which caused her to condescendingly correct me in front of clients. Then the practice manager suddenly told me that I’m only allowed to do vaccine rooms and tech appointments (nail trims and anal glands) instead of sick rooms. However, whenever there were clipboards piling up with rooms I’m not allowed to take, she starts yelling at me about why nothing’s done. 

Today both the manager and supervisor talked with me and gave me a writeup form for the three times I’ve forgotten bloodwork. Not only that but she also said that whenever there are clipboards that I just sit there and don’t grab them (most of them being sick rooms) when SHE is the one telling me to only do vaccine rooms. One second I’m told that I’m doing a fantastic job by either her, my colleagues or the doctors, the next second she tells me I’m not progressing. This was within the span of a week in a job with a steep learning curve. I keep getting mixed signals about my performance and I don’t know what to do anymore. 

I’ve honestly never cried so much at a job, especially one that I’ve barely been at for a month. I even had a panic attack in the bathroom. I feel like an idiot for quitting because this is the third clinic I’ve worked at (the first one I was laid off because of COVID after 7 months, the second one I left after a year to finish my VA externship which couldn’t be done at the place I worked at). 

They wrapped up the meeting by saying they’re trying to help me become the best vet assistant I can be, yet they gaslight me into thinking I’m the one being uncooperative and not communicating, but whenever I try to communicate by asking questions or voicing my concerns, I’m met with a sense of hostility. Whenever I’m not sure about something and ask for help they give me attitude, but when I try to do something without guidance I’m in the wrong. 

If I quit, it’s not like I’ll be unemployed. I have a paid research internship coming up and I could work at school as a lab technician while I take a break from vet med. 

I just can’t handle this place anymore."

During my first week, I kept forgetting to label bloodwork and put it in the fridge which happened a total of three times on two different days. I owned up to that situation and have been improving since then. 

They’re very inflexible with the schedule. During the interview I explained that I’m currently in school taking summer courses but the manager brushed it off and I never got the chance to talk about what days I needed off. Upon hiring me, they originally scheduled me to work 36 hours a week. It was such a hassle trying to talk them down to 30. When fall semester starts next month, I have to reduce my hours to 25, as I’m taking 17 credits. I already know that talking to the manager won’t be easy. 

As a VA, I have to start exam rooms by taking a medical history and communicating with the doctor. The vet that I’ve worked with the most says I’m doing a great job, but there was one day where the practice manager was shadowing me to see my progress. I got really uncomfortable with her micromanaging that day and kept messing up certain tasks or stuttering which caused her to condescendingly correct me in front of clients. Then the practice manager suddenly told me that I’m only allowed to do vaccine rooms and tech appointments (nail trims and anal glands) instead of sick rooms. However, whenever there were clipboards piling up with rooms I’m not allowed to take, she starts yelling at me about why nothing’s done. 

Today both the manager and supervisor talked with me and gave me a writeup form for the three times I’ve forgotten bloodwork. Not only that but she also said that whenever there are clipboards that I just sit there and don’t grab them (most of them being sick rooms) when SHE is the one telling me to only do vaccine rooms. One second I’m told that I’m doing a fantastic job by either her, my colleagues or the doctors, the next second she tells me I’m not progressing. This was within the span of a week in a job with a steep learning curve. I keep getting mixed signals about my performance and I don’t know what to do anymore. 

I’ve honestly never cried so much at a job, especially one that I’ve barely been at for a month. I even had a panic attack in the bathroom. I feel like an idiot for quitting because this is the third clinic I’ve worked at (the first one I was laid off because of COVID after 7 months, the second one I left after a year to finish my VA externship which couldn’t be done at the place I worked at). 

They wrapped up the meeting by saying they’re trying to help me become the best vet assistant I can be, yet they gaslight me into thinking I’m the one being uncooperative and not communicating, but whenever I try to communicate by asking questions or voicing my concerns, I’m met with a sense of hostility. Whenever I’m not sure about something and ask for help they give me attitude, but when I try to do something without guidance I’m in the wrong. 

If I quit, it’s not like I’ll be unemployed. I have a paid research internship coming up and I could work at school as a lab technician while I take a break from vet med. 

I just can’t handle this place anymore."

I hope I am doing this correctly.

I live in Colorado. I'm a 21 year old college student who will be graduating with a degree in Computer Information Systems (CIS) in spring of 2023. I plan to purse a career in IT. I have 2 years helpdesk experience in IT and am currently in an IT + Marketing internship this summer (I spend mornings with marketing and afternoons with IT). I will be 22 when I graduate. I will have a CompTia A+ and N+ certification.

As far as personal belongings I'd like to take, I don't have much - I can't imagine it'd even fill a small trailer. I plan to bring a desktop, monitors, gaming peripherals, etc. with me, but if it's more viable/cost effective to just sell everything and build another setup in NZ that's fine by me. I do still need to bring a few other belongings though.

I will be going alone, no pets or anything. I have $10k in savings currently and will likely have $15k-ish by graduation time.

I currently live in a fairly arid area - the winters are very cold and the summers are hot. I don't have a specific preference for climate. I prefer the cold in general though. I would prefer a higher elevation city with fairly decent internet access. Cost of living doesn't matter, as long as we're not talking SF or NY ridiculous.

I have no criminal record, and I am both a US and a Colombian citizen currently.

If there's any other relevant info that is needed (that I haven't managed to think of), please let me know and I will respond in the comments.

Thanks in advance to any one who can help me understand what this could look like."
w42gtl,2,2022-07-20,Could someone please suggest me majors based on my course selection and ecs?,Uncoolwonderwoman,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/w42gtl/could_someone_please_suggest_me_majors_based_on/,"Not sure if this kind of post is allowed, but I'm curious about what majors I should look into. I'm applying as CS to my matches (like it but not in love) because of the job opportunities, but I was was unsure of what to apply as to reach colleges (ivies, top publics). I definitely want to explore more majors and I might even switch if I go to a match school, so if someone could help me, that would be great! I'm wondering what major makes sense for me based on my ecs and course selection.

Interests: My favorite classes so have been AP world history, AP chem, and PLTW engineering.

Courses (rated on a scale of 1-10): Calc BC (7 ), Multi (5), Stats (7), Bio (7), Chem (9), US History (8), World History (9), 2 PLTW engineering courses (10, mostly projects tho)

(5s on all APs taken, so I think I'm decently skilled in all)

Senior course load: AP music theory, AP CS A, AP gov, AP macro, pltw engineering course

ECs: research internship in designing a new technology related to electronics and chem, scioly (mostly physics/chem/build/stats events), making and selling bath products (surprising amount of chem), anti-vaping education (organized an event with a friend), book blogging, art (embroidery, painting, etc. for fun), piano (for fun, performed at a few recitals), independent coding projects (nothing insane though)

Future plans: Idk, maybe research or a corporate job. I definitely want to work on something interesting and new that keeps me busy. I also want enough money, but I don't need an excess amount. In terms of location, there just have to be people around. I'm fine with small town or large cities.

Thanks!"

The first two years out of college I worked as an FPGA Software Engineer and used Verilog to program our devices. And then I thought it was only going to be a year just to get some work experience before I do a Master's at Machine Learning. What should have been one year turned into two years and maybe I wasted too much time on that career path.

But then I'm on my second year as a Master's student for ML, and I am having second thoughts about pursuing this field as a career because of the highfalutin terminology that I don't wanna use in my day to day. Also just the nature of training a model, and then see if it works out well is something I dislike apparently. (This wasn't clear to me at the time). During my internship as a computer vision researcher, I didn't really like the inventing new methods aspect, but maybe an ML Software Engineer would appeal to me. Is this strange?

So now, am not sure of what I actually wanted to do. Like cloud engineering, backend engineering, data engineering are choices I am currently considering. That is basically the category of companies I've been applying to, but my previous experiences and programming languages used aren't really relevant. Maybe Python from my ML experience is worth something but not the Verilog. For example, I wish I didn't learn Verilog and instead learned SQL, Java, C++ which are more of the common languages used by the companies. Am currently looking for internships that are in those categories, because they might have a lower bar for experience in relevant languages. I am currently learning Golang to make projects with to add into my resume for these companies, and it always feel like I don't have enough time.

Does anyone feel the same way? or if anyone has advice please let me know."

I'm a data science student set to graduate in a year, but I was actually an intended pre-med student for freshman and sophomore year so I am slightly late in my journey.

I am mostly interested in data scientist/analyst roles with some slight interest in SWE. I read in another post that it is incredibly difficult to find internships post-graduation because they expect students to return back to school once the internship is done, which won't be my case if I apply for a summer internship this coming fall. I'm slightly concerned about my job prospects as I know how crucial internships can be for getting your foot in the door for positions like this. Although I've done a URAP research position for the past year, I did mostly grunt work with data cleanup and visualizations and I'm not sure if that's enough leverage for a senior student.

Almost every HS/county has a robotics team. Additionally, the competitions are super fun!
2. **Science Olympiad/USACO/Hack-a-thons** \- Many hack-a-thons are free online. They typically help you improve on programming skills, or learn new ones. Some Science Olympiad programs such as ""Codebusters"" offer a hack-a-thon like experience, but on a state/national level. The same applies with USACO.
3. **Coding Internships** \- Many universities (even local CC’s) may set you up with a CS professor if you reach out. Doing research/work for a professor not only gives you experience, but may also count as volunteering. Getting an internship at an actual company is also just as good, however may be harder to find.
4. **Summer Camps** \- Teaching kids how to code is greatly looked upon. Many volunteering organizations have STEM focused summer camps and typically look for high school volunteers to run them.
5. **Start a Club** \- If your school does not have a club for something STEM related, could be cybersecurity/coding/data science/etc, start one! Starting a club at most schools is pretty straight-forward, and gives you leadership experience."

w4hmaq,1,2022-07-21,Need advice on internship - health reasons,PharmaCoMajor,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/w4hmaq/need_advice_on_internship_health_reasons/,"Hello folks,

So a bit of a backdrop here.

I am currently 30 and going into my third year of an econometrics and data science bachelors (the study program is 5 years for me). I decided a few months back to start looking for internships to see if I could get a head start. I figured, it would be nice to do an internship now, rather than waiting until my 5th year (when I do my thesis).

Luckily, I managed to secure an internship with a small data science company and the boss is super nice. They even hired another intern to work with me on this internship.

Now, here comes the kicker. Over the last 2 years, stress has hit me hard. I been constantly pushing myself through this degree and at times, almost pushing too hard, on the verge of burnouts. I was never a stressed person, but over the last 2 years, I have really been pushing the stress hard and not really paying much attention to my overall mental (and sometimes physical) health. Unlike in my early 20's - the effect of stress I feel alot more than back then. In other words, if I don't take care of myself now, I feel the affect effects, while in my 20's I could push harder.

1.5 months ago, my appendix burst and due to my stress and extreme stubborness, I decided to just take painkillers and deal with it. I had exams, so naturally, I didnt have time to go to the hospital. A few days after, I was hit with a massive fever. Again, I decided to just take painkillers. For the month following this, I was constantly in pain with stomach cramps and extreme tiredness. I went to the hospital as an emergency, and indeed, from ultrasound tests, my appendix had indeed burst. Luckily, the surgeon confirmed that my body had indeed started repairing itself, containing the infection. But it is going to take a further 2-3 months to fully heal (basically left with scar tissue in the region). Surgery is not an option as the body has effecively walled off the point of damage.

Lets just say I was lucky with this. But maybe next time, if I pull the same crap, probably not. The surgeon itself was amazed and said this is really a rare incidence.

After this event, it was sort of a wake up call for me - i needed to take better care of my stress, mental health and pysical health.

Currently, I had a small part time job on the side (very low stress, easy money) and my study. If I was to take this internship, it would mean introducing a third variable and at this point, I think it would become way too much stress for me and I would probably end up back in the same position as before. I talked to my the CEO (she is the one who took me under) to explain what I had been through and she agrees that I take it slow and she would like to have a meeting with me in 2 weeks time to make plans for the internship starting in September.

Honestly, I have been thinking about this and on the one hand, its a great oppotunity to get my foot in the door before the end of my study. On the other hand, I am no longer 20, and I have been letting too much stress run me over the last two years and for me, the priority is to get to the end of my degree alive. I need to take better care. At the moment, when I speak to the internship lady, my answer will be to not start the planned internship from September, obviously explaning to her what I have outlined above.

I know this is giving away a good oppotunity, but I am trying to think of my health here (and for me, I always placed studies above health, regardless of the stress). Being 30, my body is less resistant to that now and the last thing I want, is to be back in the hospital because again, I placed everything else above my health.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My question to you guys - what would you do in this situation? Perhaps suggest starting the internship later on down the road in your degree? (Is this reasonable? Perhaps in a year or two?) Anyone who has been faced with similar decisions I guess I would like to hear how you dealt with it.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope you guys could give some advice!

Many thanks!"

I graduated with a MSc in Data Science and I would like to work at a Level 3 company in The Netherlands (Amsterdam) as a Data Scientist. Example companies are among others Booking.com, Uber, Databricks, Flexport, and Netflix.

The problem I encounter is that none of these companies offer jobs or internships for graduates it seems. I got rejected for a job at Databricks, most likely due to lack of experience. 

My question is therefore: how/where can I get experience to actually get into this companies? My current plan is to do a traineeship at a bank (ING/ABN/Rabo) and then from there apply to these companies, but I would much rather start at a Tier 3 company."

My management don't care about teaching me anything. They are too busy with R&amp;D requests that I get left with doing nothing. This has been doing on for months now. I never enjoyed the company culture either. The entire makeup of the engineering/tech department is white men. Nothing wrong with that, but it's very isolating being the only POC girl. Being here makes me hate my career. I sit and stare at code for hours a day. No one is in my office room to talk to me, because they are busy else where. If I ask to do a task, my management tells me to chill out and wait. If my management gives me a task and tell me they will show me how to do it, they take days or weeks to have the time to show me how to start something. It is so draining coming in everyday 8-5, yes 9h shifts, and do absolutely nothing. For a time, I used my energy to just run through leet code, learn new languages, earn certificates, and even do homework. I can't even say that I feel bad about being paid to do nothing, because I had tried to do tasks, but my management is too busy to care.

I just want to leave this internship and start somewhere else. I have been applying to other internships, but most of them are for 2023 summer. If I left now, I would not have an internship for months or even next summer. Which is better?

I'm doing a 6 months internship and developed a huge crush on someone working there, we exchange glances but I always tried to keep those feelings to myself since I heard that he has a gf. My internship is going to end next month and he's probably going on vacation in one or two weeks so I just wanted to see him more before seeing him disappearing so I asked a friend who works there something about my crush but it was a very simple question just to be able to see him in the end of the day, this friend didn't understand that it was an indirect question so he went asking him and even told him that i'm the one who's searching for this info.
Now i feel so embarrassed because as explained, i wanted to keep it to myself and not letting him know, i didn't go to work today and probably won't go tomorrow but i'm afraid to see him next week since I really have to go finish my project ...

This is going to be a very long read so I understand if you guys don't wanna read the whole thing. 

A quick background about me: I was never into academics. Growing up I was so not interested in studying. I wouldn't do my homework until the teacher punished me for it. I would skip school for days. I just wanted to daydream(Maladaptive) all day. Acting them out and stuff like that. I was told by my therapist recently that I have all the signs of adhd and it all adds up now. Of course the way my parents thought would fix me was by shaming me for not getting good grades and conparing me against my sister who did. On the other side of the spectrum was my sister. Who was(is) the good child. Listens to parents, works hard, gets good marks to make sure she doesn't anger mommy and daddy. I honestly never cared. But as I grew up I realised that no one was gonna save my ass if I stayed a D grade student in the future so I slowly improved myself. I wasn't exactly a grade A student but I did well enough to survive. Like a mediocre person. Even now. Of course there was parental favouritism growing up( in a very complicated way). Especially my dad was very proud of her but equally disappointed in me. 

This is something I started to notice after my sisters marriage in 2020. I am an Indian and here when a girl gets married she is sent off to her in laws place for the rest of her life. So that's what happened with my sister. 

When this happened for the first time I was alone in my room. I go to college so I was in my third year of engineering and the tension around campus and placements were soaring high. So like everyone I got into preparing for the interviews for 6 months. 

These 6 months I was so productive. Part of it definitely was because of the tension and stress of not being able to land myself a job but still. I was so consistent. Then there were days when my sister would come to my house. And I would literally feel like not being productive at all. I would be so damn depressed. Even now she is here for two weeks and I haven't been able to focus on my internship project and I keep procrastinating. Not that I don't do that in general but most of the times I am aware of it and I try to manage my time. 

I do not know why in her presence A) I don't believe in myself that with sheer consistent hard work I can achieve anything , B) I literally feel so drained around her I can't even explain. These two weeks has been me being a good younger sister listening to her marriage troubles, her in laws stories and trying to make her feel good from whatever is depressing her. 

In a way I have always felt like every thing in my house revolves around two people's conveniences, my dad and my sister. My dad gets the first priority though(he has been very toxic and abusive to all 3 of us aka me, my mom and my sister). Then in the absence of him my sister is the one who does a lot of emotional dumping, raves about how difficult her work is(she's a data scientist), or boasts about her little achievements throughout the day and announces them. She literally explains everything about her work and how amazing it is to my parents and they obviously think that she is great. I on the other hand don't share anything and even if I did my dad would be like ""I don't care about yours I wanna hear your sisters first"". So I don't tell them about my achievements and honestly they're not that impressive either(like I said I'm mediocre). 

I remember when we were kids and whenever guests came over to our house my dad would ask my sister to sing for them(we both were/are trained singers). And when my sister tried to geet me to duet with her my dad would be like ""No you sing. Your younger sister will get her chance later"". He would make her sing like four to five solo songs and get to me and ask me to sing one or two and later ask both of us to sing together as a "" Finisher"". I am honestly crying as I am typing all of this right now because I see how fucking toxic he is. 

Anyways I am trying to understand why I get so depressed and unmotivated around her to do things that I should be doing. And I also wanna know how to combat that."

I work as a junior developer in Italy, my focus is mainly Java 8 and its environment in a big financial company that's a good name in my cv. I'm completely self taught and switched career at 31yo few years ago from sales (was getting good money but also depression).

At this point (3 years in) i'm confidently one of the best developers here in my own niche (the average guy will run away if i just say ''leetcode'' so tbh there's not much competition lol).

My question is: what would you suggest me to focus on right now if my focus is to get hired in some big tech US company?

I've seen people get into 200-300k positions who know barely more than me but have the big advantage of having an important degree or strong referrals (usually the two are linked). I'm a bit frustrated of earning 35-40k (which is okayish in italy eh) when the world offers much more. Especially cause soon i might move to a senior/lead position where i will be doing serious work for barely few grands more per year.

Should i go back to study and get a degree? Should i study more algos and sysdesign in my free time?

Everyone says work experience matters more but i would be okay in an intern position at a faang lol. Once i'm in i'm sure i can get it working. How do i even get an interview?

Any advice appreciated!"

w4kqgx,6,2022-07-21,Bioinformatics phd for fall’23 cycle,YellowSubmarine8989,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/w4kqgx/bioinformatics_phd_for_fall23_cycle/,"Hi guys, I’m a master’s student at an Ivy League and am majoring in biomedical engineering with a focus on bioinformatics and machine learning. I would like some thoughts on my profile for phd. I have a 3.5 GPA and have done an undergrad in computer science from India. I moved here right after that and have done two semesters of research at my institution (though more image processing focused) under another professor who’s well known in that field. I’m working as a summer intern at another research institution working on protein structure prediction and mutant prediction. I have one more semester of my masters left and will most likely be working at a lab during the same. I’m interested in cancer genomics/protein prediction/functional genomics/bioinformatics phd programs. 

I’m interested in the following programs as of now, though if anyone has more suggestions on these I’d love to know more! 

1. Cold Spring Harbor Lab PhD
2. UConn-Jackson Labs PhD
3. UCB-UCSF joint PhD program
4. Sloan Memorial Kettering-Cornell Weill-Rockefeller University Tri Institutional PhD 
5. UPenn GSB
6. NYU Vilcek
7. MIT or MIT-HST(there are some labs at the whitehead institute that are quite interesting!)
8. UWash Seattle
9. Caltech/CMU-Pittsburgh/Yale/Columbia/UCSD? 

For my recommendations, the professor I worked with at my masters institution is someone I’m looking at. He did his postdoc at one of the above institutions. Apart from that, my managers and PI at my summer research lab are also good recommenders who have done their PhD at one of the above labs. During my undergrad I did more tech focused internships.

Though I don’t have any publications :/

I’d to know if I should be editing my list of programs or any other suggestions are more than welcome! Thank you!"

I got an on-campus internship last year then a PPO(at 18 CTC) last week as a data analyst at an MNC.

Should I go for a masters degree outside India(can afford) considering I want to be a ML engineer and there is a bias towards masters/PhD students for those roles, plus my bachelor's degree is in a circuit branch.

Or try to look for better off-campus offers for better roles(DS/ML) and pay."
w4m6es,6,2022-07-21,"TL;DR ""Run of the Mill"" Here's where I am in IT, Am I doing this right? 22 / Male",basicallyconnor,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/w4m6es/tldr_run_of_the_mill_heres_where_i_am_in_it_am_i/,"What's up Guys / Gals.

Let me preface this by saying I have 0 Certs. Also I live in rural South Georgia, so the cost of living is obviously a lot less then say Colorado or NY when factoring in pay. This is primarily just a brain dump of where I am in my career and not sure where I can head from here.

I started my first IT job/internship when I was 17 about 5 or so years ago. This was primarily intro level 1 1/2 stuff. Hardware fixes for company laptops / desktops, imaging, AD management etc. This was an internship so my pay rate was basically half of my coworkers. I started at $8.50.

&amp;#x200B;

Second Job was from 2019-2021 at a Kyocera Direct MSP. 3 months after starting my entire IT team turned over, so they essentially handed a 19 year old the entire IT department. It was sink or swim, but I learn quick on my feet and managed to run the department for a little over 2 years. This included everything under the sun as far as MSP's go. All the networking and management was handled by myself. This job started at or around $11-11.50 and before I left I was on a static $43k salary.

\*Note\* After working for a billion dollar MSP, I would never do it again unless I was making enough money to throw away all of my respect for my mental health. Take that for what it is.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to current date, I'm a little over 5 years or so working with businesses and I'm now working for a private group of brothers that own many companies and real estate managing all IT operations for them. This has been a breathe of fresh air as the dumpster fire I came from nearly burnt me out of IT all together. My first year here I am on $50k salary.

&amp;#x200B;

The only concern I have is that I feel living in my rural city, the wage cap is probably a lot lower than most places. I'm not sure if it would be a good decision or not if this job ends up not working out in a year or two, to open up my own MSP company and try to scrape by with the relationships I have with local companies or to try and move into a larger city and peruse something lucrative. I understand that at 22 making $50k isn't bad by any means I'm just trying to plan for the future as I don't want to get complacent and give away all my best years to a blood sucking ORG. I like to think I have a good head on my shoulders but some times I get wrapped up in where I think I should be and forget that things don't happen over night. Maybe this is just me searching for reassurance. Any how, thanks guys."
w4m7ae,7,2022-07-21,Been running my own shop for a year now. Here are some thoughts.,ramostofthetimeiwin,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/w4m7ae/been_running_my_own_shop_for_a_year_now_here_are/,"I went into private practice with an exceptional colleague after 3 rubbish experiences for context. I’m a mental health therapist. 

1. My first job out of grad school was community mental health. Seriously underpaid, yelled at for mistakes, once was asked to go march with the company for the pride parade because “you’re…. You know. Gay right?” 

Had my curriculums I designed for groups stolen, forced to do trainings we didn’t need to, never allowed to do trainings I did, taught to treat people like numbers to rack up for making so many billable hours. Once got trained on working with a serious case but not informed of the fact this human tends to throw actual human feces at people(I had to duck a few times) Only thing I can say is, my direct managers always were looking for ways to make it work. My team lead made me
Get fired instead of quitting and classified my firing as a certain type of termination to get me unemployment. Homie also made them give me severance and just gives the glowingest reviews. 

2. A better position… ish came after about a year. I took on two jobs. This clinic is basically like “we contract you to see people and help
You build a business.” Pay money for a business license, im like their 4th person they bring on. Then two months in they inform me that money I spent on a business license was useless as they had to hire me as a w2 employee. I swallow it and just ask them to pay the license fee back. They don’t. 

They start to suck, I left the other job. I try to give them more time, don’t get new clients, get absolutely DRESSED down verbally by both owners for not telling them I’m taking unemployment and for having the audacity to apply for it in the first place. They offer stipends for tech during pandemic, they belittle me for wanting to use mine on headphones that enable me to hear better. They subtley insinuate I’m just trying to get “nice gaming headphones.”

So I quit again!!

3. Another small team, basically a medical provider who wanted mental health on hand, then just NEVER stopped to learn how our field work and how to make our teams work together well.

February he tells us he’s NOT firing us. 

March he tells me he’s firing me and the person who would go onto be my business partner. 

We start a practice and boy has it been better.


While the capitalist hellparty(autocorrects doing. Keeping it) is still raging, running my own shop is THOUSANDS of times more rewarding. 

Here are things I’ve learned

1. I get the freedom to see people who can’t afford help and say “fuck it, pay it whenever”
AND PEOPLE DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THAT. I see enough people that I can plenty often just swallow a session. A family with bad state insurance wasn’t having to pay and when they found out the bad state insurance wasn’t paying me, they offered to go to the shit free equivalent in the area. It’s weirdly enough job number one from earlier. People get weirded out sometimes if you take care of them. A seperate person has a high deductible so I said “we’ll bill your insurance to help you meet deductible. Then just pay us as little or as much as you can each month.” 

She said it was the first time anyone had offered that.

2. Others still feel like they are your boss even when they REALLY ARENT. Parents who are like “we don’t have good proof you billed us wrong, but we kinda feel like it. So you do the work of checking for us.”
3. People don’t allow themselves prioritizing, like I so often get emails that are like “im sorry I didn’t handle this sooner” and I often have to think, “bro I forgot you existed till this email reminded me we needed to do this thing, thanks for taking it seriously though!” 
4. Fuck you I work the hours I want. Job 2 and 1 both had really annoying expectations about arbitrary Friday nights you have to have open or weekends you needed to ensure you were there. In particular, job 2 scheduled me out of my availability and played on the emotional heart strings of “you wouldn’t want to leave this person without care would you?” Running my own shop. If someone says “hey can see you see my kid late on a Friday at like 8pm, I get to say no.”
5. If you take care of others, they will take care of you. It takes practice and involves allowing yourself to set the right boundaries, but the thing I’ve learned the most is that all you really have to do to have a stable foothold in this business is to be a good clinician, make sure that clients put some effort into compensating you fairly, and the rest will take care of itself. 

My business partner and I are considering employees, second locations, expanding, interns, and these experiences. As well as this sub, have made me strong in my commitment to NEVER being a shit boss. IF I ever an email employer, I’ll never stop being vigilant to not be any of the assholes I’ve experienced or y’all have experienced.

Thanks y’all!"
w4n47b,3,2022-07-21,Need advice,Flight-To-The-Moon,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/w4n47b/need_advice/,"Hi people! I'm in my second year at a no-name college with my graduation date set for May '23. I really didn't know I was going to be done so quickly so the grad date caught me by surprise. I haven't done any internships or any CS related work because I thought I had more time. I'm kinda scared that I screwed myself over by taking too many credits too quickly. What should I be doing right now so that I can get a job by Fall '23. I have been looking at winternships for '22 and internships for summer '23.

TLDR: What should I be doing if I graduate in a year and haven't done any internships or jobs relevant to CS?"
w4n4ui,2,2022-07-21,First job out of college and not enjoying it,Boring-Floor-1118,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/w4n4ui/first_job_out_of_college_and_not_enjoying_it/,"Hey everyone, 

I got my first full time job out of college back in January (SWE at a startup). I was very excited going into it, but since I started my enjoyment has been going downhill fairly quickly.

I really enjoy all the people I work with, they’re smart, approachable, friendly, etc. but I’m not sure if it’s the domain, the tech stack, me, the company, or what, but the work is extremely demoralizing and it’s very hard for me to scrounge up any energy to work on my tasks. 

The thing is I also ran into this during my internship — which I just attributed to the company, didn’t really think much of it and figured it would get better once I got a full time position. 

During school, I really enjoyed the research I was doing and working on my research projects, I could work on that stuff for hours. Whenever I solved a problem, it felt good. It felt like I learned something fundamental that I didn’t know before. 

Solving problems during my internship and now, doesn’t feel good. It tends to just make me more frustrated. “Oh that’s a really unintuitive thing, why is GraphQL designed like that?”, “Why is this module so incredibly over engineered that it’s unreadable?”, “Why did this engineer choose to perform code golf over here and now no one can understand what it’s doing?” etc. Many of the problems I face feel self-inflicted, avoidable, and frustrating. 

I have hobbies that I enjoy after work, I exercise daily, eat well, sleep well, etc. but in the end, 8 hours of my day is spent feeling empty, unrewarding, frustrated, and depleted of energy and it’s hard to shift my focus to “well, I have a nice paycheck, so I guess I’ll deal with it”. I would take a vacation, but I don’t have much PTO built up, and the city I’m in has seen a massive COL increase in recent years and I can’t exactly afford it. 

I guess my question is every SWE job like this? I like to think that I enjoy Computer Science. I can work on personal projects before and after work for hours without ever feeling tired. My plan is to return to grad school so I can try to pivot into a domain that I enjoy (what I did research in) but my big worry is that I’ll do that and once I get to the “greener grass” I’ll be in the same position."
w4nrj6,1,2022-07-21,How should I prepare for first year technical interviews(yes they do exist lol),Odd-Perspective1423,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/w4nrj6/how_should_i_prepare_for_first_year_technical/,"So basically i started to research for first year computer science internships and found few of the companies who might interview me. I have 2 internships and 1 project on my cv which I hope will be sufficient to get pass the initial screening round. I am worried about the technical interviews, I have just started out learning ds algo in c++ and i am just a newbie, did try doing leetcode questions but cant even do a simple level question. Now i am confused how should I prepare for them so that I can atleast pass the interview. I will start with my undergrad degree this year in september so I am aiming at getting internships for 2023 summer positions.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks a lot!"

I'm actually in an intership in a company (bank sector). 
 But the problem is i live in a city that i know nobody. And depressed i don't enjoy anything and i have social anxiety that get worse and worse. I feel so lonely in the office and i don't interact with full-timers or even other intern. I only speak with my manager sometimes. 
I don't blame them cause i know the problem is me, i get really nervous, anxious, and can't even hold eye contact. I always feel anxious in the street or public places but it's x100 boost here. They think i'm an anti-social or something like this. I can't ask questions and they think i don't care. Even in launch time i seat alone seeing everybody having fun while they look at me like a loser. Nobody care about me anymore and no one even came to say hi or ask me what i do. I feel like a waste of space there. Even the manager don't care anymore because he don't really like my way of talking (it suck really well). The only positivity i learned a lot of skills (coding) with my manager but i can't show my real talent and my real ""me"". 
I just ruined the opportunity to get a job aswell i feel it's hard to be assertive and confident. I try but i can't ! 
Do therapy really help ???"

w4rcg0,2,2022-07-21,data analyst internship,MainMathematician257,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/w4rcg0/data_analyst_internship/,"Hi, I'm a rising sophomore at UCLA. I have some questions regarding finding summer internship next year for data analyst positions and I would love to receive some advice.

1. I just completed the google data analytics recently. So, I think I have learned most of the basic skillsets. I also created some projects and built a somewhat decent portfolio (SQL, Excel, Tableau). Am I ready to apply for summer internship next year? How do I start? Do I just start networking to get referrals and applying everywhere (Linkedln, Handshake, google, etc) like that?
2. I think I'm decent at SQL, Tableau, and Spreadsheet. I know a little of R and I'm also learning it on codecademy to be more proficient in the language. But I'm definitely still a beginner. I don't know anything about Python as of right now ( but I will take a course at my university in the future). Will this be a disadvantage for me in my job searching? Are my skillsets good enough to land an internship for next summer?

Thank you for reading my long post. I really hope to land an internship next summer so any advice/ input is much appreciated. It's my first one so I'm quite nervous and I don't know how much preparation is enough."
w4rr30,0,2022-07-21,Don't know what to do,discovery-,AskProgramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/w4rr30/dont_know_what_to_do/,"Hi, I've finished my freshman year in cs a month back. While I have been coding for a few years now and have been doing competitive programming for some time as well, I have practically zero experience in actual development.

I've landed this internship through someone I know just to gain some experience this summer (the company fully knows this). The problem is, I'm genuinely dumbfounded by how little I know. I always thought that nothing could be that challenging to learn (regarding actual development) because I have some decent experience in algorithms and ds. 

The company I'm interning at uses mainly dotnet core. I thought following a tutorial could be beneficial, so I started following a pretty good tutorial on youtube. While this tutorial was genuinely helpful, I couldn't fully benefit from it because the tutorial was using SQL Server (which I can't run because I'm on Mac), meaning I could only use it up to the halfway point.

At the moment, I'm clueless as to what I should do. I couldn't find any other tutorials in a similar fashion, and without a complete tutorial, I don't know what specific things I need to learn. 

Can someone experienced please share their advice with me? I'd be truly grateful. Thanks in advance,"
w4s43b,6,2022-07-21,I regret my decision,DonkeyAggressive4420,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/w4s43b/i_regret_my_decision/," My spoiled older brother works in my uncle's company in Tokyo. When I was studying, going there and joining him was a dream for me. The company already has apartments ready for them when they travel there. They don't have to pay anything related to rent or even bills.

By the time I was getting close to graduating, my brother got into a lot of trouble in the company due to his attitude. Since then, he kept calling me every day warning me not to come to this place because the managers are toxic and so is my uncle's mentality. He almost got himself fired, which caused him to hate him so much. The pressure he put on me along with my father's kiss ass ( don't want to go into details since this will become too long ) behavior towards my uncle kinda turned me off and I ended up deciding not to join my uncle's company, even though he offered me an internship.

Now, I found an interesting job opportunity in Munich. The company looks good. I was excited at first but now that my VISA appointment is getting close, I started to stress about the apartment hunting since it's so difficult, the savings, and lots of stuff. I then realized... I'm alone in this, unlike my brother.

I have never been outside my country and thought I decided to live somewhere else, with a higher quality of life. I would accept guidance, but not favors from family members so that I can be proud of my career ... but now that I almost made it, I feel so alone and I didn't even get my VISA yet. My brother got everything set up for him after studying in a private college to get his engineering degree. He already knew where he will live and he won't even care about rent. He had a cousin there, and his uncle of course. He never tells me the good things. When he gets promoted, he doesn't tell us. When he gets a raise, he doesn't tell us. When a manager forgets to say ""Good Morning"" to him, he calls us whining about the toxic culture.

Me? I got nothing in Munich. I'm so stressed that I am barely talking to my parents and I am sure that I will regret not spending these moments with them when I am about to go to the airport but I can't help but envy my brother and hate his behavior along with my father's that caused me to abandon my dream of working in Tokyo.

There is nothing I could have done better back then. I thought that I will look for a job in Tokyo but Japan is extremely difficult for junior engineers and COVID made it even much worse."

We were wondering if there was a simple way of offering this code package to others, without them being able to view our code at all. Of course, the first thing that we thought of was creating a front end, have it run on the back end, and charge them as such, but is there any possible way to have someone run a command on the command line, and we would somehow return them the csv file and still charge them?

The class is intense(regular semester long course compressed into a month) but manageable and I'm doing ok in it. My job is an internship that I work part time(20 hours now, was 35). Right now I'm struggling a lot with mental health(not because of internship/class), and I think that stopping the internship to focus on the class and my mental health for the rest of summer before my fall classes start might be important to stopping a pretty harsh spiraling that has been happening through the summer. Also, I started working a few days after spring semester ended, so I haven't had a summer break/break at all. With the way the internship is going right now I feel like I can't progress until I learn more, which I plan to do, but it's more of content that I need to learn on my own time/need more time to understand. I've been having to learn a lot of new software and programming languages in the span of a few weeks. I've already learned a lot and have a good sense of what direction/path I need to continue in. 

Next week I have my midterm so I took some days off, but then the second week of August is my final. Fall classes start a little more than a week after the final. My parents want me to return home for a week before I start my fall classes so they can help me. I lost track of dates and I originally wanted to stop working the internship the first of august. The company I work with is small, and my bosses are nice and understanding. Do you think it would be ok to explain my struggles to them about my mental health, and need to end the internship abruptly? I don't plan to work with them long term(for other reasons), but I still want to remain professional. I only plan to work two days next week, but those two days would be my last before August 1st. I don't want to just say I'm leaving and not give an explanation as to why. Also, what would be a way to approach the topic of ending the internship? Any advice would be good, I'm just trying to find the best course of action right now."

I don't have much experience in this area but I'm really interested as of recently in learning more low level stuff, and working in C/C++. Only experience is a C programming course, an OS course I'm currently taking, off and on learning a bit of C++ in my free time, and messing with an Arduino for a bit a few years ago.

I want to portray my genuine interest in this area and my eagerness to learn, but I'm also worried about just simply not knowing enough to be an appealing candidate.

To be fair, I don't have much experience in *any* area: I'm a senior in college, and my only work experience is working as a frontend web developer at a web dev lab at my school. And the position I'm applying for is an internship, so I'm hoping the bar isn't set too high.

But still: how do I do my best in this interview when I don't have a ton of C/C++ knowledge, but I have a genuine interest in this area of programming?"

The required level of education for the IT role would be lower than I have pursued so far, but would allow me to enter a new field and obtain new skills, but specializing in my field would allow me to build up experience and credibility. 

I am also aware that it is probably easier to switch back to business after having been in the IT field than it would be the other way around, but I am skill struggling to find out what would be the better path.

Would really appreciate everyone’s insight on this! Thank you for taking the time.

But I really don't have that much knowledge/experience, and I'm afraid my enthusiasm won't outweigh my inexperience when interviewing for this position. I'm hoping because it's an internship, the bar will be a little lower, but I'm worried.

I'm also wondering if they'll ask C specific questions, and although I've been exposed to C, I can't say I'm ""fluent"" or even that comfortable; although I do enjoy coding in it. Are there any topics I should really refresh myself on before Monday comes around?

Any tips for me in this situation?"
w4wh0z,7,2022-07-21,Not sure if Software Engineer Test is for me.,Old-Pirate8467,DevelEire,https://www.reddit.com/r/DevelEire/comments/w4wh0z/not_sure_if_software_engineer_test_is_for_me/,"Hey Guys, I have 2 years experience in a Small IT company. I started in college placement as a Intern SDET,  Then got hired by them after college. Great company, Happy with my team etc, pay is decent for my expierence. I initially jumped on the opportunity because I received a 2.2 in my degree and was concerned about getting a job, typical post college anxiety. So I landed back into a Junior SDET role. 

So for me there is plenty of positives with this role. The biggest one is that I'm at the point where I'm trusted and a lot of responsibility is put into me. I get put onto sprints and my suggestions for the most part get listened to, I get to choose my own secondary tasks, so I can automate or develop what I want in that regard. I get to use my coding ability to a certain extent but not as much as I want. Also all the guys I work with directly on my team, and for the most part the company is fairly sound.

So the first major issue I have is that I don't get to code as much as I want. I have spent the past two years I've been really working on my coding, I feel that I am above average. I applied to Google this year and got through their first technical interview if that's any barometer, got rejected on the 2nd Technical interview. I'm constantly coding outside of work as well. I do 1 or 2 Leetcode  questions most days and I have a genuine interest in learning about the deeper data science and algorithms aspects of it. 

Its something I have gotten notice for in our company. Its to the point that I have worked on front end tickets during sprints when the work load was high. I was offered a front-tend position last year but that was slowly forgotten as my teams workload increased and my manager couldn't find or get budget for a replacement. My manager has since told me that HR wouldn't allow me to be switched because it would require getting someone who isn't a Junior which would cost more. 

The second issue I have is the attitude towards QA from certain teams in my company. I get messages from Product, sales, CE etc asking me to manually verify stuff, create tickets for them, demanding me to verify stuff on projects I'm not involved in. I have also had issue where guys from product air me out in public channels because I wasn't doing pixel to pixel comparisons between proto-types and production. I really don't feel I have the eye for detail when it comes to UI's. I just want to code. I feel I excel when creating test plans, test cases, manual test cases etc. But when it comes to actually verifying stuff for people its a slog.  I really hate it. 

Third issue I have is part of our team is based in a South Asia, These guys while very nice tend to have a very different culture then the Irish team. part of this includes a complete disregard for the QA team. We get entire projects that took months to develop handed off to us with hours of a deadline to verify. The part of the reason I have written this is because I had to stay up till 10pm today verifying the project I was given to test. These guys work on important components and I have to live with this I guess. 

It makes me think is it even worth trying to continue in QA or should I just bite the bullet, take the pay cut and find a junior role in something else? Could this just be the culture of this company might be different elsewhere? The other question is whether a move like this would be difficult because I have been in QA for two years, Would this effect me ability to get a full stack job?"

w4xg7y,22,2022-07-21,Remote interns vs On-site interns,lychee-ramune,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/w4xg7y/remote_interns_vs_onsite_interns/,"The company I work for is a pretty large software company and we were having intern capstone presentations this week. I’d say about 75% of the interns are on-site and the other 25% are remote. 

My friends and I realized a very large difference between us remote interns and the on-site interns in the presentations. We seemed to not really have much “tangible” work to show and mainly were assigned rudimentary tasks that had a great need to be done but no one else wanted, while the in person interns had much more flashy and impressive looking assignments. 

This was sort of discouraging for us as we really wanted to be in-person and do the cool things, but we’re instead assigned remote due to relocation costing too much for us. Has anyone else had this experience at your internships this summer?"
w4xop5,1,2022-07-21,left internship and all I want to do is go back,etowahman66,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/w4xop5/left_internship_and_all_i_want_to_do_is_go_back/,"I had an internship this summer out of state. It had housing and I lived alone for the first time in my life. I loved it. I had to end early and move back home. Sadly I live at home with mother and now I feel  like I've lost all my freedom. Back at my internship I cooked all my meals, I could do what ever I wanted when ever, I had a relationship. Now I have my mother asking me if I'm OK every 5 min (I have a broken foot but can walk), I can't stand long enough to cook, and my relationship from there is just ""friends"". I want to go back back to my internship. It was like being at summer camp but with a bunch of young adults and we were getting paid. I wasn't a huge fan of the job but everything outside of it was amazing. I saw all my friends back home and it feels almost lack luster. I liked being who I was back there. I used the time away from everyone to figure out who I was. And it's pretty much the same person I was before. Just feels different. I feel like I've lost part of me that I found out there. Living at home bugs me so God damn much. I have a chance to move out, but my $ situation has gone down hill and I don't think I can afford it anymore. I just feel lost again."
w4xsou,3,2022-07-21,German Company ignoring my past experience,throwaway_adhd_dev,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/w4xsou/german_company_ignoring_my_past_experience/,"I am from a non EU country and I moved to Germany for masters after 2 years of C/C++  and python dev. In Germany I worked for 2 years as a C# developer and 1 year as a Java developer for enterprise application development l.

Then I transitioned to my current role(DevOps) where I've been working for 2 years but my job designation is that of a developer with 1-3 years of total experience.


On top of that I'm being assigned tasks that an intern is normally assigned and all meaningful work is kept away from me and I'm told by managers that that's the correct task for my role. My managers are also significantly lacking from a technical knowledge perspective as they have a hardware dev background and have no clue about proper DevOps.


I've been passed up on promotions and transitions to other teams have been also denied. 

Upon insisting I was told that I already have enough tasks and that i dont have the right skills.

Now I'm severely depressed as my colleagues are generally nice but when it comes to doing meaningful work I'm wasting time here.

Is this kind of experience evaluation normal in Germany for non german speakers who are not from eu ?

Should I change jobs given the economy ?


TL:DR; previous experience not being considered, feeling underutilized and undervalued and depressed. Is this normal in Germany ? Change job in this economy ?"

I changed my major from computer science to computer engineering mid semester. It’s a CC, it really is a transferable associates in engineering. The only real reason I did that was because i really liked my math class. It was the most interesting for me and my highest grade. I’m still precalc but I don’t think I’ll ever hate math. Some perks from the switch is not having to take some classes that would have been a complete waste of time. Now I’m like 99% sure I’m going to find a programming job for internships and career choice. That was my mindset going into college. I would have chosen software engineering route, but the college I want to go to (UNCC), doesn’t have it. They have both CS and CE. I’m not 100% on that, I still need to call them and ask about it rather than googling it. I’m not sure what I should do, anyone has thoughts?"

i’ll miss so many things. the internship i haven’t finished, my cat pushing her head into my face asking for pets and kisses, sleeping through the rain, binge-watching my favorite shows, eating ice cream on a cold day, the noodles vendor next to school i always buy from.

but i won’t miss the my parents’ sighs or the disappointment on my dad’s face when i asked for the money to pay for school or for when i could no longer afford to hail a ride to get to work. i won’t miss the desperate texts i get from my mum asking if i’ve gotten paid yet and if i could lend her some money to get groceries. i won’t miss the utter shame and humiliation i felt when i had to call up a distant relative whom i hadn’t spoken to in years to lend me some money. 

i won’t miss the selfish little resentment i felt in the back of my mind while trying to be happy about my friends’ accomplishments. i won’t miss looking at myself in the mirror and hating everything i see or the dread and self hatred i felt going to a clothing stores with friends, fully aware that absolutely nothing in there fits me. 

i won’t miss my parents complaining about each other to me. i won’t miss the undoubtedly very skewed perception i have on marriage and the concept of matrimony i have after witnessing the gradual collapse of theirs in all my 22 years of existence. 

i won’t miss feeling guilty just for simply existing. i won’t miss lying on my bed in the dark, staring at the ceiling and wishing that my body would just discorporate and turn into nothingness. i won’t miss spending a chunk of my life praying that i’ll never become my parents despite knowing full well that i’m made up of the absolute worst of their dna combined.

it’s only when i’m sitting down and writing this out that i realize the bad things way outweigh the good. but such is life, i guess. 

so yeah, i’m going to kill myself soon. by monday, i’ll no longer be breathing and i can only hope that everybody will be better off with that."

PWC intern applications have an inclusive employment disclaimer/page and then ask me to disclose any mental conditions that may affect my work (as do all other big 4 firms) and not sure if they'll stay true to their word. They would never outright say my ADHD is the reason they rejected me as its illegal in New Zealand where I am but might say some other generic excuse with this as the underlying reason.

Basically I have it that pros are they may give allowances for the application/interview process (like if I'm jittery during the in-person interview ect.), And cons being they discriminate against me. 

Overall, unsure if its worth it or not

I was super excited cause this was one of my dream schools since early high school. Unfortunately, just recently, I found out I may not be able to afford since it’s out of state. Alternatively I also got into NCSU for CS (I was really okay with either major since each program interested me) which is in-state and much cheaper with aid. I’ve been heavily debating whether I get around 90-100k in student loans at GT for a wonderful experience with leading internship opportunities or if NCSU will be just as great (and with very little debt). I’ve seen people here saying to do the cheaper options, especially for CS but I guess I’m really just hoping for someone to talk me down into being more okay with it since I was really excited to go to GT. Especially with they’re unique threads for CompE classes and co op programs. I just spent months thinking I was gonna be able to go just to get roadblocked last minute. Would really appreciate some reassurance."

w517v3,1,2022-07-22,Plateau in life,Opposite-Sell-710,LifeAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/w517v3/plateau_in_life/,"Hey yall, seeking some advice on my life and how I should go about it.

26M, went to college got my bach's degree in auto tech, during the time did an internship and also worked at a shop. Shop pay was absolute garbage (500 a week). After i graduated i got another job a year later that paid way more close to double and was able to negotiate raises each year. I worked there for 4 years and during the time expanded my tool collection greatly, and was building my own customer base on the side doing side jobs after work. I was making great money, about quadruple my first job on some weeks. My job began to get too strict as they fired everyone but me and started locking me down around the clock and keeping me late with no overtime pay. I decided it was goin to be my last year because my boss denied my vacation i told him about months in advanced because we were too busy and i was the only tech. Before the new year I quit on good terms (made up some bs reason to leave).

I accepted a job from one of my friends with a euro speciality shop for less money. However, in those 2 years working with him my clientelle blew up and upgraded my side work garage to a full unit. I was getting really big jobs as it became known in my area that i wasnt a regular mechanic and actually knew what i was doing. I worked every other day at the shop until i was able to leave completely and be on my own.

Fast forward 2 years now, had to relocate last year due to landlords negligence. Yall know its bad for business to relocate within your first year. Anyway some weeks I did well and some I made next to nothing. Im a young guy so i attract a lot of young customers so nobody wants to pay. I took a lot of losses that I learned from and business is really no joke. This year im focusing on not taking as many losses and getting deposits on every job to avoid people who dont pay etc... Im a die hard workaholic. im the typa guy to work 48 hrs straight, sleep for 3 and do another 48 cuz i needa get a job done.

Ive never really looked for love or had a gf or try to be super social with people. Im pretty anti social but lately ive been trying to break out of that for the sake of my business and expanding to find mechanics and good clients. I had a horrible childhood filled with abuse and trauma from my dad. I have bad anxiety sometimes, overthinker and as of late within these past few months ive become super lazy and have been procrastinating everything. 

Idk what it is. This is the time to grind. Im a lil fat so im in the gym working out in the am, then after in the shop the whoole day. Some days I dont make it to the gym, and end up startin work late anyway then i regret it all at the end of the day. I been trying to schedule my life out and work 10hrs a day max so i can get sleep to hit the gym. I just cant help myself. I spend 15+ hrs in the shop and actually only work 8 of them. I spend so much time reflecting my life that it paralyzes me. Im not making the money I need to yet, I dont got a girl, im out of shape, i dont have a house, my racecars and my daily all need work and i dont have time for any of it, how the hell do people make time for laundry every week. Im also backed up on work for 2+ months with customers still showing up at my shop for small work. 

TLDR
I feel like ive hit a plateau. I essentially laid everything out for myself but my whole passion and drive has disappeared. I dont know if this is what they call ""burnout"" but has anyone felt similarly? I just feel like shit and and bieng lonely dont help. Everyone thinks life is great for me but I actually envy everyone else that can live life normally, make great money without all the struggles, party, and are having kids etc."

w545jy,1,2022-07-22,I Hate My Half-Sister.,EmploymentLow6845,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/w545jy/i_hate_my_halfsister/,"For some background my family and i live a lower class life. My mom is single and barley makes money for rent \[she has asked my sister to help to pay rent sometimes.\] my sister refuses even though my mom said she’ll pay her back. She thinks its “her job as a mom” to pay. My sister doesn’t pay car insurance \[matter a fact she canceled her insurance.\], doesn’t help around with the chores in the house, leaving me to do everything. she leaves the lights on everywhere and doesn’t turn it off. She doesn’t work or attend college and has this fantasy that she is gonna become a millionaire by “give people drawing of where they are going to meet their soulmate.” she doesn’t want to go to college because she doesn’t have anyone to pay for her. My mother asked her for to take one of our dogs to the vet tomorrow and she declined saying it’s wasn’t her dog and so it’s not her problem. I couldn’t do it because my sleeping schedule is different and i’ll be sleeping when during the time of the appointment but now i have to stay past my bedtime to take our family dog to the vet.

Two years ago my sister moved out and left her dog with us for six months and we took care of her dog and cat. My mom sold the cat because my sister wasn’t helping out at all. When I brought up the fact that my mom and I took care of her dog she just laughed and say “she is a family dog.”

Tonight I asked my mom if she could get me some fast food because I rarely ask and just wanted it. I asked my sister what she wanted and she ordered more than me. I was calling my mom to ask what was taking her so long and she said that the line was long and I asked if she was getting anything and she told she she couldn’t afford it. I told my mom to not get one thing my sister ordered. After i ended the call with my mom I told my sister that my mom wasn’t gonna get a thing she wanted. She got upset and was kinda bashing our mom for it.  I made my mom some food for when she got home as a thank for the fast food. As soon as my mom walked in through the door all she kept asking was ""Where is my food?"", ""Did you get anything for me?"" Didn't even bother to say hello to my mom.

My mom told me that my sister and I should take a trip to the beach and that’s she’ll pay for the food and gas. The only thing is that we have to bring all the dogs. I told the first part to my sister that my mom was gonna pay for the trip to the beach and she was 100% into it the idea. Then i told her that we had to bring the dogs and she went from a 100% to an 80% just because of some dogs. I told my mom that she would go to the beach by herself, as she needed some time to rest. \[She works two jobs\] She lives with my mom rent free, does not have a job, told me she was gonna ask my mom to pay for her college, she asked our mom to buy her juuls and throws them away after two days She gave me her juul to throw away. Which I did. She threatened to destroy my room because of it. I told her she was acting like her dad. Because she was, I don't care if that hurt her feelings. It's the truth. It got so bad to the point my mom had to separate us because I was literally going to fight her.

Our mom and her has some issues that I am not getting into because most of it is because of me. I can let go of things and my sister can't. She can't be the bigger person. I've told her multiple times how she is immature and can never be the bigger person. She pouts.

I am right now applying for internships, getting two jobs \[to pay for college, medical school, etc.\], doing early college and high school. I am worried about telling my sister about my plans because she has mentioned multiple times that she was going to use her friend and I for money when she needs it.  I think the phrase she is looking for is that she is going to be leeching off of us. Using the power she hold over us for the money. Even though my mom and I have more issues than her and my mom. I'll be the one to support my mother for when she is ready for retirement, I am nicer to my mom because she is my mom, no matter what she does she will always be my mom.

Anyways I just needed to get this off my chest because if I didn't I would actually beat up my sister."

In the recommended schedule for iDP SEP, it states that we have to complete our vacation internship attachments during the summer vacations after y1 and y2, before applying to go for SEP in y3s2.

On the other hand, if I want to apply for NOC (y3s2-y4s1), the vacation internship attachments would be done overseas, so there’d be no need to complete them beforehand during the summer vacations.

I’m more keen on the NOC pathway, but I’m worried that if I’m not selected for NOC (especially since it’s very competitive), I won’t be able to go on SEP either since I wouldn’t have completed my vacation internships beforehand.

Is it possible to complete my vacation internships during summer hols beforehand and still go for NOC? Although that’s basically completing double the internship requirements… but this is the only way i could think of that would allow me to still go for SEP if I’m not accepted into NOC.

I’d really appreciate it if there are any seniors who can share about their experiences/advise, thank you!"

w5bk7f,6,2022-07-22,How oversaturated is the entry level?,Antman269,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/w5bk7f/how_oversaturated_is_the_entry_level/,"I have heard that while the mid and high level positions in this field are thriving, it is oversaturated and highly competitive at the entry level. Supposedly too many people going into the field, along with companies not wanting to hire anyone at the junior level due to their low experience. 

However, I have also heard an argument that most of the oversaturation comes from people who put in the bare minimum effort. Many of the applicants barely understand programming, have no passion for it, and think they will easily land a job. Most of them don’t even have a degree, only some bootcamp and self-teaching. So when you cut them out, the competition seems much smaller. 

So for someone who takes things seriously (Getting the proper education, doing internships, etc) would it be worth starting a degree for it today, or is it really as oversaturated and competitive as some say?

How will it look in five years? How does it apply in other countries like Canada?"

Kinda came here to vent because I’m nervous about the potential repercussions. If anyone is familiar with Slack, please read. 

I usually slack with a close friend of mine at work (usually work-related things). It’s never anything unprofessional up until today! 

We discussed salary, not just our own, but other’s at the firm. I also included how the intern was the one who told me what some of the other’s salaries were and how I was unhappy that someone younger than me was making more. I’m usually very cautious about what I write over any company channel but for some reason today I got carried away. Now that I look back, I completely regret the conversation happening over Slack. 

I feel like I messed up pretty bad and now I’m getting anxious. What is the likelihood HR will see these messages? Can I get fired over this?"

In gr 8, I've been focusing mainly on contest math and have been able to get decent results out of the Waterloo contests (Canadian) and like the COMC and Euclid as well. (Unfortunately missed AIME qual by 1 question this year, hopefully next year I think is viable).

However in gr 9, I wanted my major to be computer science so I shifted towards USACO and have been able to pass USACO Bronze and now am in USACO Silver. Aiming for Gold by end of gr 10, so that I have gr 11/12 to aim for USACO Plat.

I want to major in computer science, but would doing math contests be helpful as well? Should I get to a certain point where I can just put ""3 time AIME qual"" and just leave it at that, or work my ass off to try to get to like that CMO (Canadian math Olympiad) level? But I'd rather spend this time working on coding, and getting my stat up to USACO Plat. Which one should I focus on? I don't want to try getting into robotics as well since I do not have time for it, and would rather dedicate my time toward these contests (which I find much more fun).

I've also been tying to build up a theme in my ECs and tryna do just 2\~3 ECs that I can really dedicate my time towards.

Expanding to another local library in September as well, with future plans to expand to all 5 of the local libraries in my community as well as most of the schools in my district teaching wide variety of coding related classes (Python game dev, Arduino, microbit, etc.). Responsible for hiring and managing all instructors, and ensuring smooth quality of classes.
* (Part-Time) STEM Learning Facilitator, assisting and helping elementary students out with STEM ""building"" projects. (E.g. building a marshmallow tower, using scratch to build a game, building your own bridge, etc.). \[9 months time commitment for now\]
* (Freelance) Curriculum developer for that same company, designing their projects. Idk how I could relate this to my college essays, but I was thinking it would help me be more ""creative"" and if I ever wanted to apply as an engineering major I thought that it'd be helpful. What I basically do is to come up with project ideas (building a suspension bridge out of string and paper and cups) and then film videos and write up a document. 
* (School Club) Head of Outreach -&gt; Club Leader now of tutoring club. Helping secondary students in math and other subjects as well. Trying to expand to elementary schools to teach them about STEM and common science subjects and have fun with them
* (Part-Time - Hopefully) Ski Instructor at local ski resort. I live in Vancouver so like the ski hill is like 10 min drive away from my house so I could work like once/twice a week teaching skiing. Currently CSIA Level 2 cert., hoping to become CSIA Course Conductor and teach future instructors as well

My questions:

* I feel like all my ECs are related towards teaching and coding/STEM. Is this a good thing, or should I try expanding to other branches? (E.g. research intern \[very hard to get\], internship in general \[very hard as well\], shadowing?)
* I want to be able to create something unique, and something that like not a lot of people do. I want to help my community some way... Any ideas?
* As a rising gr 10, any advice for me in terms of school/ECs? Really nervous honestly

So I just feel a bunch of imposter syndrome. Then on top of that I feel like I get no support from anyone in my life. They only tell me “you got this don’t worry” and stuff like that when I tell them I feel so overwhelmed or stress etc. it’s like there’s no support unless I’m at the end of the line. Even when it comes to physical help around the house like cleaning or cooking it’s not done unless I’m extremely sick or extremely tired. I think I may have periods of depression but im not too sure how to accurately define it. Or maybe I’m just really stressed or overwhelmed by the whole situation.

I'm an introvert, and I wanted to spend the summer quietly working on my hobbies, studying for an internship, etc, basically just things I can do alone.

The problem is that sometimes I'll talk to people online, and if I meet someone I think is cool and we click, especially someone of the opposite sex, I can't stop thinking about them--it's like I go from being able to focus on myself to being consumed by thoughts of some random person. Then I'll regret trying to socialize at all because I can't seem to control my feelings. It was the same when I was living on campus for school--I ended up catching feelings for someone who only wanted to be FWB, and now has cut off contact completely. I've given up finding love for now since I can't focus on myself if I'm worrying about a relationship. It's just hard for me to find people I'm comfortable with, and once I do it's hard for me to let them go, and all I can think about is not being too clingy and trying to focus on my own life again.

But my two best friends who have been coders for 10 years, and say that 2 years is too long and that I could be already be employed in this time and that degree doesn't even matter which I kinda agree with, but at the same time the internship sounds really tempting and solid way to get real-life experience and enter the field. And frankly I'm not a prodigy and not sure I will ever be able to self-teach myself so well to get employed.

What's your take?"

Looking for a way that doesn't require me to enroll in school.

I am on F1 visa and am currently interning at a tech company for the summer. I got my internship extended till December, but for international students to work, we need to obtain something called CPT (Curricular Practical Training). CPT during Fall or Spring semester requires full-time student status, which means being enrolled in 12 units. And you're limited to 20hr/week of work.

I really don't wanna do part-time work and would like to take a semester off to keep my internship going as a full-time. But then I won't be a full-time student and thus work permit won't be given.

Does anyone here know if there's a way to go about this?"

What happens if this becomes a lifestyle altogether? That's the flow I am in right now.

I'll get right to the issue; I am a 22F and I have no motivation to do anything. I constantly feel anxious about how this is going to f up my life. This is not procrastination but no will to do it at all.

I am a CS major masters student, currently doing my internship at a pretty good company. I honestly believe I got this internship on a stroke of luck but is a huge blessing as it pays well. Even at my university, I just did the bare minimum so that I would pass with a good grade. I spend hours every day on social media and novels and almost nothing on my work.

My mentor at work has been telling me to put more effort from my side and I try to but as soon as I see something too tough I tally it for later. My intern project presentation(not mandatory) is coming and I was so detached to what I worked on that my manager noticed and talked to me asking if something went wrong. I told her everything was fine and my mentor helped me a lot. She just said that I need to put in more effort or the project I had would not look good from the team.

I broke down after the call. There is no way they'd want me as a full time employee after this. I realize this is a huge problem but I can't help myself. I try everyday to fix this and get something done but I end up with such bad anxiety about the future that I don't even touch anything. I even gave up on motivation and tried to discipline myself, nothing is working.

I still have a few more months until the end of my master's and to enter job force. The past one year had been a complete waste and I'm scared I'm disappointing so many people around me, including myself. I've started hating what I loved doing for hours. I don't want to be distracted and filled with anxiety all the time. I really need some help to pick myself up.

Please help me on what to do. I can't talk to anyone since I have no immediate family. I don't mind not getting a full time in my current company but I feel this is going to push me into bigger problem going forth. Anyway to better myself is welcome along with criticism."

Around next year during this time I’ll be in my own apartment enrolled into community college (working of course). I’m stressing over the decision to either take out loans NOW or work full time while being a full time college student. I want to major in computer science to become a software engineer so I know this won’t be easy. I was hoping to save taking out loans for when I transfer to a uni to get my bachelors but idk how it’ll work. I’m hoping to have an internship by this time around next year since I’m already practicing code but if I’m only working part time, I’m not sure it’ll be able to pay my bills and my tuition fees. 

The questions I’m really asking here are, if I take out loans for community college, will I be able to take more out when I transfer to a university? And most importantly, is it possible to start paying off everything once you’re completely done with your degree not once you’re done halfway?

Has anyone taken out loans for community and university only having to pay them once you’ve acquired your degree? Is this even possible? 

I’m sorry if these questions are dumb ones, I just want to start preparing myself mentally if it turns out I’ll be full time in both areas. Thank you in advance!!"

I'm quite interested in CS/working in software and I've been dabbling in it since 10th, although I couldn't really do much in the past 3 years.

I'd taken a  drop year for JEE and messed it up due to a combination of bad decisions, mental health issues, etc, and I'm anxious about the future. I'm not expecting anything from the next Mains and I have half-decent scores in my state CET. I'll most probably be getting **BTech IT in a no-name state university (tier 3/4?)**, they barely have a placement cell and probably only see WITCH recruiters on campus. 

**However I might have the chance to get a core branch (Power (or maybe Printing), ^(I'm somewhat interested in electrical-related topics so not completely terrible)) at Jadavpur in spot rounds. Should I take this option if I can?** Obvious pros include much better on-campus recruiters (most of which are open to all branches), better internship/research oppurtunites, better location etc. The only major con is that I'll have to study CS on the side while keeping my grades up (which I'm willing to put in the effort to do). 

---

---

Also, I've been looking at how to start learning as much as possible and preparing for jobs as soon as I join uni, **I have a rough list of the things that I think should be learning/doing in the next four years but I'd appreciate if anyone could provide any other suggestions/improvements/specific advice** :

- Initially do a course like CS50x  
- Get comfortable in a couple of programming languages at least, initially
- Study important theoretical CS topics, build related projects
- Learn Webdev, do a course like TheOdinProject
- Learn DSA, get into competitive programming
- Try to participate in programs like GSOC, Hackathons, etc
- Build good personal projects
- Maintain a Linkedin? Personal blog?

**Are there any MOOCS/Certifications worth doing that companies actually care about? Or do I simply audit them and learn what I need?**

---

---

**How difficult is it to get decent (off campus) internships if I'm not from a great uni?** Assuming I have decent skills/projects and can pass interviews, do I have a chance at getting internships at the end of 1/2/3rd year in uni? (paid ones preferably lol) 

**What internships plaforms are there? I've seen Angel.co mentioned a couple of times so far so I'll keep that in mind. I've also heard of Internshaala earlier, are they legit?**


**Lastly, is it possible for us 4th tier plebs to get decent non-WITCH, product-based jobs off campus right out of college?** Assuming I've solved Past 14 years Leetcode Question Bank (with topper's solutions) ^/s , have good projects, and maybe an internship or two, what are my chances at 12+ LPA jobs, for example?

I don’t have a frame of reference for how I’m doing at all. I haven’t heard anything negative but the feeling that I’m behind where I should be is eating away at me.I wasn’t able to refactor the code I was handed, the author ended up having to. He said it was because it was old, hard for even him to follow, and had out of date packages where the version wasn’t documented.

Transitioned from 9 years of hospitality industry!
Like many in the world, I was temporarily out of work albeit only for 3 months as I live in a tourist destination. Not knowing when tourism would ""boom"" again, I reached out to the University College I dropped out of 10 years ago and was accepted to continue me AAS degree in Computer Science where I left off. 
I enrolled and calculated it would take about 1.5 years to complete as a part time student, employed full time in hospitality (crazy hours) and the structure of the courses didn't allow me to take as many courses in a semester as I would have liked. That did not deter me from pursuing a dream I've had since I was a kid. 
Fast track a few months, my wife and I are expecting a little girl! So part time student, full time job and pregnant wife, we got this! 
Fast track a year, I'm now towards the end of my AAS degree and need 2 internships to complete it. The first person I reached out to for an internship took me in right away (networking with people that came to the bar helped loads). 
I negotiated a paid internship but no dice, so I accepted the unpaid internship in exchange for being taught as much as possible and guess what? 
I exceeded everyone's expectations, especially because I had to travel abroad for a family emergency and still connected to meetings and troubleshoot issues for clients/customers. 
So part time student (1 course left), part time internship, full time job and father of a beautiful healthy baby girl. (Parents will totally understand, LOL) 

Landed a full time contract as a support engineer!!! 
Did 1 month of full time IT and full time hospitality (late hours) to realize I had to pull back from hospitality to focus my energy on IT. 
The company has requested I get the A+, Net+ and a couple MS certs for a pay bump within the year that would land me between the US 50k-60k bracket! 
I'll also receive my AAS diploma next month! 

My goals are to get comfortable with networking, cloud services (it's a cloud focused company) and eventually hit Cyber Security! 

Looking for feedback on how I tackled all this and guidance as to next steps! 
The company pays for the certs in full as long as its within their field. 



 That said, yes, I was back at work in 3 months but didn't see tourist for about 2 years, so the tips were dismal but was able to network with the local community!(no one knew when the tourists would come back) 

So stoked!!!"

I am a student in cyber security (not really focused on the red team side) and in my last year, I have to complete a graduate internship.

So I got an internship offer from a company. The company doesn't have a detailed description of the internship. And expect that I take some initiative in this regard.

The central question of the internship is:

&gt;*""How do you test the resilience of a company X to a ransomware attack?”.*

They asked me to come up with a first draw on how I am planning to do this. This is of course a nice opportunity to learn. But, I find to have a hard time starting on this, part is due to my limited knowledge in pen testing (that's why I want to take this offer to become better at it)

I also posted this to a different subreddit. And got some good tips (testing their backup, network segmentation, endpoint protection) 

I would also like to have some input/tips from your guys in this subreddit. I really appreciate it."

w65e7e,2,2022-07-23,Where am I going,Vortexman746,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/w65e7e/where_am_i_going/,"Sorry for the long post, this has been brewing for a while and I'm not positive how to communicate what I'm feeling. TL;DR: second paragraph

Could really use some perspective here. Beyond burnt out with school, starting my 6th year of my undergrad, just can't seem to get over the finish line and get my CS degree. There are many reasons why I'm struggling including mental health challenges. One major factor for my lack of drive recently, though, is I have no idea what comes after school. I don't even know what I want to do. This adds another layer of difficulty as I don't feel I'm working *towards* anything and therefor feel unincentivized to work.

What do you do for a career? Do you enjoy it? More than just being good at your job or liking the pay, are you excited to go to work? How many jobs did it take you to find one that is a good fit? How do you gain exposure to unique work experiences if the University CS track is primarily focused on Software Dev and you aren't the type who's motivated to go learn a new tech stack in your free time? Do you struggle with being a programmer who doesn't also live and breathe code or have the desire or energy to take up side/passion projects? 

I definitely know that I have underlying issues at play. I've been managing depression to various degrees of success since middle school, and am exploring the possibility with my psychiatrist that I may have ADHD inattentive-type. Because of this, I really don't have things in life I ""enjoy"", certainly nothing out of which I feel confident I want to make a career. Would love to hear your thoughts. 

Regarding the notion of ""you don't really need to love your work, you just need to make time for other things you enjoy.""

This may be true, and I'm open to this feedback if other people feel this way. In my experience, if I don't like what I'm doing, it is infinitely harder to do. This applies across the board, from chores that would take &lt;10 minutes to complete or a final project for a class. I know there are many people who can tolerate tedious work and can coast on auto-pilot and just get shit done as necessary, I don't know if I can do that. 

My only CS work experience so far was a summer internship doing Angular full stack development (WFH). It was fine and I learned a fair amount, but I could feel myself rapidly losing interest after a few months once the novelty wore off. I began the summer with a great work ethic. I always finished my work on time (usually ahead of schedule), pushed myself to produce high quality work and learn from the other developers so I could implement better practices into my code. This devolved into dreading logging on for work, putting in minimal effort to appear online but struggling to squeeze 30 minutes of actual productivity into my 8 hour day. I was very fortunate that this occurred very shortly before the end of the internship. I know this is anecdotal and I'm not generalizing to say that this is how every work experience would go for me, I just dread the possibility of struggling to hold down a job because I can't maintain interest."

w67b37,1,2022-07-23,Please advise,funkmasta8,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/w67b37/please_advise/,"Hello, everyone. I would really like to work in programming, but I am having a hard time finding anything that I qualify for. I have a bachelors and masters in stem, but not in CS. Throughout both degrees, I took classes and/or learned different languages. I’m best with python, but I have also done some C#, C+, SQL, and a bunch of other languages that I’ve used a couple times. 

All the “entry-level” jobs and internships I find require on average a total of 12+ years of experience usually spread between several languages as well as degrees specifically in CS. At a minimum, I am seeing 3 years of experience in each language as the requirement.

When I ask for advice, I get the same responses almost every time. Things like “fix up your resume”, “apply anyway”, “x language is really popular so you should learn it”, “build a portfolio”. Nothing seems to be working and all the different advise just pulls me in completely different directions with seemingly no effect on getting a job or even an interview. I have tested into so many CS job sites with no luck on getting a job. Clearly, my skills in select languages are enough for the job sites, but without professional experience or a related degree I’m not considered good enough I guess.

Does anyone have a pretty straightforward way of getting a job or even an internship in a job with programming, preferably one that aligns with my current knowledge?"

w69nqo,1,2022-07-23,Should I switch my part time job?,dota2nub,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/w69nqo/should_i_switch_my_part_time_job/,"I started my CS degree at a local trade school a year ago and successfully made it through my first year. Before that it was required I do a 9 month internship so I could enter the school and the place I interned at kept me on part time throughout last year. Soon I will have worked there for two years, studying part time. It will take me 4 years total to get my CS bachelor's.

The thing is, the place I work at does Cobol, version control is a guy that looks at the source folder and checks changed by dates, and everyone at the company is already retired. I see no big future here and don't think I learn much useful tech here except maybe the C# and Powershell I started using for internal stuff.

I have a job interview soon at a place where I'll be responsible for a Java app that is much simpler than my present millions of lines of Cobol monstrosity I can still barely make sense of. They also don't have unit tests, but at least they use Git. Do you think switching jobs after two years will look bad on my resume?"

w6fawg,1,2022-07-23,I feel stuck. I resent my step dad.,Blackanese77,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/w6fawg/i_feel_stuck_i_resent_my_step_dad/,"I (23M) feel stuck. I resent my step dad, a little bit of my mom, and also have a lot of blame for myself as well. (WARNING, LONG)

To begin, my parents are are divorced and my mom remarried when was around 4 or 5 to me current step dad, and they had a child together (my sister 8 years younger and I have a great relationship with). My mom has had full custody so I have always lived with her (my bio dad has gotten in trouble with the law and was abusive to my mom). As I was growing up, my mom has always told me how she was mentally, emotionally, physically, and verbally abused by her my grandma. When wee started living with my step dad, Honestly I don't remember too much of my childhood, but I always remember the feeling of hatred towards him. He would explode and get angry over every little thing, gaslight, manipulate, beat me (when I was younger), verbally abuse me, harass me, micromanage, control me, and would would not let me express how I am feeling. There has been countless amount of times where I would be upset because he is screaming and hitting me for no reason, and when I would try to fight back, he would get even more angry. then (and now) he would wake me up in the middle of the night because I forgot to put a plate or chopstick in the dishwasher). On top of that he talks to himself and would say negative things like a crazy person. And when I would get pissed about that and say something, he would explode and I would not hear the end of it,. Even when I agree to try to end it and say I will do something, he would repeat and repeat and repeat wand goes on for so long. My parents have gotten in countless fights due to this as well, but nothing comes of it since he is not self reflective at all and has some sort of sick/twisted god complex mindset. I felt like I was never allowed to show my emotions and had to push it down. My mother I believe is a somewhat emotionally unstable as well, as she would hit me, scream and say hurtful things whenever she was upset, but when she was in a good mood she would pretend that those things never happened. I was always pressured into studying, which i did to a certain extent but as they added more and more pressure, I pushed back and it made me not want to do it more and more, especially when they would get angry/ get physical/ say hurtful things, and would not give me the time of day to listen or understand. Once I got into high school, and hanging out outside of my house more, the more and more I realized how abnormal my home life was. Of course not every family is perfect, but the relationship and respect my friends parents would give their kids n(as well to me) was mind blowing. I started staying out late cuz I didn't want to be home, which of course they would yell at me about but I did not care. I didn't want to be at home. As my sister was growing up, I noticed they would treat her a little better, but none the less would still be emotionally immature and would do fucked up shit.

Once I left for college I felt a sense of relief. I felt like I can be myself and honestly was one of the happiest (but also stressful in other ways) i have been in my life. Of course there were a lot of things that brought my down (specifically academic stress) but I felt like I was doing well for myself and had high hopes. I was still drinking a-lot on the weekends and would dabble in drugs; I was having a lot of sex though with random strangers. Then comes covid, and I was forced to come back because of school dorms kicked everyone out. That was when things started going downhill again. I was forced to be at home because of the lockdown, and i would always stay in my room. I did not want to interact with anybody, Aside from my mom when she is in a bad moon, I would AVOID my dad like the plague and he still makes his way to me and finds something to micromanage and yell at me about. Constantly, every day. I tried reasoning with him many times. When I am calm and passive he get upset. They when I break and get upset he yells. Nothing gets him to leave me along, no matter what reaction, nothing gets resolved and he escalates him.but gave up cuz he gets mad and nothing changes i match his energy and am rude back to him. He gives me no privacy with anything, when i lock my door, he gets the key and yells at me. When I tell him to leave me alone because i don/t want to talk to him he tells at me. I forget to make my bed he yells at me. I go back upstairs but didn't push in my chair he yells at me. I felt like I was going crazy. Once the restrictions started lightening up,I would always be out, or stay at home, rarely leaving my room. I would get drunk or high everyday, and would still have casual sex very often. I would skip dinners because I don't want to be near him. I realized as I got into my adult years he has NO friends at all. The only person that tolerates him is my mom and sometimes my sister. That was when my drinking problem got worse. I did not know how to handle anything with my family (minus my sister). I felt miserable and and alone and did not know how to manage my mental health or what I was feeling. I would drink almost everyday, would do molly, coke, anything that would help my escape. I blew all my unemployment money. I was at ground zero. I had no impulse (and still don't). I graduated online and had a min wage job, and my plan was ti chill a little bit until I landed my first big job or internship. I wanted to take my time especially since I just got out of school ( I was still applying to jobs). Yet I would constantly be pressed about ""why don't you have a real job yet? When I was your age\_\_\_\_. etc.) TBH I didn't even want to go to school in the first place, I wanted to pursue the arts but I was not allowed to because ""It wasn't a real job"". After 3 months I landed my first internship and held onto that for about 5 months, which I was also micro managed and bullied by my 30 something year old co workers. I got fired because I would always leave to the bathroom and would hide in there because I wanted to get away with them. On top of that the my manager at the time would push all her work onto me (I was managing 80 social media accounts) while she would sit on her phone and gossip with other co workers). SOrry I feel like I am complaining a lot, it was still good experience i guess idk. I worked as a server after that since I did not want to go back to a cooperate environment after that experience and my dad would still give me shit about ""Are you going to be doing this your whole life? Why are you staying out late with your friends you aren't in college anymore (which again he has been saying that even when I was in college so makes no sense, like I got my degree and passed all my classes). Anyways fast forward to now. I am working a entry level job at a credit card processor (not making a lot of money but definitely more that what I was getting paid before, while rehearsing for my 2 dance teams and trying to balance my social life. I am sure you have noticed by now I am bad with my money and have bad impulse. And I have wanted to start my life over and get a clean start. So once I got this job I was excited. I was going to be able to pay off my debt and save up to leave this house. My dad convinced my mom to have me pay rent (which I did not mind at first) but then he doubled it once the first payment day came in and I was furious. 1) because it was again, double what we originally agreed on, but also because it was half of what I made in a month. I tried negotiating but he was set in his ways and would not meet me half way. SO then like I have been doing (which I understand is immature and also unhealthy) I would spend all my money on alcohol and drugs. Mainly alcohol and then food as well because I did not want to be at or be near home). I still pay it now (it has been about 5 months), and I do my best to do everything he tells my to do so I don't have to interact with him but he always finds something to yell at me about and we constantly argue. I tried therapy too but had to quit because of my 8-5 work schedule and dance rehearsals after work (work schedule mainly cuz therapy places that I have tried closed at 5). Tried meeting up with a psychologist cuz I suspected I have ADHD too based on my work which with things I had no interested in but had to stop due to work schedule.

I feel like I am the asshole, but I cannot stop the way I feel towards him. He has always belittled and made me feel like crap. Even when he is semi calm, I can't help but be rude to him because of what he has been making me feel as I was growing up, and to this day as well.  Everyttime he talks to gets near me i get triggered. I don't know what to do. My younger sister is very mature for her age and comes to me with her problems and we talk about it. Wer'e both see the emotional immaturity of our parents mostly my step dad. I need to leave but I a stuck in a loop with my own actions and him.I feel guilty cuz I don't feel this way towards anyone but him. He brings out the worst in me. I hate the person I am when we interact. Now that my mom and sister have been visiting Japan for 2 months it has just been the 2 of us and it's getting worse. Idk what to do. I told my mom about this and she says she understands. Which I don't know how to feel. idk I feel like I am going crazy and more and more things are coming loose in my head. I feel trapped. I want to get better and fix myself yet I always end up coping with substances. I don't know what to do. Sorry for the rant guys. Thank you for reading. I just feel so lost. I am not suicidal btw so please do not be afraid of that i guess. Idk. fuck. Basically I am don't being treated like this and am holding my ground, but I am still setting myself back with my own actions. AITA?"
w6ffxn,1,2022-07-23,My (30f) supervisor/friend (33f) is convinced I am flirting with our boss to steal her job,chellsbellsxxoo,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/w6ffxn/my_30f_supervisorfriend_33f_is_convinced_i_am/,"My (30f) friend/old supervisor (33f) and I were having lunch yesterday and discussing our boss. I did an unpaid internship with her for my school program and our boss took interest in me and wanted to hire me. The budget wouldn’t allow it and so I didn’t get the job. After my internship, my boss invited me out to a networking event to try and get me a job. We ended up staying out pretty late and both got pretty drunk. He was being flirtatious, told me I was pretty, but I really didn’t respond. I’m engaged and I knew his behavior was not appropriate. He then told me that he would like to hire me as his assistant, and because I really needed a job, I agreed. 

Fast forward, the assistant job never happened but my boss assured me that he would help me find something. He made it clear that he would like to have me take my supervisors position one day. I made it clear that I didn’t want her to be fired for me to take it, because she’s my friend and I knew she would never talk to me again. So since then, he’s been trying to help me find a job within the same company, but not at his building. 

Now fast forward to yesterday. My friend/supervisor and I are having lunch. She told me that she is planning on quitting soon and said “obviously they will call you to hire you.” I told her that I do want to work there because I know the boss is chill, but that my fiancé is not comfortable with me working for him, and that I don’t need that drama in my life. We were talking about how strange it was that he was trying so hard to get me hired, and my friend pointed out that he flirts with me a lot. I blurted out “I have flirted with him too. Well, I guess I just flirt with everyone, or that’s what they think. When I’m being nice to someone, they think I’m flirting with them.” Her mood instantly changed. I was driving her back to work and she was getting pretty heated and saying “if he wants you so bad, he can have you. I’m tired of being treated like this.” She then later texted me saying that she can’t believe I “admitted to having a flirtatious relationship with him” and  “our friendship is void and over, lose my number and stop texting me.” I brought up the fact that she herself was in a relationship and that she was being flirty with the maintenance guy. She went as far as to tell me that she would sometimes look at his bulge. She also told me that she found our boss attractive but she could never be with him because he’s a vegan. I reminded her that I have never hit on our boss or flirted with him, but that I can see how it can be perceived like that from him. 

Basically, she accused me of flirting with him to take her job. Which is not true. I did stay friendly with him in hopes that he would hire me for a different position, or hire me when she left. I am completely dumbfounded. I tried to explain to her that that’s not the truth at all, and she ended up blocking me. 

I have a job interview this week. She put in a good word for me before this huge blow up. And she is one of my references. I am worried that she is going to sabotage that now for me. I am also worried that she is going to go to our boss and tell him everything that I told her. He had told me that he didn’t like a few of the employees (inappropriate on his part) and I shared that information with her yesterday in confidence and with the idea that she’s leaving soon anyways. I am so sick over this. I can’t sleep, can’t eat. Her bf tried to reach out to my fiancé on FB, I’m assuming to tell him that “I’m having a flirtatious relationship with my old boss.” Thankfully, my fiancé just deleted the message and didn’t respond. I know I need to tell him what’s going on, but I am worried it will cause conflict in our relationship like it has in the past. I told my fiancé everything about my boss and we both agreed that the relationship is not appropriate and that he was hitting on me. I think my supervisor is upset that our boss was giving me attention and trying to get me a job, to then one day take her job. She feels threatened and like he just wants to fire her and hire me. 

I have tried explaining everything to her. I have apologized. I have brought up logic. She still just has me blocked. Now I don’t know what this next week looks like for me. Is she gonna blow up and tell our boss everything? Is she gonna play it cool and just finish out her last few weeks? Is she still going to keep trying to reach out to my fiancé? I feel like she is trying to ruin my life, even though I have done nothing to her. I confided in her and she betrayed me. How do I get over this? Am I the bad guy? 

TL/DR: My supervisor blew up on me and blocked me because she thinks I am trying to take her job by flirting with our boss. She also tried to reach out to my fiancé to tell him about my “relationship” with our boss. I think she is taking things way too extreme and is being overly paranoid. I do not want to work for my boss because I don’t need the drama or gossip that he and I are a thing, when we aren’t."
w6g30y,1,2022-07-23,Quick experience and hackathons?,shweshishweh,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/w6g30y/quick_experience_and_hackathons/,"I’m a fifth year senior studying computer science - my last semester will be this fall.

I’ve been applying to fall internships when I can but not much luck.  My advisors pointed me to Forage and micro internships in the meantime.  But I’d like to do more.

Any tips about that, along with anything else I could do with my last semester of college would be appreciated. Thank you."
w6hw2x,6,2022-07-23,Used work laptop for personal use. Am I screwed?,upperfex,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/w6hw2x/used_work_laptop_for_personal_use_am_i_screwed/,"I have been working as an intern at the UN for a couple months and I've been using my work laptop all the time at home. The main reason was that my personal laptop is terrible and old but I have no money to buy a new one. My work laptop is way faster and just better. My own laptop has even trouble connecting to the internet for some reason.

That said I started questioning if that was appropriate, so I googled it and it seems like something you should never do. I kinda panicked and deleted all my browser history; obviously I never ever did anything nasty like porn and also never installed any software which I couldn't do anyway - but there was a lot of reddit, YouTube and casual browsing.

How likely is it that some IT people will see that and I will face negative consequences?"
w6j9nf,5,2022-07-23,Opinions on What to do About Toxic Work Environment - Should I Quit or Stay?,kinganthvny,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/w6j9nf/opinions_on_what_to_do_about_toxic_work/,"I’m currently on the fence about quitting my job and I’m looking for opinions on what you think would be the smartest move. Some background information, I’m 22M, work in Human Resources, and have been working in HR throughout my entire college experience full time, which amounts to about 4 years of experience.

I started working at this company about 3 months ago. I left my previous position since I just obtained my bachelors degree and wanted to utilize it. I was offered this position making 8 dollars more an hour than I was. There have been red flags from the start, but here we go. I was informed in the interview process I would be a full time employee with benefits, etc. On the day I’m offered the position, I’m told it had to be a 3 month contract which will convert to full time in July. I don’t need the benefits so ultimately I said okay to this and accepted the position. I let them know I had a vacation planned about 4 weeks away and they were fine with it.

I started working there, the distance being about an hour from my house. On my signed offer letter, It states that I would work 8a-4p.  was told that I had to work 8:30a-5p. No big deal, but the traffic getting to and from is horrible and giving me over an hour commute. I ask if there was any flexibility of me being able to do the 8a-4p that was outlined in my offer letter, but was told no.

I brushed that off, then we hired an intern. Everything is good for about 2 weeks, until it’s time right before my vacation. I go on vacation and when I return, Im told that they want to know if Im serious about this position and that I’ve been slacking and Im not putting in effort. The woman I work with has an attitude all the time, puts her finger in my face when asking a question, refuses to give help when asked, says she’s too busy to assist, the whole nine yards. I enjoy the money, so when Im told this, I just oblige and say that I will work harder and I apologize if I came across not wanting to be here right before I was getting ready to go on a vacation. For about 3 weeks, I worked so hard, putting in extra hours, making my work was completed and correct, and was told Im doing fine. This past week, I called out on Monday due to my acid reflux flaring up overnight. When I return the next day, I’m told that I’ve been not doing work and that I really need to consider if I want to be there.

At this point, I was fed up because Ive been working tirelessly for weeks and this was just thrown in my face again. I said I wasn’t feeling well and was out sick the rest of the week, even though I wasn’t. I found out the next day that the same woman was going through my personal file and reading through my documents and telling the intern that she thinks I’m lying about my experience. I took this time to reflect and I’m genuinely considering not returning on Monday at this point. My mental health here has been causing my acid reflux to flare up, and my anxiety has been getting worse the longer I’m there. This week at home I’ve had no medical issues and I’ve felt so relieved knowing I haven’t had to go back. I’m trying to decide if it’s really smart to just quit and leave, or try to force myself back into this situation just to provide for myself. I have enough o pay my bills for the next month, and I’m debating on just quitting and really hoping I find a new position within the next few weeks.

EDIT: I’ve been searching for new positions, but haven’t had much luck because I’m unable to attend interviews due to work. They won’t allow me to leave early, come in late, take any days off, or step out of the office without them knowing what for and how long I’ll be out. I’ve even been reprimanded for using the bathroom for more than 10 minutes. It’s a very small old house that was turned into an office so there’s not much wiggle room."

At the moment, I’m a DevOps engineer intern. I’m unsure if I’m able to staying or not (need to ask soon about it). So, I’m planning ahead. So, I graduated college early this year with a CompSci/IT degree. I don’t have a lot of work experience nor IT experience. I’ve only done a couple of projects from school and know a pretty handful of IT tools, but not very proficient in all of them. My reason to create this post is to ask this question: can I apply for junior DevOps engineer position when I only have one internship experience? or should I start with IT help desk and work my way up there? I’m planning to get an AWS certification sometime soon to get more job offers. But, I’m stuck of what to specifically look for when I’m finished with this internship. I can’t decided whether to find a full time job or still look for internship for my lack of experience. Thank you! Sorry for the grammar btw.. had to post this at the moment"

I am currently 23 years old, I graduated from university one year ago. I have a bachelor of arts and sciences, with a major in history and Journalism.

I worked while I was in university for a local TV stations, as my last year came I began to find that I had no drive to go into journalism or history. 

I loved my history degree don’t get me wrong, but I found that my passion was business, and dealing with stocks.

My final thesis in history was on economic bubbles and not only did I enjoy every second of researching it, I found that I was actually the first person at my 40,000 person university to take out some of the books, ever!

I loved reading about it. Since graduating I’ve been working at a law firm as a administrative assistant. Although I love learning and arguing the law/reading contracts.I have found that I would like to take the path of corporate law, which would need a backing in some form of business to support my application for the program.

My parents, extended family, past teachers, and girlfriend have all said that it is clear to them that I would excel in the field. I just feel so anxious when I hear the speak about me and say stuff like that. I don’t want to fail them. I don’t want prove them wrong. The more I’ve thought, the more I realize my mind revolves around business 24/7, all I do in my spare time is look at stocks, read quarterly reports, and evaluate the cash flow of businesses in my area/vacancy of malls.

My options are as follows:

I have an unpaid internship in Hong Kong that was postponed because of covid, that I could do anytime after October. It would last 4 weeks. This could be extended past that to 2/3/4/5/6 months, for a price.

I could go back to university and do a business degree. Which would only take 2 years.

I could also do a masters degree in business althought it would cost 140,000+, where as the bachelors would only cost 40% of that as I can transfer credits. I could even lower the cost with scholarships!

I’ve applied to jobs in the field of business, yet my feeling is unless you have a degree orare currently pursuing one, you are unable to really break in the field.

My question to you guys, is what should I do? Do you have any suggestions?"
w6lfx1,3,2022-07-23,i feel myself pushing my friends away and i don’t care,yeetocheetoi,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/w6lfx1/i_feel_myself_pushing_my_friends_away_and_i_dont/,"so i decided to stupidly date in my friend group. we broke up and now she basically tells my friends. 

“it’s me or him”

for parties and such, if i show up she’ll leave. and since most of them like her better, i don’t get invited to stuff anymore. 

the real fucked up part was this. 

i was chilling one day, and a couple of my friends came up to me asking me if i’m going to this big party they’re having. (they’re not in the friend group they were just invited) i told them i didn’t know of any party. 

a couple days later my friend who’s in the friend group texts me asking if i wanted to come to the party, which was in like 2 hours. i tell him yeah. i start going to the party, which is like 45 minutes away for me. i get halfway there and they call me and tell me not to come because my ex is making a big deal of it. 

i haven’t rly talked to any of them since. even at events where my ex isn’t there they don’t rly invite me. 

i’m doing an internship rn so i don’t have much time during the week, so during my summer, i have been with my friends or other people once. in the past 8 weeks. i just never made an effort to be with anyone cause i didn’t want to. but of course it would’ve been nice to. 

now i’m a part of this one friend group that’s based in canada, which is kinda far from me cause i’m in the states. but they’re nice people. but for some reason i almost never want to talk to any of them. even though i rly do like them. 

i also was talking to this one girl, she was nice to me, and opened up a lil, so i did too. yeah she screenshotted everything i said and sent it to her friends. also in the group chat that I AM PART OF. 

so i’m pushing them away cause i trust none of them. 

i realized that i only trust 3 people rn. which is sad to me. im supposed to be the extroverted one. 

also i have a presentation for my work in a week that i am terrified for, and i feel extremely underprepared. 

fuck i hate being the nice person cause it always feels like nobody actually gives a fuck about us. 

sorry for all of this just needed to say it."

w6m3q5,333,2022-07-23,Intern / New Hire Advice: Have basic social awareness and respect,beagle765,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/w6m3q5/intern_new_hire_advice_have_basic_social/,"
Im 25, and was the first in my family to graduate from college. Corporate america/finance was tough to navigate and I think theres a lot of unspoken rules that come with the culture. My younger brother is interning this summer and I put together a list of advice I shared with him. Some of this may be harsh but this is basically a list of everything Ive seen interns do wrong / wish I knew:

1. If you hate your internship, never make it be known. Be respectful, network on the side and be grateful for the opportunity to learn. If you’re at a large firm, take advantage. Get the offer at the end of the summer and you can decline (no decent person will hold this against you) -but people will be mad at the privileged kid who took their opportunity for granted all summer. Be very careful who you disclose your disinterest in your current role to - HR will often lie and claim there is room for mobility but this can get political and is difficult to navigate correctly

2. Unless you have set hours because your group doesn’t pay out overtime, never be the last one in or the first to leave

3. Always ask if theres something you can help with if you leave before your team does

4. Dont ask anyone about salary unless you have an offer in hand and are talking to HR. Go on glassdoor if you’re that curious

5.Be careful with how you engage with your group. People may have banter and dig at each other but they’ve been working together for 10 years - you’re not in a position to make those same jokes  

6.Watch how the team works and follow suit. If everyone eats lunch at their desk, you shouldn’t be taking an hour lunch as a new joiner

7.Never complain about manual work or think you’re above something youve been assigned. If youre above it, make it better.

8.Do not take days off as an intern. Youre here for 10 weeks

9.Do not get cocky. Youd be surprised how many execs are actually really low key and frugal. Flexing as a new hire or talking about your lavish lifestyle/family money will often be frowned upon

10. Dont sit on your phone especially in front of someone senior

11. Dont be an a** to anyone. You are not better than anyone regardless of your role. Assistants, janitors, cafeteria staff, support staff - these people do a lot for the firm and have great relationships with many execs

12. If you find yourself with free time, IM people on the team asking if they have any busy work you can help with. Chasing a team on a deliverable, an annoying manual step to a project, etc. 

13. Google everything before you ask someone a question. Investopedia, excel help, etc 

14. If you cant meet a deadline, flag this as soon as you realize you wont be able to so others can help out

Edit: I agree some of this is toxic/outdated but many older generations have an old school mindset (these are the folks making hiring decisions). IMO, if youre an intern and want an offer always play it safe. If you want to start breaking old school workplace culture, thats great, but you can risk your FT offer in the process 


Hope this helps :)"

I am 20, in sophomore studying computer science in a good school( state school; but not in elite/ivy league) I could have got better grades and ended in up some ivy league, but I just gave in my average work. When I look at my friends and peers, they have achieved so much; someone's working on making their own project, learning multiple languages, some coding since they were 13, proficient in C,C++/Java, learning web development, etc. While I just wasted my time, I really don't know anything other than what is taught in school which is Object Oriented Programming, Java, C++; that's it. It's not that I don't like Coding; or my parents forced upon me. I did argue with my parents as they wanted me to pursue medicine, and I wanted computer science. It just feels bad that after fighting for what I want, I kind of feel average in what I am doing

Feel like average; my peers my friends are learning something new, going to hackathons, making their own startup, applying for internships, interning in multiple companies. I will apply for internships in Summer 2023, however with so less knowledge I don't know where and what to write in my resume. And by September, it's hard to learn and be proficient in new language. When I look here; in this sub or r/cscareerquestions ; I get little anxious as people are interning, learning so much, while I haven't done anything so far. I am just looking for help, or advice about what should I learn to improve in this CS Career."

I have never taken an accounting class in my life. The internship ran from Jan to April, and I received an offer at the end of it.  During the internship I decided it was not for me because the work-life balance seemed abysmal but so many of my family members, friends, etc kept telling me it's such a great thing to have on your resume that I accepted at the last minute.  I took two months off to travel and have a break and started in June.  

One month in and I already hate it.  We are expected to have 60-70 billable hours per week during busy season, which I knew but did not realize we are having another busy season from essentially now until November.  It feels like we are in ""busy season"" almost the entire year.  I also coach a high school team after work, and one of my bosses has already given me a hard time for taking 3 days off last week for a tournament for my coaching because I didn't give him enough warning--he was on paternity leave until the week before I left and yelled at me because I didn't give him more warning when he was actually unreachable until then.  Our hours are constantly being looked at through a microscope and compared to each other, we are about to have mandatory weekend work days, and the stress is already starting to eat me alive. I also am constantly lost, as I have no accounting background, and with so many employees choosing to work remote asking for help is extremely difficult.  I've been told no because people are too busy on multiple occasions, and sometimes when people help me I feel like they are quizzing me on things I ""should"" know, or they are visibly frustrated that I don't understand. I feel like I have no time to sleep, eat, work out, or even breathe, and I want out.  

My question is....can I leave now? Can I look for other jobs in another industry now? Do I leave the internship on my resume but leave off the month I've had in this job as an associate? Or do I try to stick it out until either January (when I started at the company as an intern) or next June (when I began as an associate). I feel like I'm drowning under the pressure and have no clue how I could even make it to January."

w6ut09,71,2022-07-24,What is it like attending a lower ranking (&gt;25) program?,Texas_Rockets,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/w6ut09/what_is_it_like_attending_a_lower_ranking_25/,"This sub has a tendency to view programs that aren’t higher ranking as professional hellscapes that have no intrinsic value, so what it's like to attend these programs isn't something that's often discussed. Would love to get the POV of others as well, but since I most certainly fit this bill I’ll start. And while I've got the podium, I do want to note that I absolutely think ranking matters. The entire ranking methodology is intended to capture outcomes like comp and alum network quality, so this is not a post that seeks to undermine the validity of rankings. And I don't buy the occasional view I see expressed here that ranking only matters if you're a douche. If you got into a top program that's something you should be proud of and will really jumpstart your career in a way that's possible, not but as easy, at lower ranking programs. 

My program is &gt;#50. And I do 100% regret going here, as it’s abundantly clear to me that higher ranking programs offer massive benefits in terms of the alum network and recruiting. But, characteristics of my program, with the good first 

The good 
- End of the day, most people don’t have MBAs, so this is still a huge leg up in the job market. 

- While you can't lean on brand power to land a solid job at a program like mine, brand just gets you an interview. You still have to be competent to get a job and the rest of your resume is still a big factor in your candidate profile. It's just not as easy to land the interview. 

- Continuing the idea that it's about ability more than anything, I don't want to speculate on whether I will get an offer at my current internship or say that it would be a specific number, but based on convos with my boss and in-house comp data I've seen, I would be in line to earn 135-165k if I got an offer. This idea that you're just doomed to earn shit pay at a lower-tier program just isn't valid.

- I've still learned a ton of skills, and I'd bet in terms of knowledge it's about 90-95% what you learn at HSW. I'm a career transitioner and did not work in business prior, so this program has done a TON to teach me the skills I needed to make this transition.  

- Really, a low-ranking school only matters in landing your first post-MBA job. After that I’ve heard it’s really just about how well you have done in your job and people don’t care all that much where you went. Though I think it does bear mentioning that the first job has a lot of power in setting the trajectory of your career, which matters a lot if you want to get into finance or top 4 consulting. 

The bad 
- Lower quality candidates. Only a few are what I would consider to be exceptional. Though I do want to note that I don't get the sense that most people in my program go here because they got rejected at the M7 programs. They are either pursuing dual degrees (with the other degree being something the school is known for), they just didn't/don't give a shit about ranking, they weren’t aware of the importance of ranking (which is probably a bigger one), or they just live in the area and wanted to get an MBA without having to move. I think maybe one guy in my program applied to some top-tier programs, but he doesn't seem to have done a full-court press. 

- Mid professors. I have learned a ton, and it’s not like my professors are terrible, but I have only been impressed with a few. 

- Less than stellar alum network. My program graduates smaller cohorts and while a few have gone on to have incredible success, on the whole I wouldn’t describe reaching out to alums as a way to get top-tier internships or FT offers.

- No one gives a shit that I go to my school. I think many at top-tier programs may be used to telling people they are getting an MBA, people being impressed, and then when they tell them where they’re getting it people being even more impressed. The latter does not occur if you go to a lower-ranking MBA program. 

- Recruiting. It's not that my program is a liability, but it also isn't an advantage. Companies do not give a shit about my school. They care that I have an MBA, but my school doesn’t have recruiting pipelines that I’ve heard exist at the better schools. You just sorta apply to internships online and then you network to the best of your abilities on your own. That's how I got my internship. Some companies will reach out to my school and post stuff on handshake or occasionally I will see an email that’s roughly ‘we have an alum that’s looking to hire people here, let me know if you’re interested and I’ll set up an informational interview.’ But they’re all at random companies that I don’t really get the sense you need to have an edge to get into. And forget MBB. If you want to work at Deloitte, that’s something you’ve gotta work up to post-grad. I was being interviewed by someone who got their MBA at HSW, and they noted that their program had sort of a waiting period where companies weren't allowed to give offers until after a certain point to ensure all the candidates had chances to interview and they were asking if there was anything like that at my program; like their program was so desirable that they had that much leverage. I don't remember if I said or thought it, but my general response was ""I cannot possibly describe to you the degree to which that is not the case at my program.""

- Comp. On average my school's comp is definitely on the lower end (TC I think is 100-115), but I've seen that the more solid candidates aren't really constrained by that. My school's stats are also limited by the fact that people disproportionately go here to work in non-profits or the government. 

Job stats
Applications: 75
Interviews: 10%
No response: 44%
Rejections: 45%
Offers on interviews: 20%
I also declined 3 interviews after accepting my current position. 

Also want to note that I was still able to land some pretty solid interviews."

I'm looking for PhD vacancies in Computer Science, specifically affective computing and computer vision. As a non-American is there a portal/website where I can see such openings in the US &amp; Canada? LinkedIn, for example, is bloated with industrial internships so it's kinda hard to filter them out."
w6y9ih,0,2022-07-24,GIC Investment,Significant-Low-8026,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/w6y9ih/gic_investment/,"Hey, I have $30,000 in student loans from OSAP with an interest of 2.75-3%. I’m starting 4th year and I don’t have to pay it back for a little over 1.5 years.

GIC rates are at 4.25-4.5%. Although I took the student loans, I never used it because of internship money. But instead of giving it back, would it make more sense to throw it into a 2 year GIC since the loans rate is so low?

The 5 year GIC option is 5%, but I don’t want it locked up for that long. Also, why are the rates so high? I remember when they used to be like 2%, so I never bothered with the hassle of locking up my money. I know interest rates are going up, but how does that correlate to GIC rates? Will GIC rates continue to go up (ie. should I wait a month or 2?).

I also have $10,000 in a tfsa investment account, but I’m concerned about the market right now, so want a more safe option for the 30K. I’m 21 and my parents don’t know about investment/don’t like the hassle, so I’m kinda on my own for this decision. Any advice would be appreciated. I booked a meeting with a banks investment advisor in 3 weeks to see what they have to say.

w6yomz,0,2022-07-24,How not to feel burn out,Thugger021,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/w6yomz/how_not_to_feel_burn_out/,"Hey folks, I need your assistance with a very important matter. 
Firstly, I recently completed my second year of software engineering, and since then which may have been a mistake… I haven't missed a full week of coding (whether learning something new, building things I need, or creating youtube tutorials for my channel). One month ago, I collaborated with another programmer on a sizable portfolio project that may go beyond the portfolio level. Since I've been working on this project a lot, I've started taking Saturday and half of Friday off bcz I got to a stage feeling burnt out and don't feel like working.

I play a lot of sports, and occasionally, especially on Saturdays, I go out with friends to relax . I have a 3-week internship that begins in 2 weeks outside of my country, but I can't really stop working on my portfolio project because it will slow us down a lot. Therefore, I had planned to devote no more than 3 to 4 hours per day to the portfolio project and the remainder of the day to the internship.In addition, many people that I really love who haven't visited my country in four years will be arriving and departing while I am away. I am using this as motivation in addition to my passion for programming, but I am really afraid that I will reach a point where I am unable to work on either project. I tried to fit in some swimming and meditation, but I'm not sure if it was enough. Of course, I'm going to take Sunday off to unwind. I'm looking for senior programmers' advice on how to avoid burnout because I genuinely enjoy what I do, since last December if you take a look at my skills they have evolved in a gigantic way, and yet I am still a beginner and feeling burnt out now is a major issue for improvement 

Thanks for reading all the way here."
w6ytsg,34,2022-07-24,Tips for those who have not yet taken 344,thundastruck,OSUOnlineCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSUOnlineCS/comments/w6ytsg/tips_for_those_who_have_not_yet_taken_344/,"I did well in this course and to me it wasn’t as bad as people are saying. I took this course along with two others while doing an internship the first 2-3 weeks. I had never touched C or C++ before.

1. Don’t use VIM.
- I know VIM is recommended for this course as your IDE by the prof, but just don’t. VIM is useful to know but if you really want to learn it, learn it on your own time and not while you’re learning a whole new language.
- Use VSCode and SSH into os1 and do all of your work on there. This way you know that your program works where it’s actually going to be tested for as a grade.
- you can also easily scroll and edit compared to vim 
- Windows makes line returns weird and changes them sometimes which can mess up your program if you test locally but not on OS1–that’s why use VSCode and test on there since it’s Linux based. You don’t want everything to work on your local environment then have it fail where graders are going to test.

2. Don’t take it over the summer.
- Unless you are an experienced C programmer or have been working in the industry, the shortened time frame really hurts you. I needed almost all the days given for each assignment.

3. Break things down
- for the first two assignments read the directions very carefully and follow the skeleton code closely. Not much deviation is needed here to get full marks.
- smallsh and beyond - break each functionality down to individual parts if possible. Work on a specific part before moving on to another one.
- sometimes I would create a new file and write a function to see what the result would be. I used this to test if the individual functionality would work like I expected before trying to incorporate it into the complete program.

4. Read the man pages but…
- read the man pages to see what the functions do. 
- however some of them are confusing. What I would do is google the function along with tutorials point or geeks for geeks to see examples of the function in action. This helped me to really understand what the parameters were and how they worked with the function.

5. Understand pointers and when to use them 

6. Take this course as close to the end of the program as you can manage.
- I took 344 after an internship where I had to learn a new language and had to problem solve without answers being given to me. I think this really helps with approaching this course.
- sometimes programming doesn’t really click until you’ve taken a few courses where the answers aren’t already online.
- you’ll hopefully have more confidence as you near the end of the degree in your abilities

7. Test as you go
- I never really used the debugger other than it telling me where the code was messing up. Never really learned how to use it either as I don’t believe it is necessary to do well in the course.
- if you test as you go and implement new functionality it’s easier to know what and where you messed up
- print statements can be helpful

8. Take this course by itself or pair it with low time/difficulty courses
- I took this course paired with 464, 475. I found 475 to be more difficult to understand theoretically but easier to code for the assignments.
- 361, 362, databases, or 464 would be good pairings for this class."
w71prz,74,2022-07-24,Anyone else feel really tired when the weekend comes?,theinfinitefailure,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/w71prz/anyone_else_feel_really_tired_when_the_weekend/,"I don't know, I didn't think the internship would be this tiring. Maybe it's the whole 5 days a week 9-6 thing, but it's been almost 2 months and you'd think I'd get used to it by now. 

 I literally don't do anything after I get of at 6 every weekday. Just go straight home, eat, watch something, then sleep. I honestly can't wrap my head around how others have the energy to do anything else. Then when the weekend comes I just spend my time finishing chores then lounging around doing whatever. I'm starting to feel kind of guilty for not finishing this webdev course over the weekends/summer. I don't know if I'm the problem and should take some vitamin supplements or something but I can't understand how others have the time and energy to do so much over the weekend, particularly code. Is anyone else experiencing this tiredness? I really hope that's not how it's gonna be when I graduate and work a full time job."
w7242k,32,2022-07-24,Working in tech industry without a good computer.,YASSlNE,AskProgramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/w7242k/working_in_tech_industry_without_a_good_computer/,"Hi, I think the title maybe not straightforward to the real problem but here's the long story.

I don't have (by I, I mean me and my family) enough money, we're even afraid of turning on the ac for long time because it may cost a lot of electricity that we can't even pay the bill, I do have a pc but it's too old I can barely open visual studio or even sublime text to code it gets too slow and turns off.

I also been really ambitious and hoping to make some mobile apps but as you know android studio requires much ram and a good gpu, so I focused more on web apps.

But even web apps requires at least a good ide and at least 8 gb ram so that I can run both the browser and the ide, my pc is an hp with intel i3 2.20 ghz, intel 3000hd gpu and 4gb of ram.

I currently work as an intern for a tech company and I'm obliged to bring my pc at work but I get all the problems (too slow, gets hot, apps that I work freezes and turns off).

Please if s.o else been with the same problems maybe have some advices for me.

PS: I'm 20 years old.

Edit: Thank you so much guys for the support &lt;3"
w72d5p,7,2022-07-24,"Late 30's enrolled in CS, trying not to get left behind",BarelyrememberDiablo,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/w72d5p/late_30s_enrolled_in_cs_trying_not_to_get_left/,"Hi, I'm planning on attending a community college for a transfer Associates degree in Computer Science.  The reason I'm posting is I'm not sure which route to go degree wise overall (AAS alone, or AAS-&gt;BS/MS, BS, MS).  I'm a late 30's Veteran and I haven't worked in a few years. I can't do social work jobs any more. That's about all we need for background I think.

I already have a Bachelors in Sociology from a state school, so I know I can do the college thing. What I'm worried about is how I'm going to be able to learn along with the average student who will probably have a strong coding or math background, which I have neither.  I have no background in computer science and my highest college math was college algebra (Not even pre-calc). I want to avoid being that person who needs help every day.  Is math going to wreck my shit? I am familiar with windows, ios, I build my own computers and have nearly finished an A+ certification. Other than those things, I know nearly nothing. So what are the best first steps for someone like me? SICP book? C++ on one of the online courses? I started a python course but my classes will be in C++ it seems. C++ first?

Another concern I have is that I am unsure whether this Associates combined with my Sociology Bachelors would be enough to get me an entry level job, or if I will need further education.  What do you see other career changers do at your school, if you know of any that have a degree in something random already?  Would it be wiser to seek internships during my Associates, or do I need to get a Bachelors or Masters in Computer Science with what I already have to get an entry level job?  I know this isn't the career sub, I just wanted to ask this question to perhaps see what path you see other adult learners/career changers go down. Thank you in advance for any input!"

I'm doing this so my fellow North American applicants can chill out and calm their nerves a little bit.

Although it is true that anyone can get bad luck with the questions being asked on their interviews and that interviews tend to get a bit harder at L4 and L5 compared to the intern and new grad level, I still believe North American FAANGMULA interviews are pretty fair. Literally just have a good understanding of most problems and concepts on the Neetcode list, time yourself so you're finishing most mediums within 20 minutes, and practice communicating your thought process and writing clean code, and you'll probably get into some Big N company.

In India, there are so many candidates and so few spots that companies can pretty much expect competitive programming levels of DSA knowledge and still fill all their spots easily. There's just tougher competition over there. Most of the really hard questions on Leetcode would never show up on a North American Intern/New grad interview. And if it did, they wouldn't expect an optimal solution. These questions are mostly being ""flagged"" by international job seekers on platforms like Leetcode.

Another bias is that job seekers are going to be more likely to report seeing the difficult problems as opposed to easier ones on Leetode. Additionally, I've seen hard problems asked with far easier constraints during the interview, which also biases the frequency rating. For example, I've been asked Integer to English Word in an interview before, but the constraints were that the integer was always less than a thousand. This significantly reduces the difficulty of the problem. But if I were to report that problem on Leetcode, there's no way to make that distinction on their website."

**Quick Info:** Rising junior at a very small school (35 in my grade/class), top of the class (we don't do valedictorian but I have the highest PSAT &amp; GPA.), the school offers very few classes, only 8 total AP classes, I plan to take 6 of them in addition to 1 or 2 independently (I'm only not taking the AP Art classes). I'm often told I'm one of the smartest at the school and called the top of the class.

**Demographics:**

* Trans/Gender non-conforming (male sex)
* White/caucasian
* From a small town in Northeast Indiana
* Small non-competitive private Christian School (K-12 has 300-400 students total)
* Income bracket is around $110-$130k

**Intended Major(s):** Mechanical Engineering or Computer Science or Political Science or Mathematics. Undecided right now, but enjoy math, programming, &amp; legal studies

**UW/W GPA:** Predicted GPA: 3.9/4.2, current: 4.0/4.1

**Test Scores:**

* My school doesn't do ACT but I took it by myself during Freshman year- got 26 overall I think (I know, embarrassing low)
* Sophomore PSAT was 1220 (also too low, I blame COVID)
* Junior PSAT should be 1300 (based on practice tests)
* Junior SAT should also hopefully be above 1350

**Coursework:**

AP CLASSES:

* Sophomore (1): AP CSP
* Junior (2): AP Lang, AP CSA (independently)
* Senior (4): AP Lit, AP Gov, AP Span Lang, AP Calc AB (school doesn't offer BC but I might take the BC exam)

AP EXAMS:

* Sophomore (1): AP CSP
* Junior (4): AP Lang, AP CSA, AP Physics 1, AP USH
* Senior (5): AP Lit, AP Gov, AP Span Lang, AP Chem, AP Calc AB or BC

There are no IB, honors, or such classes offered at my school

&amp;#x200B;

**Awards:**

Perfect attendance (lol)

Speech &amp; Debate:

* Academic All American
* Four-time National Qualifier
* Top 3 highest point earners in the school's history
* Ranked top 5 in the district, top 10 in the state, and ranked in the country for Speech &amp; Debate
* 4-year ""High Net Point Earner"" of the team

**Extracurriculars:**

* 2-year captain of the Speech &amp; Debate Team
   * 4-year member
   * 2-year team captain
* Played tennis all of high school (and middle school). Only on Varsity in my senior year.
   * Won a few awards/recognitions on the team, nothing too special or crazy
* Played baseball sophomore year- varsity starter (only 12 on the team though)
   * All-conference honorable mention
* Member of our yearbook/Witmarisum/Sightline Student publication- includes a website, youtube channel, social media, and yearbook making
   * ""Lead"" in the club/group, and by my senior year was the longest member of it
   * Tech consultant for the club
* Fish Head- my school does a Fish Fry every year twice a year, once for the junior class, once for the seniors
   * Every class elects 2 students to be the leaders of it, it requires a lot of time and effort to plan out the Fish Fry, and manage it on the actual ""Fry Day""
   * Is a student-elected and teacher-selected position of respect and leadership
* Lights Technician for every play &amp; musical (1 of each a year) when I was in high school
   * Started in middle school, have worked with the director ever since
* Probably something else that I'm forgetting lmao

&amp;#x200B;

**Essays/LORs/Other:**

* Summer after Sophomore year I had an internship with the Notre Dame Center for Civic Innovation
   * 8-week summer internship
   * Made a GIS map/file of Downtown Elkhart (a city in Northern Indiana near Notre Dame)
   * Collected lots of data for the City of Elkhart
   * Worked to solve their housing crisis

**Schools:**

*I'd love to go to most T20s, but these are my top choices, I don't have any idea of my chances of actually getting in, so please help me with that :)! If you have suggestions of other schools to apply to I'd also love that.*

* Ivies- EA or RD, whichever is better
* CalTech- my top choice, probably apply EA

* Carnegie Mellon- good choice, EA or whatever is best
* WashU- same thing as Carnegie Mellon
* U Chicago- would love to go here, but probably won't get in, EA or whatever is best
* MIT- lol, same thing pretty much
* Boston College- my target school, EA or whatever is best
* Northeastern- another target school &amp; top choice, EA or whatever is best
* University of Denver- safety/backup
* Goshen College- safety/backup, local college in my hometown/current town
* Probably a few Top Liberal Arts Schools (Williams, Amherst, Pomona, etc.)

Thanks for taking your time to chance me! If you have any suggestions or comments at all, please let me know!

Other note: I will NOT apply to 15 schools, only a few. I just want to know where I have the best shot at. Thanks!"

* Let's get this out of the way, I'm trans MtF, and staying in the US long-term feels like sitting in the blast radius of a ticking time bomb.

* That being said, my physical and mental state are completely stable and healthy. For all practical purposes my transition is done, my paperwork is up to date, and I live an exceedingly normal life. Were it not for fears of being the target of political turmoil, being trans does not factor into my daily life or even thoughts

* I pass rather well and do not expect discrimination based on appearing lgbt to be an issue wherever I go. Overall I'm concerned less with the explicit lgbt protections a country may have, and more with simply the ability to be a normal citizen blending in with everyone else and not receiving any different treatment or spotlight on me due to my identity (which I keep as hidden as possible in the first place). I have a hope of someday receiving citizenship and official ID documents in a country that does not have any records on me indicating my transgender status at all.

* **I have *always* wanted to settle into another country as my permanent home for many reasons, the current political climate of the US is only making me think and act more proactively on pursuing what was already my dream, it is not the main motivation**

Alright, now all the rest of the relevant info:

* I am a born US citizen

* I have a bachelor's degree in computer science

* I have 1+ year in post-grad software development experience, 3 years if including software development internships taken during my degree program. Strengths are full-stack development using .NET core framework, many of the most mainstream Javascript frameworks, MSSQL for both client-facing and internal company applications.

* I am currently making good money and saving it, expecting to have a reserve savings in the middle 5 figures before 2024

* Japan is my dream goal for many reasons. I've stayed in the country before and could write a whole essay on everything I love about living there. I have no delusions about it either, I'm aware of all the commonly cited drawbacks of life there especially as a foreigner

* I have one friend also from the US who lives in Tokyo working in the tech sector, who I'm consulting for advice and pointers on this matter

* I have been studying the language long-term but informally. I estimate my current proficiency is JLPT N4, and by the time of the next JLPT I intend to have reached N3 and make it official

* I hope to *not* have to resort to JET programs

* I am very open to other possibilities, especially if the opportunity is good and the process can be expedient. I have friends across many countries (Sweden, Switzerland, France, Germany, Australia, Canada, Austria) that would be open to assisting me were I to move near them, though I am not currently learning any languages other than JP.

* It is *unlikely* that my current job would allow me to work full time remote from outside the country, but the odds are not zero

* No criminal history or trouble with the law of any kind, I've never gotten so much as a parking ticket

* Wherever I move I'm looking to never return to the US.

This wall of bulletpoints in mind, I'm looking for any pointers or advice on work visa processes and their paths to permanent residence. Potential opportunities for large employers in my field who could sponsor a move, things to be aware of that may not be obvious, advice on specific countries that I may have the easiest/quickest time getting into. It feels like there's so much conflicting information across random websites in regards to any given country's work visa application process, so if anyone can offer relevant advice for getting out of the US for good, I'd love to hear it, since in my current situation I feel as if I have all the tools necessary to get out but I need help putting together a plan to use them.

I’m considering applying to both a SWE internship and STEP internship at Google (along with a ton of other companies of course) but would only be able to get a possible reference for one of the two spots. 

For some background info on me: I’m going into my second year in computer engineering and have been working on projects (unrelated but would love additional project ideas if anyone has any!) throughout the summer to boost my chances at getting in and I’m now wondering whether it would be better to prioritize the STEP internship or a full on SWE internship.

I’m comfortable enough in my technical skills to apply for the STEP internship, knowing that we work in groups with other interns and are closely mentored/monitored throughout the program. I do worry about wasting my “reference” on the STEP program rather than a full blown SWE internship - which is obviously the end goal (an ex-neighbour still works at google and offered to act as a reference for me)

Will going for the STEP internship, as a second year student, hinder my chances of coming back as a SWE intern the year after? Would I be better off aiming for the SWE internship directly even if I feel that my skills might be lacking compared to others applying - but I would still have that reference “boost”.

w7bppy,2,2022-07-24,First salaried position out of college and am struggling greatly,Fancy-Refrigerator90,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/w7bppy/first_salaried_position_out_of_college_and_am/,"So I graduated in May with a degree in Civil Engineering, moved to a big city and working for a general contractor as a project manager. Great salary and benefits, cool city, great co workers. However, all my intern and co-op experience were as a lab technician and a summer spent estimating. I feel overwhelmed and clueless so far. I'm learning slowly and figuring things out, but on Friday I messed up on an invoice we send out every month and its got me super stressed. No one freaked out at me or anything, I was just told to look at it again and consult with my boss if I got confused. I also have had a string of bad luck in my personal life: truck parts stolen, had a home invasion, had a medical emergency that required an ambulance and an ER visit, and recently got in a bad car accident that was not my fault (actually happened right before I found out I f'd up the invoice)

I have 3 projects starting next month, which I feel will help accelerate my learning curve and give me more to do. Work comes in waves it seems, sometimes I'm super busy and sometimes I literally have nothing to do. It's my first time being on a salary (only every been an hourly employee) and the idea of not having work hours set in stone is also freaking me out. I'm super polite to everyone, work hard, try and tackle my assignments immediately when they come my way. I struggle with my confidence and view everyone as superior to me in the office since they know what they are doing and I really don't. As a project manager I feel confidence is an important thing to have, and I am lacking it. 

Anyway, I know that was a lot of rambling. Here are my questions: 

1. I haven't gotten a warning or anything about my performance so far, but am I in danger of being fired? 
2. What can I do to speed up the learning curve in the construction management industry? (we do mainly asphalt paving projects, mostly government and city, not much residential work at all)
3. What can I do to increase confidence at work? 

Thanks in advance guys."

Is it possible to land quant trading internships in these firms for co-op (and eventually, full time)?"
w7d3gl,0,2022-07-24,What major is likely to lead me to a job/field that I’m not miserable in?,workpk12,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/w7d3gl/what_major_is_likely_to_lead_me_to_a_jobfield/,"What activities / hobbies / interests have you had since a kid? - Writing, I started writing fanfiction at a very young age (literally the age of 8 or 9.)  I was also very into physical activity in elementary school, and I actually still write fanfiction now.  I recall that one of the first things I did after getting my first iPad was look up the process of pregnancy and that sort of thing.  

What do you love talking about with other people? - I’m not inclined to say that I’m good with people but movies, science is actually really intriguing to me (not that I discuss it with people often,) MBTI actually… MBTI definitely, MBTI probably comes close to the top of the list for me.  Back when I took Chemistry I tended to be knowledgeable about that.  
What type of people is it easiest for you to converse with?  - People who are open minded and who I don’t feel judged by.  I have a lot of social anxiety around judgmental people.  

What are you curious to keep learning about? - Science (Donnie Darko comes to mind,) human behavior/functioning, different diseases, etc.  When I was watching Donnie Darko yesterday for some reason the whole “oh wow, never realized how much I like science” thing hit me.


How do you want to be remembered? - I have to be honest, I actually don’t know how to answer this question.  Like if I’m being as honest as I can be here, when I read this question, something that came to mind for me is that at least today, I’m actually sort of feeling like when I die, I don’t know that I want to be ‘remembered’ - at least not in a broad sense, like by everyone.  If I end up getting married and having kids, I guess I’d want them to remember me as a kindhearted, hardworking woman who helped provide for the family.  But I assume this specifically pertains to a career, and the answer is: I don’t know.  I guess that I might want whatever kind of work I’m doing to be important in the sense that I’m maybe idk helping someone or something, but I actually really don’t know.  

What would you do if money weren’t an issue?  - If I had all the money in the world and I had to choose one hobby, I would want my hobby to be one wherein I consistently helped someone out - for example, maybe just feeding and listening to old people.  For some reason that comes to mind for me or appeals to me, even though I don’t have “good social skills” and don’t know how good I was at it before my grandparents died.  (But I’m really sleepy in part due to my internship, so I still don’t know.)  

What does the world need but can’t get from anyone else but you? - I don’t know, I guess my specific way of thinking?  Oh, well, actually maybe my loyalty.  For example, in regards to my internship I’m consistent about showing up and trying to do the work even if I don’t always… know what I’m doing (like for example for some reason even though I enjoyed hanging up the wetsuits I had trouble unclipping the uh… the lifevests.  It just kind of hurt my fingers.)  I’d also say that I have potentially good organizational skills.  I’ve heard that I have good writing skills.  
I don’t know what I’d be willing to sacrifice in order to have a job?  I know that I think I’d be consistent about showing up and completing the work no matter how I felt (I still show up to my internship even when I’m sick and make sure that I’m efficient about completing the tasks.)  I guess that if I were helping people that’d be nice, but I can also have days or periods of time where I’m very cynical/pessimistic about people and society so that’s a tough one.  

What gives you energy but keeps you at peace at the same time?  - Honestly, just taking a walk outside.  Getting sleep at night (which I’m not good about doing - I do get sleep, just not as much as someone my age should be getting.)  Writing fanfiction, actually.  

What’s one positive thing you need to happen to you to give you momentum to keep moving forward? - This isn’t something that needs to happen to me, but I know that it probably actually would be beneficial for me to delete all social media.  I’m really obsessed with Reddit specifically (I’m getting better about my other social media) and am aware that it’s impacting my mind more than I’d like to admit, but.  I guess I need my mental health to improve (I have depression and anxiety if you can’t tell, yay) to be happy moving forward, and to have better… social life prospects.  Oh, I’ll also somehow need to fix my sleeping schedule because I’m tired of waking up with headaches (though I also get sick a lot, for whatever reason.)  

What are you looking for long-term? - I want to finally, definitively figure out what I actually will major in and what job may make me idk decently happy or at least not entirely miserable (I already am not a huge fan of school, so I just want to find something where I don’t go home wanting to rip my hair out - that’s not how school always makes me feel, but.)  I want to be able to save up my money.  I don’t want to say that I went to college and just completely wasted my time on a degree I’m never even going to use.  
Extended information: I’m not in college yet but am getting closer and closer to it.  I was thinking of majoring in nursing for a long time, but am now getting kind of scared bc I know that attaining your bachelor’s in it in my state is really competitive, and also bc I keep hearing about “nurse burnout” and about how it’s really bad for people who are already prone to depression (though I have high functioning depression.)  

I was thinking of majoring in neuroscience because yesterday after re watching Donnie Darko for the first time in years, I was astounded by how fascinated I was and it got me really thinking about how science is the one subject I’ve always been really, truly intrigued by more than anything else.  But now I’m scared bc I dropped Pre Cal in junior yr early on as I feel like I didn’t learn enough in Algebra 2, and I don’t want to do a science major and have to take remedial math classes or something.  My mom pointed out to me that I actually used to be pretty against going into STEM in general.  I just feel lost and kind of dumb.  

I’ve always been good abt maintaining high grades, but was a little easier on myself in junior year or less studious due to my decision to start at community.  I ultimately feel like I haven’t enjoyed my youth and have spent a lot of time depressed.  

I know that a… woman who attends community in my city and is almost in her 2ndyr of it suggested to me when I asked her that apparently when you get to community in my city, if you show them your transcript and have already taken a specific math class you won’t have to take it again.  

I am not inclined to say that I have good social skills, or have ever been the “popular” type, but am commonly considered to be an ambivert.  

I was partly considering nursing bc I am aware that the degree is versatile.

What can I do?",Joonscene,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/w7e1oi/mom_seems_to_think_ill_f20_be_successful_after/,"I'm currently taking up Computer Science as a major and Math for a minor. I'm also reaching the end of my first internship (there's four days left). 

The internship was shitty. It was done from home and I was assigned a very dumb project, no effort required whatsoever. Compared to other people's research projects, mine is the equivalent of a preschooler's chicken scratch. 

I couldn't have done it any better, and now I have to present it to everyone on Thursday. It'll be a nightmare, but I'm ready to get it over with. I plan on applying to an externship that my college is offering, but overall, college is not going so well. 

I mean, I guess that's to be expected, right? Get the degree, get out, find out none of it mattered? 

I live at home with my parents and I don't have a job currently. They don't want me to move out, but I do. I really need to. My family isn't the worst, but they are tough to live with on a daily basis. 

The thing is, I don't want to waste money by renting. I need to get a job, but how am I meant to rent in a place like NJ while being a full time student with a part time job?

I don't think it's possible, not unless I find friends to share rent with. 

Anyway, I talked to my mom today and she said I should spend my time in college studying and building my resume so I can get a good job after I graduate. 

&amp;#x200B;

A good job? With my computer science degree that I managed to get with no coding experience whatsoever? I just don't see it happening. I don't see anything but disappointment and shame in my future."

I have a bachelors degree in applied science already (traditional engineering) and am doing a second bachelors right now. Need another year to graduate, but my intern manager wants me to work on a new project with a full time offer. Should I just drop out of school?"
w7knzb,2,2022-07-25,Is it worth taking a tech internship for a non-tech company?,usr3nmev3,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/w7knzb/is_it_worth_taking_a_tech_internship_for_a/,"I'm an incoming college senior, and recently received an offer for a part-time 'applied computer science intern' role in the mining division for a multinational manufacturing company. Based on my discussions with the team, it's more or less just a software engineering intern role but there was a fairly strong emphasis on formal algorithm design/development. From the conversations, it seemed like I would learn a pretty solid amount, work with some talented people, and gain experience with a fairly unfamiliar/new to me tech stack (Kotlin). The pay was decent as well.

However, I'm slightly worried about being pigeonholed to a role that is not ""pure"" tech, and having trouble breaking out of it. I do have a prior sophomore internship at a Series B SaaS startup, but I would not be able to continue after graduation there (the mining company expressed extremely strong interest in me continuing after I graduated ('assuming nothing goes wrong during your internship')). This role also didn't seem to help my internship search for something new this summer. 

Is this a valid concern? My gut tells me I should take the role, and in the worst case, I can just leave it off my resume."

For my 12th mid term as well as predicted I'll be most likely be getting around 95%+

Gradewise, I am within the top 5% of my grade.

As a cbse student I don't have much choise in choosing my subjects
My school offers only 2 main streams: Science and commerce
I am a sciences student and my subjects are as follows: Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Computer Science, Physical Education, English

I have taken SAT once and obtained a composite of 1460:
Math: 800

2) co-founder of Azia: a youth organisation, that works with Schools and NGOs to provide opportunities for students around dubai, opportunities  for community service, competitions etc. Will be holding a large interschool fundraiser after the summer. Started this organisation cuz there was a severe lack of opportunities in dubai for Indian students, for example: its quite hard to find community service opportunities and volunteering opportunities for below 18 year olds.

3) I have built 3 full stack applications, currently at use in my school. (i) Buble: A student tracker for covid-19 safety. (ii) GameTime: An application to see scores of sports and games happening at school. (iii) JSSNews: A news platform, where students of my school can get a summary of the latest news.

4) I was accepted into a selective summer program by the ministry of education, Dubai.

5) I took up an internship position during the summer at a local solar company writing reports.

6) I am an active member of the schools leadership council: Currently the president of the Hope Committee.

7) President of the Tech society at my school, we organise and participate I'm various hackathons and competitions.

8) Leader of the coding Club at my school, where I teach students how to code and build applications. I also started the system of clubs in my school as it wasn't present previously, I helped setup 5 separate clubs and appointed the leaders as I am clubs coordinator as well.

9) Currently working on an engineering project on metaverse with the help of JSS University in India

I am hoping to try and getting into t20 schools. I am thinking of ED to cornell university, and still confused on which other universities I should be focusing on based on my portfolio.

Any other Universities I could apply to?"

Preferred field- Technology(e-commerce, web3.0 etc.), Technology/ Strategy Consulting, Tourism. 

Preferred Location- Europe, US, Japan.

Languages spoken- English

Situation:

Hello, I'm enrolled in MSc in business Analytics in France, and I will be graduating next year. So, during these vacations, I've been trying to upskill myself so I could start looking for opportunities asap. I've been looking over the internet, but most of the content is about processes, charts, etc that are used. I totally understand that these are important when you work, but as a newbie, who doesn't have a solid Business Analysis background, I don't think I could showcase these in my resume, which would be the only thing that'll get me my interview. Now, in France, language is a barrier for me as I don't speak French very well. I am still learning but I'm sure that it wouldn't be that good so soon. So I have been learning SQL, python, excel, and tableau so at least I could mention them in my resume.

Question:

What skills, tools, and things I should definitely work on, which I could showcase in my resume, or mention in the interview to land that opportunity. Also what are the projects I could do and mention them? I am also looking for the requirements of top companies like Amazon, they only demand some SQL knowledge and French and English skills. But I think it'll be a problem for me with the language, as well as my experience. Please suggest me things to look forward to, work upon, and companies I should target for better work-life balance with reasonable pay for an entry-level applicant. Any resume tips and job/internship hunting tips are welcome as well.

Also, is anybody working in any field of web 3.0 as a business analyst? I would just love to know which companies have such opportunities and I would love to work on web3 technologies. Also, talk about the relevant skill set and knowledge required for it.

Thank you in advance."

w7m06e,3,2022-07-25,Applying for CS programs as an ECE undergrad,jinks777,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/w7m06e/applying_for_cs_programs_as_an_ece_undergrad/,"TLDR: ECE undergrad. Not satisfying all prerequisites for MSCS programs in terms of courses studied during undergrad. Will my profile be instantly filtered out?

I'm trying to apply for CS programs in the US for fall 23. I have a B.E. (Bachelors in Engineering) degree in Electronics and Communications. I've noticed that a lot of programs (mainly looking at MSCS) have prerequisites for computer science based courses taken during an applicant's undergrad. My main question is whether these prerequisites are absolute and will my profile be instantly filtered out if I don't satisfy all of them?

A lot of programs ask for courses like operating systems and database management which I could not take during my undergrad and I don't think it matters whether or not I studied these topics on my own to the universities that I will be applying to. Some programs don't have a ton of prerequisites and some ask for equivalent work experience instead. These programs are what I'm considering for now.

I've always had an interest in computer science. It's just that things didn't work out exactly as planned when I was applying for my undergrad which is why I ended up in ECE.

Additional info:

- Currently working as a Data Scientist in an MNC. Current experience is about 12 months.
- I had taken 4 CS related courses in college. Not sure if the first 2 count since they were mandatory courses in our first year.
  - Fundamentals of Computing
  - Fundamentals of Computing Lab
  - Data Structures using C
  - Python Application Programming
- Have 2 ML related projects. Have one 6 month internship in the same MNC that I'm working in.
- Engineering mathematics for 4 semesters.

I continued with my internship. 

I spent time with my family but right now I just feel so useless and a failure. I don’t understand how to navigate life anymore. It seems like everybody is doing so much better than me. 

I’m also a bit jealous of my ex but not In a I want him kind of way. But I’m jealous of his success. He recently graduated, got a new gf and a job. 

Meanwhile here I am struggling to do better in school. It’s not like I slack off. I do the work but I’m overwhelmed by the deadlines. 

I don’t exactly know how I’m going to kill myself. I just don’t have any will to live. It’s over for me."

Thanks in advance!

Also I’m actually somewhat decent at leetcode easy/mediums (still trying to implement hash maps where I can, though for maximum optimization) so that’s a plus, but don’t have much experience coding in real world situations. Actually none at all"

Also by the time I thought I might be able to fall asleep there were not enough hours left. I would have maybe gotten 3 hours and I cannot function with any less than 7 minimum. I might have been able to work with 6 hours, definitely not 3. Especially because I have to wear a suit and look nice every day.

 The job ends in a short amount of weeks and I just left a learning opportunity today because I felt sad and couldnt cut that difficult conversation short and just fing be responsible and sleep.

I was vague as to why I could not come in. I wonder if they will see me in a bad light. Scared and sad and feeling like the scum of this earth :("

w7tfxc,3,2022-07-25,Intuition between class weights,Sudden-Pineapple-793,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/w7tfxc/intuition_between_class_weights/,"Hi, I’m currently working on a binary classification problem for my internship where I categorize text. I’ve built a naive bayes model. My current issue is that with the classification, if it’s true, it can be broken down to hundreds of different subsections. Ie I’m trying to predict if text is a rule; if it is a rule, I would further categorize it into if it’s a health rule, or a financial rule, etc. I’m working with tf-idf, logistic regression -&gt; multinomial naivebayes  


My main question is, is there a difference between having it be a binary classification problem then taking the true labels, and putting that into a multi label classification problem. Or if I can just put false, with 100 true classes into a model right away. Intuitively I’m thinking there would be no real difference, because the class weights for true/false would still overall be the same. But if we go with the first method it would be easier to see how the model is performing at different points.


An example would be (40% false, 60% true) versus (40% false, 20% true1, 20%true2, 20,true3)

Sorry if my terms are used incorrectly, I’m still in school.thank you!"

I am an Aerospace Engineering MSc student at a good university, however, I realized that I never really liked the field and decided to change to Software Engineering. To make it more achievable, I have been taking computer science courses alongside my thesis and learning some of the fundamentals that I would have gotten in a CS BSc.

It is getting close to my graduation, so I will start applying for jobs relatively soon, around September, I think. I will be targeting bigtech and fintech companies and wanted to ask for some feedback on whether my CV is good enough to get interviews. I believe I have a decent project I also have an internship, which is good, but the fact that it is in Data Science and that I do not have a CS degree make it harder for me to judge whether this is good enough.

Besides taking an Algorithms and Data Structures course, I have been reading a Computer Networks textbook and plan to read one on Concurrency Models before applying, however I don't know how to or even if I should include that in the CV, since I am not taking any courses on the subjects.

Below is a picture of the CV:

w7uxx7,7,2022-07-25,Confused on which direction to take. Looking to study computer science.,DrKwonk,UniUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/w7uxx7/confused_on_which_direction_to_take_looking_to/,"Hello guys! Im currently in year 12 and wanting to study computer science at University. Recently, we did our PPEs (Pre Public Examinations) and while we haven't received our predicted grades yet, i asked my teachers for what i got in the tests themselves.

Im currently doing Maths, Biology and Sociology. 

Biology - D
Maths - C
Sociology - B
UCAS points - 96


Weird combo but this is because i wanted to study physics instead of biology as the school i go to listed it as available, got accepted for it but then the day before we started year 12 (yes, literally the day before), they said that it conflicted with the maths time table and that they were both on at the same time, so i had to choose either maths OR physics, and chose maths since comp sci courses want maths, then had bio left over.

Anyway, the two options i have been thinking of was doing a foundation year with comp sci at a lower ranked UNI, OR doing good in my A levels, then taking a gap year and re applying to better unis the year after. (I have african parents and the ranking of the university is important to them. Obviously i want to make them happy but if i dont go to a crazy university i dont want to be seen as a failure you know?)

Im currently doing an internship for a startup, so i have programming knowledge in javascript, with concepts understood through Scheme thanks to SICP by MIT (Currently reading the Javascript one), if that will be any use to my personal statement (if i apply for foundation). (funnily enough, this startup provides calculator tools for computer science students. You can check it out at [Compscilib](https://www.compscilib.com).

I also wanted to ask how good experience like this would look on my personal statement. 

Any other suggestions on which path i should take, or if the uni i go to really matters for computer science would really be appreciated."

w7x6yf,135,2022-07-25,Difficulty finding degree-relevant job without internship experience,Kraftykodo,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/w7x6yf/difficulty_finding_degreerelevant_job_without/,"I'm one year post-graduation (biomedical engineering) and haven't had much luck landing a job in either biomedical or software fields, at the moment I work as a data analyst but I'm really looking for something more along the lines of a Junior Developer or Biomedical Technician.  
  
The problem I'm running into is I can make it to the interviews, however I never continue onward past the first or second interview, usually due to not being as competitive in skillset as other applicants. I have six different projects involved with either biomedical or software topics that I typically choose from to include/discuss depending on the position I'm applying to. Even so I'm starting to think that the projects aren't complex enough to make up for my lack of internship experience that many others likely have.   
  
I had one (arguably two) internships lined up my Junior/Senior year, however that was right when the pandemic hit, and both companies dropped their intern positions as a result. The pandemic hadn't subsided to any great extent until after I graduated, but then I didn't qualify for internships any longer of course.  
  
I know I need to work on more complex and likely more relevant projects for the positions I'm applying to, but how do I know what to prioritize? I'm applying to such varying job postings throughout both software and biomedical fields that I'm struggling to choose one specific niche to specialize towards, and I know I need to find a specialty.  
  
I feel like I've fallen behind the colleagues I graduated with, and I'm losing confidence in my ability as an engineer."

With enrollment at this university, I’m looking to apply for summer 2023 internships (FAANG, big tech, etc. anything I can apply to). The head of the CS department told me a while back that the review period would take 1-2 weeks, but now the admissions office is telling me that they’ll get back to me in September or October. 

Is it okay for me to still apply to summer 2023 internships in August with this master’s program on my resume’s education section? Note: This is a cheap masters program with a high acceptance rate and I went to a top 15 CS program for undergrad, so I expect to get in. My only concern is if companies will turn me away for not being fully matriculated yet. 


**TL;DR**  I’ll most likely get my master’s acceptance in September or October but I would like to apply to summer 2023 internships in August."

Didn't get an internship this year, so I'm hyperfocused on getting a good one for next year, actually posting this during a leetcode break lol. For those of you that have had an internship (preferably multiple), what are the common factors that can help make or break an internship?

I understand some of these will be up to personal preference, but even things as simple as WFH versus hybrid versus in-office, or working in a team of interns versus having a solo project, or having housing provided versus a stipend, etc., would be things I'd like to hear about! I'd also love to hear about if internship quality usually reflects internship ""prestige""--my thought process here is that companies with established internship programs likely have better ones overall than smaller companies that may only hire a few interns.

If some experienced users could chime in, that'd be great, thanks everyone! I usually lurk but this sub is super helpful!"

Im very new to excel and have been spending the whole day trying to figure this out. Ive tried XLOOKUP but so far vlookup has yielded better results albiet not much. I can manually match certain things like adobe photoshop as its in the ACL but the function I've found leaves much manual work to be done in a list that is huge.

background:

little expierence in Excel (basic spreadsheet stuff (no function knowledge))

intern at a government position and the spreadsheets are CUI (or something) so I cant share them

the A column is what needs to be searched and the K column is whats being matched

I took up accounting and did well in my lower division classes and ended up completing an associates. 

For the upcoming Fall semester is there a way I can communicate to effectively to people coordinating or leading internship programs in order to stand out among other applicants that may have not gone through the math/sciences I have taken?

I don't want to go outside,my only good friend calls me and tells me to hang out repeatedly but I just ignore him for some reason. My social life is non existent. Everyday I wake up,watch anime,play games,watch porn,jerk off and go to sleep. This has been going on for too long. I try to stop it but after 2 days I go back to same routine. I also gained lot of weight in these two years and basically I feed by impulse nowadays. I want to visit a psychiatrist but I don't have the strength to tell my parents about it or go there by myself. I feel like shit that me as a doctor don't have the strength to go to a psychiatrist. How can I tell others to do the same when I can't?

I’m about to graduate in 3 weeks with no prior internship experience. I’ve sent probably 90 applications and had about  4 interviews. Made it to the final round for 1 and then failed, ghosted by 2 after initial call, and one offer. This offer is from TCS. I’ve read various reviews regarding TCS, some people say they were placed in a developer role and some in a completely random one. I really want to pursue software development in my career but I’m unsure if TCS will provide me with that. They are offering me a decent salary (unemployed at the moment) and I can leave anytime I want. Also, they said that I would be placed in a project that is located in the Bay Area which is close to my home. Should I take this offer and hope for the best? Or, continue to apply to other companies? 

Overall, I just would like to receive some guidance from this sub or from people who were in a similar situation as me.

w86zob,2,2022-07-25,Where do I go from here? Do I keep getting certifications or do I start looking for jobs?,Drewskiii727,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/w86zob/where_do_i_go_from_here_do_i_keep_getting/,"Hi everyone, I was recently laid off and am trying to transition to the IT field, more so cybersecurity or cloud security. I have a Bachelors in Finance and have worked in a client-relationship/operational capacity in private wealth management for the last 5 years so I don't have a tech background.

Not really having a game plan, I've just been studying for a few certifications. Currently I have the AZ-900, SC-900, AWS CCP, Network+ and Security+. I am slated to start WGU's Bachelors in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance on September 1st, I'm hoping to try to finish it within a 6-month semester term.

Do I continue just getting certified? Or should I enroll in the Soc Analyst career path program with Cybrary? Or should I try to start applying for jobs? Even entry level help desk positions seem to want 1-2 years of experience. Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated.

I've been trying to find cybersecurity apprenticeships but haven't had much luck, I missed the internship period for most companies. There is a local cybersecurity company hiring Security Analyst positions for a SOC that the recruiter has said I don't need prior hand's on experience to get but I've been reading the Glassdoor interviews for that company and its 4 rounds of pretty intense situational technical interviews which I don't think I would be ready for. I can pass a CompTIA test but in-depth interviews like that, I'm sure I'm going to crash and burn hard so don't want to be over confident and screw up potentially interviewing with them before I am ready."

w88j9i,3,2022-07-25,"How do I get organized, stop talking myself down and start accepting my mistakes?",Hungybungygingi,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/w88j9i/how_do_i_get_organized_stop_talking_myself_down/,"So I used to be depressed during high school but I am doing better now and I am trying to actively improve myself. I am on break waiting to start my sophomore year in college, I have a job I do on campus, and plan to study English and History. I workout, but not as much as I would like, and try to actively make a schedule I can adhere too. I thought since it was the summer and that I made my decision not to work a job over break that it would be easy but with family events, getting together with friends, and doing everything my family expects of me while still feeling somewhat free is harder than I thought. So the first part of my question is how can I balance this? I don't need a super specific answer just advice on how other people with a lot of commitments were able to balance these things out. I assume the answer is self discipline and will power and if that is the case how can I improve those qualities within myself, how can I convince myself to keep going even when my plans are constantly derailed or I just want to relax?

Another thing I want to bring up is how I am constantly putting myself down, whenever I make a mistake or make someone upset by accident, I find it hard to not degrade myself. It used to be worse in high school which caused my depression and I try to actively fight it today with some success. My brother says I need to stop comparing myself to people and just focus on myself. I motivate myself a little bit by thinking about Rob McElhenney talk about getting shredding for Always Sunny in Philadelphia in a Conan interview. He talks about how he goes to a personal trainer and asks if they can train him so he looks like Brad Pitt in Fight Club, and the personal trainer says that's impossible. Then he tells Rob that what he can actually do is make Rob look like he was in Fight Club. So he's basically saying instead of comparing yourself to Bred Pitt focus on the best version of yourself and I believe in that completely. Despite trying to hold true to this philosophy and trying to actively fight back against this negative thoughts they still are able to creep into my brain and I hate it. Social media doesn't help either even though I have tried to avoid many platforms I always find myself coming back to stuff like TikTok, Reddit and Twitter. Not to mention how addicting Youtube is. Self discipline would probably solve the social media problem but as for the putting myself down part I am open to advice. 

Finally how can I accept the fact that I am a human and I make mistakes? Should I just accept that I made the mistake and tell myself I wont do it again later, but what if I accidentally offended someone by doing it, then I'll feel guilty and start degrading myself again. Even if I made peace with that person I still feel disappointed in myself for making that mistake in the first place. Whether its a social or activity based mistake I still find it hard to get past the fact that I might be a weak link or something. Especially since we live in a world that I personally think holds individuals to tremendous scrutiny if they are willing to put themselves into a social space, I find it hard to get past every little flaw of mine which I think will make people hate me. I still suffer a little bit from social anxiety and I am introverted but I try not to let this stop me. I am trying to put myself out there more. I decided to not get a job this summer since I wanted one last free summer, the last one before I truly become an adult and accept that my responsibilities will only just grow from this point forward. I plan to try out for my colleges rugby team this next semester, and my school job is a customer service job so it really tests my social skills. I will also try for a full time internship nest summer and I am starting to form a bit of a relationship with one of my female coworkers. So In the next couple of months to a year I will be trying to get out of my comfort zone, granted these aren't big steps but I think they are good starting points. 

I am not sure how the people on this subreddit will receive this post, but I am still young and foolish, and want to become a better person. So to the presumably older and wiser people on here, how do I get organized, how do I stop talking myself down and how do I start accepting my mistakes?"
w88srh,4,2022-07-25,new interns seems to be smarter than me 😶,Brilla-Bose,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/w88srh/new_interns_seems_to_be_smarter_than_me/,"Backstory

&gt;I work in a small company (in **work from home**) with 8-10 employees. i got this job as my first job 8 months ago, and recently got permanent. when i was joining i had a senior SE but he moved to a new company 3 months ago,  i mainly do full stack and mobile development (with react native as well) but i sometimes i feel like knowing nothing! 

&amp;#x200B;

Problem

recently They took 3 new interns and two of them seems to have a good knowledge in programming (probably better than me ) , since i'm the only guy left i need to do code reviews and need to organize them, clear their doubts and you know, all the senior software developer stuff! 

**Have you ever been in a situation like this? where your junior have more knowledge/skills than you? if so how you pulled of from that situation?** 

PS: i'm not jealous but i'm a bit scared what to do next and how to handle this situation"
w89yof,2,2022-07-26,I feel like a failure of a human being.,Freya00746,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/w89yof/i_feel_like_a_failure_of_a_human_being/,"I (22F) have been feeling worse and worse about myself as of late. I have struggled with depression and anxiety my whole life, it's the way I've always been. I also had a tough time in school thanks to a learning disability. I would often compare myself to my twin brother because he was always gifted and did well in school and talked to others with ease. I remember feeling at around 8 that I didn't want to live because I felt so worthless like I wasted everyone's time just by existing. I got into fashion and technical design because it's the only thing I'm any good at my parents always encouraged me with it and bought me a sewing machine when I wanted to try it because it was the first time I showed interest in anything and it lit a spark in me and made me truly happy. Making costumes and figuring out how to bring something into reality made me feel like I have value in being alive. Even with my poor grades, I managed to get into the world's best fashion school and have decent grades. This year will be my last year in college I'll be getting a Bachelor's Degree in Technical Design (more about making the garment rather than designing it) I have an internship and I just don't feel that joy from this. my main thought is ""will I really be doing this for the rest of my life? Have I worked so hard to get a job I don't love?"" I'm currently working on a costume on the side for fun and that's really the only thing keeping me going right now. I love this craft and every step of the process, other than that I hardly get joy from anything in real life. I spend what free time I have either working on costumes or consuming media. 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is I feel incredibly guilty and like a disappointment. My parents gave me a wonderful childhood paid for my college and a study abroad trip to Italy to learn about textiles. They are also paying for my apartment in NYC for my internship. I do my best in my internship and in school, but I am so tired of trying so hard all the time. I feel bad because my parents worked so hard for this, but all want to do is make my dumb costumes and not work a ""real job"". I worked part-time to pay for the supplies for the costumes and such but that wouldn't work for the rest of my life. There is likely no way I'll ever be able to pay my parents back for college and everything they have done for me. I am scared about my uncertain future, how am I going to afford the cost of living and costumes in the future? At my internship, I feel nervous that I am doing everything wrong, I feel like a disappointment to my parents for not partying and having a true ""college experience"" when stuff like that makes me incredibly nervous. That my grades aren't perfect and I have a hard time talking to others, that college study abroad and my apartment are too expensive and I honestly don't think I am worth all of the efforts they have put in for me.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry if this is rambly but I just need some advice here, how do I stop feeling so guilty about everything, I just want to be happy fulfilled, and live comfortably. Am I asking for too much from the world? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you"

I want internships and work experience as an SWE so I can have a competitive starting salary when I graduate college to pay off debt etc (90k/yr since that's the average starting salary at my school).

Problem is, I will graduate in 2 years assuming I take the full-time student route. I have no experience aside from doing some minor game development (think games that take less than 10 minutes to complete) in C++ using Unreal Engine. Furthermore, I am an incoming freshman, meaning I have taken none of the higher level classes that internships usually look for in an applicant. I have done competitive programming in high school, although I never got anywhere with it.

&amp;#x200B;

What are some tips to increase my chances of getting internships? Should I do undergrad research, what kind of projects should I focus on, etc. Any sound advice would be appreciated."

Activities 4 and 5 are speculative but extremely likely. I have two hobbies I can put down for ecs.

Awards:

Honestly, not that significant. Since I'm in the top 3 students at my school, a Renton Rotary Student of the Month award from my district is very likely (top 10% of the class gets a chance). Everyone on this list is typically everyone in the top 10-12 of the senior class. I also have 100+ community service hours, so I'll get a silver medal.

\-   Invited to the National Academy of Future Scientists (apparently a lot of the top 10% in my class got this)

\-   Invited to attend the National Youth Forum at Georgia Tech &amp; Berkeley (one of those expensive programs you get in the mail for having a good GPA)

\-   Invited to attend Rice University's Aerospace &amp; Aviation Academy (same thing as before)

\-   National Honor Society Member (honestly, our NHS is kind of a joke. We use to do a lot of community service, but now NHS members just attend the induction ceremony and leaders help with planning the induction.

\-   Student of the Month: Academics, Stellar Attitude &amp; Results, AP Calculus BC, Physics A, Physics B, Chemistry, French 3, Algebra 2, Geometry, Algebra 1

Common App Essay:

&amp;#x200B;

Due to the pandemic, our robotics team missed out on our competition in my freshman and sophomore years, so I wanted to write about what competition was like as a first-year and inexperienced project manager and what I learned by being in a fast-paced, stressful, and competitive environment. In particular, how I carry the ideals of FIRST (gracious professionalism) when collaborating with others and how it's an environment I would like to be in for college.

&amp;#x200B;

Final Notes:

This is a repost. I've shared my college list before, but I want to get an idea of what would be realistic with my stats. I also come from a very underresourced school funded by title 1 grants (for context, two people last year got into t20s: MIT &amp; Brown. They had very very comparable stats except for the internships and independent project. I think their most notable ecs were FBLA/volunteering, All-state Orchestra &amp; Robotics), so I'm curious about how that plays a factor in my chances.

Please recommend a reach school(s) for early decision or restricted early action. Also, does it matter if my ecs aren't all related to physics? I literally couldn't find anything to my best ability over my junior year for opportunities in physics that weren't a) paid summer programs b) anywhere near where I lived. Thanks."

\#1 I am wondering that it is not possible to post my work in the GitHub since it is company confidential?

\#2 I have two sections in my resume. One is work experience and the other is project.

I am thinking to write about my summer internship and general description about it for my work experience section and also considering put the name of the project that I did at company and description of it for the project section. However, I am not sure if it is a good idea?

Should I just combine them and write the project as the description of my internship work experience? or should I split them as two different thing?

I'm really new to gamedev. I probably have no more than a few weeks of experience in this (I have started in september 2021 but couldn't really work on it), and I have began to learn using unity, thinking it was my best choice since it was at least/almost as popular as Unreal Engine but looked simpler for 2d games

In about 6 months, I'll have the possibility to realize an internship as an autoentrepreneur, and I want to develop games (I know it's risky but I still wanna try). Until now, I was quite confident in using Unity for that purpose

The thing is, with all the drama around Unity recently and some choices considered hazardous by a big part of the communty (e.g this video [https://youtu.be/R6xUVQKCsAk](https://youtu.be/R6xUVQKCsAk)) I'm affraid that it's not a safe bet anymore, and that the software will die eventually (in months or years) because of all those decisions that are considererd bad

I will probably keep on using Unity, at least to learn the basic concepts around gamedev because as far as I know it's still quite a good engine, but I wonder if I should change to something safer in the long term, like UE/godot/gamemaker

Hello! I am a current CE student at UIUC. I just finished my freshman year as a CE Major(I still have to take 220 cause reasons). I am incredibly passionate about technology, I have an internship at a big tech for this summer and also interviewing for next summer with offers close, as well as multiple certifications for cloud platforms and networking areas. BUT, and this is what I need help with, I hate CE. To be specific, I believe I strongly dislike the EE part of my major. I realized a bit too late into my freshman year that all my hobbies and interests align more, or completely with the CS side. Should I just stick it out with CE, after I get 210 done, I know I have the Big 4 courses to complete, and some of those are EE focused, but other ones focus on the CS side, but will I be forced to take other EE focused courses? I feel like everyone around me is just so far ahead and understands faster and better than me. I am a very hands on technical person, and can get a task done but when it comes to test taking and memorization I choke hard. I try my best but I can't seem to match them, and as such barely have above a 3.1, so a transfer to CS will never be approved. I know that transferring into CS is practically impossible and honestly I probably won't even try, but I was looking at CS + X. Do you guys have any recommendations on where to go or what to do? Other than talking to my counselor? : ) Your time is appreciated! Thank you!"

My social skills are complete garbage. My ability to retain material from my classes is garbage. For the career(s) I’m pursuing, it just feels like i’m way too dumb for them.

I created a Reddit account just to make this post and seek advice. I really feel like I'm on the brink here. 

I had a lot of difficulties while in University. Academically I was doing good but sometimes I struggled to fit in and had problems with finances. During my time at University I had to take quite a few Leaves of Absences due to personal reasons.

I loved what I was studying, I did fairly well in my class. I went from an Econ major to a double major in Econ and Math with a minor in CS. I didn't have a problem with the workload, I had some difficulties as mentioned above but I was ready to fight through it. 

During the pandemic, things really took a turn for the worse and after taking multiple Leaves of Absences it dawned on me that I wouldn't be able to graduate from University. University meant a lot to me, HS wasn't the best experience and I had determined to make University the perfect fresh start to a journey. 

As I took those LOAs a part of me knew that I wouldn't be able to graduate but I kept delaying the inevitable because I didn't want it to have such an awful ending. 

Sitting at home not being able to go to University was and has been incredibly painful. I have still tried to keep myself productive by working an odd job, staying healthy, and studying. I've kept myself productive for the past one and a half years and still kept studying. Looking up the syllabi of the classes I had planned to take and downloading the textbooks and studying by myself, getting to a near graduate level of knowledge in some topics and improving my coding skills everyday. However, I now feel like a complete idiot. 

I've dreamed of working in Data Science or Finance, but why would they hire a schmuck college dropout when they can just hire people coming fresh out of university? I'm now realizing that all I've done is completely waste my time. I always thought that I'd have this slim chance of still breaking into these industries but I don't think it's possible. 

I recently joined a consulting firm as an intern till December, I basically lied to them saying that I was on another LOA and since they're a small firm they didn't really give a damn. I don't mind the work at all and I'm happy to do it but the company culture is horrible and on average new employees leave within three months.

I'm going to try my best in not succumbing to the company and leaving because I don't know what i would do and even if I stay here till December I don't know what I would do after. I'm really out of solutions here. All of my friends are entering reputable Grad schools or have started working and here I am. I can't help but keep thinking how things would've been if my University experience had been normal. 

Due to certain reasons I can't get into, transferring to another school or formal education itself is out of the picture. 

I really don't know what to do. I keep going into a bad state every few days on what could've happened and what did happen. I keep thinking that time is running out and soon enough if I don't do something major then I'll be stuck in this state forever. 

I know I'll still keep fighting. But some days the pain from doubting and anxiety is the worst. I just need to figure a way out and need help on that front."

I'm in the worst phase of my life, constantly having suicidal thoughts and I started abusing ritalin, but I'm afraid to stop because currently it's the only thing that makes me get up and have motivation, I don't know what to do and the worst thing is to remember that it's all my fault. It's not ADHD, it's not anxiety, I can't complain about my family who always supported me. the fault is all mine. Please help."

Can you guys please help me decide which of these path to take, or if i should do something completely different? And if i do go into the field of game design how would you suggest I go about it.

Some idea i did have was to either make a proper 2D/3D rpg (however small/simple time allows it to be) to better understand unity. Another idea was to make a Pokemon rom hack to get an idea of game design and level design.

Situation:

Hello, I'm enrolled in MSc in business Analytics in France, and I will be graduating next year. So, during these vacations, I've been trying to upskill myself so I could start looking for opportunities asap. I've been looking over the internet, but most of the content is about processes, charts, etc that are used. I totally understand that these are important when you work, but as a newbie, who doesn't have a solid Business Analysis background, I don't think I could showcase these in my resume, which would be the only thing that'll get me my interview. Now, in France, language is a barrier for me as I don't speak French very well. I am still learning but I'm sure that it wouldn't be that good so soon. So I have been learning SQL, python, excel, and tableau so at least I could mention them in my resume.

Question:

What skills, tools, and things I should definitely work on, which I could showcase in my resume, or mention in the interview to land that opportunity. Also what are the projects I could do and mention them? I am also looking for the requirements of top companies like Amazon, they only demand some SQL knowledge and French and English skills. But I think it'll be a problem for me with the language, as well as my experience. Please suggest me things to look forward to, work upon, and companies I should target for better work-life balance with reasonable pay for an entry-level applicant. Any resume tips and job/internship hunting tips are welcome as well.

Also, is anybody working in any field of web 3.0 as a business analyst? I would just love to know which companies have such opportunities and I would love to work on web3 technologies. Also, talk about the relevant skill set and knowledge required for it.

Thank you in advance."

I did some side project but those are very basics. I only did one software with an UI and it's been more than one year now. I practically never program when I go home as I feel like I have many others passions and not as much time as needed.

 I am 27 years old and couldn't take a CS degree because of financial reasons. I was always into programming since I was 10 years old and found a way to mod video games. I self-studied Programming, DS / Algo, and Digital electronics without a cheat day for 5 years till 2 years back. I tried my best to use all the resources available on the free internet to minimize as much knowledge gap as possible, knew it is inevitable but wanted to reduce it. And then started learning JS and web development in general. Other than CS I was never really a good student.

I did all that while doing a boring petty job to financially support my family. But finally landed an internship after I finished studying application development in 2020. Then got a job and now I have 2 years of experience and earn almost 2X of the median salary for a Junior application developer in my nation. 

But now I think I am financially viable to study in a college/university and get a degree either remotely or regularly because my dream is to go abroad (do a master's) and make a life in another nation. 

But I am 28, and the whole process is making me nervous and even though I know I will have to make that jump. But I feel like I am too old to do any of that. Everyone I know is already there.

How to cope with this anxiety and/or overcome it?

Thanks for clicking on this. 

I am 28 years old, with a finance degree (BS), and have 6 years working in data science/data analytics in the financial services industry. Data science/analytics was never on my radar, until I got an internship for data analytics 6 years ago and I’ve stuck with it since. Apart from my work experience, I have no education or formal training to back up my technical skills for this field. 

I do not have any advanced education in higher math, nor do I have any experience in coding python, like a lot of my colleagues do. I am good at the coding (non-python) I do for work, but don’t really enjoy it. I have yet to be a “data science lead” or “senior level data scientist”, partly because I don’t think my skills are great. I only got a 20% salary jump last year because I switched companies.


However, recently, I was offered a position to become a product manager, within the financial services industry. I would be in charge of all credit card products for a small bank. I wouldn’t be coding as much, and the role would be more strategy focused. Are there any product managers out there who could potentially give me some advice or insight as to what potential future career paths could look like, if I took this job?! 

I’m concerned about future role opportunities (I feel like data science is a growing field — do I want to leave it? What would “growth” look like for product managers? I imagine job opportunities would be fewer). Likewise, if there are any data scientists or data analysts out there — any advice would be appreciated! Thank you!!!"

I am BSC student and during the first year of college I fell sick at the exam time due to Dengue which resulted in year back, in my college we only have yearly exams, next year COVID happened got promoted without exams, in second year studied just enough to get through the line, and was also able to do an internship for 6 months.

As the internship period was coming to and end I started applying for jobs for Front End Development and was able to land a role in a small Bengaluru based company, took my last year exams and was about to join but got to know that some of my exams are going to be postponed, my joining date was colliding with exams. Spoke to HR she was kind enough to let it pass but then again my college postponed the exams, this time I decided to leave the exams and join the company as financially we badly needed the money.

Now, I have missed the remaining exams and most probably will get another year back. Though my current company has not asked for degree. But my question is how will having two year back that too in a BSC degree will affect me, will I be able to grab good opportunities in the future or will it create difficulty for me if even if I have work experience to show?"

Since graduating \~3.5 years ago, I have been working at a FAANG company as a software engineer. I've had one promotion to SDE 2. I've been taking on more and more leadership responsibilities, ranging from internship mentoring, interviewing candidates, designing and owning new services for junior engineers to help implement, and other standard mid-level engineer duties. I feel my work experience demonstrates that I'm a strong performer.

However, my undergrad experience tells a different story. I attended an average state school where I majored in computer science. I struggled a lot my first 2 years with mental health problems, and performed very poorly in a lot of my classes, including some Ds and Fs. I didn't have much direction and was extremely unmotivated.

About halfway through college, I was able to mostly fix my problems and from then on had solid grades, including deans list multiple semesters. I joined a social fraternity and got involved with philanthrophy events on campus. I also secured internships every summer until graduating. I had to dedicate a LOT of time to make up for my past mistakes in order to even land a job at FAANG. My GPA after graduating was a 3.2, and my Major GPA was higher.

What are my chances at a top 10 MBA? I haven't taken the GMAT yet, so I can understand it's impossible to answer without that. However, I am trying to figure out if it's even a possibility before I start prioritizing scoring a high score on the GMAT. My reason for considering an MBA is I'm not interested in coding the rest of my life and trying to climb the SWE track (very difficult compared to roles in PM or consulting I believe)."

First one being that I put off some tough classes until this semester. I could get it done if I worked my ass off, but given that I will also be working on my senior project this semester, I would prefer if I didn't have a huge workload and half-ass my senior project. I want this thing to be done right.

Second reason is that I enjoy learning about CS. I just found out recently that I could take master's level courses as a undergrad. There are a couple that I have had my eyes on that I would absolutely love to take. Not to mention other undergrad courses that I haven't had the opportunity to take as well.

Third has to do with timing. I have no internship experience. Given that most hiring is done at the end of spring anyway, I would like to have more projects under my belt so I can market myself a little better by the time I graduate in the spring.

Lastly, I'd just like to say that I like being in college. I feel like I've really only been here for a year since I took the community college route + covid. I enjoy talking and meeting all different kinds of interesting people here. Maybe I'm wrong but I don't think I'll ever be in an environment like this again, so I'd like to enjoy my time here while I have it.

Being that it was my first business trip and I had never been to Vegas before, I was over the moon. However, now I’m starting to second guess my decision.

I want to note that this company is family owned and the company is very very very adamant on hiring from their own community. I won’t go into too much detail on said community but: 95% of the company is made up of this particular religious community. I am not part of the community and when I was going through the hiring process, they made it seem like this is a great honor b/c the company rarely goes against what their comfortable with. 

When I was finally hired, they only offered me hourly at 19/hr, which is not ideal b/c I live alone and have no support from parents or a S/O. But I was so afraid of not having a job right out of school that I took it right away. My biggest problem right now is that I feel like I might’ve shot myself in the foot b/c going to work just seems like a chore and I feel that I don’t have a chance on moving up or at least a slim chance b/c I’m considered an outsider.

I was looking into applying for internships or other jobs but I also feel that I might be being too hasty. What should I do?"

Am I the only one who feels uneasy returning full time to the team I interned with? I have LOVED all of my intern teams they’re super nice and helpful and have really helped me grow. however, at my last internship, I secretly told the conversion recruiter I don’t want to return full time to my specific team because I feel like I’ll always be viewed as the intern. I also am not too good with confrontation and voicing my opinions and I feel that my team will always consider me the “intern” and I won’t be able to excel and speak up. I’m having this same crisis at amazon currently, I love my team. My manager has indicated a full time return offer many times, but I just don’t think I would like to return and be considered the college student/intern for the rest of my career. The thing about amazon is I don’t think you can return full time to another team, but google you can. How to get over this fear, I think it’s holding me back ???"

w8tjq3,1,2022-07-26,How do I(20M) tell my parents I have started collecting die-cast cars again?,pekkauser,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/w8tjq3/how_do_i20m_tell_my_parents_i_have_started/,"Hello everyone. So basically after six years I started collecting toy cars again in February of this year. I did not expect to get back into it at all. I enjoy it but I have been having concerns since my parents don’t know at all about it and the fact I am keeping it a secret makes me stressed out. My collection is worth like 900-1000 dollars. I love my parents dearly, they’ve done so much for me so I have been trying to give back as much as I can a long the way. I’m also pretty emotionally open with them and I’m comfortable telling them how I feel.

I have many sub-issues within this main issue I want to tackle and I need help because the few people I’ve talked to haven’t given me much to work off of but they validated that my interest wasn’t weird so I don’t hold any ill will. Starting with the background on why it’s because I started collecting in like 2007(5M) when I was like five years old, then I stopped in 2012(10M). Then I started again late 2015(13M). Since I was a teenager my parents didn’t approve of me wanting to buy die-cast cars as they thought it was only a kid’s hobby. I ended up taking money from their wallets behind their back and using the excuse of buying snacks to go with my friend to stores to buy die-cast cars. This was because they only limited me to three cars a month while every new release many more came out that I liked (I know 13 year old me was terrible). Eventually I got caught red handed and lectured like hell. I deserved that because I learned not to steal from then on out. Gradually I lost interest in collecting and gave away my old collection in early 2016. 

I feel like the reason they were also judgy was because of how much of a dumbass I was in 8th grade. I was never an academic star and I hated studying so I only did enough to get by. They didn’t like seeing that and wanted me to do my best.

The first sub-issue I have is how to get it across to them this is helpful to my mental health. Basically since I started in my second semester of my second year of college I started getting more thoughts and fantasizing about having a fulfilling relationship as well as losing my V-card. I hated those fantasies because they felt so out of reach since I was too busy being stressed over school plus I have a history of being rejected by women. I didn’t know how to get advice since a lot of it was super garbage and nearly led me to fall into alt-right ideologies. Im also on the spectrum so a lot of my life I’ve struggled socially. And the way ethnic men are socialized, talking to women is another hard task. I talked with my mom about this stuff and she listened to me and was very helpful but I felt like the thoughts would always come back. I didn’t want to keep bothering her about it though she was very caring and asked after a lot of our conversations: “Are those fantasies still occurring?”. When I got back into collecting I felt like those negative thoughts I was having about the fantasies were disappearing since I would occupy those thoughts instead of what other cars I was trying to acquire for my collection. It felt like my mind was beginning to be at peace. I was happy when I found the cars I was looking for. Even better when I found something rare. I still have those fantasies every now and then but I’ve taken a more positive attitude to them in the form of “if I keep working on myself and being a good person, the right person will come.” I don’t know how to tell them this though without sounding dumb. I feel like if I let these emotions stay bottled up I would have done something rash like pay for a camgirl or a prostitute just to give me some sort of “romantic” interaction. There’s also the possibility of drugs and alcohol getting involved. And it would have been easy to do so. I’m at an internship and my rent isn’t too crazy so I have some money laying around. This may sound narcissistic and arrogant on my part but I take the fact I didn’t do stupid shit like this and instead invested in a hobby that doesn’t harm anyone as a sign of emotional maturity. I chose the path of a decent human instead of a possible druggie/incel/“nice guy” because that’s what I want to be and what the world needs more of.

The second issue I have is moving. I’m really afraid of my dad getting mad at me for needing to buy an extra moving box to accommodate my collection. He’s helped me so much financially and I’m very grateful for it so I don’t want to add more to him. A possible solution I had was setting aside some money from my check to pay for the extra moving boxes myself. Though I feel like he’d hate if I told him I would do that. This is because one time I got news my internship start would be delayed a week right after I moved into my temporary apartment. He had to pay my rent for that extra week I was there and I said when I got paid I’ll just give him back the money but he said he felt insulted I said that. Hell he said that’s the most disrespectful thing I’ve ever said to him. He wasn’t even angry he was just sad. So I apologized and we put that behind us. I feel like likely he will pay for it but he won’t be too happy about it. 

The last thing I am somewhat worried about is how I fund my collection. It mostly comes from selling old shoes and redeeming cash rewards as well as money from my internship. So technically it is my own money but I feel like they could argue in a way that I shouldn’t be using it for that. I don’t feel it’s even a bad thing at all since I made a rule for myself where I wouldn’t use more than 10% of my check each payment period for my collection. 

The main question I have is how do I articulate all of this to them? I’ve struggled with my emotions and getting them across properly for a lot of my life. I’m a grown man and I can make my own decisions. Best case scenario they understand perfectly but nag me a bit about my spending. Worst case they are incredibly disappointed I got back into collecting basically toys.

At that time I was an intern, who by documents worked for a partner company, that worked for Samsung, so it feels weird that they'd want me to sign something like NCA as I was just a small baby intern.

* How does it generally work?
* Does that mean that I will not be able to work at certain companies ever forever?
* If no then how long does it last usually?"

I am thinking about staying instead of moving back to my family because I don't want to get stressed by them.

Important backstory: Last year my mother suspected my father of cheating and started spying on him (e.g. having GPS on his car). She often asked me for help and advice and became very depressive during that time. She lost so much weight and talked about suicide or wanting to disappear from the world IN FRONT OF MY LITTLE SISTER. My parents would fight a lot and then pretend everything is normal for a few days, rinse and repeat. This affected all of us negatively and I was constantly stressed and sad, even thinking about ending my life.

I don't know how I managed to continue living there but since I moved out months ago,  I realized that I had never contacted them and don't miss them. I also ignore some of their calls, especially my father's. There's also the problem that my parents rely on me A LOT. They would push most of their responsibilities to me and I have to handle their problems, because they're immigrants and 'don't understand a thing'. So when I get a call from my mother, she always asks me for help or rants about my father. I get irritated during the calls and speak in a pissed way to her. But I always feel bad after the call ends and would start to cry a lot or have a mental breakdown. I'm even crying right now writing all of this.

If I stay here, I have to look for a job and a new home, since I don't want to rely on my parent's money and my current apartment is only temporary. I would also be in my last semester and have to work on my thesis while jobbing for money.

If I move back to my family, I don't have to worry about rent, money and food. But it's possible I would get stressed and cannot focus on my thesis.

What should I do? I am thankful for any kind of advice."

A little bit of background:  
Audit Intern at one of the Big 4 in London at UK&amp;I  
I have one more year at university left  
I do not like my time in Audit for a few reasons:

The work is very boring, I initially wanted to apply to Corporate Finance but I decided to go with Audit since I thought I would had higher chances of getting accepted.

My team works from home 90% of the time so I did not get to network with anyone from my team apart from the other Audit interns that come in everyday.

I have been doing a very good work and my close team members have given me very good feedback, but the work is very mundane and the worst of all is that after I had lunch with some interns from Corporate Finance they told me about all the outings they had with directors and partners (ice cream, food, coffee, drinks, which happen at least once a week), all the coffee chats they have been incentivized to have with different people, and the way more interesting work they have been doing.

Starting salaries for Corporate Finance graduates is currently £36k in London (according to company's website), which will increase after 2 years when their graduate scheme ends (another salary increase)

Meanwhile, after speaking to audit graduates, the starting graduate salary for audit is £30k, but people may say that the benefits come because of the qualification that makes you a certified accountant, which will lead you to make £45 - 50k after 3 hard years of doing boring grunt work, going through busy seasons, and having to study for 15 exams.

All of those reasons are what pisses me off, because I know very well that I could have been in that Corporate Finance position, I have raised my interest with the student recruitment team and as well as my managers, but student recruitment said that if we get to receive a graduate offer it will be in the same service line that we are working at.

I never had any client interaction, I was never taken to a client site (even other audit interns have been to at least once). The CF interns on the other hand go to in-person client meetings very frequently.

I do not know if I want to spend the next 3 years hating my life and hoping that I will get an opportunity to move to Corporate Finance after qualifying, even then it may not be possible since my company is planning to have a big split (you probably already know which firm I am talking about).

**I am starting to get a bit scared because it is harder to get a graduate scheme at a bank or in TAS/TS/Deals at other firms since most positions are being taken by interns.**

If you can give any sort of advice or words of hope, I would really appreciate it. My internship ends in 3 days.

If you managed to read all the way here, here is a piece of advice from this experience:

We used to get “good job” gift cards all the time to use on the brewery’s merch and food from the restaurant (both the food and merch were super expensive, but I liked them both so I was okay with in-house gift cards - as an underpaid, overworked employee I relied on this cards to feed me during 10+ hour shifts). We were also often forced to sell expired beer and told not to tell anyone about it, which is probably the worst thing they ever made us do. 

I was a valued employee, I was cross trained to work in pretty much every department and trained others as well, and I kept my mouth shut about the expired beer while I witnessed some other employees telling customers about it. 

I worked as a “second” manager in the merch store for about 6 months. There was another “senior” manager who worked remotely because she was in university, her aunt was also head of accounting. She would make the schedule, give herself all long weekends off and call me and other staff in on days off all the time. 

I was there 8am-9pm Monday-Saturday, and I began to realize that too much was expected of me. The last straw was when I found out the other manager was being paid more than me while only in-house once or twice a week. Instead of quitting entirely, I just demoted myself back to a regular employee… after that all of my bosses basically forgot my name and those good job gift cards stopped coming my way.

I went to school for graphic design but didn’t finish due to personal reasons. There was an opening in marketing for an internship (unpaid, by the way) so I went for it to gain experience. The head of marketing basically laughed me out of the door, told me unless I finished school I didn’t have a shot, and said he/the company didn’t trust me with all the social media account passwords(??) I was sad about it at the time because I had done some other side work for other local companies, and since this brewery is a huge attraction and gets a lot of eyes on their social media, I saw it as a huge opportunity for myself. It beat me up for a while, even after I had proven myself loyal and had worked there for over four years at the time. I quit shortly after that.

After I gave my notice, I no longer kept my mouth shut about the expired beer and told anyone who would listen and warned hundreds of customers not to buy it. Even encouraged the other employees to contact the labour board and the health inspectors, not sure if they ended up doing it or not though.

Fast forward to today - I found out from a current co worker that this brewery now has a “bring your own food” sign outside and a food truck parked outside 3 times a week because they can’t find servers and cooks who want to work for them. They literally don’t serve food four times a week because everyone in my city knows the owners are awful, the pay is bad, and the environment is toxic. I also saw the owner bussing tables and seating people the other day and he was sweating like you wouldn’t believe.

I now work for a government organization as a social media producer/graphic designer with full benefits and a $10/hr pay increase. 

Don’t break your back and bust yourself for a company who doesn’t trust you to have their passwords, when another company will and pay you more for it."
w90jy2,5,2022-07-26,Applying for CS programs as an ECE undergrad,jinks777,MSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/MSCS/comments/w90jy2/applying_for_cs_programs_as_an_ece_undergrad/,"TLDR: ECE undergrad. Not satisfying all prerequisites for MSCS programs in terms of courses studied during undergrad. Will my profile be instantly filtered out?

I'm trying to apply for CS programs in the US for fall 23. I have a B.E. (Bachelors in Engineering) degree in Electronics and Communications. I've noticed that a lot of programs (mainly looking at MSCS) have prerequisites for computer science based courses taken during an applicant's undergrad. My main question is whether these prerequisites are absolute and will my profile be instantly filtered out if I don't satisfy all of them?

A lot of programs ask for courses like operating systems and database management which I could not take during my undergrad and I don't think it matters whether or not I studied these topics on my own to the universities that I will be applying to. Some programs don't have a ton of prerequisites and some ask for equivalent work experience instead. These programs are what I'm considering for now.

I've always had an interest in computer science. It's just that things didn't work out exactly as planned when I was applying for my undergrad which is why I ended up in ECE.

Additional info:

- Currently working as a Data Scientist in an MNC. Current experience is about 12 months.
- I had taken 4 CS related courses in college. Not sure if the first 2 count since they were mandatory courses in our first year.
  - Fundamentals of Computing
  - Fundamentals of Computing Lab
  - Data Structures using C
  - Python Application Programming
- Have 2 ML related projects. Have one 6 month internship in the same MNC that I'm working in.
- Engineering mathematics for 4 semesters.
- No publications 
- Cgpa: 9.03
- GRE: 152V, 167Q, 4W

My plan for the last year has to be to spend the next 1.5yrs in grad school for EE, but the internship I have for the summer is offering me a very tempting other option.

The internship is at a startup with great growth, and they have essentially offered me a full time job starting whenever I want. I'd get equity plus the potential to move into a management position as they grow. I could do grad school part time and they would pay for the classes.

If it was just these two options, I think I would definitely just start working. However, there is one more thing giving me pause. My senior design project group has continued to work on our project, and we believe there is a great market for our product. I've been talking to customers in our industry and have received 5 letters of intent to purchase in the last month. I really don't want to miss out on this opportunity, and I have a feeling if I went to work full time it just wouldn't happen.

Any thoughts? I'm really conflicted, there's opportunity costs in every possibility."

I've been working for an electrical manufacturing corporation for 9 months (plus 3 months as an intern) as an IT associate analyst, basically doing site infrastructure support in a manufacturing plant (800 employees, over 400 computers) out of the hundreds plants the company has worldwide.

I just graduated from college (software engineering) and this is my first professional job out of college. To be honest, it's been a progressive learning curve between learning customer service, new technologies and support service, and messing up processes and learning while fixing them.

But now my boss wants me to take the responsibility of Change Manager of my entire country sites (over 20) which basically means I'd be in charge of managing changes to the IT infrastructure using the ITIL change management framework. This responsibility is currently under an IT senior analyst (over 10 years in the company), but since he's leaving the company in 1.5 months, they're looking for a replacement.

I have absolutely zero experience with change management, absolutely zero. I haven't even done my first change in my workplace, so I have no idea how would I be able to manage changes of over 20 sites.

I'm barely starting to feel confident in my current position and I really don't want to take over more responsibilities than I feel confident with yet. And this new responsibility does not come with a salary increase or title change, just the extra work. 

My boss is really a nice person and she says she thought about me for me to keep developing and progressing in the company, but I honestly feel it too rushed in and I just don't want it, I'm barely just starting to feel confident in what I do right now and want to keep learning about it before taking over harder responsibilities.

Am I in the wrong for wanting to decline the offer? I'm just afraid this could backfire in the future."

I've learned a lot so far and I'm willing to push myself to learn a lot more in the next year.

I've been lurking this sub for a long time (on another account) and I've been truly inspired to work hard so that I can land a job at Google or Facebook or some sort of HFT.

Background:
I am a rising junior in college in the US. I am double majoring in Environmental Studies (GIS focused) and Policy (ES focused) with a minor inData Science. I have recently taken a GIS intro course and loved it. I have always had an interest in maps (geography and cartography), as well as flags, and this
course really opened my eyes to it. I have also signed up for a remote sensing course the fall of my senior year (the description sounds right up my alley). I am also interested in statistics and data science. Creative and ingenuitive problem solving are two other skills that I possess. (Any good book recommendations on
previously mentioned topics would be greatly appreciated)

Internship:
I am struggling to find internships to apply for during the summer of 2023.
They all ask for certain specifications and experience that I do not have. I am
required to have an internship (policy related) in order to graduate with my policy degree and next summer (2023) is my time to do so. Ideally it would something that includes GIS with hints of policy so that department approves it for graduation requirements. Does anyone know of any organizations, departments, or other groups that
are in this relative field of study that I could reach out to?

Further Professional Life:
What computer programs should I self-teach that may be necessary in a
professional field? Or those that might be needed for applications to jobs?

Are there any more specific jobs or degree programs that you know of which fit the interests previously described?

What is the difference between a GIS/Remote Sensing Master's Degree and
a GIS certificate program?
O  In terms of relative rigor, time, and job/pay opportunities
O  I am looking into further education as it seems beneficial, interesting,
and I could use my final year of NCAA Athletic eligibility.

w94sq0,6,2022-07-27,Profile Review - Aerospace &amp; Defense,SchruteFarmsMBA,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/w94sq0/profile_review_aerospace_defense/,"Hello!

I am looking to target round 2 apps (maybe round 1 for some) this year for Fall 2023 entry, and wanted to get an idea of my chances.

Nationality: Canadian, Male  
Languages spoken: English and French  
GMAT: 660 (44Q/36V) --&gt; **Targeting round 2 so I can up this to \~720.**  
GPA: 3.5/4.3 (3.9/4.3 in the last two years --&gt; heaviest course load (in terms of quantity of courses and difficulty, deans list etc. etc.)  
Education: Double undergrad in Theoretical Physics and Mechanical Engineering  
Occupation: Aerospace Engineer  
Industry: Aerospace and Defense (Top 3 - Boeing, Lockheed, Raytheon etc.)  
Work ex: 3-3.5 years  


Extra-curriculars (just highlighting one for brevity, but I have quite a few to highlight in my apps):  


Passion for finance and investing; this led me to being involved with the investment club at my uni.  
I was then nominated to run the investment club; I became the first non-business student to ever run it.  


More than doubled attendance and organized networking events and presentations with professionals from varied fields in finance (IB, PE etc.). Gave stock pitches and generally explored my passion for finance and stock picking. This was quite the experience for me because I was the only Engineering student standing and presenting in front of &gt; 50 purely business/finance students talking about stocks and running our weekly meetings. On the flip side, I was able to get Engineering/STEM-heavy students excited about the world of finance and business, and I used my platform as President of the investment club to bridge the two 'Worlds' together with the aim of killing the 'engineers and scientists are awkward nerds who only like to hang out in a lab' stereotype.  


Employment:  
I joined my current job through being selected out of many (&gt;100) students for a leadership development rotational internship program (first of its kind at the time, 1 spot open at my company...I got it). I am in a very analytical and quantitatively heavy role but I am balancing that out by presenting frequently to executives, and chairing meetings for projects that I manage (significant financial impact). I am an extrovert by nature and thus I enjoy connecting with people and forging business relationships.  


My managers are aware of my ambitions to grow within the company and have received 1 promotion since joining. Promotions are slow in this line of business hence looking towards the MBA (I am aiming for executive leadership one day and have had 1-1 time with both the Chairman/CEO and President of my company), and my managers are actively preparing me for a management role in the future through giving me the lead in many key high visibility projects with many stakeholders and a significant financial impact to our division.  


Summary:

My goal is to attend business school so that I can fulfill my passion and curiosity for business, get a formal business education to complement my quant-heavy undergrads, and bring those skills back to my company and add value upon completion of my MBA. Promotions and the work in pure Engineering tends to be slow (as mentioned above). Looking to return, but to the operations or strategy side, where climbing the ladder is quicker, and the work is more fast-paced and 'big-picture'. 

Long-term: targeting a C-suite role in the aerospace-defense industry.

My feeling is that my background/industry experience is fairly unique, so I might have a decent shot...are my school choices realistic?

I am targeting schools such as HBS (really like their general management and case-method focus), Johnson, CBS, Rotman, Oxford Said, and LBS.  


What are my chances? And any other schools come to mind based on my goals?

Please assume that I can get the GMAT up to a 720; I seem to be hovering in that area in my practice tests.

Two of my coworkers made me cry,pizzahotsunspot,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/w94vtv/should_i_go_to_hr_two_of_my_coworkers_made_me_cry/,"Currently an intern at a large well known industrial company for the summer. The workplace is a textbook case of toxic work environment. I’ve seen 3 coworkers cry my first month. Some multiple times… My boss is the reason why, he’s abrasive, aggressive, bossy, and basically badgers people to getting what he wants them to do. He will spring things up last minute and expect the rest of his team deal with his demands. We had people get hurt and even die and he’s treated every situation very callously. He even made racist comments about my mentor/manage. He usually leaves his door open when telling someone off, which is often. My problem isn’t with him, since he’s been nothing but nice to me but a true pain for everyone he’s worked with. Not only that but he uses all of our morning meetings to talk about his agenda. In the meetings, he talks about how COVID isn’t around anymore and people need to stop being so soft. 

I was working on a project and I randomly bursted into tears at my desk. I genuinely didn’t feel it coming and nothing provoked it. I think it’s because of the work environment wearing down on me. Well, I have two coworkers in their mid-30’s who usually are nice to me but poke fun at me a lot. I went to the bathroom crying and one of them pointed out my face once I got back into the office saying “OH MY GODDD YOUR FACE!!” Nothing else. At this moment, Tears were welling up again so I walked quickly to the restroom. The other girl (manager) saw that I was crying and continued to make a comment about how I wasn’t being safe and to put my phone away in a playful tone. I no longer talk to these girls and avoid them everyday. One is a manager and the other her inferior but they act like besties and gossip all the time at work. They even gossip about the other half of the team which are two girls, calling them hoes or saying they are annoying. Am I overreacting to their comments by ignoring them? Should I go to HR? I’m discouraged about going since my boss has been at this company for a very long time and talks to everyone in an aggressive way. What will my comments do at at company like this who allows these people to be in their positions for so long in the first place?"

w96pv5,4,2022-07-27,It’s worth it :),napping-panda,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/w96pv5/its_worth_it/,"So I’ve been seeing a lot of horror stories about engineering and I wanted to share a success story-mostly due to the fact that I just graduated and I’m still sad :,) hopefully some of you will be able to relate to some parts and know that there is a light at the end of the tunnel.

I literally chose mechanical engineering because 1: I searched “degrees that will make you the most money” and engineering was always up there 2: not too bad at math (but not too great either) 3: im a woman and lastly 4: it looked interesting to me and I typically like a challenge. I loved telling people I was going to be an engineering major-it made me feel smart and powerful!

Now came the actual process of getting my degree, and I started off strong with a D in chemistry first semester during midterms. Long story short I though “oh f*ck what did I get myself into” every day of that semester. Another fear of mine was that everyone around me was Einstein-level smart and that I was the stupidest one there. But I put my pride aside and started asking questions in class, like literally whenever I didn’t understand something. That helped me A LOT and also after befriending some of my classmates I learned they were in the same boat as me. I got my grades up through study groups and homework sessions with others. I also got known as the girl who asks way too many questions, but a couple random classmates actually thanked me for this as they were confused also but too shy to ask. I started to enjoy the lab work and told myself that everything was doable.

The workload absolutely sucked sometimes, but the cool thing about humans is how adaptable we are. There’d be weeks of nonstop work and then some weeks of little to no work. Planning out my schedule and sticking with it really helped me. I found plenty of time to still go out and do other activities. Don’t get me wrong though, I am the WORST procrastinator. So what I’m trying to say is if I can do it, so can you!

I did struggle in a couple classes to the point where I was going to office hours but other than that I never failed a class or came close to failing. My end goal was to still get an awesome high paying job right out of college. However, I realized that I didn’t like my engineering internships and felt really stuck. However, that’s the beauty of engineering! I started looking into other industries and found that a majority of companies are always on the lookout of engineers, even some positions I’d never heard of had accepted engineering degrees. So, I looked into the consulting industry and got an offer/interviews with a ton of great companies. I think that being an EGR major made me stick out in a good way.

All in all, I made the best memories and best friends from majoring in engineering. I know everyone’s situation/experiences are different, but in my opinion is don’t listen to people saying that it’s impossible to major in STEM. I had a great experience full of ups and downs. I will never be happier than when my robot started to work or after finishing a code.

I leave for NYC soon as a person with a mechanical engineering degree 🥳  stick with engineering!! It’s such a reward getting a degree like this :)"

I'm majoring in computer science but I really want to work with robotics or anything of that nature. Any pointers are appreciated!"
w97fom,0,2022-07-27,Job prospects for a graduate with an overseas bachelor degree,Gounigo,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/w97fom/job_prospects_for_a_graduate_with_an_overseas/,"Hi all, I really want to get my first job after graduation in Singapore and would love to get some opinions about job prospects for me with the following background:

\- International student at a New Zealand university, decent GPA by graduation (Expected)

\- Tech relevant majors

\- A scholarship and few certificates of academic distinction

\- 2 internships (both are relevant to my major) on graduation

\- Some teaching assistant experience

My desired position: Graduate data analyst, business analyst, data/insights analyst, quant analyst, tech consultant, ERP consultant

As I'm not Singaporean therefore need a work permit/E Pass to work in Singapore and also I do not graduate from a university in Singapore, how hard will it be for me to get a job as a fresh grad? Will my chance to get a job be same as international students studying in Singapore universities or employers still prefer Singapore uni grads? 

Thank you all"
w98mbq,0,2022-07-27,Is a Post-Bacc in CS the right choice for me?,strengthandhappiness,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/w98mbq/is_a_postbacc_in_cs_the_right_choice_for_me/,"Hi guys,

I graduated with a BS in Biology from a large public uni with a less than stellar GPA around 4 years ago and have been working in a healthcare role (~65k salary in MCOL area) for a large retail company ever since. 

I found out a year or two after graduating that a programming career is what I really wanted, thus going down the self-taught path while working fulltime. Somewhat knowledgeable (but definitely not great) in Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and some SQL. Slowly realized that the most realistic way for me to get a job as a SWE/developer would be to go back to school to get a 2nd bachelors in CS.

Is a Post-Bacc the right choice for me? Bootcamp is the fastest option but most riskiest in terms of even getting a job afterwards and a masters (was looking into OMSCS) might be too difficult due to a lack of understanding of CS fundamentals and would take even longer to finish vs a Post-Bacc (~2-2.5 years I believe).

Heard some online Post-Bacc programs such as Oregon State University (OSU) but looking for other recs? 

Does school name or online degree matter? 

Is this worth quitting my current 65k job to just focus on school fulltime? Could work part time but goal would be to finish degree as fast as possible. Goal would be to apply for internships after 1st semester or as soon as possible.

Thank you for any help/advice I can get on this, greatly appreciate everything in advance. Thank you."

Code Redemption: You may not use any code purchased here on any site other than those associated with your purchase. Doing so will result in me requesting you pay the listed price of the second use of the code, and refusal to do so will result in a report to the mods of this subreddit. Any points or other bonuses associated with a code are not included with your purchase unless specified in the post.

""Should Port/Upgrade To 4K"" Codes: I make no guarantees regarding 4K ports/upgrades. If a code that should port/upgrade to 4K does not do so, I will direct you to the relevant support team. I can, in most cases, provide any photo(s) of the code insert and/or Blu-ray upon request if needed for a support team. I will only provide a refund if I cannot produce them upon request when needed for a support team.

Payment/Fees: I accept only USD through Venmo and PayPal Friends &amp; Family (F&amp;F). I do not cover any fee(s) associated with any purchase(s).

Doing so may result in a fee from PayPal. I do not accept eChecks. Failure to adhere to this rule may result in a loss of funds. I typically issue a partial refund in this case because PayPal charges fees that I cannot fully refund without losing money.

The setup: We connect two PCs via SerialPort

I didn't, i rejected them. they called me few times confirming the rejection. I told my friends that i didn't reject it tho and that i signed the contract cause i felt so ashamed. but right after rejecting the internship i felt this relief sort of?? i just smiled and felt a weight off my chest even though it was a goal i chased for months. i dont understand this. lets just hope i find a way to tell my friends before they find out themselves and scold me again (out of love lol)"
w9baae,1,2022-07-27,Partner company made a complain about my work,Kagerou2020,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/w9baae/partner_company_made_a_complain_about_my_work/,"I really need your advice so I'd appreciate it if you read this.

**About Myself:** So I'm in charge of student internship placements among other things (that's not even my main responsibility but I'm the only one working on it).

We have a mandatory 1 month internship for each junior year student (20 students a year, held in August)

I have to look for placements (mostly create new connections since we have no network since we are new), persuade them to accept an intern, and then persuade the student this placement will be good for him (no scam, I find good suitable places).

**Problem Zone:** Last year because of c\*\*\*na I had to postpone almost everyone's internship until this year.

This year a lot of companies cancelled the internship due to staff shortage because of c\*\*\*na. So This year I have to place around 40 students. In a country where an internship is not a thing (here an internship is literally a one day workshop), c\*\*\*na is still going strong, so you might guess how difficult it is to organize an internship.

So imagine, not the US or any Western country but imagine a country where an internship concept is mostly foreign, especially internship at an office, and yet you need to establish a brand new network and negotiate with not so willing companies, then persuade students that the company chosen for them is suitable (we don't have the luxury of offering several options so I look for a placement that most suits the students' needs), yet some students do not want t to intern at the proposed company simply because they don't like the name, or for any other stupid reason. Then place the student, check up on them, then follow up with the company. And still get a lot of complaints afterwards that they didn't get treated as normal employees.

**Reason for Complaint:** Last year I had to organize and reorganize, do the same work over and over again several times because of the c\*\*\*na because the university we work with suddenly said that they decided we can't do the internship because of big numbers of the infected.

This year I have so many students to place (around 40). This year's students will be interning in August as planned but for the previous year students, they are in their senior year now and very busy, and a lot of companies cancelled, so my communication with them has been really slow or no emails whatsoever, because I can't bring myself to tell them ""sorry, the company cancelled and I'm still looking for a new place"" while we don't have much time until their graduation left.

**Communication Issues:** Because of all this chaos, sometimes I'd forget to tell the student the company can't accept intern at his prefered period of time and I'll have to move it. So the student complained to the university office.

The university office complained to me (I'm an employee of a partner company).

Not only that, university asks me to regularly email the students even if I don't have an update, for example ""still waiting for this and this, will contact when there's an update"", otherwise ""they worry"".

Due to some companies, my growing anxieties and depression my communication in general has been slow, so  for some of the students the schedule has been decided 1-2 weeks before the start of the internship (but the students know it's August anyway, so they should have left it open in the first place no matter if they know the schedule or not).

For the previous year student I didn't communicate to him that the company refused his prefered time frame and offered November instead (contacted him only in July) to which he angrily complained he has thesis to write and why was there no communication.

**Conclusion:** On top of that I'd like to mention that my company had to lay off 95% of our employees in 2020 due to you know what, so we have only 4 people left. My future with the company has been hanging by a thread all these years and my boss has become rather rude towards me. Because of that I developed anxiety, severe depression, panic attacks.

And I informed my boss I'd be leaving come September because I found a new job.

Yet tomorrow we have a meeting with the university and they put the internship part on the agenda, so I suspect they're going to make an official complaint against me.

I own up to my mistakes, I know I could've done better but my company treasures its reputation beyond anything else in the world and just thinking about tomorrow makes me extremely anxious, considering that my boss has been very rude to me once I told her I'm leaving.

What do you think about the whole situation?

I just had another panic attack about the whole thing and I feel like 'm losing it and I'm not sure how to behave anymore and I just really can't wait to leave the company.

Sorry for the long explanation but I'd really appreciate a fresh opinion."

On the top right theres a picture of me which is marked up for privacy (having a picture on your cv is common in germany). On the top left there is my phone number email and name which is also marked up in the screenshot. I would be super thankful for anyone to take a look at my CV and get an opinion. Im quite sure about the order and format. But i dont know exactly if I presented my programming experience correctly. Thanks a lot in advance.

The first round consisted of a Teams meeting with the hiring manager where I was asked general questions about my projects and some common behavioral questions, followed by some technical questions about the language required for the job (C) and a coding question.

I was just emailed a schedule listing five interviewers' names and each of their designated interview time slots yesterday. I'm expected to interview with each person individually, back-to-back, for a total of 3 hours, and with no breaks in between.

I'm a new grad with (regretfully) no internship experience, and I'm a bit confused about why some companies choose to go with this format as opposed to a shorter, single interview with a panel of interviewers. Not sure what to expect since this is my first time going through such an (in my opinion) unnecessarily lengthy interview round.

Edit: Thanks for the helpful responses! As someone with ADHD and GAD, it's been a bit overwhelming as I'm currently interviewing with 4 different companies on top of wedding planning lol, but I think I've got this!"

Today I realised that the other interns have been asking for more projects on their own accord, taking up to 4-5 projects at once.

I’ve completed both my projects on time and tried my best to give high quality work, making sure my documentation for my code is sufficient etc.

I’m a bit worried that my company may give me a low evaluation score for my final review, seeing that other people complete 4-5 projects in the time I complete 2. Technically if i OT, work weekends, and not be so perfectionist, I can take on more projects too but I guess it’s too late. I guess it just didn’t occur to me that I should be actively asking for more projects since I was still doing my assigned projects (lesson learnt)

I’m just wondering if I will be viewed as someone who don’t take enough initiative at work?... since I didn’t ask for more work than what I was assigned .-.

As a small panel shop owner, and working in the automation field doing instruments and control panels for the last five years, and as a licensed electrician for the last 8 years, I’ve finally made the leap towards doing what I wanted to originally do anyways.  

1) All of the findings on working after agree point towards engineering internships that start out at like 16 bucks an hour… this would be almost a 60% reduction in pay from my day job. Is four years as an intern what most people do with an EE degree? Can my current design and controls experience contribute towards my PE?

2) Mixed signals from the market are giving me a hard time deciding whether EEs are in high demand, or whether it’s a super competitive job market. 

3) Any advice for a senior citizen doing an EE degree online? I’ve been out of the college game for over a decade and I’m a little nervous.

I have done 0 internships only LOR will be that of my Hod 

I am good with Dsa at best  (200-300 dsa on leetcode and pupil on codeforces) 

So the thing is I have sister in US and her opinion is that 

You have not done anything in 4 years in one year you are not getting workex from any top companies 

Might as well try it out here as you will save 1 year because at worst you will join at some low paying (relative)  cs/it job and you would gain 1 more year exp rather 

What concerns me is she was in like very good college
With 1.5 yrs of already workex but her argument is people from even worse college in right location and grinding out are doing better than her 

My question is 

1) is my goal wrong to pursue ms only for money and return ?

2)should I wait out 1 year or take my sister's advice ?

3) what more can I do in my next 18 months if I decide to wait out ?"

We're a small biz (about 500 users) and management (they're awesome!) is open to new ideas so I said ""Hey! Let's get an intern to help me out with this!"" and they're all for it. 

After viewing a couple internship posts on here it looks like it's all very cloud focused, but the internship would be geared towards working with automation projects - APIs, scripting C# and Python, and building locally hosted web apps for internal use. It would be great to have them help build out our DevOps infrastructure and policies that could grow into a full time job someday. I KNOW most students will have no idea what they're doing and expectations are super low... by the end of the internship I would hope to have helped them (help me hah!) complete a small automation project(s) that they can slap on their resume, and other great experience in the medical field. 

Would a CS major in Jr or Sr year find any value in that or is that pretty small potatoes compared to an internship at an enterprise level company? 

What's a good pay for a dev intern with little to no experience?

What perks would get your attention and bring the most value to an intern?"

Hey guys, I just graduated (Bachelor’s in Computer Science )in the spring of this year and now I’m planning on applying for a master’s (non-thesis) in Computer Science in United States. 


Currently my profile looks something like this.  My bachelors CGPA is 3.08/4.00 which equates to 77% from a well known Pakistani University. I’ve 2 internship experiences and I’m planning on taking the GRE by the end of August. My target score is about 315-320 and in my practice test I was able to get 310 and now I’m working on improving my score and doing some side projects. 


Currently I’ve shortlisted a few universities but I think they are very ambitious according to my profile. Can you guys let me know if indeed if they are too ambitious and if you can also recommend me some more universities to target, that would be very helpful. Additionally, If someone is studying in any of these universities, can you also give me a review on these as well?

Universities:
-Santa Clara University. 
-Stony Brooks University. 
-Northeastern University. 
-Illinois Institute of Technology. 
-Rutgers University - New Burnswick. 
-Purdue. 
-Cornell. 

P.S: Sorry if the editing of the post is weird. It’s because I’m on a mobile device."

I've liked all different courses I've had throughout university (networks, soft eng, databases, AI, data mining, android programming etc) however im still struggling to find the field in cs that makes me feel that im most attracted to and want to specialize in.

 I'm trying to make a decision since im thinking to go straight for a masters degree.

My latest interest is in Machine Learning where im doing my thesis in regards to Continual Learning on Mobile Devices. 

As a side thing, I experimented with ethical hacking for a couple of months as well as fiddling with unity during past summer and made like a small game but I lost interest on both.

Lastly, during my internships I tried again to see different fields. I've seen tech consulting as an alternative as well as a data &amp; analytics team which basically consisted of mathematicians and physicists with some training on programming.

However, im still undecided on what path in cs I should follow. Just a clarification, I love coding however I don't like the fact of being in front of a screen all day coding forever and that's what's making me skeptical of soft dev although I think that in higher positions you don't code that much but I'm unsure about it. 

If anyone could offer some advice or state their opinion it would be greatly appreciated.

w9lk6n,3,2022-07-27,Sincerely thinking about starting my own business,whosBlast,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/w9lk6n/sincerely_thinking_about_starting_my_own_business/,"I've always wanted to start my own business, and have been working to gather money to be able to do so, I'm still young (23M). I still don't have nearly enough (1k in bank) due to several personal issues during this year. I have a steady job where I've always been felt welcome and the environment is great, salary is not the best but it's the worst either, can do pretty much what I want and still save some every month.

Recently though, something happenned that's making me consider leaving my job asap... but have been struggling to see where to. Let's start from the begginning:

In December, I told HR I was unhappy there, as I was doing pretty much the same thing every single day, and I get bored quick. The HR manager is someone I really look up to, is really humane and very friendly. I asked if there was any solution to this, that I'd be flexible to whatever he could come up with, and offered some options to change department too as we are growing very fast, but all got rejected as they hired me for this position because they needed someone there. Fair enough. I knew what I was coming in for when I started this job, but having graduated during the pandemic in Hospitality, there wasn't much available, and I only got this job because I had been here as an intern before and my bosses really enjoyed the work I did. 

During this year and since then, without any additional investment and with the only rising costs being inflation-based, I brought the company  more than 4M€, while they are paying me €24k annually... I always thought I deserved more, but my supervisor said that I already got 2 raises during the last year (after netting them a great amount too, went from 20k to 22k to 24k) while everyone else just got 1.

They recently hired a 40F to my department, which I was in charge of training, and she doesn't want to learn. Everyone in my department has tried and failed, and she's more of a cost than a source of income, but she's getting paid the same as me. I still accepted the situation, but have started looking at other jobs to see if maybe I could get something better, but haven't even managed to get an interview.

Now what really crossed the line for me was the following the situation:

My manager is 6 months pregnant and will soon leave for maternity leave. She always told me that someone would be coming to our department to add to the team at the same level we are, as we are adding more hotels to our portfolio and someone will need to be in charge of them. Now this monday, the company's owner had a meeting with HR and my manager, saying that if the person coming is at the same level as me and my colleagues, then there was no point for my manager to come back after she has a child. So they PROMOTED the new person with a BETTER pay and she will be in charge of us during my manager's absence. This person went through the whole recruiting process ready to take into a position, and she has been promoted without even being here already, while one of my colleagues and I have been working hard for 2 years, have pretty much made this department from scratch with the help of my manager (She was alone when I first joined), we have made the company MILLIONS and we're still only in July, and there was no pay bump or promotion for us.

I really believe I can start my own company now but don't have the money to start, and can't find another job that pays me a bit better (I'm asking for 30k, been lowering to 28k recently but still no dice...)

This is mostly to vent, but would love to hear some advice before I just lose faith in everything

TLDR; Made the company 4M€ and we're still only in July, getting paid 24k€, can't find anything better, don't know what to do"

w9mvkt,2,2022-07-27,Am I stupid for delaying my graduation?,Kenisis24,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/w9mvkt/am_i_stupid_for_delaying_my_graduation/,"Hello everyone, I am torn between making this decision and need to hear other peoples thoughts on my current situation. I was planning to graduate this fall, although I've been seriously considering delaying my graduation until the end of spring for  various reasons.

First one being  that I put off some tough classes until this semester. I could get it  done if I worked my ass off, but given that I will also be working on my  senior project this semester, I would prefer if I didn't have a huge  workload and half-ass my senior project. I want this thing to be done  right.

Second reason is that I  enjoy learning about CS. I just found out recently that I could take  master's level courses as a undergrad. There are a couple that I have  had my eyes on that I would absolutely love to take. Not to mention  other undergrad courses that I haven't had the opportunity to take as  well.

Third has to do with timing.  I have no internship experience. Given that most hiring is done at the  end of spring anyway, I would like to have more projects under my belt  so I can market myself a little better by the time I graduate in the  spring.

Lastly, I'd just like to  say that I like being in college. I feel like I've really only been here  for a year since I took the community college route + covid. I enjoy  talking and meeting all different kinds of interesting people here.  Maybe I'm wrong but I don't think I'll ever be in an environment like  this again, so I'd like to enjoy my time here while I have it.

Truth be told, I feel dumb for asking this in the first place, but this major has gotten me used to asking dumb questions so screw it. What do you guys think? Given my situation, is it worth delaying my graduation another semester?

tldr; No internship experience, heavy load if graduating this semester, could use the extra time to better market myself."

w9n28k,1,2022-07-27,Is it possible to pass data from a python file to a javascript file without using flask?,stuffingmybrain,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/w9n28k/is_it_possible_to_pass_data_from_a_python_file_to/,"I'm in an internship where (for whatever reason) the codebase for this internal analytics website does not use a standard framework like flask or django. Instead, someone created their own `HTMLReporter`class with its own methods like `render_html`. I don't really care about this, but one of the things I've been trying to do (for way too long) is make a bar chart and display it on the webpage. The data from the bar chart is returned by a python file where some data wrangling happens. 

At first, I just made a plot in python, saved the image, and then embedded it in the html but this didn't work for more complex images, and some of the axis labels were cut off. So I've been trying to pass the data for the barplot to a javascript file that renders a barplot and I'm completely lost at this point. 

With a framework like Flask - I could've done something like `render_template(..., ..., data=data)` and use jinja2 inside a `&lt;script&gt;` to get it done. But this custom class doesn't have that functionality. 

- I tried using the json-script template tag [as described here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/templates/builtins/#json-script) but that just gives me this error: 
```
... {{ barplot_data|json_script:""plot-data"" }}
jinja2.exceptions.TemplateSyntaxError: expected token 'end of print statement', got ':'
```

- I also tried using a python package like plotly or dash, but they seem to require me to host the plot on a public website before embedding it into html and I can't do that since the data used here is sensitive. 

- I'm right now trying to parse the json file with the javascript itself. I'm running into a bunch of incorrect-path issues, and trying to resolve them. 

I'm just thinking that there's gotta be an easier way to do this... right?"

My plan then is to do a 4 Week Internship in summer and then again in winter (depending on how busy I am). Ofc this internship will only be to check out a possible job and stuff and see what I can do.

w9p3sl,24,2022-07-27,Red flags or am I spoiled?,alexandervolk,consulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/w9p3sl/red_flags_or_am_i_spoiled/,"I joined a small tech consulting boutique in April as a Senior Manager to lead a marquee project for the next 2 to 3 years. Previously I was Director at a marketing agency of roughly comparable size. I had an equal offer from Avanade on the table at the same time but chose the boutique to avoid ""corporate culture""

While the money is slightly better at the consulting firm, there have been some annoyances which - while not total dealbreakers - have at least made me concerned if I've made the right choice:

1. They seem overly strict, even stingy with any working material like hardware, phones and their car policy. At SM level I was expecting to have a little more sway in choosing my work equipment as well as generally not getting some janky hand-me-down laptop and phone. 
Instead I had to fight to get a more up to date laptop and I'm using a three year old iphone that someone else left behind when they left. 
Also their car policy is completely ass-backwards and doesn't reward getting an EV, doesn't represent current market prices and would basically barely allow me to get something the size of a shoebox. 

2. The owner and CEO has been in the industry for almost 30 years but is a very eccentric figure, which can sometimes manifest as rudeness or at least lack of tact towards his employees

3. In my time here, several projects had to be rescued from the brink of client cancellation because of bad quality. Sometimes these rescue attempts are unsuccessful. They're constantly understaffed and are filling up the ranks with interns and working students instead of experienced hires. The partner I'm working with seems to be constantly doing crisis management instead of meaningful work. 

4. The project I was brought in for isn't even completely sold to the client yet. I have to help pitch each stage of the project to the client. During the hiring process I was led to believe that it's all greenlit already and all I had to do was execute it well. 

So I'm wondering... Is this just culture shock and I'm not really used to being new at a job anymore? Do I simply toughen up and hang tight until I've developed a certain standing at the company? But also, is this just an unprofessionally run company full of red flags and I should run for the hills while I can?"
w9p8l2,69,2022-07-27,How to Prepare for Your Freshman Year of College,creativequeenz,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/w9p8l2/how_to_prepare_for_your_freshman_year_of_college/,"I'm a rising sophomore and I'm bored. So I'm writing a series of reddit posts about freshman year advice called ""A Sophomore's Input"". Here is post #1.

5 tips :)

1. **Take a deep look through your university website.**

Your university website is such a great resource that many students do not fully take advantage of. You can find information about academics, student opportunities (jobs, undergraduate research, fellowships, study abroad, etc.), events in the fall semester (career fairs, school traditions, etc.) free student resources (like free therapy or free tutoring), student clubs/organizations, and more. It's so nice to already have an idea of what your school offers before you come. I've noticed that a lot of  these programs aren't mentioned anywhere but on the website.

2. **Try to become more independent.**

Learn how to cook basic meals, do your laundry, manage a debit or credit card, and start budgeting. Learn proper email etiquette. Learn how to clean. Learn basic first aid. Maybe even learn how to drive. It's a lot easier to learn those things when you're at home and you can ask your parents for help than when you're at college and you're trying to figure it out on top of your busy schedule.

3. **Get connected with your class group chat and university social media pages if you haven't already.**

Those are great places to ask questions and find out more information about your school before you go. Some people have even made friends through these groups (although I didn’t). See if you can possibly connect with the upperclassmen at your school. They can help you when it comes to which classes to take, professors to avoid, opportunities to apply for, how to manage your college life better, and more.

4. **Spend time with your family and friends.**

If you’re going to college far away then you probably won’t get to see them very often. Homesickness is real and people don’t really talk about it. Just try to make the most of your time at home because when you move away you’re going to realize that you took certain things for granted. For example, getting sick in college is extra hard because 1. you’re still expected to do all of your work even when you feel horrible and 2. you don’t have your parents there to give you medicine and herbal tea. You will miss homecooked food. You will miss your pets. Even if you are going to college to escape you will probably miss the familiarity of the space that you grew up in and the comfort of your hometown. When you move to a new place you have to reestablish that feeling of home. But once you do it’s great. In fact, I found that when I came back home I would miss being at college.

5. **Consider making a resume.**

You definitely don’t have to do this but you might see a job, a club, or a volunteering opportunity that you want to apply for and it's a lot easier if you have a resume already. That way you can just tailor it to your application. My school uses a website that has a list of jobs and internships for students and recent grads. Having a resume and uploading it onto the website makes it a lot easier when you want to apply for something. Look to your school's career center website first for a good resume template.

**tl/dr**

Look through your university's website, try to become more independent, get connected with your class group chat and your university's social media pages, spend more time with family and friends, and consider making a resume.

Good luck freshman!"

This summer I got a computational project for an internship and really got interested in programming. I might do something like Computational Physics or maybe even consider development as a career. Thing is, I suck at programming and have not done as well as I wanted to in my first programming course (which was in C) which I took in my first semester about two years ago (compared to my math and physics grades, cs grade just sucked). This project made me learn some C++ but I think its far from what a 'programmer' needs to know. My question is how do I get started? Like what would be the best resources to learn from, best ways to pick stuff up, etc. I do some stuff in Mathematica, Matlab, Python and use packages like MatPlotLib and SciPy regularly. My immediate goal is to just become better at programming in general and being able to do things like Competitive Programming (I looked it up over the summer as well, basically if I encounter something that I cannot do, it interests me even more). The language that I'm currently practicing is C++.

Also a word of advice.,False_Bodybuilder_10,TransferToTop25,https://www.reddit.com/r/TransferToTop25/comments/w9tjm2/followup_to_t50_odds_posta_few_more_questions/,"I made a post about a week ago concerning the potential for any T50s since I bombed out of community college 3 years ago with a .5 gpa after a year and some change (7 Fs, a B, and a D.) Well it turns out that I have to go back and get my academic standing changed to in good standing since even though I withdrew the transcript still shows academic suspension. So now I’m planning on taking 3 classes there along with my normal 4 at the current community college I’m attending. The only problem I have is that I have to get to at least an overall gpa of 2.0 to have standing changed unless I use academic renewal which limits the possibility of changing more old Fs to Cs. A word of advice to those who are in a similar situation it may make sense to attend your former school rather than just start over. My total possible gpa after AA degree from current school plus the averaged transcript grades is now 3.12 vs 3.27 if I went back and repeated all courses. Not that it matters anyways. 

So now once I get my standing in order, I’ll be able to transfer as a junior with an overall gpa of 3.12 (academic renewal not included)/(3.85 institutional) and obviously the bad (but slightly better) transcript following me. If I try to transfer as a second semester sophomore my overall gpa is a 3.01(AR not included)/ (institutional 3.82). 3rd semester soph preferred for internship possibilities. ECs are volunteering, potential SGA treasurer spot, work, self taught python/R and self taught financial modeling. May try to do something else but time is a constraint at a certain point. 

My new questions are as follows: A. Does a mid term report get calculated for gpa as a transfer? B. Obviously HYP are out. Is Dartmouth/Cornell/Columbia GS/Brown Rue a possibility or not even worth wasting app $?C. How important are ECs, Essays, fin aid need, and does age help?

If anyone could help me devise a list of potential reasonable options for transfer so I don’t drop 2 grand on app fees lmk I’ll gladly buy someone lunch. Thanks so much

w9tubn,0,2022-07-27,What's the process like to move to the States? How hard is it for Canadian devs?,refep,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/w9tubn/whats_the_process_like_to_move_to_the_states_how/,"Hey everyone,

I have some questions about how hard it is for Canadian devs to move south of the border. Given the vastly disproportionate salaries and the fact that owning a house here is a pipe dream, I've long been interested in moving to the US. I've been doing some research and honestly it seems like the US immigration system is designed to keep as many people out of their country as possible haha. There don't seem to be a lot of channels through which Canadians can easily immigrate to the States.

I was researching getting a TN visa, but I do not have a degree in Engineering. My BSc is in Computer Science, from the University of Toronto. It seems that TN visas only apply if you are an engineer, or a ""Computer Systems Analyst"" whatever that's supposed to mean. The H1B process is probably the way to go then, but I've looked and it seems to be a lottery? Based on your country of birth? I'm a naturalized citizen, so the H1B might prove difficult to get if that's the case.

I'm also exploring getting a Master's degree from the US. I don't particularly want a master's, but I'm open to it if it will provide a pathway towards citizenship.

I'm not an experienced dev either, so I don't qualify as a skilled worker (I think those require 5 years of work experience? I have like 2 months + internships lol). I suppose the easiest way to get into the states is to leetcode my ass off and get a FAANG offer, but more and more of those are remote now, and plus, I don't even know if you can transition from a work visa to green card.

Any insight would be greatly appreciated. Thanks."

w9yeoi,1,2022-07-27,Seeking Career Advice,anasp1,quant,https://www.reddit.com/r/quant/comments/w9yeoi/seeking_career_advice/,"Hi folks,

&amp;#x200B;

Background:

Currently a 5th year in a 4+1 program (B.S. Biomedical Engineering, M.S. Biomedical Data Science and Modeling) at a small technical private university in Chicago, Illinois. I graduate Spring 2023 with my B.S. in BME, M.S. Biomed. Data Science &amp; Modeling and a minor in AI. My GPA is solid throughout the board with 3.7 in B.S. and a current 4.0 in my M.S. program (w/ a 3.8 in my minor). I'm on my third internship when it comes to applying what I've learned (machine learning &amp; data science at a big telecommunications &amp; defense company in California).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm very passionate about trading and machine learning and want to blend the two together. For example, in my free-time I am always back-testing and forward-testing (live-trading) strategies in the Forex market. Currently I'm funded (small account) with a proprietary firm (MyForexFunds).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm seeking genuine career advice, I want to take on the challenge and become a quant, but I don't know exactly what I should aim for, before I start my rigorous studying (which will consist of me grinding coding, working on projects on the side to beef up my resume, and of-course deep-diving into probability, statistics, and the math required for this industry). I consider myself to be at an OKAY standing when it comes to probability, statistics, and math and consider myself an OKAY coder and a sub-par trader (just started Forex trading \~7 months ago). I know what lies ahead (countless nights of me grinding leetcode, pulling my hair out with brain-teasers, and A LOT of math, statistics, and probability) and I'm excited and want to get started on all of this.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just not sure what to aim for, a quant trader? or a quant researcher? I've gotten interviews in the past for ML Algo Development Internships at a proprietary trading firm in Chicago, but the technical assessment was very difficult.

&amp;#x200B;

With my background in mind, what advice do you guys have when it comes to career outlook? I love trading and the markets and I want to apply my knowledge of machine learning, data science, and trading to it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, what resources would you guys recommend for me?

&amp;#x200B;

tldr: Finishing up school soon and am unsure as to what path of quant to go down given my current skillset and passion."

He doesn't have a lot of professional software engineering experience, pretty limited to an internship and startups that we've worked on together (I'm a PM), but has security experience. He has been interviewing as much as practical since May with no offers.

He did an interview prep course to try to land a software engineering job, but it hasn't led to the expected outcome. 

I really feel like it's a loss that companies won't share feedback on how to improve. There's no feedback loop on his side. 

He's putting a lot of effort into interviewing - we both have 2 full time jobs and are watching our kids. Once he lands a new job, we're hoping to go down to 1 job.

How can I best encourage or help him?"

wa1uni,174,2022-07-28,"Finally got a job with no internship experience, heres what I did.",offshoes,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/wa1uni/finally_got_a_job_with_no_internship_experience/,"I graduated from an OK university in May, so around three months ago, with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. I was really dumb during my time in college and while I got good grades, I didn't do any internships. Literally the only thing I've done was TA for an introductory Java programming class. It took a lot for me to finally find a role, and a combination of some luck and what I've learned from this subreddit helped me achieve that. Here is some of my advice:

1. Please, do yourself a favor and don't slack off in college like I did. GET INTERNSHIPS. Everybody I know who got a job quickly after graduation either had previous internship experience or converted to full time from their internship. I believe it makes it infinitely easier to get interviews with that experience on your resume. The entry level market for devs with no experience, from what I've seen, is pretty awful. I was competing with people with CS degrees and multiple internships under their belt.
2. With no work experience, what did I fill my resume with? The answer is projects. I was doing nothing for months post-college except looking for roles and applying. I would take several hours a day to work on some personal projects that were not simple, but larger applications with many different parts. I also made sure to keep my GitHub profile clean, meaning clean commits with good commit messages, unit tests for all my projects, and I also made sure to always setup some sort of CI/CD pipeline for my projects and deploy it to some cloud platform. This allowed me to fill more bullet points about each project in my resume. I also had a couple of school projects posted to my GitHub, but only put one of the more impressive ones in my resume.
3. Along with making my projects, I would set aside time to study some DS&amp;A. I am nowhere near good at leet code, but I could implement all the well known data structures, understand the advantages/disadvantages of performing certain operations in them, and use them to solve some pretty basic problems. I'd say I'm able to do most leet code easy problems in a relatively quick time frame.
4. The first few months of applying, my resume was terrible. I mean absolutely horrid. I actually think this is one of the biggest reasons my job search took so long. If I were a recruiter or hiring manager looking at the resume I used to apply with I would personally call me up and roast me. Find a good resume format that is clean, simple, and not too flashy. I'd recommend taking a look at some of the resume formats on Overleaf.
5. I applied to everything that was even in the realm of entry level. Anything with less than three years of experience, had some sort of words like ""junior"" or ""associate"", and anything with technologies that I have worked with in the past, I applied to. I must have sent out hundreds of applications. I did not change my resume for every job listing, but I hear often that this is a good strategy (but I'm not sure).
6. Be real during the interview. I didn't pretend to try to be some computer science wizard who sits at his computer coding for sixteen hours a day. I tried to make the interviewer laugh, relate on a personal level with them, and be generally relaxed and outgoing. When I didn't know something they asked me about, I would be upfront about it. I would then either go about explaining how I would try to figure it out and ask them to please explain the concept to me. Be interested and show that you're willing to learn, I think this is one of the most valuable soft skills to have."

I feel like I’m in way over my head and that I won’t have time to do an internship alongside my studies once college starts. I want to quit by September 30th but am scared as to what she would say/what would happen if I don’t stick it out for 6 months (I’ve been working for ~2 months now and quitting in September would make it a total of 4 months).

I'm the guy who kept posting alternatives to Lenovo Legion! Despite the awkward 3 storages position and limitations (all the 3 are maxed at 1TB), I've decided to take Ideapad Gaming 3 with 16GB of RAM because of the better performance in gaming and it's 20$ cheaper than the Legion R5 5600H + RTX 3050 combo in Indonesia!

However, I still can't decide because of the battery and processor. Since I'm a college student now, I'm gonna do a lot of my tasks on my laptop (of course) and even though I'll mostly do it at my home, there are times where I need to go out and by the end of the last semester there's a program here where I need to do Internship program and report it! 


I'm very interested in both because it offers three different things:

1. The new i5 absolutely crushes Ryzen 5 in everything except performance, even beating 6th gen. 
2. The Ryzen model has the better RTX, it's a 90W-95W 3060 while the i5 is only the default 80W RTX 3050. Unlike the processors, the 3060 has 40%-50% better advantage than the 3050ti. So it's a few percent more than the default 3050.
3. The battery in Ryzen is 60Wh while as Intel is surprisingly low with 45Wh.


Although I would use it mostly for gaming and tasks (Word, AutoCAD, Eagle, etc.) I still am very concerned with my battery life because I know I'll take the laptop everywhere when needed. Which one of those two models should I pick? Or do you guys have any other brand suggestions? My budget is only up to around 1130$ now."

I have a chance to pursue an opportunity to join a growing cyber security company. It's an internship, which is exactly the type of entry point I'm looking for. The position would be related to **joining a Red Team**. I'm a Cloud Engineer, with skills in Software Engineering. I have experience hardening clouds, permissions, roles, VM's, building API's, etc... Not at a large scale, but enough to be competent.

I would seriously love to score this one, just would love some guidance from specialists in the field.

What are some topics I should study on apart from **OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities**?

Perhaps we can started a thread which others would find useful as well."

I decided to quit my internship at a large non-profit a while back and wanted to share my experiences in case it could encourage someone else to recognize their worth and move on to something better. 

To be honest, a few weeks out, and I'm not positive if I'm happier for it mainly because the switch required me to go back home to California, and I was much happier in New York. However, I am happy that I quit the internship because I felt mistreated and dismal that something pure like a non-profit could have questionable tactics and materialistic ends. 

I made a video about it if you were curious about my experience: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxjJsRXj\_8&amp;t=7s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZxjJsRXj_8&amp;t=7s)"

I don’t have any desire to find an adult job because corporate America is draining. I’m angry that I never got the chance to study abroad during undergrad, thanks to COVID. I’m angry about being physically assaulted and no one caring. I’m frustrated that I couldn’t find cool internships or job post grad. I’m irate because my life is so unbelievably awful and I truly believe it wasn’t supposed to be like this. 

For the past 7 months, I have been fighting for a better life, but it’s not working and I don’t have any supporters. Today, I started thinking about killing myself again.

wai7d8,1,2022-07-28,How to work for myself,_itsAdoozy_,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/wai7d8/how_to_work_for_myself/,"Hey, I want to start off by saying I'm trying not to get too rant-y with this, and am genuinely looking for advice and opinions on what to do. **Essentially, I'm fed up with the industry I work in and want to be my own boss and work for myself.**

Some background on me: I have a Master's degree in Aerospace Engineering from a decent school, but tons of student debt that I have to start paying off soon. Right now, I work for 20$/hour and benefits, but its not really doing work that relates to my degree. Because of this, it seems that no one in the industry wants to hire me when they see that I have a graduate degree but no relevant experience, so I can't get any relevant experience (the classic conundrum we find ourselves in). I've had internships at big DoD contactors but would rather bash my head into a wall than go work for them again, so that's not really an option. 

In my brain that leaves me the following job opportunities that relate to my degree and interests. 

1) Work for a small startup - There's not a ton of jobs here, and all of the jobs that I see posted require a decent amount of highly specialized experience, which I don't have and can't get. 

2) Academia - I work in a research lab now but like I said earlier, the wage I get paid is barely survivable, and there's not a lot of career growth opportunities unless I get a PhD. Now, that is something that interests me as I love what I study and think it can benefit the world as a whole, but I don't really know how to go about applying to PhD programs with not a lot of specialized experience in the field. 

3) The final option and the one I want the most advice on, become a freelance engineer/analyst and work for myself. I don't even really know if this is possible because I've never heard of anyone doing it pretty soon out of school, but it seems like it would solve a lot of the issues I'm coming across in that I am creating my own opportunity to gain experience, and I could choose the problems I want to solve and work on. But, I have no idea how I would go about starting that (making a business plan, healthcare which is very important bc I have a chronic illness, marketing myself, gaining clients etc..)

I'm quickly losing hope that I'll be able to have a fulfilling career and also be able to pay my bills, so any advice and help is appreciated."

wainry,1,2022-07-28,the best college pathway?,Dissociativebri,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/wainry/the_best_college_pathway/,"my 16th birthday is soon, I want to study computer science and communications. doing ux/ui and web design and cyber security on my own. i love languages and have a goal of 5 in the next 5 years. im  an American citizen btw, my mom moved us abroad and now our lease is up and mexico and facing a move again. we just had our visa renewal but i cannot work or study here.

 and so far, i have 6 pathways that i can think of

1) we move and i attend high school back in the states take aps the sat &gt; apply to uni im interested in universities in california, not the ucs &gt; finish with a job offer hopefully in Seattle or remote. as i dont want to work in the bay area. this will be the most expensive option that takes the longest time and i don't have room for errors.

2) we move i attend high school, take ap and sat &gt; attend community college &gt; transfer out of state to university &gt; continue plan like above, get a job, aiming for internships sophomore year and up but i have a bf who wants to move from New York to either texas or Sacramento. so when im 18 and a junior i can move with him (not counting it as an option right now it's just a consideration) im from texas looking at cali but im not closed to moving with him in texas either, i just been all over texas idc for it much.

3) we move back, I excel in school, junior year apply for Questbridge Prep Scholar Senior year apply for Questbridge college match for Stanford and apply outside QB CSUs or UCD or UCB.

4) move back, &gt; apply for Questbridge National Match and risk it. Still Apply to mentioned schools.

5) we dont move and i get my ged costs about $200 &gt; community college i save up my refunds since i wont be able to work &gt; transfer to university as mentioned &gt; get a part time job or random freelance projects &gt; graduate and work

6) the cheapest option, ged $200 &gt; take cleps and other college  credits $5  a credit &gt; transfer to an online university graduate in 2 semesters or less.

the problems with #6 ill still be home and home could  be still in mexico or back in texas, but i wont be making any money. that means i wont be able to establish credit and move out.

Also the colleges  that accept clep are adult universities. i don't know any young people 17-24 going to those universities. i just know it's for people like my mom, basically single mother of five who wants to finish her education. i don't think id get much networking or experience out of it. just an express delivered bachelor's.

QB prep scholar requires me to enroll in school in texas. And it gives me a 5x higher chance of matching with a college. Than if i  applied as an unschooler.

if my bf and i are still together when i go to college he is an option ill consider, only then. we are fairly mature and have the same goals but because he already has most his stuff in order and im behind idk how that will impact the situation. we should be fine though.

my grandparents say i can stay with them to go to college but there isn't good public transportation and the colleges arent a good fit for me either. i want to live somewhere public transportation is efficient, you don't need a car. texas isn't known for transportation.

if i do go back to live in texas i only want to live in austin. and the only school im interested in is UT."
waioep,11,2022-07-28,confirmed job hopping makes more than loyalty,Think_Inspector_4031,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/waioep/confirmed_job_hopping_makes_more_than_loyalty/,"Background: my old job I started as an intern, making $13 an hour, then engineer I at $26 an hour, then six years later I was a senior engineer in title, project manager/ team lead / IT admin in responsibility making about $30 an hour. 
So COVID hit, job was iffy so I left this 60k-ish a year job for a 85k salary position somewhere else. Then a year later, left again to my current gig making 120k salary position. 

Background #2: Before I became a senior engineer I was asked if I can go out of state and set up VectorCover for a customer because they lost the talent. Project was expected to last 6 months, I finished everything up in three months, wrote detailed documentation and wrote a few tools to automate 60% of the work (hence project finished in half the time, I'm not a miracle worker, I happen to know programming languages and fake vba till it works).

Story: My boss three levels above my last boss calls me, and asks the usual small chit chat, and then tells me how they have a VectorCover project, and they really need someone with experience, as they lost lots of people due to stagnant wages. Asks if I could come back, or at least work this project because it's time sensitive. 

Old boss said, hey I can give you 130k, work remote (not normal, but you can earn it if your bosses trust you, and do not need to manage you), and interested in going back to work. However I can't let anyone know how much I would be making, because it wouldn't be fair to the people who were there 10 years compared to my seven. 

Moral of the story, I would probably be making max 80k a year if I stayed at the job, movie around gets you way more."

wak8d0,45,2022-07-28,Capital One SWE Internship,whaledarn,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/wak8d0/capital_one_swe_internship/,"I applied to the Capital One SWE internship a couple days ago, and they sent me an OA on Code Signal that I recently finished. From what I heard, you need a score of 700+ out of 850 to be considered for the next round, but a classmate of mine got a 700 and was told he wouldn't get an interview because he was a sophomore. My score is within the range to get an interview, and I was wondering if this was something other students had experienced?"
wakplt,8,2022-07-28,Feeling demotivated cause of stuff,RadiantSkiesJoy,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/wakplt/feeling_demotivated_cause_of_stuff/,"Abit of introduction: preferred name is skye, 22 and this is my first full time it job. 

Hardware side of computers has generally been always my favorite  for quite a long time and I have been trying to land a job as an it executive for almost 6 years and finally managed to get one and the company looked really nice on the outside since it was a non profit. For the record though this company owns about 3 billion or so in sri Lankan rupees so they are financial well off, plus they get aid from Norway every year. 

BTW there's also an intern below me. This is something for later. Plus there's about 32 branches and one head office totally in the organization. 

I joined the company on May, and instantly was sent on a field trip and literally didn't even have any time to learn about the company or anything else. So one week after the field trip, I was only able to work with the old it ex for like 4 days, almost a week.. I barely learned anything from him about the existing systems or what has even been used or what not.

After he left, I slowly managed to learn almost everything, and I keep getting scolded saying ""your it and you don't know how to solve this"" when I don't even know what network this printer old cable printer even connected to. There's no network diagrams, but a whole mess of stack of routers which I still haven't even bothered to look into. 

The it manager gave me the first task of putting together a complete database of all the assets while wanting me to build a complete sql database for it... Anyways I managed to convince him to go with glpi since I literally don't want to spend time on developing a database with the very little time there is.

He then wanted me to get upto date list of all the users and asset codes of 400 computers combined from two companies. I did manage to make it but I'm still lacking the asset codes and userlist, cause they couldn't keep proper records every year and kept doing excels that were all over the place. 

Recently my bosses boss, the ""head of it"" who's a really pain in the ass who works from home, comes In a car like once a week, keeps picking on me because I'm not updating a system he made out of azure dev ops. Basically he turned dev ops into a ticketing system and I couldn't update it for just two days cause I was out finding medicine for two days straight(dont even bother asking, just Google Sri Lanka). 

Anyways I missed two days, we get to a meeting today and he starts fuming over why only the senior it exec(who only maintains the companies inbuilt erp system) can do his job properly while both of us can't. I told him our scope is abit too huge and I don't have time but I'm trying but still he goes on don't you have 5 minutes(if I had 5 minutes I wouldn't miss my lunches somedays). He then decided to get my join date and the interns and inform the management to take a disciplinary warning against us, and since we are still in prohibition and we can be let go. 

Coming week he firmly told he wanted upto date information on the pcs with their cpu ram disk speeds. For now I'm  planning on writing a basic script to get it done and hopefully it works. 

I'm kinda scared and sad I'll loss the job since I tried to get this job for a very long time, while working odd jobs for the past few years and it's like my entry level job and I was si happy but everyday it's just becoming sad and more frustrating."

Thanks"
waqzqg,6,2022-07-28,22 and everyday is harder and harder.,feelthiswayagain,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/waqzqg/22_and_everyday_is_harder_and_harder/,"I feel like I've messed up everything in my life.

I'm 22, still in college because I changed my major late like an idiot, adding on another 2 years to my schooling. I feel like I'm a leech onto my parents, not because I ask them for money but because they are paying for my college. They say it's fine but I know in my heart that it's not.

I worked an internship this summer at the worst company you could ever imagine, working 4pm to 2am every single day the entire summer. When I couldn't take it anymore, I left. Got a notice that I'll have to pay back the 1k sign-on bonus in full that was taxed down to $500. I worked all summer, but am coming out with less money than I started with because of rent to stay in my college town, cost of living, and having to pay the company $1000.

I wasn't able to secure housing for next semester, so I'm living off-campus. My plans fell through with my friends to secure a 4bd house, which would have been much cheaper, and now I'm going to be living in a 200sq ft box for $1300.

I take antidepressants but they don't work. every night this past week I cry nonstop. The other night I cried for 3-4 hours straight, unable to stop. I'm so numb I don't even know why I was crying. I think it's because my ex rejected my offer to try to reconcile things, but I wasn't even really thinking about that. I do miss her though. She was my only close friend. But I ruined everything by being a sadfuck, an unlovingfuck, and an unkindfuck.

I've been going on runs, usually at 1am. It feels like I'm running from my problems, literally. The other night I was bawling my eyes out, and started running and just kept crying. I'm just crying my eyes out at 1 in the morning, running down dirty, empty, unhappy streets.

I don't want to keep living this life. I'm tired. I have tinnitus that rings constantly. I think about killing myself a lot, but I don't think I will. But I think *about* it.

My mom recently had cancer surgery. It seems she's in the clear now, but it will be a long recovery for her. I feel like I burden those around me.

I keep asking the universe if it will ever get better and it it feels like she keeps telling me no.

I'm tired man. Tired of being alone, tired of loving and losing. Don't know if I can keep doing it. Don't know what else to do though."

Is there any way I ask to get my internship extended ( possibly into fall part time)?

———
Context: 

So I have been working as an intern in house for  a big company. They have a set program; for fall, winter, and summer.

I really fricken love it &amp; feel like I fit in. I don’t want it to end :( 

I’ve gotten lots of compliments from my mentor and my manager. I asked my manager for feedback and she said I was ranked as high as possible for all categories &amp; gave positive feedback.

My first rotation , the attorneys heard about the work I did and praised the quality. I didn’t know they knew who I was 😵‍💫They asked when I graduated, what I was doing when I graduated , and basically hinted at hiring me in the future/ said I should intern during law school. 

Another attorney asked if I planned on staying here, I expressed how much I love it and had a good chat/ connected over things.

At the beginning of the internship, they say they hire interns with the intention of hiring them long term"
warmi1,5,2022-07-28,Will it disadvantage me if I don't have CS Ec's and experience as an aspiring Cs major?,No_Description_949,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/warmi1/will_it_disadvantage_me_if_i_dont_have_cs_ecs_and/,"I was an international student for 9th grade at some boarding school, so I quiet literally didn't have access to computers, much less computer science. My first year back in the states, I took Ap Comp sci principles but had very little time outside of school because I had to try to bridge the gap between my international curriculum and U.S cirriculum (an unhealthy amount of all nighters to maintain a 4.0). I just began taking CS50 by Harvard (an intro course) to just step my foot into programming.

However, so many posts I see here are people with actual cs internships and crazy ass projects. Will I disadvantage myself severely by not having CS related Ec's and experience? Do colleges expect you to have a decent amount of experience with it? I probably have above average Ec's but below average in terms of Cs ec's."
waros1,26,2022-07-28,Is this a scam?,Steel_Airship,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/waros1/is_this_a_scam/,"I'm a computer science major and software development intern who doesn't  have freelance experience but want to get into web dev freelancing.

Yesterday  I got a text from someone saying that they saw my LinkedIn profile and want to hire me to design a website for their church and to send a  proposal to their email. I sent the proposal and they asked for a cost estimate. I gave them an estimate and now they want me to send them my  full name, address, city, state, and zip code, and phone number so that  they can send me a check for the cost. I am a bit suspicious because I  had assumed that most freelance transactions such as this are done over  platforms like PayPal and I know that there are a lot of check scams out  there, plus I'm weary of sending out my personal information to a  client that I don't know outside of secure channels. I asked if I could  receive the payment over paypal and I'm waiting on a response. Do you  think this is legitimate?

This is a  bit anecdotal but they also used the word ""kindly"" (""kindly provide the  following information""), which a lot of scammers from foreign countries  use, despite having an English name."

I had an internship and part-time work as a frontend software engineer before graduation. However, I'm still not confident with programming, and even in my previous technical interviews, I can't even explain some concepts well.

I thought of applying to data-related jobs instead. I know basic SQL and Python as we worked on classification models and machine learning during junior and senior year (and I actually liked these subjects more). Is this enough to land a data science/ data engineer job even without internship experience? Thank you!"

I have been dealing with a work environment where my co workers are putting in unpaid overtime hours everyday and I mean everyday for at least 10+ hours and weekends as well. Now these same teammates(2 of them) have been consistently trying to completely sabotage the work I’ve been doing by tagging me in slack channels and basically implying that I haven’t been doing things the right way. During the daily stand-ups these same teammates basically shit all over me and couple of interns who started when I joined the company. They again implied that we’re doing a very poor job. However, the thing is we’re not or at least I’m not because I have kept track and record of everything. So far my average error rate has been below 0.60 % and most of the things they’re mentioning I’ve been following it and doing it exactly the same. I have also been told by these same teammates that I’m doing a pretty good job when I’m alone with them and it’s about the interns not me. But then every week I’m getting tagged in the public slack channel in a rant where it’s being implied that we’re still not following the workflow right. This has caused so much stress and I’m someone who’s practicing mindfulness so I’m somewhat able to deal with it but it has started to affect the after work life.

These two teammates also are involved heavily in office politics so they’re always trying to gossip and shit talk about other co workers. I have tried to keep it professional but I still get interrupted by them trying to chat with me. So, I’ve started to notice a sudden increase in these slack messages and very aggressive tone during the meetings where basically our work is being criticized consistently. If the interns are asking questions they are replying in a very passive aggressive and sarcastic manner. Even if it is about interns and not me this feels like a very toxic work environment to be part of. I feel like I’m being presented to the management as someone who’s having a very poor start to the job.

I don’t know what to do as I’ve never been in such a a situation where I’m consistently being criticized and somewhat disrespected/humiliated by the type of language used by these teammates. I’d appreciate any advice on how to tackle this situation. Thank you and sorry for a long post."

My thinking is that I can get a taste of research and brush up on some skills to decide if I want to apply for a research internship during y2 summer break. 

However this mod clashes with many of the available time slots (which have higher vacancies) for Korean 1, a mod I really really want to take this sem. I’m considering dropping LSM2191 for a higher chance of getting Korean and taking LSM2191 in y2s2 instead. However, I’m worried about not being able to get the mod (the vacancy and students selected ratio was really close for round 1.) And I’m also worried if it’s too late if I take this mod in y2s2, in terms of knowing if I want to apply for a research internship or not (I suppose we gotta apply for internships very early on?)

wavgk6,3,2022-07-29,Considering a switch from medicine to CS pathway—advice?,Bepbopbeep,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/wavgk6/considering_a_switch_from_medicine_to_cs/,"I’m a college freshman considering switching from a pre-med biology track to studying CS. To be totally honest, I don’t care about what field I go into—all I want is a job where I can make a high salary, do shit I actually want to do outside of work, and retire comfortably at the end of my career.

I don’t think I’m cut out for med school (and certainly can’t afford it) so my current path in medicine is PA school: 2 years post grad, plus 1 gap year to work on applications, start work pretty much immediately after school with a relatively high salary (avg. is 100k ish in big cities). But, this field AFAIK has little growth, i.e. I would be working for that same salary (maybe up to 150k?) for the great majority of my career.

I don’t know anything about CS and I know that I’m behind, but naively I have this image that with enough work during college, and getting internships in the summer/part time to get experience, I could graduate and get a decent paying job where I could then job hop/negotiate/etc etc my way into a very good salary. The crux of it is that this option leaves me with less debt (no grad school) and more growth opportunities (salary would increase significantly w experience). 

I go to a small Seven Sisters college, but they do have a lot of career resources and I think that I can take advantage of them well (for internships, etc). I’ve seen people here with internships at Microsoft and other big companies so I know that it’s possible. I also have an older sister who currently works in the field. 

Has anybody made this switch? Any thoughts about medicine vs. CS/tech as somebody who isn’t particularly passionate about either? Is my view of the job market/opportunities in CS accurate? Any feedback is appreciated!"

I’m in my final year of my computer science degree and am looking to start getting ready for the job hunt. Now I have been throughout college, and currently still do, work a full time non tech related job along with my full time studies. This has left me no time for internships so I haven’t gained any experience in the tech industry. I feel like this leaves me at a huge disadvantage initially.

I do have a handful of personal projects I’ve worked on in my free time and that I continue to work on, hoping to make up for my lack of industry experience. I also passed the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam which I’ll put on my resume, though I’m aware that particular certification holds little to no weight to employers.

Lastly, lurking around here I’ve learned how important a great resume is and especially how important it can be to tailor your resume to each company. I haven’t began working on a resume yet, but I’ll be devoting time to that late this year, early next year.

So any advice for how to continue getting ready for the job hunt next year? 

Thanks in advance!"
wax24c,0,2022-07-29,"I'm 16, a senior in high school, and I want to major in Finance but I really want to learn to program. Is it good to learn programming for what I want to do? And should I minor in computer science?",definitelyavid,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/wax24c/im_16_a_senior_in_high_school_and_i_want_to_major/,"So for context, programming has always been a major thing in my life. I have always had some sort of passion for it - but not enough of one where I would dedicate myself to it in hopes of a future career path in it. My dad was teaching me how to program when I was around 9 or 10 and I was learning Python but got really confused at def() and if/elif/else statements. I've picked up programming in Python again using codecademy and I've been really enjoying it. In a way, it almost feels like a video game and I get the same sense of enjoyment.

It's difficult for me to convince myself to dedicate a lot of time to programming because I'm also going to start taking a Financial Accounting course and Intro to Business course at my local community college. On top of that, I'm balancing 4 AP's, leadership, and an honors math class at my school while working to get a business internship. Coding and learning to program is really enjoyable to me and I feel like it has a lot of benefits that I can apply to real world situations like problem solving and logical thinking.

If you were in my shoes, what basic programming languages would you recommend learning? Or what languages would be good for the field of work I'm looking to pursue? How many hours should I dedicate to learning these languages a week if I want to see a lot of progress in a year? Is learning to program even worth my time if I have to focus on my classes, internship, and college application? 

I have so many questions about programming and I would really love to learn but I don't want to become discouraged or dedicate too much of my time to it if it won't prove that beneficial to me either currently or in the future.

Thank you so much for the help!!!"

Been on the reddit for quite some time and gained a lot of knowledge on the process of getting a career. But, I need some clear guidance on what should my priority be for the next 6 months before I graduate.  


**BACKGROUND:** I am an IT Major graduating in December 2022 specializing in Web Applications, been coding JS, React, Next, Python, Java, etc. and learned how to make a full stack application. I have 3 small project from school and I have experience in Data Engineering from the internship I am in currently at a reputable company.   
I have little to no DS&amp;A skills and LC grind is below average right now (I know I need to do that)  


**PROBLEM:** I know that I must do LC like my life depends on it to get the job, but wanted to know besides that what else should I prepare for to ensure I get a job by the time I graduate this year. Should I do projects? If so, any advice on managing time? I work part-time at a tech store to make money for myself.   


**TLDR:** I want to secure a SWE job by Jan 2023, I graduate in Fall 2022. I have small projects and currently in a Data Engineering Internship at a reputable company. I know that I must do LC as my life depends on it, but is there anything else to better my chances? I work part-time elsewhere to get by so I have a lot going on but I am willing to do what ever it takes to get a SWE job to make my parents proud.

I graduated last year and after a summer internship at an investment management firm, I came back as a full time employee working on the infrastructure side of things. I've been here for a year and a bit and while the pay is good, the job is just not right for me so I'm looking for a change. The only issue is I have a 3 month long notice period. I feel like this is a really long time for someone with just over a year of experience in the industry, and potential employers will not bother waiting around when they can get someone in the door much quicker. I've read on here that this is becoming industry-standard but many of my friends have month-long notice periods at most (I also have a 6 month non-compete after termination but I don't plan on moving into another investment firm after this so that's almost off the table).

I've been applying to positions this week but am sort of dreading potentially finding a job I really like and then being declined at the final stage because they don't have 3 months to wait around. Either I keep doing this and then wait for a company who is willing to wait 3 months to hire me, or I put in my notice today and then coasty for a month or so and then start rigorously applying.

What are your thoughts?"

I personally think it is unimpressive but am concerned that without this from my freshman year I have nothing to bolster my resume for sophomore summer internships. Regardless, I am curious about how I might go about describing my role on this project....Research Lead / Web Developer comes to mind quickly but seems lengthy. Finally, for one of my profiles, it is suggested to give a URL for the project and the only code I have any access to is the website I built, not the code that ran our device(I didn't really have much input on it so Im not worried). I'm concerned about making my github repo public and linking it because I figure if they want to see it they can ask directly, not that my work is anything to steal I suppose.

* What are your expectations?
* Why do you want to work for our company?
* Etc.

I can't think of anything. I just like to code, because I like the challenge and I want to earn more experience. They're like puzzles and they are fun. I'm not picky. I don't have anything more besides me just wanting to progress, learn more and code. Simple. To the point.

I feel like it's a crutch, because there are people boasting and selling themselves to get the job offer, while I'm not picky. Sure, I can say the cliche things like: I can do this or I am motivated, etc... , but that gets old fast.

I'm also not aiming to work in the big four. I don't have such ambitions. I just like the work and live a simple life.

I have displayed my attitude here. What could I improve on to become more desirable for companies/employers to hire me?

I am currently in my first year of Engineering at the University Of Auckland, NZ and on track to specialising in software engineering next year. I've always had a passion for this industry and have some experience in python and javascript through online courses and high school studies. 

**Advice Needed:**

I would ideally like to have opportunities to intern in Australia at a top company (e.g. canva, google, [freelancer.com](https://freelancer.com)) and eventually land a graduate role there. What can I do now to set myself up for success with recruiters down the line?"
wb5nw2,1,2022-07-29,"Grad student with three potential paths, which do I choose?",Trifle_Useful,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/wb5nw2/grad_student_with_three_potential_paths_which_do/,"Hi, first post here so apologies for any mistakes. I’m currently stuck picking between three options early on in my career. I’ll be using a list format for a lot of this to keep track of what’s what. 

A bit of background: I am a graduate student of Urban Planning and Public Administration in the midwest, working towards two master degrees simultaneously. I am set to graduate in May. 

I am also working two internships, one in Planning and another in Budgeting. My problem comes in when I was offered a third internship in the real estate industry and it’s left me unsure of what to do. 

-Employer 1: (Planning) $16/hr, 30min commute 

-Employer 2: (Budget) $15/hr, 40min commute 

-Employer 3: (RE Consultant) $20/hr, 50min commute 2x a week, the rest WFH. 

Complicating Factors:

1.	Employer 1 has created a permanent, benefitted position for me at roughly $19.25 an hour with the ability to work PT until I graduate. This is a public sector job with merit pay, benefits, stability, and I have a fair bit of loyalty to them for giving me increased responsibilities and raises. 
2.	Employer 2 is an internship that has only been ongoing for roughly three months. It is supposed to last an entire year. 
3.	Employer 3 has structured the internship in 90 day chunks, with eligibility for extension based on performance. Given the nature of the employer (not a developer but more of a middle-man), I have concerns over the ability to secure a position even if it were to be extended. 
4.	I have a 4.0 and solid references, so I would like to keep the door open to one of the Big 4 for when I graduate in May. 

I feel as though if I were to accept the position with Employer 3 I would be opening myself up to risk of layoffs or no extensions later on, given the changing housing market. 

I also worry that accepting the permanent position with Employer 1 would leave me feeling morally bound to them come May, preventing me from accepting a better offer with a larger firm. 

Lastly, I am a college student. The low pay of Employer 2 would put a bind on my finances given the commute. That said, it would offer me stability through the coming academic year and give me the flexibility to secure a new job come May. 

Do I accept the offer? Do I stay with Employer 1 and bind my options for the spring? Do I stay with employer 2 and feel the burn financially?

Also, before someone inevitably says it, I won’t accept the permanent position and leave Employer 1 come the spring. They have been incredibly supportive of me and I have a lot of respect for them. Seeing as they are already severely understaffed, I don’t want to throw them under the bus in that way. 

Thanks in advance for any advice, and I’ll try to be responsive to questions for clarification."

Recently after participating in an internship, I have developed an interest in ECE. 

When I first applied to UT, I wasn’t really sure about what engineering to pick. I kind of chose mechanical because it’s considered the “jack of all trades” and because I wasn’t really sure what I wanted to do yet. 

How hard is it to transfer from MechE to ECE? Is there a back up plan that I can do in case I don’t get in?

Obviously I know that you can’t transfer until after your first semester, but is there anything I can do to prepare?"

So I am a Biology major and Computer Science minor and a sophomore in college and I am very very interested in getting into the field of bioinformatics. I would love to get a few internships under my belt as an undergrad but I honestly am not sure of which internships I should really apply for.

My freshman year, I applied to a ton of internships - I’d say 50% were “bioinformatics internships”, 30% were dry/wet lab internships and 20% were miscellaneous computer science related internships (ie data science, data analysis, software engineering etc). I feel like I did not  get any internships just due to my inexperience but I do have a feeling that applying for bioinformatics internships may be futile because those internships seem to inherently favor those who are further along their undergrad path. 

Which internships should I really be looking into and what are some tips for applying (ie “when should I apply?”, “what are the best companies/institutes to apply to?”, “what  are they looking for in candidates?” etc). Thank you to any and everyone who interacts with this post!"

I guess I’m asking for an outside opinion on what I may be doing right or wrong, and what aspects are out of my control in regards to my job search.
Here are my “good” employment traits
-got BA in Asian Studies May 2021
-from this degree I can now speak Japanese (native language is English, also know some Spanish)
-Studied abroad in Japan from Oct. 2019-August 2020
-Made an impromptu/informal tutoring group w my friends: helping each other improve Japanese and English abilities 
-Been at one of my current jobs since 2019 (3 years and change)
-strong computer abilities esp from distance learning
My “bad” employment traits
-all but 2 jobs in my employment history are retail
-the 2 non retail was a late night dorm RA in 2017-2018, and currently a laundry warehouse worker (from 2021)
-current retail position cashier is at a place with…not the best reputation. Rhymes with mall fart
-for 1.5 months in 2021, I tried out a job at a warehouse. It was a nightmare so I quit and without notice. However, i keep this off my resume, linked in, social media etc
-Did not do a college internship: normally would have done in my junior or senior year, but COVID started my junior year, so all the potential ones were cancelled.
-i live rurally, and in, what I call, a “job desert”. Most positions around here are retail related, warehouse, manual labor etc,and a small amount of medical. (Basically nothing related to my long terms goals/major…i know i’ll need to move)
 
I’m just really trying to figure out what I’m doing wrong, and if/how much of this difficulty is out of my control.
I’ve applied for
-data entry
-receptionist 
-secretary 
-HR/administrative assistant
-Subtitle translator
-JP&gt;ENG localization person
-customer service rep
-mobility specialist (helping people make big moves logistics wise)
Among many others. I’ve gotten a few interviews, but none have led to an offer. I even applied to a local customer service rep position, in which I met all the qualifications, AND had a a personal connection put in a good word to the company for me. We had like 3 phone interviews and one in person, and they still said no! Another, for the mobility specialist, I applied, they loved my resume and my 3 very long zoom interviews/ phone calls, rejected me, called me back for another interview a few months later, and rejected me again. I thought i did well in these interviews, and I seemed to have great conversation/chemistry with the interviewers! 

I’ve updated and upgraded my resume a ton, making it very easy to understand and making myself sound great! Ive also tailored it to the positions i apply to. Recently i’ve started attaching cover letters to every single application. Yet, most dont reply or I interview and they reject.

Did they somehow find out about the job I quit after a short time? Does having “ mall fart “ on my resume ‘taint’ it? I’ve followed all the interview tips, like having questions prepared, research on the company, dressing nicely, taking notes, etc etc…is there something in interviews I’m messing up thats subtle? Are employers hiring remote employees more picky/ maybe snobby? I have an interview for a nice position next week, but i’m worried the cycle will continue. I’m absolutely done with  and sick of my current jobs, I want to move on!"

The ship was ominously quiet as Daniels and his small team made their way through. He felt a prickling sensation on the back of his neck as he wondered where all the mutineers were. It was technically late into the night, and was about the time most of the science crew went to sleep, but had they really not thought to post a guard? These people had been dumb enough to jump to the technically correct realization that the ship’s crew were all former pirates based on entirely misconstrued evidence and their own paranoia, so he didn’t have much faith in their practical intelligence. But hoping your opponent was stupid was never a sound strategy. Even if they had proven their idiocy at every possible turn there was still a chance they might do the intelligent thing.

That didn’t really matter, so long as they could get to the helm and send out their message then everything would be alright. Well, not really. He was dooming his ship and remaining loyal crew to either a fiery death, or a painful exposure to the hard vacuum of space. He felt his guts roil at the idea, all those men who relied on him dead by his hand, just like Riley.

He focused his mind on the here and now, getting caught up in his past failures would only doom him now.

Their two Kunan’ai companions who could slink silently over the ships floors faster than the two humans had rushed on ahead to use their excellent sense of smell to scout for them, also to get away from Finch who still reeked of mace.

“Captain” she whispered.

“Yes”

“Can I ask you a few questions?”

He turned to her a gave her an incredulous expression “Now isn’t exactly the time for a chat lieutenant.”

She looked embarrassed but pressed on “I know that, but they have been weighing heavily on my mind”

He looked at he sternly, but knew that if she didn’t ask whatever was on her mind she might never get the answer, because one way or another today was his last day of life. “Ask away then” he assented.

“Well, earlier today Mark showed some photographs he had taken from your room” she said timidly, like she knew she was asking about a touchy subject but wanted to know anyway.

Daniels cringed “Little bastard” he mumbled. “Which ones did he show you?”

“One of you and three other people who looked to be your family in front of a grey ship”

He thought for a second before he smiled a little as Bra’tal came back to guide them forward. “Yeah, that was me and my folks on the day I joined the *Astaroth.* They had flown into Noctis to see us off”

“Us?” she asked.

His smile faded “yeah, me and my little brother, Riley. I heard about the *Astaroth* from an old friend of ours and I convinced Riley that we were needed there” he let out a sigh. “I don’t regret going aboard that ship, but I do regret bringing him with me.”

Finch looked sympathetic “He wasn’t in the next photo, the one of every posing on a pyramid with that woman holding Greyson’s head.”

Daniels nodded “The Battle for Greyland, that was the day I lost him. He was by my side when a claymore went off, he shielded me from the brunt of the blast, and took a load a BB’s in the side.”

“The Battle for Greyland?”

“Yeah, Greyson and his band of thugs decided to pick a fight with us, so we brought hell to his doorstep. Greyland was this out of the way planet the old bastard had found and turned into his base of operations. The ship fought its way past their orbital defenses while taking on heavy ground fire, then drop ships deployed platoons of marines to take Temple City. We cleared out that hive of pirates temple by temple. While the captain and a team of elites stormed Greyson’s sanctuary and took his head off.”

“Captain Astarte, the Maiden?” she asked inquisitively.

Daniels snorted “I can personally assure you, she was no maiden”

Finch flushed “I meant she was raised by the rebel group called the Maidens.”

“Yeah, I think I heard something like that.” He said absentmindedly as memories from that day flashed past in his mind.

Finch looked pensive and worried “Does, does that mean you really are a pirate?” she whispered hoarsely, afraid of the answer.

Daniels looked towards her and knew that the time for lies was over “Yeah, I was. But not the same kind as Greyson was, we never dealt in slaves or drugs, and in the early days we made our way by hunting down other pirates and slaver scum.”

“So you’ve killed people then.” That was more a statement than a question.

Daniels nodded “Yeah, Greyland was my first real mission, and the first time I ever killed another human being.” He went quiet and she let him get his mind in order “I thought I could handle it; they were all bad people. But when that claymore went off something inside me clicked, and I could no longer see a bunch of thieves and murderers, all I saw were just dead ‘people’, as dead as my goofy little brother. Captain pulled me out of combat roles and put me in the helm.” His voice was raw.

He expected her to react in horror, or to turn on him and alert the mutineers to his presence, but instead her face went carefully blank “And your role aboard the *Staff of Lore*?”

Daniels cleared his throat “Exactly what it seems, we’re hear to explore and chart the stars, nothing nefarious.”

“And the *Beelzebub*, another pirate ship? Do you trust them to do the right thing for the Kunan’ai?”

“Absolutely, we’re not bad people, we’re just in a rough line of work.”

She scowled “I’m pretty sure piracy is more than ‘just a rough line of work’”

“Depends on the context” Daniels said darkly.

“And what does that mean?”

“It means that after this is all over Captain Bell will likely have a long chat with you about who we are and what we do, the full story because there’s a lot more to us than meets the eye. But right now we need to send that message, are you this with me?”

Her gaze seemed to penetrate his soul “Yes, for now helping the Kunan’ai is more important than your past.

At that moment Bra’tal came around the corner, “I think we’re near the bridge, but there’s something you need to see first.”

“See what?” Daniels asked.

Bra’tals ears flattened against his head “We found the room where we were being held, and next to it we found the human the *myotenniers* had tortured. He wont get up.”

\~\~\~\*\~\~\~

Mark had truly gone to far, everything he had done before paled in comparison to the broken and crying form of Nelson. The Kunan’ai had already freed him from his restraints, but he had just slumped down to the ground, quietly crying in the sawdust of his own severed horns. Daniels stood in horror as he looked in on the room, and Eliza saw his face blacken with cold murderous rage. Before when he had strangled that intern he looked offended when she thought he had killed him, and just before in the hallway he looked remorseful as he remembered what must have been a very hard day for him. But now she knew that if he could gets his hands on Mark then he wouldn’t hesitate to kill him.

He stepped forward and lifted Nelson up with a grunt “Mathew, can you here me Mathew.” He said gently, calling him by his first name.

“I,I,I” he stuttered.

“Its okay kid, don’t push yourself.”

“I, I didn’t break, they didn’t break me.” He whispered hoarsely.

“That’s good kid, can you stand?” he said softly as he helped Nelson up to his feet. His legs trembled violently, and Daniels offered his shoulder to him for support.  He turned back to the door and the cold fury on his face sent a chill down Eliza’s spine “Help me support him” he said gruffly. She was stunned for a second before she stepped forward to support his weight.

He guided them into the ship’s helm and settled Nelson into his command seat and looked out on the room around them. Mark and his thugs had torn up the whole room, panels were torn off the wall and wires were recklessly strewn about. He examined the room before he stepped over to calmly pick up a large wrench as long as his forearm, he tested the weight a bit before jerking his head towards the trash “Find yourselves something suitable, I have no doubt that once we send out our message they will know we escaped. We’re going to need to fight our way to the landing shuttle, its about 50 yards from here to there with plenty of adjoining halls.”

“We will be fine with our claws Daniels” Bra’tal said and Kun’ee blinked slowly in affirmation.

Eliza shook her head in shock “I can’t fight, I don’t know how.” She protested.

“You swing and hope you hit something!” he snapped, “There’s not much more to it than that.”

“Bu-“

“Do you want to live or not, because unless you can get your ass on that shuttle then you’re dead.” Eliza was stunned into silence, Daniels glared at her, picked up a pipe and forced into her hands. “It wont be easy, but it’s you or them.” He growled softly.

There was a rustling behind them as Nelson forced himself to stand up and pick out a makeshift weapon, he still looked incredibly pale and drained but the look in his eyes told them that he was willing to do his part.

Daniels nodded and stepped towards the console and punched in a quick series of numbers, the locked-out screen then changed, and he punched in a short message comprised of seemingly nonsensical letters and numbers. AZ9, WW12, QT41, HLF4. Before he hit send.

He was about the close out the program when a reply came in “*roger, stand by.”*

Daniels smiled and reached shut it down when an audible click brought there attention to the door where Mark and two of her ‘former’ colleagues stood holding guns.

“Hands off the console pirate!” Mark barked.

Eliza watched as Daniels slowly lifted his hands away from the console and stepped back, Mark stepped around him before he glanced to the still open comms screen. In the exact moment he turned away Daniels swung his pipe wrench into the side of Mark’s, there solid crack made her blood run cold, and if Daniels hadn’t shouted “GO!” then she would have been too stunned to move.

\~\~\~\*\~\~\~

It had occurred to Daniels that the mutineers had set a trap as soon as he entered the helm, it explained why they had gotten this far without running into anyone. And while hacking into the ship’s systems would have been very hard, setting up a watchdog program to alert them when the ships comms had been opened would have been easy.

The previous ambush the mutineers had set for them had put them in a hopeless situation, even if he had tried to fight his way through them it wouldn’t have accomplished much. But right now he had nothing to lose, it was now or never. And after what they did to Nelson, Daniels felt like he needed to repay the favor. He didn’t have direct eye contact on the mutineers, but he could see a distorted image of them on one of the helms reflective surfaces, a trick Astarte had taught him after she had revealed how she always seemed to know what cards Daniels had in his hand. So when he saw that Mark had turned away from him and the others had let their weapons drop, he took his chance and swung with all his might.

He felt sickened by the thud his wrench made when it smacked into his head, but he pushed down his revulsion and roared “GO!” to his stunned companions.

Finch and Nelson were stunned for a moment, but Bra’tal and Kun’ee were not. The two of them launched at the two remaining thugs with claws and teeth bared and savaged the faces of the two terrified mutineers. Daniels watched the brutally tear into the two and mentally changed his image of Kunan’ai as weasel-wolfs to weasel-wolverines.

Daniels turned to the two startled humans and roared “MOVE!” and finally broke them out of the daze. He turned and smashed in the screen of the comms station, he charged forward and swung into another mutineer who had been coming through the door, and felt his body sink into the old muscle memory of his life as a marine. For the first time in years he felt himself sink into his old role as death and violence incarnate, his perception sharpened, and all of his moves became precise and brutally effective. His teachers and family had drilled these steps into him so thoroughly from a young age that they dominated his every movement, and it had saved him many times over the years.

He charged forward, barely registering the enemy before him as swung his bloody wrench before charging forward once more, sometimes someone came in behind him and one of his companions took care of them. Some sort of siren went off and the lights went red, but Daniels paid it no attention as he rammed his wrench into another head.

They ate up ground and in what seemed like only seconds they had reached the air lock for the lander.

The pneumatic mechanism that opened the doors had been disabled so he pulled down on a lever to release the captured air and slid the door to the side with a grunt. “Get in” he ordered.

Nelson being one of only a few people onboard besides himself who could pilot the lander strode in first, then the Kunan’ai. Finch was about the get in when she turned back to see that he wasn’t following her. “What are you doing?” she asked.

“I’m not coming with you; a captain goes down with his ship” Daniels said firmly.

“Don’t be ridiculous, you’ll die if you stay.”

“I know, and I’m ready.” He said softly.

“please ju-“ she pleaded before Daniels reached forward and planted a kiss on her lips, one last taste of life before he met the reaper.

“Take care lieutenant, let my parents know I love them” he said before pushing her into the lander and he sealed the door.

She got up and pounded on the glass as he stepped out of the airlock, sealed the door, and released the mooring clamps.

The shuttle craft slowly drifted away from the *Staff of Lore* on a puff of vented atmosphere, and he turned to face the mutineers who had trained their weapons on him.

I’ve gotten As in all my courses and have been able to tackle hard classes (I wouldn’t say with ease, but feasibly).  

Then came 372 and Bram Lewis. I have never felt so confused on projects nor have had any professor be so cryptic when “answering” students questions. I’m still floating at an A, but I know it’s going to drop end term just because I couldn’t finish the TCP project, and now RDT is slapping me across the face as well.  

These projects are so confusing, the guidance is not there, and when the professor says “just rewrite the program entirely” it’s like, what’s the point of providing skeleton code that is just meant to lead students astray?  

This is the first term I’ve worked full time outside of class (riding an internship fortunately), and maybe that’s part of it, but man. I fucking HATE this class. Or should I say I hate these projects. They feel so incomplete and vague with no rubric guidance.

Edit :

Here’s a response about grading for reference to the annoyance this class has been.  

“The point distribution is not published for this assignment. It's a lot like spices in cooking - such a small contribution but it makes or breaks the recipe but a pile of spices will never make the meal.”

I have done fashion internships in the past and just recently gotten one small internship in tech (not related to fashion). I also feel like the pandemic took away so many resources and opportunities that I could've taken within my school. Soo, now I want to take this gap-year to get through my personal reasons and also explore internships in the field, and then compile a list of opportunities that I want to pursue once I get back on campus. Also, I know that I am going back, so the argument that I will get lazy and not go back to finish my degree is kinda getting old.

However, people are saying I'm wasting my time... I work as a waiter/bartender right now (which I kinda enjoy as  a part-time) but I have joined programs that have been teaching me how to code and create AI using that code. I am also looking for internships in the field I want and while Fall 2022 doesn't seem too hopeful in getting an internship, I have found other programs that I would want to do that help me in creating projects that show I am proficient in coding languages. I know it's not full-time opportunities but I just want to slowly build my portfolio so I can be a more competitive application for larger companies once the next summer roles in.

I remember when I failed the msft explore interview and the Amazon  SDE intern interview I was depressed as a sophomore. I managed to pass the Microsoft interview the next year. I also have always failed the Amazon final interview lol. 

It's not the end of the world if you can't land one of these top internships or new grad positions. 

Multiple people have personally told me that this subreddit/cscq/blind is damaging their mental health seeing people achieve what they cant but desperately want.

News flash, even if you do no projects and just barely graduate you will find a job even if it's a crappy one. I know a guy who can barely code who got a job out of college for 80k. He can't even do a leetcode easy.

Once you get 2 to 3 years of experience at any company you can apply for SDE 2 roles at FAANG which there are way more of than intern or sde 1. I know a guy who finished his degree at 28 years old at a crappy college worked at a no-name crappy company for 2 years and now is a L3 at Google. 

You can interview for SDE 2 and they might downlevel to sde 1 but you will still make it into FAANG. College isn't your only chance to do it. Some kids in college have told me they have depression seeing their friends get these internships. Never become depressed about this. 

You are probably not even 21 yet and you have 30 to 40 years ahead of you to work and make money. If you can't get into FAANG at 20 you'll have hundreds of opportunities to get in at 22,23,24... Etc

The fact that you're doing computer science and going to college puts you at a better spot than 95% of people. My dad has 30 years of experience as an accountant yet my friend who barely knows how to code (he can't do leetcode easy) has the same salary as him at his first job. 

Anyways enjoy your college. Socialize with people and take care of your health. You're going to be grinding for another 20-30 years anyways.

Also somebody achieving one of these internships doesn't make them better than you by the way. Plenty of assholes in this industry who were not good at anything in their life except for coding/vidya that have a huge ego."

For the past 3 years I’ve been living as an intern in Spain. Unfortunately that all came crashing down when I suddenly developed an aggressive form of MS and had to return to the US for treatment. 

I would love to relocate to Spain permanently. Spain does offer a golden visa that is accessible after you purchase 500,000€ worth of property. After 10 years on this visa I would be eligible to apply for citizenship. 

I currently only have a degree in Spanish because I originally planned to become a Spanish teacher but unfortunately my state only pays teachers $30k. 
For the past few months I’ve been researching lucrative careers to help me reach my goal. I could go back to college for a computer science degree to get into software engineering. The pay is really nice but learning how to program is difficult. Another option would be earning a business degree and going into IT project management. The pay is also nice (not as high as software engineering) and it’s more people-focused.

wblvik,2,2022-07-29,what is going on inside my head?,No_Helicopter9361,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/wblvik/what_is_going_on_inside_my_head/,"I was recently given the idea that I may have trauma from my childhood. I always think people are making fun of my. I do have night terrors and sometimes scream in my sleep. I always try avoiding people because I am afraid of what they'll say to me. I am always on edge around others and intimidated by them as well.

More about me that could relate to my ptsd. I laugh at other people's reaction when I insult them. Not in a way to be mean but in a way to just feel comfortable and feel like I can be on their level. I believe this has something to do with the fact that I still experience people laughing at me when I was a child and how funny they viewed my reaction which in turn has me develop that kind of humor.

I believe I have an underdeveloped mind. I still watch cartoons to this day. I have never dated anyone. I am really not into porn. I am not asexual because I still find female attractive. All that points me in a direction that I may have an underdeveloped mind.

Other things I do that relate to my trauma is depression. I feel very isolated and alone from everyone else in society. I have terrible facial expression along with awkward positioning when I walk. When I was younger I wasn't always like that. I was a very cheery lad as a kid until my ocd and adhd started to get in the way of my social life

I feel really intimidated when I see other people talk to me. I am scared of what they may say to me and it makes me feel uncomfortable. When someone does insult me I react in a very scared way that makes it fun for them to insult me. They see how easy it is to insult me and they continually make fun of me getting in my head. It is hard for me to say anything back to them because I have a very bad time communicating my thoughts. 

I cling onto friends real easily. Everytime I lose a close relation with friends I tend to feel even more isolated then I already do. In the end I really care what they think of me. In this internship I tend to always go out of my way to help my superiors so they can accept me.

 I always had the idea that I am a super hero that can defeat anyone. This image of myself being one started in 6th grade and it continues to this day. I'd imagine myself being like that when I listen to music. This kind of imagine gives me the belief that I am superior to everyone else but when reality is being faced in front of me all, that feeling goes quickly away.

For the first time ever I meant somebody else who had adhd and ocd but didn't show any kind of issues expressing themselves through their face. They could speak perfectly fine and I could see they were very confident in their words. They do enjoy being around others and don't have any issue with conversation. This has led me to a conclusion that I have something other then ad/ocd and I believe it might be ptsd.

More information that might help answerthis question! 

I am currently working at a company  and I majoring in management information systems or business analyst I have 2 siblings with my brother becoming a freshman in college and my sister is going into the 8th grade. Both my parents are very loving and caring. My mother is a business owner and my dad is not working because of his heart which he is currently on disabilities for. 

I have seen therapist in the past, I stopped because I thought that I didn't need it after I graduated from high school. Once I did hit half way through my freshman year I wanted to see a counselor on campus which she did help in some capacity but I eventually did stop seeing her. I started seeing another counselor on campus two weeks ago but I wanted more help so I wanted to try betterhelp and give it a try. I learned that my mindset is not set in stone as in I can change who I am. Before I started seeing my counselor. I believed that my adhd and ocd were things that I could not change. She has taught me that I can change who I am. She introduced mindfulness and mediation which got me to believe that I can improve or in other words get better with dealing with my adhd/ocd. I stopped doing both of those because they were not in my interest but I still am trying to figure out other ways to improve myself. 
While I was doing this internship I believed I was not going to perform well because of my disorders. As time has went on however, I started to realized that the main issue was not my disorders but my self esteem.
My motivation has been through my work ethic. When I was younger was made fun of a lot by my peers from being different from them as in not being as good enough to enjoy a conversation with them. In middle school I specifically remember that every 2-3 months I would no longer be welcomed by others I sat with who I thought were my friends. In high school it got better but I started feeling lonely and still do. In high school I vouched to myself that I would prove them wrong by getting a good job so people could look up to me which has made my life good and bad in some ways. The good thing is it has got me to work really hard in college and I enjoy doing work because I feel part of something. The bad being that this kind of mindset has got me to think that people are always out to get me.

I take medication which is 125 mg of stetraline which my docter wants me to start taking 200 mg soon, 40mg of atomoxetine, 25mg of adderall, and trazodone.

One thing I  often do is getting sidetracked easily. When I am giving a task it is easy for me to get distracted and do something else which becomes an obsessive thought from my ocd and my adhd. I will then make the obsessive thought a thing I will hyberfocus onto which in turn makes me be in the clouds a lot.

wbm1fh,1,2022-07-29,why am I isolated inside my mind?,No_Helicopter9361,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/wbm1fh/why_am_i_isolated_inside_my_mind/,"I was recently given the idea that I may have trauma from my childhood. I always think people are making fun of my. I do have night terrors and sometimes scream in my sleep. I always try avoiding people because I am afraid of what they'll say to me. I am always on edge around others and intimidated by them as well.

More about me that could relate to my ptsd. I laugh at other people's reaction when I insult them. Not in a way to be mean but in a way to just feel comfortable and feel like I can be on their level. I believe this has something to do with the fact that I still experience people laughing at me when I was a child and how funny they viewed my reaction which in turn has me develop that kind of humor.

I believe I have an underdeveloped mind. I still watch cartoons to this day. I have never dated anyone. I am really not into porn. I am not asexual because I still find female attractive. All that points me in a direction that I may have an underdeveloped mind.

Other things I do that relate to my trauma is depression. I feel very isolated and alone from everyone else in society. I have terrible facial expression along with awkward positioning when I walk. When I was younger I wasn't always like that. I was a very cheery lad as a kid until my ocd and adhd started to get in the way of my social life

I feel really intimidated when I see other people talk to me. I am scared of what they may say to me and it makes me feel uncomfortable. When someone does insult me I react in a very scared way that makes it fun for them to insult me. They see how easy it is to insult me and they continually make fun of me getting in my head. It is hard for me to say anything back to them because I have a very bad time communicating my thoughts. 

I cling onto friends real easily. Everytime I lose a close relation with friends I tend to feel even more isolated then I already do. In the end I really care what they think of me. In this internship I tend to always go out of my way to help my superiors so they can accept me.

 I always had the idea that I am a super hero that can defeat anyone. This image of myself being one started in 6th grade and it continues to this day. I'd imagine myself being like that when I listen to music. This kind of imagine gives me the belief that I am superior to everyone else but when reality is being faced in front of me all, that feeling goes quickly away.

For the first time ever I meant somebody else who had adhd and ocd but didn't show any kind of issues expressing themselves through their face. They could speak perfectly fine and I could see they were very confident in their words. They do enjoy being around others and don't have any issue with conversation. This has led me to a conclusion that I have something other then ad/ocd and I believe it might be ptsd.

More information that might help answerthis question! 

I am currently working at a company  and I majoring in management information systems or business analyst I have 2 siblings with my brother becoming a freshman in college and my sister is going into the 8th grade. Both my parents are very loving and caring. My mother is a business owner and my dad is not working because of his heart which he is currently on disabilities for. 

I have seen therapist in the past, I stopped because I thought that I didn't need it after I graduated from high school. Once I did hit half way through my freshman year I wanted to see a counselor on campus which she did help in some capacity but I eventually did stop seeing her. I started seeing another counselor on campus two weeks ago but I wanted more help so I wanted to try betterhelp and give it a try. I learned that my mindset is not set in stone as in I can change who I am. Before I started seeing my counselor. I believed that my adhd and ocd were things that I could not change. She has taught me that I can change who I am. She introduced mindfulness and mediation which got me to believe that I can improve or in other words get better with dealing with my adhd/ocd. I stopped doing both of those because they were not in my interest but I still am trying to figure out other ways to improve myself. 
While I was doing this internship I believed I was not going to perform well because of my disorders. As time has went on however, I started to realized that the main issue was not my disorders but my self esteem.
My motivation has been through my work ethic. When I was younger was made fun of a lot by my peers from being different from them as in not being as good enough to enjoy a conversation with them. In middle school I specifically remember that every 2-3 months I would no longer be welcomed by others I sat with who I thought were my friends. In high school it got better but I started feeling lonely and still do. In high school I vouched to myself that I would prove them wrong by getting a good job so people could look up to me which has made my life good and bad in some ways. The good thing is it has got me to work really hard in college and I enjoy doing work because I feel part of something. The bad being that this kind of mindset has got me to think that people are always out to get me.

I take medication which is 125 mg of stetraline which my docter wants me to start taking 200 mg soon, 40mg of atomoxetine, 25mg of adderall, and trazodone.

One thing I  often do is getting sidetracked easily. When I am giving a task it is easy for me to get distracted and do something else which becomes an obsessive thought from my ocd and my adhd. I will then make the obsessive thought a thing I will hyberfocus onto which in turn makes me be in the clouds a lot.

 Another issue I tend to do commonly is I commonly have a hard time paying attention in certain situations which in turn makes it hard for me to pay attention when someone is giving me instructions.

Conclusion!

Do I have complex ptsd? What other kind of disorders/mental health issues could I possibly have. I am seeing a therapist within less then a month but the more information I get from people the better I get. Thank you for reading down this far and I look forward to reading any comments you post. I don't have autism, I already got tested for that."

Any help is greatly appreciated, sorry it's kind of long.

&amp;#x200B;

The company has about 2 Gb  of data that is produced as logs from the robots each day. These logs are stored as JSON in .txt files and they want to automate the backup process. They don't want to back up the data with a server in house as the power's too unreliable in the area and they want remote access from anywhere in the world 24/7 (or as close to it as they can get). They also want to have editor privileges for some of the people who can access it and viewer privileges for everyone else who can access it to minimize the risk of accidental deletion. Lastly, they want to have the data that's backed up automatically processed by some scripts that are stored remotely (ideally python) that I'm going to build and then have the compressed, processed data stored in a separate folder in the backup. The regular logs need to be deleted after 30days but the processed ones held on to for at least 2-3months.

&amp;#x200B;

The current approach is to use a 3rd party app to auto upload the txt files to drive then manually delete them after 30 days. The other parts have no solution and they'd rather not keep using a 3rd party app.

&amp;#x200B;

My thoughts are either keep what they have but use Gdrive to handle the uploading of logs from linux command line to drive. Then use the sharing privileges of the parent folder to set viewer/editor privileges for people accessing it and somehow run python scripts from colab as new logs are uploaded. 

OR use the AWS CLI for uploading then use AWS's CDK or python SDK and EventBridge to auto run python scripts for processing the logs.

&amp;#x200B;

I am in college with good coding experience but 0 knowledge of anything outside of what will be in the processing scripts themselves. This internship is a learning opportunity for me more than anything else so please let me know if I'm misunderstanding anything. Both these ideas have their own issues too so if there's a better solution please let me know.

I also understand that I should have gotten an internship before, but here we are. Lastly, I understand that internships usually are for students. However, I am dedicated to making this work, because I know I’m capable.

Im here to ask for your guys’ advice. As I don’t have any internships, I won’t stand out among all the entry level applicants to most companies. What are the odds I can get an internship this summer (after I graduate) as a stepping stone to a full time career? Moreover, I would love to enroll in a masters program for CS. Has anyone had experience doing an internship the summer between undergrad and grad school? I would be applying to internships this fall that expect me to be going back to school, before I know for sure if I got into grad school, so I’m a bit confused.

I was very ambitious, very different from my family, and I grew a huge ego to mask my insecurities. When I was in college, I got a very high profile internship at an investment bank. I was on cloud 9, it was everything I’ve ever wanted. At that point I had been bullied my entire life, so when I started having issues with a work colleague, my trauma made me defend myself in a very unprofessional way. I called him a loser, but not as a joke, I told him he was a failure and never would be anything in life. 

Months later, the situation got bad and I was let go. Since then, I can’t help but to feel ashamed of the person I was. That occasion hunts me every single day of my life and I can’t let it go. I don’t have any social media, because I don’t want to be remembered as a person who humiliated someone. That happened 5 years ago and I can’t let go. My life has crumbled, i immigrated, have been working odd jobs and I’m afraid to put myself out there. 

I know what I did was wrong, but I have truly changed. How can I move on with my life?"

I am thrilled to be given an opportunity to continue, but since it’s going to be my senior year and with a little to no chance of return offer from them at the moment, I would have to make time for sending out job applications and interviews on top of my fall semester in which I have to take at least 18 credits. 

I was originally planning on not working or doing part time doordash (around 5-10 hrs a week) since I’d have a good amount of savings to last me at least until January.

The pay is great, the benefits are amazing, and I’m excited to finally land an actual job in this field.

But I’m also terrified. Three skills they noted on the original jib posts were SQL, R and Python. I don’t have too much experience, save for using R back in college for data visualization and reporting. For SQL and Python, I’ve done some self-teaching with online resources. I feel all my experiences so far has been shallow at best

TBF, i do think this is an entry level job as it doesn’t mention any specific years of experience. I also see the roadmap and they are definitely easing me up until i can perform at 100% efficiency.

Still, i am terrified of not liking the work environment, steep learning curve (my biggest worry), and generally not performing to the expectations.

The impostor syndrome is real

EDIT:

I posted this before going to bed last night, and woke up to all of the overwhelmingly supportive comments. Thank you guys so much. I feel much better!

EDIT2:

So got a few PMs and comments on how I got hired, and tips for getting recruiters to notice you. Here are things that I've done and some things I wished I've done. **NOTE THIS IS BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE**, and may not match your situations

* My main sources to look for jobs were LinkedIn and the above-mentioned University's job page. I did not want my email inbox to be flooded with job alerts from 10+ sources, so I stuck with just those two.
*  I limited myself to how my applications I turned in, because I wanted more jobs to be posted before I go on an application spree. I applied to around 14 jobs each week
* Been more than a year since my graduation, so 14 x 52 = 728 applications total, give or take
* I WISH I had an internship opportunity, but covid hit in 2019 and all of the internship programs were being canceled, so I graduated without any experience
* As I mentioned in my main post, I used online resources to self-teach all the necessary skills. [Alex The Analyst](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM&amp;t=712s&amp;ab_channel=AlexTheAnalyst) on Youtube has been my biggest source of learning, followed by other websites that offer free learning.
* Created a GitHub page to use as a portfolio to showcase my work.
* I created a sort-of cheat sheet where I wrote down answers for questions that were gonna be asked during interview. I read off the answers during zoom interviews, but also practiced on making the responses sound natural some of the questions were, but not limited to:
   * Why \*this\* company?
   * Tell us about your most difficult/successful project
   * Tell us about skills you have that may help for this posistion
* I was brought down and left feeling disappointed with constant rejections and ghosting, but that didn't stop me from applying again and again.
* Also had temp jobs to help me get by."

wbydzy,0,2022-07-30,Does switching careers to software engineering make sense for me?,PCnuggles,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/wbydzy/does_switching_careers_to_software_engineering/,"Earlier this year my fiancée talked me into doing a full-stack web-developer bootcamp. As I come to the end of it I'm starting to have doubts that switching careers is a good choice for me. Here are the details on how my current career stacks up against SWE:
 

The money:  
      I currently work a union job in the trades making around 90-95k, ~120k with pension and benefits added on. There are good annual raises and I'm getting an unusual 18.5% over the next 3 years. The average salary for software engineers in my country is 75k, and senior engineers average 100k. There are companies that hire for much more, and the company my fiancée works at (FAANG tier) hires developers in certain roles at 150k. My pension is great and expected to be $5000 a month at 55 or $8000 a month at 65, and my benefits are equally fantastic. If I change careers I know I won't be getting anything like that, however I don't know exactly how different things will be. I know my fiancée's company has a mandatory pension plan that comes out of your pay and generally isn't well liked, and their benefits come in different tiers but are expensive and mediocre compared to mine. I think getting a FAANG tier job would be difficult but perhaps not impossible, however my growth might be limited by the fact that I don't have a degree of any sort and I don't have the ability to do an internship or take a lower paying job because I have rent to pay.

The lifestyle:  
The bad thing about my work is that it doesn't have a great work-life balance. I work 10 hour days with a drive that is anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour each way. Overtime is not uncommon when things are busy in the summer. The good thing about my job is that in the winter I get 3 months off and I occasionally get random days off due to weather. In the summer I'm busy and tired sometimes but I still have enough time to spend with my fiancée and friends.  
If I were to make the change to SWE I could expect better hours and possibly work from home, however I'd be working year round and have much less vacation time. It's a trade off, but I'm not really sure which is better or if they're about the same overall.  

Other things to consider:  
My job is pretty comfortable other than waking up at 5:30-6am. I have AC and can listen to podcasts all day, plus it isn't too mentally taxing. It is challenging enough and provides me with very useful skills, plus I enjoy what I do. While it isn't an overly prestigious job, it still gets respect from a lot of people. I think my fiancée doesn't like having to tell people that I'm in construction, but that is likely because her parents are very well off and know plenty of high class people. I currently out earn nearly everyone in our social circle but construction just doesn't have the same ring to it as working for a large company in software.

Please, let me know what you think!

I needed some help with evaluating my chances for an MS admit to a non-thesis CS program for Fall'23 and also which universities I'd have a good shot at:

GRE: 323(160 Q + 163 V + 4 AWS)

TOEFL: 120

CGPA: 8.4(Not an NIT/IIT), major GPA: 9.1, graduated in 2020

Work Ex: Have been working at a top product company for over a year, was at a big investment bank for 7-8 months before that. I have also done 3 corporate internships during college(no research internship).

Some pros: I have done TAships in college, held leadership positions and was a mentor in various mentoring programs. I'll have fairly strong LORs.

Cons: I have no research papers(I have decent projects, but didn't publish any paper and since I plan to apply for a non-thesis MS, idk how much not having research papers will hurt my profile).
A big con is I had a backlog back in my first year(I had medical issues and it was a weak subject for me, but it's not a CS-related subject), which I cleared asap.

Can someone please help me with suggestions on my chances in general and which colleges I have a good chance of getting into, cause I've heard varying feedback about my profile.

Still work in Cybersecurity, but am not getting any bites for Programming internships, even being willing to drop from $28/hr to $15/hr.

My SQL, Java, and Python have rusted to nothing, despite having a degree in Database Development.

Currently pursuing B.S. in Software Development at WGU. Completed by May 2023, most likely.

Have a couple good full stack projects on my github and will be adding more as I complete my degree, but haven't coded in months.

Basically, my code is dormant and needs reactivation. I figured work + school + projects all being in DevOps would be preferable to maximize my skills--but, while working cybersecurity, it highly detracts from DevOps.

Is it possible to get a Software Development internship while being very rusty, or should I shore up my coding, fill out my github, and complete my Bachelors first?"

At the end of university, I did an internship and worked for a year at a company (in office working) and had a very good environment and the relationship with my co-workers and people there was nice, everyone liked me but again, it was just a office things, none became more than a friendly colleague.

Once I graduated, I did a gap semester of traveling without a plan, and I had the time of my life, where I learnt very valuable lessons about the world, myself and other people. Among the people I met I will highlight 2 for the post.

One was a Latino that I felt his people skills was like a second nature. He was extremely charismatic, positive, genuine and treated everybody amazingly, that he was like a people magnet everywhere he went to.
The other one was an American third age lady backpacking solo that impacted me because of her courage, extremely easy-going personality, always truly integrating in the community she went to and her extremely low level of ego.

I see some of my friends in my city that have little technical skills and less knowledge that me or others, and still make their way with social intelligence.

Very soon I'm going abroad to work and study and those skills I want to improve will be crucial to improve my time abroad, as they will allow me to have bigger impact in people which will help me with contacts and with healthier and more meaningful friends and maybe a good, stable relationship. And will probably help me make my working career more successful and happier.

Do you have any advice that can give me to improve my personality, charisma and positivity to achieve healtier relationship with people and have more emotional connections with them?

Any book recomendations are welcome as well, 
I've read Dale Carnegie's how to win friends and influence others and some other sales books

I am a person with knowledge and culture, who can recognize that I have positive qualities and also flaws, I don't have social anxiety or something like that, I can have conversations, I an quite technical when speaking and have good general knowledge about many things, but I have a struggle to get to people's emotions and to connect with them in a deeper level to build more sustainable connections.

I’m currently a rising sophomore at a pretty good state school (Top 50 CS in the US I think) but I’ve never applied for an internship or a job before. I was hoping to get an internship next summer, but since I know nothing about the process I was hoping that someone more familiar can answer some questions about it! I’ll list them below.

  1. where do i find internships for summer ’23, and when should i start looking?

  2. i’ve not taken a DSA course, but i do practice leetcode (usually one or two per day) so should I apply as early as possible or as late as possible so i have more practice?

  3. this may be a stupid question, but for zoom interviews and stuff are you supposed to be dressed up? I’ve never interviewed for anything before besides studying abroad so any other tips are also appreciated

  4. I would love to get into something like a google step or microsoft explore (as would everyone i assume lol), but considering I have 0 prior experience with coding at a job or for research, is it worth my time to apply to those? 

  5. does anyone have really good experience with a company/program that you have interned for in the past, and you would like to recommend?

  6. I’ve heard about some people doing research instead of internships over the summer, is that a viable option for someone with my level of experience? and so where do i find those opportunities?

If you have any other advice that doesnt answer any of those questions please feel free to give it as well, thanks!!"

Note: I have changed the names of somethings for privacy since it would make my identity super easy to determine. I put an ""*"" where I replaced a name. Just copy pasted my common app format resume below and left the details so you get an idea what my essays can be about.

As I mentioned in the title, my end goal is to get into the startup space professionally. And I don't mean like one of those unemployed people with ""entrepreneur"" in their bio. My plan is to apply as a business major and then switch to CS ASAP. If you have insight on this I would love to hear it. The reason for this is my EC are business oriented so I think I would have a better chance than applying CS direct and getting dunked on by all the USACO winners and whatnot. I want to do CS because, you know, entrepreneurship. But still, my college list is a bit mixed with schools with a good CS program that I can switch into and some schools that are only good in business with junk CS so I'm open to some Reverse Chanceme.

Demographics: Asian male, family income $300k-400k last year (will be probably half that by the time I apply since my dad quit his job to be an author or something), TN resident.

ACT- 34, no SAT

wc4m2e,0,2022-07-30,My current lawyer is an idiot and is messing up my case,HeavyDiamond1619,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/wc4m2e/my_current_lawyer_is_an_idiot_and_is_messing_up/,"I want to switch lawyers, because my lawyer is lying about many things in his own life (like stating that he has an accountant that is upset that I haven’t paid the $10k part of my bill as we are on a hybrid-contingency agreement and I’ve already stated to him I would pay him monthly beginning this month… he doesn’t have an accountant, his office is small and the only other person there is an intern and his wife that uses her maiden name to try to hide the fact that they’re married while she’s working as his assistant. The whole office is shifty as fuck it seems), and then this week, he messed up in a major way on my case, ignoring my emails over ten days about a deadline with the case where paperwork was due back to the defendant by August 1… literally doesn’t even reply back to the dozen plus emails where I’m writing him “please let me know if I should fill this out or not” in regards to the forms due on August 1. Emailed him on July 19, asking for guidance and explained to him that this was due on August 1, and he didn’t reply until just yesterday, and the form technically has to be filled out by my doctor. It’s a 9 page form, and I figured we wouldn’t be required to fill it out and was awaiting further instruction from my lawyer, and he literally doesn’t get back with me until the Friday before it’s due to tell me to have my doc and me fill it out? Really?

So the lawyer I want to talk with stated this to me: “because you’re represented, I am unable to talk to you due to our Rules of Professional Conduct unless your lawyer is also on the line” which is awkward because I don’t want to have my attorney on the phone while I’m trying to see if the new attorney will take my case and let me split from this guy.

Any advice here!? I’m very worried my attorney is going to screw my case up, and want to find a new one asap, and the one I found seems great as he’s worked on a very similar case against the same entity I am suing (this lawyer sued the same entity for the same reason and won a decent settlement for the client, whereas my lawyer keeps fucking up).

Thank you"

I'm not sure whether I want to do product DS or ML DS yet but I've just finished my first ML DS internship at a large manufacturing company. I know alot of full time Data Science roles in big tech are product/analytics ish more than ML.  Since I'm not sure yet I'm still just aiming for ML DS internships but if I land a big company for a Product DS internship I would probably just take that. Will FAANG/Big Tech value my DS ML internships when I apply for new grad positions which are probably Product DS? I mean I still build dashboards and stuff in these DS ML internships but I don't really do any of that A/B testing or experimenting stuff."
wc4s6e,1,2022-07-30,Severe social disappointment,ForbiddenWoodss,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/wc4s6e/severe_social_disappointment/,"My management consulting firm had the first 3-day offsite after COVID last month and it turned out to be a disaster for me.

- I'm with my firm for &lt;3 years which I joined straight from B-school. However, I was largely working outside my home country unit due to which I didn't know a lot of folks in the offsite.

- My English (and for that matter any language) is not the most fluid - I don't know what the issue is, but I speak in a slightly broken fashion (the opposite of fluent). This has been the case since childhood. It plays on my confidence and how people perceive me.

- I have had trouble connecting with people since I can remember - I was alone several times during lunch breaks in primary school (grades 1-5), relatively friendless in high school (fought with my friends who don't keep in touch now), had issues gelling with people in college and B-school as well. Having said that, I worked a lot on my social skills and now have a few friends I can count on.

- I had tried to avoid getting into a B-school, and then into consulting but circumstances placed me in this situation. I was shit scared of management consulting because I knew how my personality was; a challenge of this magnitude was only going to cause me heartburn down the road. On the other hand, I am gritty and somehow managed to convert my internship into an offer and then got promoted.

- I sometimes just feel terrible being put in places where I'm out of my depth, such as in an offsite where I have to cope with people with above-average social skills (while I being a stand-out case of a misfit).

- I almost felt like a social outcast - knew nobody, struggling, and was alone, and it felt like people avoiding me a little.
- People who knew me a little didn't approach me often
- Had 1-2 painfully awkward conversations with people (who might have facepalmed after it)
- Nobody to drink with, and leaving the dinner party at 11, and hearing stories of 6 AM exits the next day, and people complaining about tired legs from 'all the dancing.'

- This is nothing new given my experience since childhood. Nevertheless, it pains badly. The good news is that I will 'drink' even this pain, but sometimes I feel like cursing my fortune because this sort of experience is one of the MANY in my last 30 years of existence."

However, I'm still two weeks until my internship ends. I can apply within the next month, but I won't be prepared for the OAs because I've been several months out of practice for Leetcode.


Does applying early matter or is it better to keep a list of companies/deadlines and apply when I feel I'm almost ready to take on OAs again?"

I don't have much experience in retail or food. I need to hold a job while I finish my last year of university. I have personally handed my resume to 30+ places in my local area, but only 1 interview, from McDonalds. The interviewer asked me why I want a job in fast food if I'm an engineer, I froze at that part, how do I approach this question? Do I lie and tell them I want to switch to retail/management? I'm only doing it so that I can earn quick money for my school year. Any help would be much appreciated!

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Thank you everyone for your suggestions! Wow, I never thought that I could be overqualified for something, this is a first. I have just been trying to impress the hiring managers but I didn't realize that they look for people who would stick around, it makes sense now that I think about it. I guess I will try to apply to campus jobs and IT jobs. I should mention that I'm from Canada and live in a small city (my uni is the biggest attraction), finding part-time internships in this place is very difficult and most of them are co-ops  (which are always full-time). Regardless, if I want to apply to a retail or fast food chain in desperate times, I would need to dumb down my resume or just hand in my application.

Basically, the gist is that I've been trusting my state's Vocational Rehabilitation program and my job coach's promises that they were going to help me get back into I.T. by contacting employers and arranging an on-the-job training scenario through which they paid the employer.

I trusted them, and listened when my coach told me not to worry, and not to get another job on my own because he was such an expert he would get me something no-question.  Instead he told me to focus on getting my medication dialed in and on my health.  I recently decided to try medication for various issues like ADHD, generalized anxiety disorder, and depression.  

When I saw the resume he sent me back yesterday that he is sending to employers, I knew I was in trouble.  He has clearly not been putting in any effort and is currently trying to get me into an internship designed for college students that is only temporary.

I just found out I'm losing my place to live in 1.5 months, have almost no savings.  I am supposed to start a part time evening job next week, which I took to bring in some money while waiting on the promises from this job coach.  

Now I know I'm on my own. Harsh lesson.  There is one job I want to apply for right now, it's at a nonprofit, it's low-level IT and they say they're willing to train someone up.  I also realize I am going to have to possibly just take whatever non-IT jobs I can get just to survive.  

I'm old, I'm struggling, and panicking due to my life situation.  I didn't have a resume for years because I have terrible anxiety around it.  I know how bad my work history is and how it looks.  My mind isn't too sharp at the moment with all my worries and the new meds.  Worst stress of my life.  Any help appreciated, but just know that I know it sucks and I have huge stress about dealing with it.

If you want a little more detail, check out this post which might have some more info:

Below is a link to the 3-page resume the coach came up with for me, and also an old 1-page resume from when I worked in I.T.

https://imgur.com/a/Oqpmdik

EDIT: The reason I'm posting is that I know this resume is long and terrible and I need help fixing it.  I have huge anxiety about this and overthink everything to the point of paralysis, which is why I had hopes the job coach was going to help me through this"

Am I able to Intern in the states on a J1 visa for a different company promptly after my 8 months at the first company?
I know I could simply extend my internship to 12 but was curious if I could get a separate J1 for the summer. 

If anyone knows the process or has done this please let me know.

I’m a girl, a rising senior, who is actually starting to look into a trade as a potential career option in part bc I don’t fully know what I want to major in and simultaneously want a high income job. 

When I was doing my internship, something I noticed is that I didn’t like having to walk through cobwebs in the hot sun just to count the boats at the camp, yet I actually rlly enjoyed working w the kids and it made me realize I want to have kids of my own.

I’m a fast typist, I think that I could learn to work w my hands. I can have a good memory for things and feel like I’d be good at learning through repetition? I feel like I actually am capable of understanding things if I try to understand them, I have maintained high grades in school. Ive had a good memory for things I have read online before. I tend to be scared of getting burned by things which is why I don’t know how to cook yet.

I deal w depression and anxiety. I don’t generally know how good I am with my hands.

I like having time when I come home to sit down and watch some television. I struggle w dealing w anxiety in regards to my future

I’d also be comfortable w a job that is average income but doesn’t make me completely miserable

Something that I really liked about the internship is the fact that it was a non toxic work environment, but also to be completely honest I think that assisting the kids is smthn that rlly helped me feel more mature and independent. I obviously received some help from the people around me but still

I’ve been into MBTI since 6th grade even though I know it’s pseudoscience. I tend to be consistent abt completing tasks I am given even if I don’t enjoy them. 

I have difficulties w my sleeping schedule. I’m really scared bc I feel like I absolutely just don’t know what I want to do w my life. 

I think daily abt the fact that my brother is in rehab and smthn I was thinking abt when helping out the kids is how I’d hate to see black kids (I’m black) go down a bad path in life due to abuse at home or just anything in general 

I’m not a huge math fan and dropped pre calculus in junior yr bc I felt like I hadn’t learned enough abt algebra 2 during online schooling

I really hate having to wake up early in the morning. I cried rlly hard when I got home today bc I had to walk to the bus stop w my dad (who is a stupid alcoholic) bc we can’t afford to get our car fixed. I was j crying abt how hopeless I feel.

I can’t help but think when I think abt school in general that it’s like I just want it to be over as soon as possible.

wce4c6,0,2022-07-30,No freshman information science/IS+DS is not a good major,stephcurry1130,UIUC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/wce4c6/no_freshman_information_scienceisds_is_not_a_good/,"Over the past 4 or so months, there have been like a million questions about information science on this sub (most negative some positive) so I am going to make my stance clear on it as someone who was an IS major (now stats with CS minor). This post is so long I am going to divide it into multiple parts.

*1. Careers from the iSchool: Expectation vs Reality:*

So let me start with something that most of you would probably agree with me on. The iSchool really pushes their agenda that the IS and IS+DS majors prepare you for a career in Data Science. Is it true? Technically yes but what roles specifically? Data Analyst Roles which don't really require a great deal of depth in DS? You're damn right. These relatively low paying roles can be occupied by someone with a high school diploma and very basic python and excel knowledge. This is not something you pay nearly 40k a year for (in state price). The major opens up 0 doors in anything CS or DS related and what is left is business analyst or UI/UX roles. But hold up did you see the companies! We had FAANG interns and people working at JP Morgan! But why on a 78k starting salary? Oh maybe its because the positions that the major opens up are some of the lowest paying technical roles out there. A 78,000 starting salary is one of the highest on campus. Sounds cool right? Well wait till you see where IS graduates start working. Bay Area, Seattle, Chicago, NYC area. Only some of the most expensive areas to live on earth. Yes you can make the argument that most technical majors will have a majority of students moving there post graduation but they are compensated accordingly compared to that.

*2. The coursework compared to other technical majors that open the same doors*

There are cheaper majors at UIUC that go into much more depth in DS than the IS or even IS+DS coursework. For example Statistics (my double major) requires you to take Probability (2x), Modeling (2x), Intro Python, and 4 technical electives that enforce a grounding of DS through coursework that is already based on Calc I -&gt; III and linear. What does IS or IS+DS have in comparison to this? Calc I, Linear Algebra, Modeling for DS (300 lvl cs class), Intro Python, and Algos for DS (CS277). They took some of the most difficult classes at UIUC and created easier versions of them to accommodate the X+DS majors. I'm sure this is fair to this paying more tuition to do it instead of Stats or Math.

*3. Should I apply to CS/CS+X or Information Science?*

Unless you are trying to do UI/UX design for the foreseeable future, there is 0 reason for why you should pick Information Science over CS. CS basically does everything that IS does but at a more technical level in 1 year of instruction. I read a comment on a recent IS related post that said you learn more in 1 year of CS than you do in IS and quite honestly it was spot on. People say the IS degree combines people and technology but I fail to understand how that is a skill that cannot be learned through experience or at worst outside the classroom on your own. The IS and IS+DS majors are cluttered with ethics classes that do little good for the students trying to get jobs after it.

How how about the coursework? The CS core is made up of 124,128,173,222,225,233,241,357,361,374, and 421. You are also required to take up to calc 3 (depending on the cs+) along with a math257 requirement. This level of rigor is something that will actually get you ready for jobs in CS and DS and you get 400 lvl CS class registration priority as a cherry on the cupcake. You can take classes such as Data Mining and Machine Learning to really add something valuable and something that requires skill to your knowledge base.

*4. I know I offended some people so...*

I guess this is a personal opinion and a pretty strong one which I think can be backed up. The IS and IS+DS majors have significant flaws and it exposes a severe gap between the expectations and realities of doors it will open following graduation. I am not saying that IS is a terrible major for everyone. In fact, it might be a cool and easier thing to do if you want to do UI/UX or want to get by doing more humanities work while still having a slight STEM background. Understand that the title was just clickbait."

When she signed it she was working and getting paid $750 a week. We also got about $20,000 in life insurance from my dad. 

At the beginning of June my sister decided to go on a leave of absence for two week due to depression. At the time I understood and switched the chores around so that she could have time to recuperate. At the end of the 2 weeks she was supposed to turn in a signed form from her doctor stating that she is diagnosed with depression and that the leave was valid. She kept saying she was going to make an appointment but she kept “forgetting.” She finally made an appointment for the last week of July. She got the form signed but later that day told me her job emailed her a few days ago and let her go. She’s applied to three jobs but that’s all she’s done.

Since June me and my boyfriend have been paying for everything including groceries, rent ($1600 between my boyfriend and I), her phone plan, wifi, and utilities. All she has done at home is played games on the computer, eat all of the food we buy in about 1 week and sleep. I am currently working 40 hours and in the second week of august I start my internship which is another 40 hours. I’m already stressed as it is but this will be even worse. 

Prior to moving in she bought a cat, we have to do now there are 3 cats in the house. When it is her turn to feed them, clean their litterbox, or their water fountain she usually doesn’t do it for a few days. She lets the litter boxes sit for 3-4 before she does it due to my nagging.

wcjtej,2,2022-07-31,Should I even bother to apply for positions that seem out of my league when it comes to professional experience despite meeting other qualifications and having a high degree in the field? (Civil and Environmental Engineering),tonioleeps,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/wcjtej/should_i_even_bother_to_apply_for_positions_that/,"Disclaimer: First time posting in this sub but would like to know other good places to post if this sub is not the most appropriate. I will also try my best to be brief with the background info.

I am a recent graduate from a university with a reputable engineering program (Bachelor's and Master's). Since I started my job search, I have noticed that even for entry level jobs I do not meet the minimum qualifications especially when it comes to professional experience. Other qualifications that make me feel uneasy are when they want years of experience using a specific software or technical tool. Even though I was exposed to using a variety of software through school, the exposure was never consistent. In addition, all of the jobs I had prior to graduating are not related to engineering and I have never had an internship. However, I do meet other qualifications when it comes to things such as specific trainings or certificates (i.e. HAZWOPER and EIT) and other soft skills. Some of my peers tell me that I shouldn't care what the qualifications are and I should just apply anyway, but like any engineer, I want to be efficient with this process. 

Many questions come to mind. How seriously should I take these experience related qualifications? Should I only be looking for internships because I never had one? Should I ignore any jobs that require any amount of experience?"

Where To Start At My Level Of Experience, Education, Certifications, and ATTITUDE?",PsyNougat,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/wcl7u0/school_nutrition_director_looking_to_switch/,"Hello there! I am a 35 yo who has been a School Nutrition Director for the past 9 years. I was recently laid off due to my job being outsourced to a consultant to save money. I have been evaluating what I loved about my current job and what's been consistently interesting to me. I had always loved computers and have built them since I was a child. I have always felt very comfortable with computers and find it second nature to learn. My favorite part of my job honestly was helping others solve their computer issues due to our IT guy being non-existent, streamlining my work using different software, and running a cubeSQL server/database because our school was too cheap to afford a program management software at the time. 

My question concerns where a good starting point for me would be to shift into networking administration with my current experience, education, certifications, and attitude. I'm aware of how challenging it can be since many people are shifting into IT, so I wanted to make a concerted effort to give helpful information about myself. I wanted to organize it based on the great wiki here and hope to gain some insight and perhaps a roadmap for me to move into the networking career field.

**Experience**

My experience includes directing and supervising 3 different campuses with various nutrition programs. This included a lot of grants management, auditing, supervising, budgeting, food safety, managing people, nutrition education, teaching, customer service, qualifying and feeding low-income students. This required a lot of streamlining with excel, maintaining our point of sale software, and creating a cubeSQL server/database to house all of the data. On the side, I would do tech support for our administration and staff since I was willing and available to help. Light stuff like fixing printers, setting up printers on computers, re-installing windows, backing up school data, troubleshooting, installing and updating cloud storage on everyone's computer so our data is safe. 9 years of doing all of this makes me realize how exhausting this job was. 

**Education**

I have a B.A. in Psychology and a B.S. in Nutrition (Dietetics). Additionally I have 48 credit hours in a Masters In Counseling to become a School Counselor before I decided this career shift would absolutely burn me out during the internship. However, the skills I adopted and learned from this degree immensely helped me out in working with people, communication, and leadership.

**Certifications**

None yet! However, my research had me to looking at CCNA and adjusting based on any feedback received from this post. I eventually want to get in Cloud and am really excited about the growth in this area.

**Attitude**

My job required me to develop excellent communication, team work, leadership, and conflict resolution skills. It was an extremely high pressure job that became easier over time to manage all these things and gain the flexibility to work around different emergencies that parents, state agencies, kitchens, teachers, and admin could throw at you. People seemed to really like working with me  and love watching my supervisors grow. At the end of the day I love working as a team with a common goal and making things really efficient within the organization. 

 

Honestly this past month being unemployed has been really hard. I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts on where to start with this information in mind and I really appreciate the feedback in advance :)"

Din câte am văzut trebuie să fac un REST API dar am niște nelămuriri.

Până acum, am mai lucrat cu PHP ca back-end si acolo n a trebuit să creez un API, luam datele pur si simplu din baza de date.

Acel API este vizibil pe internet sau poate rămâne pe server și să fie folosit și văzut doar local?Am înțeles că se poate folosi un JWT pentru a nu se poate da GET de către oricine dar tot mi se pare ciudat să ai atâtea informații pe net.

Altă întrebare, siteurile mari așa funcționează?Au API-uri foarte mari care există pe internet sau se procedează într-un alt mod?

I am an **Indian, male, first-generation, middle-class, gap-year student**. I belong to a developing city and attend a decent school: it does well academically, but not many opportunities are provided in sports/clubs/fests etc. My school's graduating batch is of \~200 students each year, of whom 2-3 students go abroad (USA/UK/Hong Kong) for higher education.  

&amp;#x200B;

Intended major: Computer Science (I have an inclination towards CS and entrepreneurship) 

SAT: 1520/1600 (First attempt)

Grades: 97% in Sophomore year + 98.25% in Senior year (Loosely translates into a 4.0 GPA or A+, I believe) 

Rank: 3/200

Coursework: It is an Indian board, and thus does not offer APs. However, arguably, I have pursued rigorous coursework at my school: English, Physics, Chemistry, Maths, and Computer Science in my Senior year.

LORs: All of them are highly appreciative in terms of academics and interpersonal skills. One of the teachers (Physics) has called me the most talented and industrious student in his 17 years of experience.

ECs: 

* Creative Head + Director of Technical Operations for a local bakery in my city
* Conceptualised and developing a ghost startup (does not have real impact on ground yet)
* Completed Google's Data Analytics course (\~4 months, 180 hours) Graded 100% in all course tests
* Formed the Student Council in my school, after presenting to the school authorities on its importance 
* Built and deployed a project to make the online tests being held during lockdown foolproof and more secure
* Completed a course called Clever Harvey's JuniorCEO; awarded as the Valedictorian for 'exemplary display of 21st century skills and leadership'
* Internship at a youth-led club in Graphics Department
* Participated in World Scholar's Cup
   * Ranked first in Literature and Science among 350+ scholars
   * Led my team of 3, ranked third in Team Quiz
* Student Council
   * House Vice-Caption in Freshman and Sophomore year (Highest position)
   * School Vice-Captain in Junior and Senior year (Second-highest position)
* Photographer for school assemblies

&amp;#x200B;

I think this sums me up mostly. All of the projects that I've undertaken have been independent as my school does not really support such ECs. I believe that my profile is strong academically (I will be re-taking the SAT though). But, my ECs are not as well-developed as other students from Tier-1 cities and schools. Therefore, the people who I've been taking advice from suggest me not to aim for HYPS (T10s basically) -- but, I feel (I'm sorry if this sounds braggy) that I deserve an admission because I am intellectually capable and have constantly tried to make most of the opportunities available to me. 

However, I am open to being humbled by the reality. I am confident about my ambition and believe that I will work hard to succeed no matter the college I go to. It goes without saying that I would be beyond happy if I am able to get into Stanford as it has long been a dream of mine; but, if that reality is not possible because I go to a tier-3 school, I am fine with the fact that -- acknowledging that I am still more privileged than others --I haven't been rejected on the premise of shying away from working on what I've been served by birth, but because of the experience other students possess due to their environment which is conducive w.r.t. foreign universities.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you!"

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I read a comment on a post a thirty minutes ago about a fellow redditor being attracted to chaos and crisis, and me chiming in became a page(s)-long thing. In many ways a motivational post which might stand just as well on its own.

Initially, this text was supposed to address university studies and work, but escalated to life with ADHD and rejecting expectations about normal/neurotypical behaviors and standards. I think I wrote a book instead. There goes my sunday plans for productivity. But hopefully, it can matter to some/two/one. I have tried sectioning the text for easier reading. **This has developed into a long darn read.**

7 pages on TNR, font size 12, 4391 words - plus this sentence.

**You will go through two headlines** for background on me\*\*, before reaching an index\*\* giving an **overview of eight headlines** for paragraphs or shorter texts. *Length of section(s) varies greatly*. The text will also give links to four resources for establishing control on your life (or attempting it, as I am).

**All qualities described in this post (intelligence, ability, qualities in general) are to be read as what I believe are very often ADHD-qualities or results of leveraging ""interest"" and ""urgency"",** it is not a humble brag about myself.

Rather, I think what I'm trying to say is .. If you follow what you feel good about, are interested in, and thrive in - you will do great. If you dont feel like youre doing great, but you can recognize that you are doing good, that might just be a matter of perspective. Good is a long way from bad, muddled, hopeless, lost etc. Let me reference weeks of 2hr sleeps due to insomnia, breaking down in tears as a consequence, executive dysfunction a plenty, general brain fog as a morning routine or various other symptoms to remind you of what \_that feels like. If you feel good - thats f'in great and I love you for it, as should you.

Feeling great, and being great, no matter what it is or how you do it, is what we should pursue as long as we want to pursue it. Our interests change, and its okay to change with it. Reject the norm, reject the expectations, thrive in chaos.

**HOW THE POST ORIGINALLY STARTED**

""32M here. Diagnosed earlier this year. Chaos and crisis for the win. I work in emergency management, always been attracted to those unpredictable situations where (what I now know are called) neurotypicals might be more likely to be negatively stressed. I have always thrived in those, with my four train tracks of simultaneous thought processes and picking up every-single-kind of indicator and warning signs in body language and the environment around me.""

(That paragraph was the original start of all this.)

**INDIVIDUAL TOGETHER**

I am also in my first functional relationship, and have been with one partner for about 4 years (28-32) and we have two amazing dogs. Before that, I was single for a 8 years, and had some flings here and there before that. I have always been prone to loneliness and ""outsiderness"", even if well-functioning. I have not had the patience for facades and faking things since my entire upbringing was basically that. I have no familiar relations, and at the age of 26, I finally went for a psych eval, and together we came to the answer that not only did I have no support network family-wise (no contact, no communication, no relevance to my life), but I also never got any emotional support or love, like everyone else did. Completely neglected. It hard, and it hit heavy, and I broke down in tears *(someone is definitely peeling onions while Im writing this..)* and it was a truth I needed spoken out loud by someone else or someone qualified.

Most of my life has been a fleeting, temporary living. Going undiagnosed and being vastly different from my partner, there has been a lot of ups and downs, a lot of conflicts and a lot of heavy conversations. I have changed from who I was before, and in the beginning of, the relationship, and I have tried to change according to interests/hobbies/hitting the wall quite a few times as well.

Days since our last argument: 0. It happened this morning. Getting the diagnosis gave me and us something to actually relate to instead of thinking it was all logical/illogical, sensible/not sensible etc. What has kept us going, undiagnosed and diagnosed, has been communication. We still have to establish basic things, 4 years in. Recognize that you are individuals with different needs, boundaries, barriers and challenges. Expect conflict, try to remain level headed. I am myself logic driven, my partner is emotionally driven. Its a struggle, but we are still in it and we both want to function better together. You never want to harm or negatively affect your lifepartner. Thats my basis.

**So, you know** ***a bit*** **about me now. Let me tell you how it worked out. Because it did, and I still have a lot left to give. Believe it or not, this a telling of hope and joy and life and grit and ---succeeding despite it all, while having ADHD both undiagnosed and diagnosed.**

**ADULT DECISIONS**

When the time came to for deciding on university etc, I was very aware of my lack of interest in attending any of the programmes I knew others were doing. I was also very aware that I didnt want to do anything I was not interested in.

**TEN YEARS OF OF WORK/TRAVEL/EXPLORE/LEARN**

Ten years followed with different kinds of everything.

I lived in China working as an English teacher at 21 (I had never really travelled for anything until that move), where I also did Wing Chun (martial arts). My Wing Chun classes probably had the best highlights, getting throat punched by a Chinese police man, sparring on the wooden man post, repeating a kick a hundredPLUS times and also where I learned to count. The Avatar mountains was a great place to visit to end my (only one year) stay.

I have also worked different kinds of security work (uniform and undercover) in a very fast-paced environment, renovation worker, kindergarten teacher (the best place to shift to change a rising bad temper!), store clerk, warehouse worker (the worst place in regards to monotony and stuck with your own thoughts. I still stayed for a 3 years because lf the good pay, despite the high stress about failing to rise and rise and rise to yet higher production goals, ugh). I never had a treshold for what I would or would not do, as in my head, noone is or should be considered to be lower than others. I lived for experiences.

My best work experiences categorically have definitely been security, service and children. The same areas of work which I would volunteer for alongside paid work. I always quit on my own terms, and often to address something personally (getting a temper from dealing with someone or something repetitive in one job? I would fix that with wprking in a kindergarten for a stint) I always had offers of work in the jobs I left, because I was great at it. I always gave it my all, because enjoyed it and I was interested in it. Key. Points.

\-

**JAPAN**

My work experiences was mixed on and off with solo travelling to explore other languages, cultures and environments.

I once decided I actually wanted to try practicing Aikido (martial arts), and there was no viable option in my local area. I also wanted to experience it authentically, how it was meant to be taught and studied. So, I moved to Tokyo for a few months (first time in Japan) to train at the headquarters (Hombu Dojo). I rented a shady apartment in a shady way, and I had little comforts on a small budget, and all I did was train Aikido with the locals and explore Tokyo. Vastly different from Western practices, older black belts with decades of training would not only attend advanced classes, but regularly also attend beginner classes. Basics were the foundation, after all. Seeing and experiencing that, I really felt that, and it has really stuck with me ever since. With the exception of one person, I only surrounded myself with Japanese people. --and with the exception of that one non-Japanese, they were all men in the age-range 40-80 who had had black belts for decades. It was natural socialzinn, and I had a deep appreciation for the (sometimes deeper) conversations we had. I am also still astounded by how these older and busier people could go out to drink sake after evenings of Aikido, so very often! I couldnt keep up! My gosh.. but they were great times. It was fun and I cherish the memories, the laughter, the red/pink faces of my no-longer sober elders whom I would call temporary friends. I then went back to my normal life like I no longer had left.

Actually.. Correction, for my entire experience of Japan.. I was *plagued* by one thing.

Two days before initially leaving for Japan, I had been at a friend's place in a different country for a few days.. and then I got the idea of walking Camino de Santiago. This is a pilgrimage by foot from Saint Jean Pied de Port in South-west France, across the Pyrenees on the french/spanish-border. It follows through four of Spain’s major cities, to Santiago in Spain. I got the idea.. and I could not get rid of it. My mind obsessed over it. So.. By the time I left for Japan, *I knew ..* I was going to walk the Camino.

\-

**A PILGRIM AT THE END OF THE WORLD**, Finisterre / Finis Terra

Upon leaving Japan, I think it only took me a week or so, before I left for Switzerland for a short event and a catch up with friends. I had decided that the regular Camino-route wasnt for me. I wanted to go longer. 804.6 km (500 miles) was too odd a number for me, and .. I wasnt comfortable following the norm .. am I ever? I decided I wanted to do at least 1,000 km (612.3 miles), anything over that was a random bonus. So, I crossed the swiss/french-border by foot and took parts of the French way. That whole thing is a chapter by itself, really, but I can say I stopped counting at 1,000 km (did more). I walked all the way to the western coast to reach Fisterra, a ""mythical place"" on the rough Costa da Morte. The name of the village supposedly comes from the Romans who saw the rocky place as the end of the world. I found it very much fitting as my end point. I took my first dive into the ocean of the entire hike, and I observed the sunset all the while not really experiencing a spiritual rebirth, but I had come to realize which city I wanted to live and be in on a permanent basis.

\-

**COURSES, TRAINING AND LEARNING FOR LIFE**

I attended courses of interest whereever they were internationally (outdoor survival instructor, survival in different climates, wilderness first aid instructor, kidnapping and anti-kidnapping by former mexican counter narcotics, emergency medical management in remote areas and bad situations taught by current Special Forces, Grid-down-scenarioes. Things like this and that, I followed my sparks of interest.

For a time, over some years, I also spent my earned money on travelling for and attending extreme endurance events to learn about myself, experience people as realy as they could be, pushing themselves to the point of tears and seeing other people step up when it mattered, was amazing. I also used these events actively to put down or eliminate my ego if I experienced any signs of that need. Several events were signed up for for that reason alone.

Point being, **rejecting the expected norm** of going to university (to study something, anything) is and **was not a bad thing**. Not. At. All. *Time goes too fast to postpone anything*, was my mantra.

\-

**UNIVERSITY?**

I did however, decide to go to uni at 27. While volunteering at a refugee camp in Greece (quick rise to teamleader, logistics, management, security and childrens activitites). Y'know, that urgency type kind of thing. Someone I volunteed with, from a different country, told me about university programmes for emergency management. So, I looked up my opportunites upon getting back, and within 5 months I was on the uni-track, where I had never thought I would be.

I was going to get a bachelors degree in exactly that, emergency management. Everything so far has been pre-diagnosis. Up until deciding to get evaluated for ADHD 6 months before the diagnosis, I never had an inkling, nobody mentioned the possibility to me.

(*The signs were there all along however, obviously.* *~~Alas, childhood neglect~~*\*..)\*

\-

**STUDY PROGRESSION AND ESCALATIONS AS COPING MECHANISMS**

It was tough retaking courses every semester parallell to normal course progression just to improve the grades due to needing more time to process and learn from every subject. I wasnt even aware I had ADHD, so naturally I had a punishing time with oral exams and school exams too. Fortunately, some were home exams.

Increasing the study load was something that came from experiencing a lot of guilt around not being able to read or prepare for exams, i.e. 7 day exams, where I was only able to function the last 15hrs or so, and experiencing (what I now know to be) massive executive dysfunction, as well as major guilt leading up to those last hours of urgency.

Discovering I could (and was able to) do more courses parallell to normal progression during my 2nd year (undergrad) at uni, made me increase my study load every year, re-taking more and more exams until I was through with the undergrad. Never failed a course, never fell behind on a deadline due to crisis mode for the last few hours of exams.

Upon completing my undergrad, I proceeded to postgrad and a masters programme. I found a natural escalation in ""Societal safety"" which is about how to protect society. Courses were such as crisis management, stress management, international emergency management, preparedness, terrorism, but also preparedness analysis, and a lot of other things I really did not have an interest in. *~~Ughh.~~*

\-

**ADDRESSING THE ESCALATIONS**

I kept adding on extra courses so I could switch between courses according to interest and urgency. Thus was mainly to cope with continued extreme guilt (pre-diagnosis). Having only C's in eight paralell courses is a lot easier to justify than only Cs in three paralell courses. It was also a way for me to explore my personal capacity. Some days, I had three parallell lectures. Hell, I even had three paralell *exams* in 24 hours once.

First year of my MSc (2020-2022), I was doing not the normal 30+30 MSc (ECTS) credits, but 30+30MSc and 15+15BSc. Basically added on one year of undergrad studies to one year of postgrad studies.

Second year (2021-2022), I kept that load and added on another MSc (Leading demandinge operations, a masters of management) and various single courses of interest. How far could I take this?

This past fall semester alone, I completed a total of 82.5 ECTS. Throughout the entire academic year, I was also the first student/class representative for my entire study programme (the most recent one). I was the first student rep ever on the programme, and represented every single cohort. It was a full-time job, really. But I got one hell of a recommendation letter and reference for it.

**WHAT ABOUT SUMMERS AND VACATIONS?**

I have never taken a ""relaxation vacation"" or gone on vacation to drink and those things that seem to be the norm. I have done what I wanted to do. I get an idea or desire? I recognize it will not go away after a few nights in my head, I start planning, and then I execute.

Since my third year undergrad,  I have spent every summer (usually from april/may until august) exploring work opportunities in form of what one could call internships, but according to contracts mostly have been temporary positions. These opportunies have been (3):

(2020) After my third and final year as undergrad, I worked as a **research assistant at the national defense research institute**. I  got to deep dive into ONE area of geopolitics and open source intelligence and make my own report on a given topic. I had zero knowledge on it beforehand. O-m-g. It was amazing. We were two people on this, and shared the same room. I naturally and gradually took lead, as I was dead serious on the task and structured as hell. He was dissappointibgly useless and not interested, but in hindsight, he was good as a body double and in that way pushed me to the best I could be (even if he rarely did useful/correct/good work  and I usually had to rewrite everything he did). It was frustrating. But if I had been alone, I dont think I couldve made half the effort I did. I see that now. In my free time, I lived on adjacent campus, and I could not relate to the other summer interns at all. They were 19-21 for the most part, science/math and with the best grades. The company I enjoyed (and was dependent on), were audiobooks and authors. Atomic Habits by James Clear and Steven Kotlers books on neuroscience and getting into flow (highly recommend). I attribute a lot of my ability and structure and achievment that summer to incorporating what I got out of those. They made a huge difference, and I am immensly appreciative of them being available as audiobooks and for taking the step to push Play as often as I did.

\-

(2021) After my first year of postgrad studies, I got a position as  a temp for my county's nationally\*\*/State appointed Emergency Management group\*\*. Which is tasked with overseeing emergency management in and across all our municipalities and liaison for the government in that interaction. This was a year into the pandemic, and things had stabilized only in the sense that people were not running around like headless chicken. What an incredible opportunity to learn from. We were a small team of 5-7, there were constantly law changes we had to interpret, communicate and assist with. (Gov: ""*Heres a new law law change, please communicate this to all your municipalities.*"" Our group: \**looks at time*\* *Its late friday evening. Again. Every. Friggin friday evening. Really?* *~~Ugh!~~*"" And that was just one thing!

I also got to work solo on writing up guidance for how the municipalities could holisitically work **preventively against radicalization and violent extremism** (initially a weak area for me) and a second guidance on how they could work on reducing traffic accidents (initially area of no interest). I got to pour my soul into it, and wanting to do my best, I did. I wanted to have something to show for after the summer. I got to interact with law enforcment intelligence analysts, as well as the national Intelligence Services for the wider scope. The interest grew on traffic accidents as well, once urgency kicked in towards the end. A side-bonus to it all, was that I was basically name-dropping myself in interactions with all these organizations and people that were relevant to my field and where I potentially wanted to work. I learned a lot, and *I really started to realize that I really enjoyed learning in general*, but I *really loved it* when I could deep dive or if it could catch my entire interest and focus for a limited time.

\-

(2022) Since end of March, I have been working for my municipality in the role of advisor, with the **responsibility to coordinate resources to manage unforeseen events and emergencies that could negatively impact the municipality's services and/or users**. *Wide* area of responsibility.

I sit in an OPS centre, by myself. Surrounded by monitor-covered walls, I am the go-to contact for local emergency actors (police, fire, health) and any other actors related to the municipality.

For my entire shift I am to predict or handle any kind of event with a potentially negative impact. I am to look for patterns, and how one minor/major problem in one service/area/category could interact with and negatively affect also others. And more.

It got slower once summer and general vacation time really kicked in (I have been at it since end of March), but for slow days.. Oof. I am completely occupied, and nobody works like I do. There is no expectations to do so, but I am spending 5-9 hrs straight hyperfocusing (straight up *work)* on some issue I personally think can be resolved or managed in a different, better way. My hyperfocus between situations at work, really makes the work as a whole hard as hell mentally. I am still constantly to pick up any warning signs, through different local media sites, city cameras, twitter feeds, glithces in other departments etc. I get off work feeling like a grenade exploded inside my head. Consequently, I have lately incorporated hourly alarms on my wrist for water intake, a stronger focus on food and getting some air. It has been desperately needed, in hindsight.

**CURRENTLY. ACADEMICALLY AND PERSONALLY**

I was scheduled to hand in my thesis in June, but I had to extend that to august after the diagnosis flipping my life over. I met a lot of understanding with my supervisor (who has been amazing, but who I have only contacted twice now since March...).

I still havent done any work on my thesis (no accountability, no body doubles available, lost interest after supervisor changed my thesis idea in the beginning), and will have to make up 80ish sensible pages to be delivered in the next 14 days time.

I am working on myself - a lot. Right now, mainly on how to better manage myself and life in general, and trying to make a system for thesis work. I am exploring tools like tasking with [Habitica](https://habitica.com/) (exp and levelling - Im an avid gamer if given the opportunity, which I no longer can give myself unless through this),  [Gnothi journaling](https://gnothiai.com/j), [Workflowy](https://workflowy.com/#/d8b23db4c867), and KOA ([Knights of Academia](https://knightsofacademia.org/about-us/)), taking elements from their Hard mode. I have always been resistant to [Pomodoro](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/habitica-pomodoro-sitekee/iaanigfbldakklgdfcnbjonbehpbpecl) (this link is for a chrome extension, Sitekeeper), but in the future, I am to force myself to give it some go's.

Getting the diagnosis took me for a spin, and Im still tumbling, but Im trying to work all things out in new ways.

\-

**HINDISGHT AND REJECTING EXAMS AS FORM OF VALIDATION**

In hindsight: I am really glad that I was brave enough to try adding on more and more courses. The executive dysfunction, dependency on interest, and the often lack of urgency did a majof number on my mental health pre-diagnosis. Why couldnt I function when I absolutely knew I was able if I just got into ""the zone""?? The often subpar results was a slap in the face and a kick to the self-confidence. My first major mental adjustment came from adding on last years exams for re-taking: Exams are \_not\_ representations of ability, knowledge or anything. That was a major key insight for me. It is too dependent on too many factors. Exam form, daily mood, sleep/food/hydration, private life, exam content vs course content and lectures. Was the professor a good one in relation to engaging the students, teaching the exam content, or even the overall course content? Many of the same factors go for the individuals grading you/your exam as well, plus \_many forms of bias. Theres an even bigger thing in play here as well, and thats repetition vs reflection - what is really the outcome and what is really learning? I know my answer. Sadly, my national education system up to university level is built upon repetition and forgetting, and from university level, its a little more focus on reflection some places, but far too little time to change a life worths training to repeat.

How you learn, is personal and individual. It might take me/us longer to learn something or it might take different things to trigger learned knowledge. I have zero stage fright, but I NEED to script what I am supposed to say. Followups on that, I can deal with. I can present and perform, and I can improvise on the fly. But I cant recall specific pieces of knowledge to answer specific questions when it requires my neurons to fire together as for an oral examination.

\-

**FINISHING REMARKS**

If you thrive in chaos and crisis, there are work opportunities, as well as university programmes, that might be of special interest to you as well.

Follow the path where you thrive or think you can thrive. Nothing else is worth it. Thriving is what you need and what you will live your best life for.

Theres something for us all, somewhere. Don't stop looking or being open for new ideas if you haven't found it.

If you have found it, you might still want and need to change it up if you lose interest, and thats okay. Thats just how it is for us. Accept it, keep looking to thrive and experience the good feelings. We struggle enough constantly as it. You dont need to be somewhere you dont like to be.

**Note to self**: **I have to stop writing things on mobile, it takes me** ***hours***\*\*.\*\* This post literally started almost three hours ago. I have to recognize it when it happens, and I have to move to a computer. Seriously. **Ugh!**

Anywho.. I went a bit off track, and I know people struggle with attention, so I probably lost at least half of my audience."

I am an **Indian, male, first-generation, middle-class, gap-year student**. I belong to a developing city and attend a decent school: it does well academically, but not many opportunities are provided in sports/clubs/fests etc. My school's graduating batch is of \~200 students each year, of whom 2-3 students go abroad (USA/UK/Hong Kong) for higher education.

Intended major: Computer Science (I have an inclination towards CS and entrepreneurship)

SAT: 1520/1600 (First attempt)

Grades: 97% in Sophomore year + 98.25% in Senior year (Loosely translates into a 4.0 GPA or A+, I believe)

Rank: 3/200

Coursework: It is an Indian board, and thus does not offer APs. However, arguably, I have pursued rigorous coursework at my school: English, Physics, Chemistry, Maths, and Computer Science in my Senior year.

LORs: All of them are highly appreciative in terms of academics and interpersonal skills. One of the teachers (Physics) has called me the most talented and industrious student in his 17 years of experience.

ECs:

* Creative Head + Director of Technical Operations for a local bakery in my city
* Conceptualised and developing a ghost startup (does not have real impact on ground yet)
* Completed Google's Data Analytics course (\~4 months, 180 hours) Graded 100% in all course tests
* Formed the Student Council in my school, after presenting to the school authorities on its importance
* Built and deployed a project to make the online tests being held during lockdown foolproof and more secure
* Completed a course called Clever Harvey's JuniorCEO; awarded as the Valedictorian for 'exemplary display of 21st century skills and leadership'
* Internship at a youth-led club in Graphics Department
* Participated in World Scholar's Cup  

   * Ranked first in Literature and Science among 350+ scholars
   * Led my team of 3, ranked third in Team Quiz
* Student Council  

   * House Vice-Caption in Freshman and Sophomore year (Highest position)
   * School Vice-Captain in Junior and Senior year (Second-highest position)
* Photographer for school assemblies

I think this sums me up mostly. All of the projects that I've undertaken have been independent as my school does not really support such ECs. I believe that my profile is strong academically (I will be re-taking the SAT though). But, my ECs are not as well-developed as other students from Tier-1 cities and schools. Therefore, the people who I've been taking advice from suggest me not to aim for HYPS (T10s basically) -- but, I feel (I'm sorry if this sounds braggy) that I deserve an admission because I am intellectually capable and have constantly tried to make most of the opportunities available to me.

However, I am open to being humbled by the reality. I am confident about my ambition and believe that I will work hard to succeed no matter the college I go to. It goes without saying that I would be beyond happy if I am able to get into Stanford as it has long been a dream of mine; but, if that reality is not possible because I go to a tier-3 school, I am fine with the fact that -- acknowledging that I am still more privileged than others --I haven't been rejected on the premise of shying away from working on what I've been served by birth, but because of the experience other students possess due to their environment which is conducive w.r.t. foreign universities.

Thank you!"

wczwue,0,2022-07-31,"[NY] My old job, that I just left, won’t let me interview for an open position/my dream job that I’ve interviewed for before.",WiggySmalls96,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/wczwue/ny_my_old_job_that_i_just_left_wont_let_me/,"First post here so I hope I can add context without giving too much personal info. Apologies for how long this is! 

So I was in a rotational program for about the past two years. I interviewed a year and a half ago with one of the executives that is currently hiring an assistant. At that point, I had barely learned anything or gained any new skills that I hadn’t from previous internships because the first department I was in basically had me in a corner doing busy work.

My manager at the time pushed me to do this first interview but I didn’t feel ready for, plus I hadn’t learned anything to be confident enough that I could land a permanent position, because I’d been doing busy for about 6-7 months. She knew this other department would suit me better (she’s not wrong), so I did it anyway. It wasn’t the best interview due to technically difficulties and me being unprepared for the reasons I’ve just stated.

Flash forward to now, I’ve done two whole rotations since then, gained the skills I should’ve gained in the beginning and now have two years under my belt at this top 5 company in my industry. I’ve been able to get all the experience I needed to even be competent enough to do the job because I essentially did all the tasks required of an assistant for the rest of the program. Before I didn’t know how much knowledge and experience I was missing from the first department until I moved on to these other rotations and suddenly had all these tasks to juggle.

I did great, expanded my network, and everyone pretty much fought for me to stay and were super welcoming and nice in comparison to my first experience. 

Unfortunately, I had to leave last month due to the program coming to an end and no jobs were available for me (I want a very specific role that is pretty sought after and comes along not so often). Now, I see that previous executive is again hiring with different executive for that same job (I’d be assisting two people). The new guy is new to the company entirely.

I emailed my former manager to ask if interviews had started yet because friends I still have at the company were giving me updates. She emailed me back and said that the “team” (the person I know I interviewed with before) remembered me and wasn’t interested in having an interview.

I was pretty upset because I was being judged as a newbie at the company from a year and a half ago when so much has happened for me career-wise since then! There’s been quite a few accolades that I’ll take with me throughout my career that I was able to gain after that interview took place.

I thought I was as explicit as possible in my cover letter to explain the reason why I had no real experience from the first 6-7 months of my program, but now I’m sure she didn’t even read that or my updated resume…

My question is, do you think this is right? Personally, I’ve applied to jobs year after year before, as I’m sure others have. In a year, you gain experiences that better prepare you for the next opportunity that comes along. I feel like that it’s common sense that a lot can change in a year a half, but I was completely blocked from getting another chance all based on that one old 15-minute interview.

What sucks also is that this one person gets to make the decision, and not even give me a chance to connect with the new guy who hasn’t even met me yet! Aside from me, I don’t think that’s fair to make that decision for him when the assistant they’d hire would work for them both.

I emailed them all back being even more clear of the fact that I was not experienced when we met all that time ago, with my resume and cover letter attached, and she responded back in a cheery way that she remembers me and will be in touch soon after speaking to my former manager. Tbh, I don’t know if I completely believe that because this whole thing feels like poor judgement on her part and feels like unnecessary tension with someone that is supposed to be a mentor to me.

Any advice or insight is welcome! I’m still new to office politics and such so I never know how to move in these situations. If more details are needed, I’ll answer any questions you may have to give a better sense of the situation!

TL;DR: I’m basically being blocked from interviewing with an executive from my previous company for flaws in my early experience in my rotational program. There’s a possibility that I will still have a chance to interview, but I’m confused on why someone would reject a candidate that the company already knows and that has worked with multiple people (that she also has contact with) throughout various departments who can vouch for me and wanted me to stay at the company when they found out I was leaving.

How to transition from CS/SWE perspective.,damnsonxax,quant,https://www.reddit.com/r/quant/comments/wd0b5v/how_much_ml_is_there_in_quant_how_to_transition/,"I've been reading about quant for a while and it seems like an interesting path for me, but I have a couple questions. 

I come from a more software development oriented background, currently on my last year of CS undergrad degree and a SWE intern at a known investment bank (back office/ not finanance related). Based in Europe.

I also have a personal interest in ML and been wondering if that is something you can do in a quant firm as well.

I know there's a lot of math and finance knowledge needed but I have some basis from uni and still educating myself on these topics. Wanted to transition into more data/ML/quant oriented stuff. Not sure if I should look into master's or that is a waste of time, that could be better spent on gaining experience. 

What would be the best way to break into the field, any courses,  good degrees in EU, possibly cities you can recommend.

Another thing, do you have some ideas for a ML-related project in a finance/trading domain? Would such thing be doable in a span of a few months without preexisting knowledge of finance?"
wd0h7v,1,2022-07-31,Career advice needed,Zizonga,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/wd0h7v/career_advice_needed/,"So, I am a recent college graduate with actually a decent amount of internship experience who has gotten a full time job as a midframe operator (IT job that entails operating mainframe/midframe computers) for a investment research firm in midtown. Throughout my experience as a whole I managed to pick up some skills  especially in the scripting  area (bash,powershell,vb, etc) and got a small demi-cert  in the process (trhyhackme issued). My only issue is I feel that the work I do now at my job isn't suitable for making a long term career - and I am wondering how to proceed.

I personally found that a lot of information security positions in the NYC/NJ area are moreso mid level, and often are saturated with applicants if it is truly entry level. Often times they ask for certs that tend to expire after 2 years - which basically puts you on a timer to find relevant work once you get the cert in question. I instead have tried to think outside of the box and maybe use some programming skills I have to get into infrastructure-related coding - such as site reliability engineering or QA Testing (automated), but I often find that there really is no true entry level role in these areas either. Finally, I looked into becoming a Network Operations Analyst or Engineer, but alas same situation.

Instead what I often find is a lot of software engineering or business analyst entry level roles, which just aren't my primary interest. 

I feel like I am in between a rock and a hard place - on one hand I feel like I learned the labor market in my area to find entry level IT work pretty efficiently, but the work that is often available has little to no career development.  Does anyone here (with experience in technology sector pref) have any suggestions?"
wd0tpa,3,2022-07-31,First job out off college and I am miserable- Need Advice,5gamer1,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/wd0tpa/first_job_out_off_college_and_i_am_miserable_need/,"I am looking for career advice. While I was in college, I worked at an internship that I really enjoyed, that eventually turned into a part time job. I really enjoyed what I was doing and I enjoyed my coworkers. In my last semester of college, I decided to take some time and determine what I actually wanted to do. While my boss at my previous job wanted me to look for jobs in the company, there was no jobs available in the department I was in. I looked at other jobs, but most of the jobs had very specific job descriptions, and having just graduated, I wanted to be able to have a job where I could see different potential roles I could have. I ended up accepting a job with a small company in the same industry as a design engineer. 

About a week before I started this job, I received a text from former boss letting me know of a position available in his department. It was a job that was a few prongs up the career ladder from the job I had been working while their previously. However, because I had just accepted this other job and was about to start, I didn't apply. To be honest, I was sort of dumb and didn't reply at all. I had intended to but just never got around to it and I think it was a mistake. 

It was also not a job directly related to my college major, so I sort of wanted to start with a more traditional role in my field.

I am two months in and I hate everything about it. None of my coworkers talk to each other. I also have realized that I would rather have more of a hands on role rather than a ""desk job."" I sit there everyday staring  at the clock waiting for the end of the day and then am miserable thinking about how I have to go back the next day.

I keep feeling regret for not telling my former boss that I was interested in the job, and the job listing has been down for a month, meaning it was filled. But all I can think about is how much I would have loved that job compared to the one I am at now. I figured I have a few options. 

1. I could text my former boss(who I ignored previously) and see if they intend to hire any more people in the future and to let me know.
2. I could stay at my current job and watch the job posting boards to see if any jobs open up.
3. I could find a new job at neither company.
4. I could wait out my current job and see if it gets better.

I know it is unprofessional to leave my first job out of college so soon. I wanted to try this kind of job because it was what I directly went to school for, but have quickly realized it is not for me."

wd2rsh,2,2022-07-31,Electrical engineering undergrad looking to switch to more SWE-oriented roles at intern/entry level. Feedback welcome on current resume.,smugmamale,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/wd2rsh/electrical_engineering_undergrad_looking_to/,"Hello!

I am an EE undergrad in the US expecting to graduate in 2024.  I took a couple quarters off from school to intern at a very well known tech corporation as a hardware engineering intern.  I'm going to be done soon, and I think I've realized that I want to look for more software-oriented roles, particularly roles that focus on embedded or systems programming.  I enjoy programming, there's more opportunity for remote work, higher demand, and higher salaries.  I want to see if there's any way I can optimize my resume to look better when I apply to SWE roles at an entry/intern level.  I have a link to my most up-to-date resume below.  Any advice is appreciated.  Thanks!!!

I am just lost on what would be the best path for me to take and would love any and all advice given.

For starters,

I am currently attending a 4 year University for my Business in Finance (2 years left).  I have my AAS in Industrial Maintenance.

Very little IT experience besides helping the occasional family member out\\ fixing the printer.

Currently work as a warehouse part-time while I am in school.

I am needing help on how to go about breaking into a IT related internship or at least setting myself up to land a decent job when I graduate. I am currently studying for my Sec+ and plan to take and pass before the end of Oct. I am also planning to get my Net+.

I eventually want to work in some capacity in the Cloud.  I have a close friend who is a AWS Solutions Architect and I have been highly interested in that field of study so far. My current plan is to complete my SEC+ and sharpen up my resume and apply like fire to as many IT internships as I can. (I only want to apply after I get my SEC+ since my bachelors is not related to IT, though I do want to get my Masters in IS.) I still have 2 years left so I am going to learn as much as I possibly can. After my Sec+ and Net+ I plan to dive straight into getting my AWS Certs and building my home lab. I have bought multiple courses on Udemy and plan to learn scripting in python in my spare time at school. (Slowly I am thinking around 30- 45 mins a day)

Does this all seem realistic? I love Finance but I just do not see it as a long time career for me. IT has always had a pull and I love the constant change and learning that comes with the career. I want to constantly have to push myself and grow my skill set.Big thanks to anyone that reads and replies!"
