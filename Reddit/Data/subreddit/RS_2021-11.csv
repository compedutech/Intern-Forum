qk26lz,3,2021-10-31,Interview tips for beginners?,Maaraskata,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/qk26lz/interview_tips_for_beginners/,"So I've learned that I always failed at interviews, either because I was too nervous or that I'm not ""convincing"" enough

I always break at these types of questions:

1. Why do you want to join this company
2. Why do you choose this position specifically
3. Give us your best reason on why should we hire you
4. What makes you think your skills are what we need for this company

For example, during my last interview at a mining company, I failed in these questions, especially if they have follow-up questions like, 

1. why this company there are a lot of other mining companies, honestly I want to answer because this one is open and they required someone with my skillset 
2. same as above
3. after listing my strength they usually counter it like we have a lot of applicants with that ""strength"" of yours why do we need more people like you, usually after this I froze and they just move on to the next questions. 
4. What proof do you have? I have some after my internship and side-jobs but my superior and colleague in those jobs didn't response when I ask for a referral (call, email, chat).

Please advise on how to response on those type of questions."

At the end of each intern period, each company approached me and told me to apply to them when I am about to graduate and looking for full time opportunities. 

About 3 months ago, one of the companies, which happens to be the one I want to work for, approach me to set up a meeting. In that meeting, a recruiter told me that the company wanted to hire me full time, and not to sign with other company before talking to them as they wanted to make a competitive offer. 

They asked me when I graduate and when I would be applying to full time positions, and I said I graduate at the end of April and will start looking for full time around January, and they responded by telling me that they will reach out in January.

After taking the last 3 months to think, I realized that this is the company I really want to work for. What I don't know is if I should wait till January for them to contact me, or should I approach them now? 

Also, as a side question, is there a way I can maximize the competitive offer they told me about? Other companies have told me to apply to them in the past, is there a way to bring that up professionally to try and get a better offer?

qk6iw2,1,2021-11-01,PLEASE HELP - I am the most indecisive person and can't decide which job to take,nunya__business,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/qk6iw2/please_help_i_am_the_most_indecisive_person_and/,"Hi friends,

So I am currently in a bit of a pickle and I could REALLY use some advice as soon as possible. Here's the situation:

I am a recent graduate who specializes in graphic design but also social media. I prefer designing, but my school job and internship were more related to social media so I also have that experience. 

**Company A** is in an industry that I am highly interested in, and after graduation I saw they had TWO job openings I was interested in - video and graphic design. Well, about a month ago I interviewed for the video position and was told I wasn't quite qualified but that they wanted me to interview for the graphic design position. So, I interviewed for the design position and was told that I wasn't quite qualified for that either (???). Finally they sent me to the social media department and they loved me and I have received an offer from them. Unfortunately they've only given me two days to make a decision.

At first I was totally fine with taking this position since it was at least at a company I was interested in. BUT, the same day I got an offer from them, I was reached out to on LinkedIn from someone at **Company B** (this company hires a lot of people from the college I went to) saying that they were impressed with my resume and portfolio and that I should apply to their job. This job is a mixture of design, social media, videography, etc. which is AWESOME since I really prefer designing over solely social media. I told Company B of my predicament and how I only have a couple days to decide and so they have expedited my interview to be tomorrow (wish me luck lol).

Now, here are some pros and cons of the two companies:

**COMPANY A**

***Pros:***

* In an industry I like and is related to one of my favorite hobbies
* I like the location (close to apartments, food, etc.)
* The team seems really nice
* Possibility to eventually move from the social media job to a graphic design job at the company in the future (???)
* 18 days PTO (accrued)
* More casual, laid-back environment (so it seems)
* I have an offer in hand

***Cons:***

* $20/hr
* It's a social media job but I want to do graphic design
* Health/dental insurance is mediocre (not a huge deal for me atm since I'm on my parents' insurance)
* Not the greatest 401k

**COMPANY B**

***Pros:***

* $24/hr
* Mixture of graphic design, social media, video, etc.
* 3 weeks PTO
* Probably a wider variety of projects
* This company is more involved in helping the community which would make me feel good

***Cons:***

* Currently no offer in hand - don't even get to start interviewing until tomorrow but they seem highly interested in me
* More professional/uptight-seeming environment 
* Location isn't the best
* They have a Simple IRA instead of a 401k so I would probably have to stay at this company for at least 2 years (since I read something about not being able to move the money in a 401k for the first two years)
* Unsure of health/dental plan
* Company is pretty small and fairly new (2011). Their industry seems to be pretty niche and I'm worried about the job security

My main worry now is if I take the Company A job as a social media specialist but I really want to be a designer, would that look bad on my resume? Like, in the future if I were to apply for an actual design job, would I have a harder time getting that job and a pay raise because my experience on paper is primarily in social media? There's also the possibility that I could move around within this company and maybe end up doing graphic design for them in the future, but I can't know that for sure.

Meanwhile, this other job seems to be more aligned to what I want, however, I'm a bit worried about the workload and if I might get overwhelmed (this is my first ""real"" job out of college and I have horrible anxiety specifically related to working). 

I just don't know what to do. I feel so stuck. There's also the fact that I have Company A's offer in hand that I need to reply to by Tuesday (2 days) and yet I'm only just starting to interview with Company B. I'm worried passing on Company A to pursue Company B would be a huge risk even though they do seem really interested in me. Please, anyone, I need some help! I am so indecisive!!"

So… I’m feeling a little dejected. I’m in my final year of a Medical Science degree and have been trying to secure an internship for the last 3 years.

I’ve worked really hard and managed to raise my WAM from 76.3 (2020) to 80.1 in Sem 1, 2021; however, in spite of my best attempts, I’m never selected for any internships...

So far I have been unsuccessful in:
- Denison Research Scholarship
- Heart Research Institute Scholarship
- Children’s Medical Research Institute 
- Centenary Institute
- Children’s Cancer Institute

I WAS successful with one application in 2019 at the Anzac Research Institute (first year WAM: 83).

Are scholarships only realistic if you have a HD WAM?

qkam6x,281,2021-11-01,A Case for WashU,apsuffer,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/qkam6x/a_case_for_washu/,"I too am a sophomore that goes to WashU, and I completely agree that you should weigh your decision before applying/committing here. It's worth hearing both sides of the argument, and I thought I might as well give WashU some kind of fighting chance on this sub :\^0

Before I get into it, I will be honest and say that I had an absolutely miserable freshman year. I hated it here so much, and that was difficult to cope with because I had basically grinded through all of high school just to be at this goddamn school. Every hard day had me wanting to start a transfer app. Luckily, my sophomore year has been exponentially better, and this is very much due to the let up in COVID restrictions. I'm pretty sure every institution during the 2020-2021 school yr was just a shittier version of itself. My freshman year was mostly me sitting on my ass all day thinking that this school had nothing to offer me. 

Not to say everything is back to normal, but WashU has been slowly coming back alive, and from that I've learned that college really is what you make of it.  WashU, whether you agree or not, is a top institution with a ton of money to spend on improvement. We have impressive faculty, research/career opportunities, and infrastructure. Not to say that it's a utopia, but it's also not too shabby, and definitely not jank enough to be unconditionally complaining about. 

**1. Social Life/Things to do in STL**

Yes, there is definitely a club/bar scene that requires you to drop a decent amount of money on Ubers/covers. Still, it's not your only option if you want to go out. There are plenty of house parties that people throw and mixers that various clubs/sports teams organize that require no money at all. You're not obligated to go to some random bar every night if that's not what you want to do - it won't ever be your only option, and no one will force you to go. 

I actually think the party scene at WashU is healthy, and it fits what I want out of my own social life. Someone once told me that the kids here are basically just nerds that just learned how to party, and that's a pretty accurate description of what goes down here. Literally no one cares if you don't drink / smoke, but a decent amount of people do (sometimes that shit surprises you,,, like when you see that rlly smart guy in your comp sci class blasted &amp; you would have never expected it lmao). We don't have ragers, and maybe in comparison to state schools it's tame, but there's still a presence and you very much can find things do on a Thursday/Friday/Saturday night. 

Also! It might be hard to believe, but STL is actually a pretty cool city. Clayton itself - the suburb that WashU is in - is also adorable, and allows for WashU to exist in both the suburbs and the city. The metro is easy to take (it literally only goes in two directions so anyone can realistically figure it out). There are plenty of cheap things to do around here, such as free events, cultural spaces, cute neighborhoods, etc. I'm a thrifting bitch, and I'm actually surprised at how many thrift stores there are - from exploring those, I've also found really cute local businesses and definitely some really good food (STL is known to be a foodie city and that's definitely true).  There are a decent number of freshman, and especially sophomores, who have their cars on campus. You will inevitably make friends with people that do, which makes Ubering a lot less necessary. I've only had to take an Uber a handful of times, and that was only because we had no DDs. 

Overall, I think the social scene here is geared towards a specific niche of people. And sometimes it doesn't come easy, but most things never usually do. You do have to make an effort, such as joining clubs, or talking to upperclassmen, or reaching out to people that you find cool, but all of that is just part of expanding your community and something that you would have to do at any school. Still, if your personality fits WashU's type, you will enjoy your time here. There will always be something to do, whether it be day or night ( &amp; it can't always be night aha). 

**2. Campus / General Vibe**

Yes, there are some people here who are loaded. I come from an upperclass neighborhood, and even then the way some people here treat money genuinely shocks me. But (not to make any excuses, but will make this one) this is a commonality at any top university. And while WashU is admittedly late to correcting for that, we have gone need-blind, and I would think, are making an effort. I would also say most people are very much aware of their socioeconomic status, and are generally considerate of all situations. No one is ever persecuted for their financial circumstances and while yes, sometimes the affluence peeks through, it's not some all-mighty force that dictates everything.

The facilities are nice. I don't really know how anyone can argue otherwise about this campus. WashU puts in a ridiculous amount of money to upgrade and maintain buildings. Their flower budget is literally around a million dollars. It's an objectively pretty place. There are also two gyms that are fairly solid for a D3 school, and one of which always has at least one bench open, for anyone wondering. The biggest library closes at 9PM, which sucks, but this is more due to COVID than anything else (it used to be open 24/7 - also, there are plenty of other buildings that are accessible late at night). Food isn't Michelin star quality, I agree, but there's always a decent meal, which I would say is pretty good for college dining. WashU also brings food trucks to campus, has daily dining specials/events, consistently hosts local restaurants to serve their food, and has a number of dining halls that all offer different options. COVID has also messed with what is provided (dining staff shortages being a big issue), but I would say they still make an effort. 

One thing I can't rebut is the prices,,, I'm like 200 under on meal points how did this happen &gt;:\^%%.

**3. People**

Trust that WashU has the least school spirit out of any place ever lmfao. I actually don't think I've met anyone who is some hardcore stan, but most people are pretty happy all the same. Like any other institution, we all have our grievances about one thing or another; we definitely are not blindly praising Andrew Martin and all that he has done for us. There's no Kool-Aid here and definitely no groupthink, tf. 

I've definitely had my own complaints about the people here. My freshman year was filled with some really fucking weird characters, but I also didn't make any real effort to meet anyone else. After branching out, I've found that people here are friendly and are usually down to hang or get to know you. There are still some people who are pretentious / shallow, but they aren't people that you have to spend time with. My class (2024) in particular is a bit closed off, but I think that's more of COVID forcing us to form cliques/groups than anything else. The freshman though??? Those bitches are so nice and will literally talk to anyone, which I think is probably representative of what WashU kids are normally like. We are known to be collaborative with a little bit of adopted Midwestern nice. 

Yes, there are rich people. It is an issue that WashU has recognized and that the entire student body is conscious of. Some people could not give a shit, but most here are thoughtful. Your socioeconomic status will never be a factor in any social / academic situation.

**4. Internships / Career Opportunities**

I'm not sure what to tell you. At the end of the day, WashU is an impressive school to go to, and while it has the worst brand name recognition, companies &amp; other higher education institutions undoubtedly know what it is. I don't know anyone who has struggled to secure a position that they wanted, and most people I know are doing very impressive things. Even with that, you shouldn't expect name alone to get you in. 

***5. CONCLUSION***

With every school that you apply to/get into to, fit should be a deciding factor. Every school is different, and in most cases, match is way more important than prestige. With that, college is very much what you want to get out of it. You have to put in effort, whether you like to or not, and while some things are up to chance, most are controlled by your own decisions. Regardless, university can be the best four years of your life, but also, it's just school. It's just four years. Like, it's not going to be perfect, and honestly, if it is, then where's the character development anyway. College is just . life . basically. There's ups and downs (lots &amp; lots,,, you'd be surprised how fast time passes here), and you're going to have to deal with that. Sure, some of it can be due to the institution, but some of it might also be coming from yourself. 

All in all, WashU is not perfect. No one here will argue that it is. Especially considering COVID, my college experience has definitely been tainted. But WashU has offered me a lot, and I really don't think there's a better school that I would fit with. Kids here maintain a good balance of school and having fun - the parties will never be as crazy as state universities, but they make sense for WashU students. The quality of life here is also unmatched, and while people here can be toss up, most are generally looking for a connection. The academics are also good, and profs / advisors usually care about their students. 

I know people like to dunk on WashU, and valid, but I think it can be a great school for the right person. feel free to dm if u have any questions !!!"

In my organisation we just had a intern data breach; when a user is deleted inside Azure, the manager gets a notification email from Microsoft that he has 30 days to save the OneDrive files from the user.

However the files contain also personal info like the Documents folder. As per EU law, we are forced to report this.

Did some investigation and it turns out in azure the option automatic access delegation is turned on by default. We have turned it of right now, but my question is, do you guys have any other helpfull tips regarding settings like this? Which are on by default but could cause a databreach?"

qkf817,0,2021-11-01,I can't decide between Javascript or Python,KLBS38,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/qkf817/i_cant_decide_between_javascript_or_python/,"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 21 years old and I'm trying to learn to code again. I've already done some programming for 2 years at university but nothing too advanced, I've seen the basics in Python, and I've also seen HTML, CSS, JS and Php, but I have very little memory of it.

&amp;#x200B;

I've read the subreddit FAQ about which language is the most appropriate for which project, but I still can't decide between two languages to start programming: Javascript or Python.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't find the answer in the existing posts so I hope I can give you some hints with my context about which language would be the most appropriate for my code learning.

&amp;#x200B;

On one hand, I want to learn Javascript in order to be able to create my own website for my portfolio; there is this ""design"" aspect that is found with Javascript since it is front-end coupled with html and css, which interests me a lot (creative coding also interests me a lot !). On the other hand, I'm doing business studies in IT, and I'm thinking about looking for my internships in data analysis, machine learning, etc. and I think Python is much more appropriate in this case.

&amp;#x200B;

Although the data analysis side might be more interesting for me considering what my studies are leading to, I don't have any particular priority or preference for one of the two languages.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm really hesitating between which of the two to choose. Will it be difficult to switch from one to the other once I'm well into my training in one of the two languages?

&amp;#x200B;

This choice is really bothering me because I've been hesitating for 2 days and I'm not doing what is important: practicing.

&amp;#x200B;

If you have an opinion on the question or if you want to take the time to answer, it would help me a lot !

Thank you for your attention, I wish you a very good day (sorry for the mistakes btw, I am not an english speaker) ! ;)"

Okay, so i am stepping out of my intern shoes and applying for real jobs in city governments. 

I went through the first interview virtually with HR and the previous person in the position. 

I did my second interview in person, and was verbally informed that I did very well and will hear a call back soon. 

I was called a day after the second interview that I have been invited to a third interview. 

I’m very excited as this means they are seriously considering me. But what should I expect? Has anyone been through a third round interview with a city government? Or third round at all? 

I realize they are out there. But most positions even ones higher than mine do two interviews.

I’m so brand new to coding (and so bad at it) that I’m getting frustrated. I’m getting my ass kicked in my Java class rn, and it’s taking a toll on me because I really want to learn this but I’m just not grasping the concepts. Also, I work retail part time and I absolutely hate it. No disrespect to anyone that works retail ofc, but the industry just isn’t for me. So I want to quit and try something new that brings me Fulfillment but I’m not sure what to do. I mean, I could try an office role or entry level desk job, but I’m wondering if that will actually make me happy. It will probably just be a bridge job for me until I can learn some programming languages and try to get an internship. But hey you never know, maybe it could open doors by way of networking. I understand that I’m still incredibly young, and that no one has this whole life thing figured out yet, but I just have this calling and this want to do something that makes an impact, and that truly makes me happy in life.

I basically don't know where to start to prepare for an internship and what exactly I need to brush up on. I would be applying very late for internships anyway because most stop applications in mid November.

What language should I brush up on and exactly what should be the focus of my learning in this short time period to help me land an internship?

When applying to software engineering internships, I don’t know how to describe the projects I’ve done on my resume. I don’t want to try and stretch out/exaggerate what I’ve done, but due to my lack of experience I’m not sure of the proper way to phrase something.

For example, in my C++ class, we learned about overloading functions - should I put something like “Constructed a C++ program that returned sum of all ASCII characters within multiple strings using overloaded functions.”? Or is that too basic/exaggerated to where it could negatively impact my chances of getting an interview? Another example in my Python class would be, “Designed a menu-driven Python goal creator that utilized multiple lists to manage structured data items, complete with search function.” (That one I took from the assignment objective description - my C++ class doesn’t have that).

I am fought on every plan I make, everything I do, and everything I say. ESPECIALLY by my younger sister, who has SOMETHING against men. (YOU ARE FUCKING 18. YOU HAVEN'T LIVED AROUND ANY MEN TO HATE. GTFO OF TIKTOK, AND TALK TO REAL PEOPLE.) She argues with me on EVERYTHING. I try to keep things equal, fair and even take on the brunt of the work, usually. But if I ask her to fo anything she doesn't want to do (ie, the kitchen, go to the bank so I can pick up neccessary items then pay the bills, even watch something OTHER THAN DRAMA SHOWS AND LAW&amp;ORDER) it's an entire argument until I just give up. 

She can shout, overtalk and overpower me (she's a lot heavier than me) and I barely get a ""sorry"" unless our Mom tells her to. Meanwhile, if I offend her or hurt her feelings, I MUST apologize at once. Because I'm supposed to lead by example. 

HOW THE HELL AM I GONNA LEAD THOSE WHO REFUSE TO FOLLOW EVEN SIMPLE REQUESTS!? 

I'm constantly told to keep calm, keep positive. Bullshit. They listen to the eldest brother. No fight back, no talk back. And sure, he's the calm one. The level-headed, self bettering, and personally improving one. They'd listen to HIM, sure.

But me? Zero respect. None. I can't talk them down, cuz they'll just shout over me. I can't restrain them, bc ""that's just wrong"". I can't hit them ""bc I didn't let your older brother hit YOU"" I get no respect at all. 

Pretty sure if I just left, the youngest two wouldn't care, but they'll probably die from drowning in their own trash. (Literally. I was with our mom in hospital for 2 weeks. Came back after 1 week, 5 bags of trash.  ""Dump it, please. It's just garbage"" I came back again- 9 bags.)

It's starting to feel like I'm the fucking pack-mule. Just dump everything on me, and I shouldn't complain. How dare I suggest we three work together simultaneously to complete multiple goals in one outting, amirite? (My older brother has his own apartment, and two jobs, so we don't see him unless it's an emergency or surprise. Or a holiday)

I'm just growing evermore tired of being treated like an accessory, an extra. IF I WASN'T BORN, YOU TWO WOULDN'T BE HERE. I just want respect. But I can't do anything to earn it. Hell, I have my own apartment, and my sister throws it in my face when I say anything she does wrong towards me. Like the fact I don't have a job, but she had an internship. 

I'M THE GODDAMN CARETAKER. YOU LITERALLY TOLD OUR MOM WHEN SHE WAS CRYING, WORRIED ABOUT DYING ""well, you were gonna die, anyways"". WE ALREADY LOST OUR FATHER, FROM A HEART ATTACK. YOU DON'T SAY SHIT LIKE THAT. 

EVER."

Strap yourselves in cause this is a long one, a full meal, if you will.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------

We stay laying still in relaxing silence for fifteen minutes until Andi’s phone notifies us about the sapient creature’s feeding hour. Andi ignores the alarm for a few seconds before begrudgingly turning her head and tapping the alarm off. She bends her arm backwards and taps me lightly. I don’t move and she taps me again, a little harder this time.

‘’What’s up, Andi?’’

‘’Get off of me you scaly fuck, I want to eat.’’

‘’But your back is so comfortable, it’s so warm and supports my back in the perfect spot.’’ I’m not joking, by the way, this position is relaxing my back better than any bed I’ve ever been in.

Andi turns around under me and raises her torso from the bed. I feel like I’m in danger. She grabs me from below and starts to raise me up. I would say something but I don’t think I have ever been more scaroused than during this moment. ‘’Thanks for moving Sastel.’’ Real fucking funny isn’t she? She drops me off to the side and makes me bounce on the bed.

‘’You could’ve just pulled your legs from under me, you know?’’

‘’I sure could have.’’ A reminder of what humans are capable of, although it did take considerable effort from Andi, she still raised me from a horrible stance. I wonder how far someone like Troy could throw another person in this gravity. Humans are extremely dense, mostly coming from the insane amount of water their bodies hold, around 60% of their bodies are made of water. High gravity worlds exist and many species come from them, but they’re usually small and light. You know? The smart and easy way to reserve energy and still survive. The larger the world, the smaller the creatures. The small worlds have every size of creature. As far as I know, Earth is the only heavy gravity world where evolution decided to crank the dials up to eleven.

Humans aren’t even particularly strong for their planet, they just managed to get brains as well as a little brawn. A gorilla, an earth creature of the same evolutionary path as humans, could easily take down tens of fully grown humans without even trying, given that everyone was barehanded of course. Humans would lose to almost any apex predator in a fight, they have no natural weapons to be considered on their planet, they are **endurance** predators for fuck sake. In the galactic scale, they’re now the most durable beings to ever grace space with their presence. A human can jump tens of feet on low gravity worlds, on heavy worlds they are the most massive of creatures. They would make great villains in movies. They will make great villains in movies.

I should get up from this bed, I haven’t eaten much during the day either. Neither do I want to make Andi wait. I appreciate a good joke and a tease, but food is not something I want to make anyone wait for too much. I hope they have some good meat, bacon has grown to be one of my most favoured culinary delights. I switch into some more comfortable clothing, I think I’ll just plop on the bed right after we eat. Whatever exciting things this place has to offer, they can wait until tomorrow. I walk up to Andi and we head off.

‘’Did you remember to bring the key?’’ Andi’s question hits me just an instant too late. I left the keys in the clothes I had just switched from. The door is now securely shut in front of my face, we’ll have to ask someone for a master key. I drop my arms down and bend forwards, hitting the door with my face in defeat.

‘’No.’’ Nothing more needs to be said, but in my defense I am hungry, tired, and mentally drained from dealing with humans all day. ‘’Let’s just go eat, please.’’ I hope they have some alcohol. Andi taps my shoulder with an understanding look on her face, I look at her and straighten myself.

‘’This reminds me though, I’m going to ask for a key for myself as well, one key for two occupants doesn’t work well.’’ I perk up a little after hearing her say that. It’s still strange to think that we’ve moved into the same room, completely voluntarily this time too. I might have been a dumb fuck by forgetting my key, but I am the greatest mind on this planet for choosing to ask Andi to move in with me.

We get to the elevator and I am overjoyed to find that it’s already on our floor. A couple guards join us a few floors down and strike a conversation with Andi. Jeremy has apparently become the laughing stock of the unit. The situation isn’t helped that his last name is Gergich. Poor bastard, cursed by his parents and the world, I feel for him. But now is no time to be sympathetic towards another, I have dinner to consume.

The elevator stops and the long awaited ‘ding’ rings inside, sounding the sweet bell of doors opening to stacked tables full of food. It’s nothing special, but simple is always best in my opinion. And yes, there is lots of bacon. Some meatballs and mashed potatoes. Even delicious small fish that have been fried in breadcrumbs and butter. Not the meal of a king, but certainly better than I had before being abducted. Being kidnapped truly was the best thing that could have happened to me, somefuckinghow. I eat small bites of different foods as we’re walking to the table where the others are sitting.

Troy has a mountain of food that is disappearing at an alarming rate. The amount of calories he has to consume to maintain his physique is astounding. Layne is sitting at one of the other tables, talking to one of the guards. Val is reading something on her tablet when she spots us and waves us down. We sit down and I marvel at my meal. Several kinds of meat with a few fruits and vegetables. Humans do have some great spices, but I’ve always preferred basic tastes, the exact reason for why there’s a small tower of bacon on my plate. No alcohol though, apparently it’s not normal for humans to get drunk at dinner, something I hadn’t learned due to staying with some kind of alcoholics.

‘’So which rooms did you guys pick?’’ Aaaaand there it is. I knew it was coming, but I still would have wanted to have **some** time to process. I think I should just rip the scale off and get it over with. Andi nudges me from under the table and gives me the thumbs up. I guess there’s no avoiding it now.

‘’We have the 8th floor corner, right of the elevators.’’ I really hope that’s good enough, please Val just get it and drop it. Val is about to say something without looking up from her food but she stops and makes eye contact with both of us before continuing eating. Oh thank the heavens she isn’t making this into a big deal.

‘’We? I think you translators busted lizardman.’’ Troy, you chunk of muscle given brains, really? What does he **have** between his ears? I’m trying to be somewhat discreet here and he just completely misses the point. Not that I can really be mad at him, he’s not an idiot, he just doesn’t think if he doesn’t feel like he has to. The three of us collectively shrug in amusement. Val luckily decides not to explain things to Troy right there and then.

‘’Does anyone have any real details about what our job is? All we’ve been given is just some vague goals, what’s up with that?’’ Andi brings up a nice point, what are we supposed to do tomorrow? Do we just have vacation until someone says to do something? Somehow I doubt that we’ll get much free time, maybe they’re just giving us a few days off. I would say that we deserve some time off, but we have done literally nothing productive for weeks while getting here. Well Val has taken care of injured or sick people but that doesn’t say much about the rest of us.

‘’You know that is strange, maybe we’ll get some info tomorrow.’’ I don’t know, Andi doesn’t know, even Val doesn’t know. Troy certainly doesn’t know. At least we’re on the same page about being oblivious. Well since no one here knows then it’s not our problem. Maybe some intern just lost the paperwork and no one has yet to notice. Eventually we will have shit to do though, whatever it ends up being.

We continue with some small talk about the food and the planet itself, nothing groundbreaking. Troy is the first to finish eating somehow. He excuses himself and grabs some dessert to probably eat in his room. Val finishes shortly after and tells us to enjoy ourselves, which would be nice of her to say, but she decides to make an extremely long wink towards Andi before walking off. I shouldn’t have trusted her with this knowledge. Speaking of knowledge, I have to let someone know that I managed to lock myself out already.

I finish up a little bit before Andi is done and decide to just take care of it before it’s too late. ‘’I’ll go ask someone about the key, meet me in our room when you’re done?’’

‘’Sure, but I’ll be done in a sec, better move fast before I use you as the key.’’ Whimsical threats are the best threats, comical relief **and** threatening all in one compact package. I’m not too concerned, I’d make a horrible battering ram when compared to furniture. I ask around a little and find out who has the master key. Some older human looks at me funny and probably wonders if I’m alright in the head. To be fair, I’m questioning that too. He gives me the keys and tells me to come back here and return them when I’m done using them. I hold the keys with enough strength to hurt my fingers, but I am **not** losing the master key to the entire fucking building. With everyone going back to their rooms, the elevator is in heavy use and I decide to try and take the stairs.

The eight floor really feels higher when you walk all the way up there. I finally get up on the last floor and sigh in joy, this night’s been going better than I imagined. Now I just have to get the damn door open, take the keys, and then return the master key. Alright, easy enough. I get the damn door open and find the fucking keys. I decide to use the elevator to get down this time, even if I have to wait a little while. The elevator pings and the doors open to a pair of guards laughing. They see me and are taken aback before smiling wide and waving at me.

‘’Shit man you’re a scary motherfucker to see by surprise.’’ I give him the finger and laugh a little while I enter the elevator. I would be offended but I’ve seen humans getting scared by so many things I’m starting to think they’re just playing at being brave. I would absolutely hide in some dark corner and jump out in order to scare someone for laughs, but like I’ve said, having bones turned into powder probably doesn’t feel that nice.

I get downstairs and stop the elder-guard at the same table he was at the beginning of my quest. He sees me coming and I throw the keys back to him. He catches them and goes back to reading whatever he was reading before I showed up. Andi isn't in the cafeteria anymore, she probably took the stairs and we missed each other on my way down. I take some dessert pastries to go, most people have finished eating already so no harm in grabbing a few handfuls. I go back to the elevator and enjoy the music while snacking on delicious chocolate chip cupcakes. The doors open to Andi waiting for me by the stairs. I throw her a cupcake and swirl the keys on my finger. Andi starts walking with me while munching on the cupcake, her face lights up when she gets to the chocolate core. She finishes the pastry right as we reach the door, so I hand her another one. Now I can finally relax and go the fuck to sleep with a full stomach.

I take off my shoes and go for a final bathroom break before sweet and energizing unconsciousness. I take my prosthetic off before washing my hands, it’s rated for swimming but I’d still rather avoid getting it wet as much as possible. No need for showering today since that was professionally taken care of earlier. Now it’s just a matter of falling asleep on the bed instead of the floor. Andi goes in after me, but opens the door right after she closes it, holding my arm.

‘’Right, thanks Andi.’’

‘’I’d recommend having the keys installed into your arm but for fuck sake you can’t even remember that.’’ Painful remark but fair.

I plop on the bed and take my datapad out of my torso. It has its little pocket to charge in.... which is extremely creepy now that I think about it. I look at the metallic shine left by the lack of an arm. Sometimes it just hits me how crazy this all is. I have a fucking arm **made** out of wires and motors that feels almost exactly like a normal arm. I would have searched for the nearest flamethrowers had I seen someone like me. I wouldn’t have burned someone indiscriminately but I certainly wouldn’t have stopped screaming without one. Am I some kind of freak now? The guard on the previous station certainly thought so. I calm myself and place my datapad back...into my own torso fuck this is so weird. Very, very handy but so fucking weird. At least I only lost my lower right arm and just some tissue surrounding it, I’m not a full machine yet at least.

Andi comes to the bedroom and just lets herself fall backwards into this comfy heaven. We’re in the same bed sure, but there’s more room for one person than on the ship. Andi takes off her hand and stares at the absence of it before placing it under the bed.

‘’Sastel, do you have moments when you think that you’ve lost something important, even if the prosthetics are almost perfect?’’

‘’Sometimes yeah, but mostly when I don’t have it on. When it’s on I sometimes even forget about it, it doesn’t look exactly like my other arms, but the difference doesn’t scream out at me either.’’

‘’Yeah, if I close my eyes I can imagine having my original hand back. It’s fun to imagine never having lost it. I know we could probably regrow the limbs while we’re here, but that just feels like doing the same thing, replacing something that’s already lost.’’

I reach with my right hand and grab Andi’s arm where it stops suddenly and hold it. She takes her other hand and puts it on mine for a moment before lifting it off. She rolls over and puts her hand where my arm used to be. She kisses me on the cheek and rolls back over slowly. I leave one hand grasping hers.

‘’Good night Andi’’

‘’Good night Sastel’’

Before I drift to sleep, my mind wanders off into tomorrow and what it holds. I don't know much, but the menu is open to read for anyone. Tomorrow is pancakes.

Please give me any constructive criticism you have. I am starting to enjoy writing.

**Letters from the foundry world**

Dear Sister,

I am pleased to read that everything is well back home. I, myself, am also doing great. I had many worries at first, traveling to the first “foundry world” to exist. But the humans have proven to be very kind and supportive. Kraltura VI is just as you would imagine. Volcanoes, molten rock, and obsidian as far as the eye could see. When I asked one of my human colleagues why humanity decided to build a colony on a such a scorched world, they answered: “Well, the ever-present extreme heat is easily manageable with our heat protection suits, and the consistent heat reduces the required energy input of the foundry greatly. It makes processing materials just that much easier.”

The foundry itself is just magnificent. The foundries back home are nothing in comparison to the behemoth of the humans! And the foundry I work at is not even their largest! My dear sister, when I say humanity has outclassed the Klarusar in the processing of smeltable resources, I mean it. This foundry puts out as many resources in one day as five Klarusar foundries do in one week! And there are 37 on this world, one larger than the other, and they are building more!

As for the working conditions, I was baffled. They are way better than at Mantrou Metals back home! Besides worker safety and comfort in the workplace they do not only provide sleeping quarters, but you can also rent an entire living apartment! There are schools to provide education for your young, recreational establishments such as restaurants and cinemas, even an entire botanical garden! The foundry city provides everything a family needs right on this volcanic ball of death! I have already decided to stay. The day before I wrote this letter, I have changed my contract from intern to employee. I found my place. I hope you understand.

Good health to you.

Your brother, Niroma

\-----------------------------------------

Dear Sister,

I have met a human woman, Clara. She is a marvellous female, kind, beautiful, joyous, funny, compassionate, and so much more. I was so nervous when I first asked her out. It took three weeks of encouragement from my colleagues to make me ask her out! Great eye, I was so awkward on our first six dates! Yet she stayed with me! I can barely put my joy into words!

And I was also promoted! I am now a head engineer. More work, but better pay. Now I supervise and lead a team of five engineers. For now, everything is working out well. My new team has been as welcoming as all the other humans I have met, and it has been an easy start for me in my new position. If everything continues the way it’s currently going, I might even get to train a new engineer sooner than later. I only wish our parents were a bit more understanding.

May your path be lit.

Your brother, Niroma

\-----------------------------------------

Dear Sister,

I have incredible news! I have learned, how humanity has planned to get out of their debt! In fact, I have learned of their plans for their entire integration process! When they started colonizing corpseworlds, they knew that they would go into such massive debt for buying resources, that the federation could enslave them till the debt is paid. They planned on it! While they were colonizing, they were simultaneously starting their scraping business. They are apparently profoundly great scrapers, that give the Scrimo some serious competition! When they build the first foundry on Kraltura VI, they already were in massive debt. And today we got the order to overclock the foundry! “Operation Payback” is a go! When I asked my colleges, what that meant, they said humanity starts clearing their debt today! I have worked harder than ever before! I am more exhausted than I thought I ever would be! But I am also prouder than ever before! Humanity is about to clear its debt and I get to help! We will write history!

Stay safe and write me a letter soon.

Your brother, Niroma

\-----------------------------------------

Dear Sister,

Things have calmed down in the foundry. “Operation Payback” has been a great success and humanity is now able to clear the remaining debt under more normal working conditions. My own efforts during this time have earned me another promotion! I am now a foreman! The morning after the celebration of both “Operation Payback” and my promotion was less than pleasant, but most certainly worth the fun we had.

I have also used my savings from the last few months to purchase a family size apartment, so that Clara and I could move in together. This proved to be an absolute bliss for Clara. As a teacher she always has some work to do at home, may it be correcting test and homework, or preparing the materials for the next day, so she usually had little time to relax or prepare meals for herself. Having me around allows her to concentrate on her work while I prepare a warm fresh meal for us. She also claimed that she sleeps a lot better since we share a bed. 

As for me, her consistent display of trust and love for me is such a bliss. Unlike our people, humans are apparently not permanently on edge and looking out for danger. As such, when I sneak up to her, she never seems to feel threatened by me. Instead, she is always pleasantly surprised to see me, especially when I give her a surprise hug. And when we show our affection to each other, I feel like everything besides the two of us has lost all relevance, as if it doesn’t exist. She has the tendency to call me a big, love starved child in these moments, and I have started to agree with her, since I usually refuse to let her go from our embrace for at least three hours. Sometimes ten. And every night that Clara cuddles up to me I am reminded of my bliss. I am sometimes not sure if I am still alive or already in heaven! How could something this wonderful exist in the mortal world? And then, when I go to work and meet my colleagues, I am reminded that humanity as a whole is such a welcoming species, and that I just simply have the incredible luck of being in love with one.

May the eye watch over you.

Your brother, Niroma

\-----------------------------------------

My dear sister,

Great news! Clara and I are getting married! It was clear since we moved together, that we would marry sooner than later, and we finally are! The wedding is on the gsD ### of the gsM ### on Kraltura VI in foundry city “Stahlherz”. I would like to see you there. And if you could convince our parents to come, I would grateful. I know that our parents resent me for my choice to work as a foundry engineer, since Ulkrad are a hunter species and the only known sapient species of a hell-class deathworld. Obviously, they expected me to become a pirate hunter or security enforcer, like you. Still, I hope that they can see how happy I am with my choice, and that they can find it in their heart to at the very acknowledge my achievements. I don’t expect them to share my happiness, but their presence would mean so much to me. So much has happened in these few years and so much more will. The city has grown so much, so many things were added. I need to show you all around when you get here. You will love it, trust me. Especially the new security systems and gear of the security enforcers. Humans are surprisingly competent when it comes to enforcing security and combat, considering their peaceful nature and history. I just can’t wait to see you.

Please come over soon.

Your brother, Niroma"

Hi all! I'm a graduate student doing my master's in human-computer interaction in the USA, currently looking for and applying to (partial) summer internships in the UK (mainly London) so that I can work and live with my partner, who has UK citizenship. I have several years of UX/product management skills, but I'm looking for an internship in anything related to UX research/design, product management, or technology consulting.

I'm wondering if anyone can answer some questions regarding the application process for internships in the UK while using BUNAC's visa sponsorship program (I will be financially funded up to $5k by my university):

On lots of online intern/job applications, there is a question similar to the following:

*""Do you need, or will you need in the future, any immigration-related support or sponsorship from {organization} in order to begin or continue employment with {organization}?""*

Being that I intend for BUNAC to be my sponsor, how do I answer this yes/no question without having my application completely thrown out?

Also, is it considered standard to put work authorization on CVs? If so, can I put that my intent is for BUNAC to sponsor me?

Thank you in advance for the advice!"

I'm currently in my second year of a Cyber sec degree in Scotland. I've been looking for a job for 3 months now, but it seems like there aren't a plethora of listings, especially for internships of part-time jobs. I know that companies probably don't want students running about, knowing nothing and being responsible for a lot of stuff, but I heard plenty of stories where undergrads got hired part-time to ""shadow"" someone, or just work on less sensitive stuff (most of them do coding, very basic administrative tasks or just corporate 9-5 stuff, but better than packing groceries). I may be completely ill informed here, but I thought we had a dire shortage of cyber sec workers, yet there seem to be no listings for these jobs.  


I would be grateful if you could share some of your stories on how you got hired as a student, maybe throw on some tips ;) , or where should I look for jobs etc.

BIOE major here, I want advice on my spring courses.

DiffEq, Organic Chemistry, and Human Biology is what I am taking in spring 2022 for sure. Those together is 13 credits. I'm having difficulties deciding if I should also add circuit analysis I to my courses because I need it by next fall. I can either take it in spring or summer. The issue is my school (CC) has it as 5 credits and it includes a lab. However at my 4 year I will transfer too, it's only 3 credits as it is only lecture. I only need the lecture for my major, but I'm worried the class could potentially conflict if I get a summer internship. I also don't wanna overload myself in spring however, because Orgo will eat up alot of my time as its 6 credits and a tough class as its known at my college. I also plan on tutoring in spring for Gen chem I-II. If I take it in fall I might have to stay back a semester. I'm just conflicted on what I should do. I just don't want to burn myself out like I have in the past.

it doesnt help that physics is really hard for me, and I had to spend buttloads of time to catch up in mechanics and E&amp;M bc physics doesnt come naturally to me.

I'm currently at 119 credit hours out of 190 and this is my 5th year. Basically have all of my classes out of the way besides most of the core mech classes and I don't think I will be able to finish them. The worst part is that I have already done two internships and had a good time. No struggle at all and I already have a second internship lined up with the same company that I really liked next summer (which basically means I get the job BUT only after I graduate). I don't want to spend another two years of my life at school while potentially just wasting more time and money because I'm just not cut out for the physics and math knowledge required to pass the upper level mech classes. 

What do I do? I don't want all those credits just to go to waste. Would I be able to apply them to an associates degree instead? It would make it quite the expensive degree but it's better than nothing. I know the company I interned with hired associates degree people for similar positions. They seem a bit inpatient though to get me on board and I don't think that patients will last longer than two more years of school.

I love technology and science, but this degree is just too in depth for me I guess.

This is mostly for internships/new grad roles.

**Very Common**

* Tell me about yourself  
   * I used this to talk about 2 of my most recent internships and some leadership experiences I've had through school/clubs
   * If you don't have internships, talk about personal projects and involvement in clubs
* Describe a challenge you've faced in your internship or project  
   * Highly recommend using the [STAR](https://www.themuse.com/advice/star-interview-method) method
   * My ""result"" was usually what I accomplished but also **what I learned**
* Describe a time you had a conflict with a team member/describe a time where you were the first one to speak up about something  
   * again highly recommend the STAR method
   * talk about how you solved the conflict, show your problem-solving skills
* Why &lt;company&gt;?  
   * do your research!!
   * if you're talking about their culture, say something specific (it's supportive, social, etc)
   * why do you like their product/industry
   * pro-tip: if you've had a chat/previous interview with someone else for this company talk about something positive that person mentioned
   * If you use their product, talk about that!

**Somewhat common**

* Describe a time you showed leadership skills  
   * could be during a group project, club, internship
   * STAR method is useful here too but I didn't really use it
* A time where your user changed your perspective on something  
   * This one was an unexpected question but I got this asked twice
* Describe a time you made a mistake and how you solved it
* Describe a time you encountered something unexpected
* Describe a time you worked collaboratively with someone/in a group  
   * STAR method useful here

**Not too common**

* Why did you choose your internships?
* What is a project you are most proud of?
* What are some important things you learned during your internships?
* What are you looking for in your internship/job?

**Other advice:**

* Don't use ""we"", make sure you specify what exactly **you** contributed
* Prepare 1-2 answers for each question
* Practice speaking your answers out loud, don't read off a script though
* I also stumble on what to ask interviewers at the end so here's a short list of questions I've collected through other Reddit posts  
   * What made you choose &lt;company&gt;?
   * What are your favorite and least favorite parts of working here?
   * What are you currently working on and what's been your biggest challenge recently?
   * What did you find surprising when you first started working here?
   * What kinds of support do interns/new grads have when they first join?
   * What's the work-life culture like?
   * What's it like living in &lt;city&gt;?

Hope this helps!"

I graduated a year ago in Computer Engineering, though I took around a year break for myself. I had an explanation here on why I took a year break and why I had no internships relating to CpE, but I guess that doesn't really matter, in the end, I don't have one.

In the last year of uni, I had a friend who was graduating tell me about an IT internship and he essentially recommended it for me. Did the interview, got in. I figured it would be a good way to have some office experience.

But I feel like having no internships relating to CpE is something that can work against me. I've been applying around April, really just got rejections or no responses. So besides my senior project (where I lead one of the most difficult projects of the past few years according to the heads of the department and our professor), I also spent the year off learning microcontrollers and made a project. (I never was able to print out my final PCB I designed because of the shortages on the chip, I can't manufacture it. So I couldn't technically finish it, but did everything with my dev board). Applying again the past few weeks to around 25 places, after putting it on my resume, I guess it did some good. I got 3 hits and 1 that I didn't even apply to myself (a recruiter reached out).

One was a startup, only contract, tons of hours ""tight schedule for deliverables, maybe will transfer to employment after done"". I passed on that.

I failed (I guess? There was no feedback) an unproctored coding exam online, so was rejected.

The other was essentially in total a 4-5 hour commute which I was not willing to do, I had enough of that in college. No WFH available.

The other I have a phone interview, but the position is essentially a verification engineer. So it's not like a set in stone thing, but never know. Anyways, not exactly what I usually apply to, I'm wanting to do some embedded design work, it was just one of the places I shot out a resume to.

So here's my dilemma: So I wanted to ask is a verification engineer a bad place to start your path in? I've been reading its looked down upon, or it's essentially where the failed engineers in school go (which I actually see from my classmates), or it's hard to maneuver into design once you have a verify engineer label under your belt. My senior project I'm especially proud of because of what we accomplished from the limited funds, small group and this project the past year I did, I feel I should be shooting for non verification role. Though, I'd like to start making some money already and working, but I don't want desperation to put me in a place where I feel won't be good for me, and something I'm not exactly jumping up and down with joy for.

Thanks for taking the time to read."
qkv573,0,2021-11-01,Can someone help me describe how I’m feeling/put it into words,Glad-Can-8290,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/qkv573/can_someone_help_me_describe_how_im_feelingput_it/,"Long story short I live with my aunt because my parents don’t treat me right. But now I’m starting to get stressed out by my aunt.

Recently I took up an internship and have been waking up late for school because I get home at 8pm and then have to go to sleep at nine, so I can wake up at five again.

I don’t get the full amount of sleep I usually do and I feel exhausted. But I feel like my aunt isn’t really understanding of that.

For example I got home tonight and I was going to try to squeeze in a quick gym session to try to get a break from everything - but sadly I couldn’t find the gym card in time (I found it later on under my futon)

I asked my aunt and cousin if they had seen it (since they cleaned the room earlier) and my aunt just started getting upset with me and telling my how I better find the card or else the rent office will charge her.

I was annoyed about not being able to go to the gym and ended up looking for the card for the rest of the free time I had.

Five minutes later, my aunt is yelling at me that the room is a mess (I had only a few things on the floor because I was checking the dressers for the card). She told me that it was too late and that I had already “lost” the card, but the whole time I was thinking “Didn’t you just tell me to look for it? This is the only time I have to do it. “

It’s not only that, and I can’t really explain it well but the feeling I’m getting around my aunt lately is kinda like the feeling you’d get while walking on eggshells around somebody 

I’ll go to the bathroom and my aunt will actually listen from her room for how long I wash my hands, so that she can ask me when I walk out if I washed my hands or not (she doesn’t do this once or twice either she does this every time I use the bathroom), so I have to constantly tell her “yes, I washed my hands” - i’m 17 by the way so I’m definitely well-versed in this skill by now.

She’ll also be really picky about my food habits. 

When I eat to little she’ll tell me “Don’t starve yourself”, but if I eat too much she’ll go “girl, don’t go digging out the food, I will be buying no more snacks”. The same happens when I try to cook healthy meals for myself - she’ll complain about us gaining weight but then feed us unhealthy things like hamburger helper. And when I try to make my own food with healthy things around the house she’ll then claim all the vegetables and say that I can’t be using her Brussels sprouts, her zucchini, or chicken broth. And don’t even let me get started about what she had to say for us eating candy on Halloween.

Today, I was just making chicken nuggets in the air fryer because I felt like I couldn’t eat anything else without her saying something. She then later accused me of cooking her brussels sprouts - which I didn’t. And told me to stop with the sly whispers behind her back which I also didn’t do because I wasn’t saying anything at all.

Honestly it feels like I can’t win in any situation - like even if I clean the kitchen spotless or vacuum - my aunt will be the type of person to look at this one tiny crumb on the floor and say that I didn’t do my job.

It’s stressing me out and I I don’t feel comfortable explaining the situation to her because I feel like she’s going to hold it against me or find some flaw to pick at. Literally I feel like I’m hiding every single flaw from her now just to avoid these types of conversations.

How should I deal with this"

Thursday, 9/23, Talked to a hiring manager at my school's job fair

Monday, 10/11, 12:30 AM - got invited to a 30 minute interview 

Tuesday, 10/26, 7:00 PM - finished the virtual interview 

Wednesday, 10/27, 7:39 PM - offer!

**Interview Process**

* I was blown away by the interview. I was too complacent and thought there were gonna ask me some simple leetcode question since it was only 30 minutes. Instead they asked me basic question about Python and object oriented terminologies which I was completely unprepared for. For example, they were like ""give an example of a class variable and instance variable"" or ""write me a function that demonstrates how to do inheritance in Python and use static methods"". I was completely embarrassed and explained to the interviewer how I know how to use Python but just forgot what you call the different stuff. She was kind enough to help me and gave lot of hints. Probably most embarrassing interview of this year and I bombed my tesla PM interview. 

**Prep**

* For prep, I did around 150 leetcode problems (mostly medium and some hard) in a depth first manner. Meaning I would do 10 two pointer questions, then 10 bfs questions, then 10 topological sort questions, etc. You want your brain to understand each pattern well and only focus on mastering that one pattern. Don't move back and forth between 20 different problem types.

* My tip for doing practicing leetcode: After doing a problem delete the whole code and code it again. Write down what mistake you made and what key thing you learned for each problem in a notebook. When you do a new leetcode problem, code it again from scratch the next day and one week from that day. Reviewing is probably more important than doing a new problem. 

**My tips for how to answer leetcode questions during an interview:**

1. First ask questions to clarify everything like is there a null input, negative numbers, are we returning the length of an array or the actual array?, etc. 

2. Write down on the board or screen how you would do an example manually using pseudocode or plain english. 

3. Optimize pseudocode and explain time and space complexity.

4. Only at the very end, code your solution and test it using examples.

**How did I manage to get offers after screwing up?**

Of course, I got lucky. But I think some non technical things helped me pass the interviews even when I couldn't answer their questions. I am talking about **communication**. I am an introvert but doing mock interviews on places like pramp helped me gain confidence. During the interview, I was always confident, and even when I had no idea what was happening, I didn't show any negative emotion I stayed calm and I would smile or even laugh a little when I was stuck. Remember the interviewer is a human being and your potential teammate, they are not some robot who is your enemy lol. I think me asking the interviewer for guidance and how to approach the problem like how a friend would ask another friend helped me pass those interviews. They know you don't know everything and that's fine. When you join a company, you are expected to ask questions and learn new things. Why not demonstrate you are a quick learner and a friendly teammate during the interview?

**What did I learn?**

When you grind data structures, algorithms, etc never ever neglect understanding the fundamentals of your language and object oriented design principles. This is fair game and is especially embarrassing if you can't answer them since these things are taught very early in most CS classes. I have heard many FAANG (MAMAA now?) and unicorns ask these types of questions and leetcode masters fail them."
qkvs10,1,2021-11-01,Seeking advice and/or support,dazingroses,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/qkvs10/seeking_advice_andor_support/," 

Hey everyone,

Posted a version of this post in r/schoolcounseling, but am still struggling and think casting a wider net may help. I don't mean to complain, but it's hard to talk about this with coworkers at my school. I'm not comfortable with them yet, and also don't want to overwhelm them when they all have so much on their own plates.

So, I have been working towards a career in education for what feels like my entire life. I always dreamed of being a teacher- I'd pretend to give lessons and worksheets to my imaginary students and also served as a TA for teachers during middle school and high school. In college I studied education with the hopes of being a high school English teacher. This plan, however, didn't work out. After getting to the internship period, I had a total crisis and backed out. I was stressed about most aspects of the internship and didn't love the fact that this degree would only give me one option post - graduation: being a teacher. My gut was telling me not to pursue this path and I listened to it. The thing is, I love the field of education, and it's the only thing I could ever see myself doing. When I got into a grad program in school counseling, it seemed like the best of both worlds.

I graduated in May and about a month ago began a position as a teaching assistant at smaller school (around 200 kids total in a K-8 school). Myself and the lead teacher work with about kids at the elementary level. Most of my day is spent supervising students during playground/recess time, supervising students while my lead teacher pulls small groups aside for lessons, and working with students one-on-one for lessons and such. Now, this all sounds great, but I'm running into the same problems I dealt with during my internship stint. I'm finding myself mentally and emotionally drained at the end of everyday. I hate being an authoritarian/disciplinarian, yet so much of my day is spent in this role. On top of that, I'm often teaching subjects/lessons that I'm neither prepared nor qualified for. I'm working 40 hours a week and going to school full time, and feeling overwhelmed by my responsibilities. I barely have time to do all my school work, much less take care of myself and my mental health. I feel guilty when I do something that makes me happy, because I should be doing homework or getting in bed so I can be well rested for the next day. I hate to complain, but it feels like I'm barely keeping my head above water most of the time.

I talked with my admin about reducing my hours, and they were initially supportive, but that was a month ago. I am trying to be patient, as they don't really have anybody else to cover me. However, I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. I'm barely making it through each day, and I'm wondering if this even the right field for me? I hate even thinking that, but I just feel so lost and miserable. I've been working on my mindset while at work, which has helped some, but overall I'm just feeling the mounting dread each and every day. I feel like I'm not serving the kids the way I should. I don't want to be the person who ""works for the weekend,"" but that's where I'm at right now. I hope it's just my being overworked that's causing these feelings, but what if I'm ignoring the signs?

TLDR: I'm a struggling school counseling grad student trying to juggle their teaching assistant job and school responsibilities. I love working with kids, yet hate the near-constant classroom management and authoritative role I'm being asked to take on. Is this all a part of the process or is this stress a sign of a much larger issue? Any advice or support would be greatly appreciated as I don't have many people to turn to right now."

There was only this one interview and it went sort of fine. I didn't receive any communication for a week, and when I followed up, I received a reply stating that they are 'currently experiencing high volumes and will get back as soon as they have an update'. 

&amp;#x200B;

1 week has passed since then and still no update. I was told that this internship was starting on 25th of November. My friend who gave the interview about 4 days ago received some sort of confirmation(they asked for candidate information or something I think) today morning, for the same internship at EY GDS itself, and he apparently had a tougher interview than me. And now I am stressed.

&amp;#x200B;

So, my doubts are : 

Is it normal for EY GDS to take this long to communicate the results of an interview?

Will EY let the candidates know if they are rejected ?

 Any advice on what I should do in this scenario ?"

The project search stage is currently applied for winter however I can also switch it to the summer after sometime.   


I'm not really sure what to do, I don't want to renege either Amazon or Salesforce (really scared to get blacklisted from any company before graduating college) if I get an offer from Google in either the Winter or Summer.

The frustrating part for me is that I am not in Canada at the moment but I hold a valid pgwp.

Furthermore, I have no relevant experience or internships. Just a bunch of personal projects and a previous unrelated job experience in Canada. My degree is CS related however.

How likely would a company hire me if they realize that I’m applying from outside of Canada despite holding a valid work visa (combine this with my other short-comings)?

Im currently applying as if I’m inland right now (with a Canadian number and address) but I realized that companies have started to do in-person interviews now. Im afraid that if I ask for a zoom interview, they might be put off by this.

Would it be better to enter Canada and start my job search there? It’s pretty expensive to live there without a job and I don’t know how long it will take me to find a job either. I could maybe get a retail job for the time being but I think it might be shitty to get a for for maybe a few months then leave."

ql4frl,0,2021-11-02,How to get into CS + Anthro (tldr at bottom),daedalusthe5th,UIUC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/ql4frl/how_to_get_into_cs_anthro_tldr_at_bottom/,"*Introduction*

Hi, I'm a junior in HS with a **3.7 GPA** and a **1300 in the PSAT**. I recently found out about CS + Anthro and  since it mixes the two areas of life that I love that I thought would never go together, I know for sure that this is what I want to do. To add to this, UIUC is only a couple minutes away from where I have family, making UIUC my only dream school. I would like to know what you think my chances are of getting in and I'll take any advice I can get. 

*Math/Science Courses*

By the end of my senior year I plan to have taken the AP psych test, along with doing the APCS-A and APCSP courses, along with AP Stats. The thing is, my school, doesn't offer calculus in the non-AP level, and doesn't have a AP Physics as well. Since I'm doing **Algebra 2** this year, I'm probably slated for both Precalc and AP stats my senior year, along with Physics. 

*Extracurriculars*

Due to my school being overseas, there really isn't any CS specific extra-curriculars like internships, robotics clubs or a coding club that I can do. The ones that I'm doing is managing 2 HS sports teams, singing in our school's top chamber choir group, leading the school guitar club, being the head volunteer and IT advisor at a local nonprofit, and having a role in class government and student council. Most of these I've been doing for more than 2 or 3 years. 

I'm thinking about pushing in my application the fact that I have had roles like in managing and as a class delegate to study people and use computers in the process, ie; my own data collection system for swimmer attendance and future best time estimator. In my volunteer job, I also was able to switch the entire office's computers to Debian, set up a new file sharing environment and taught Taiwanese people how to use Linux in office work applications.

*Projects*

In terms of CS projects, I have started on a **discord bot** that has a image fetcher that will display photos of memories that I have with my friends. My logic here is that since there's alot of online community studies going on in this major, this should be the best type of project to have.

*Extenuating Factors - I might not even put this down in the application*

Since I was a dorm student, right after I had adjusted to life in another country, Covid hit, leaving my family in China which was where they were staying. Right after my visit back home in China, news got out that travel restrictions were about to start, my family left to America, while I flew back to Taiwan. Because of this, a part of 9th grade 1st semester and most of 2nd, I did a total of 7 flights and 5 weeks of quarantine all by myself. Right after that, in the beginning of 10th grade, I had constantly to figure out where I was going to live since because of a expiring visa, I was very likely to get kicked out of the country and had to constantly plan for each outcome. Then I had to do another 2 flights and 3 weeks of quarantine to go to America and come back, this time taking my family to live here permanently. This is why my gpa in freshman and sophomore year is a 3.6

*Conclusion*

I'm hoping that my future projects after this discord bot and my extra curriculars will help alot in getting me into CS + Anth.

Please let me know what you think of this. My primary concerns is that my GPA, lack of internships/CS-focused extracurs, being international, and not doing calculus will prevent me from getting into CS + Anth. If they will, what things can I do immediately to start improving my odds of getting accepted?

ql60kq,1,2021-11-02,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (11/01/2021),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/ql60kq/weekly_job_qa_thread_11012021/,"Hi all,

Here is the ninety-sixth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.
* How do I find computer engineering jobs?
   * If you have no idea what you want, I would suggest just searching a job board (indeed, google, linkedin, etc.) for computer engineering jobs. If you know of a company you would want to work for (e.g., AMD), you can go directly to their website and look at their open positions. You can also use the information you learn from that job board (job titles, requirements, skills, etc.) to refine your searches on other job boards.

All the best,

\--Nick

I was very lucky to secure a job recently, and the start date is January 31 of next year. My FE Mechanical exam is scheduled 12/13 (it was actually moved from May because I was doing an internship during spring and a full load of classes).

My time has been taken up by searching for a job and my classes. The little amount of free time I have left during the day is usually used for relaxing, eating, and chores. My head is not in the right mindset to study after a full day. Thankfully, I don't have to worry about the job search anymore, but now my classes are getting busier than ever.

Could I squeeze in maybe a few hours every week to study? Sure. But I would probably study more effectively once school ends and I'll just be at home with my family in a more relaxed mindset. Other things to consider:

* This job is not contingent on me passing the FE
* I have been getting *some* practice from my senior seminar class when we do FE quizzes

So should I take it in December or January?

ql78yo,2,2021-11-02,Do I take the full time position at a start up or an internship at a big company?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ql78yo/do_i_take_the_full_time_position_at_a_start_up_or/,"I posted this in the UX design Reddit, but I’d be curious what you all think about this. 


I have received two offers for what would be my first position in UX design, one is an internship at a big corporate company and another full time position at a small start up company (less than 75 people). 

The pay is decent at the startup, but a little less than the average for my area. I would also be one of two people on the UX team. This job would provide some stability by knowing that I’ll have a full time job for the future, but it’s not a really exciting company. I also feel like it would be more stressful and more pressure here. 

The internship is well paid for an internship, but slightly less than the full time job. Also, they have a full team of designers, developers, all that. I feel like I could learn a lot here, but it’s not a full time job and will last for only four months. I’m not sure if it would be possible to be hired full time after this, but I’ll assume not. Having this company on my resume would be a really good look for future employers as well (if you’re in the US, you definitely know this company). 

So what would you all do? Take the guaranteed full time position or do the internship that would be a better fit for me?"

On track to graduate at 21 if I survive this semester. I talked to a 21 year who never went to college who is making six figures and he said that he makes that money because he’s specialized. I’ve always been interested in app development, so I want to specialize in IOS development. When I apply for internships, I usually just send out 30 applications a day to any company with an opening, and get rejected from most of them. I have three separate resumes, one showing my web Dev skills, one showing my iOS skills, and one showing my android studio app making skills. I have tons of projects for each resume (I went hard in my free time). I don’t want to worry about money, I feel like a career is one aspect of life and I don’t want to spend my entire life at home learning trying to get higher paying positions until my old age causes declines in my ability. I just want to get a good job and save until my investments pay my rent for me, then I can focus on retirement and how i want to contribute to the world. But every time I ask for advice, I get strange conflicting information. Like, grind Python in leetcode. Why? My specialization is IOS/Swift. Isn’t that a waste of time? And, no one cares what a college undergrad who knows nothing specializes in. If no one cares, how are 21 year olds getting six figure positions? Should i be a generalist engineer and spend my free time learning everything and being average at everything? That doesn’t sound smart. I don’t have time to “find myself” or “see where the industry takes me”. I just need money so I can fund what I’m really passionate about while paying rent and being happy. What’s the quickest way to money for someone on my track?"

I'm an IT - Data Networking and Security major at Liberty University. Just now getting into the actual IT courses and love it so far. I’m actively applying for internships this summer and have an interview tomorrow with a local tech company for a Tech Support Intern role (general helpdesk duties it seems like). No certs, but I’ve thought about starting toward CCNA and/or Security+, but not sure which one of those I should go for first or if there are better options to begin with. I love the Networking side of things and would love to end up as a Network Architect or NetSec Engineer down the road. Figured that a good starting place would be Sys Admin since that’s probably the most realistic entry level job I’m going to get, but I will ultimately be happy to take whatever I can get once I graduate.

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts on where I need to focus my study? CCNA? Linux? PowerShell? I definitely don’t want to graduate with a degree and have no other hard skills to show for it. Open to any suggestions from those much wiser than me! Thanks!"

1. I’ve worked for a top microprocessor company as an intern for a year. I’ve been offered another year as an intern and then a full-time opportunity when I graduate. I don’t find the job particullarly fulfilling as I’m just testing hardware when I really want to build software, but pay is good when compared to my latinamerican country average.

2. I’ve been offered a software engineering intern position at a FAANG company in Europe. The contract lasts 6 months and the monthly salary is 3x what I earn now after taking rent and food into account. However, no job is guaranteed for me after I graduate, also, I would graduate 1 semester later, at 24 years old.

3. I received a full-time SWE offer from a great company that should be added to the FAANG acronym. Salary is lower than option 2, but I would have a great job after graduating. This offer is only valid if I graduate next year, which means that I can’t accept the Europe internship if I want this job. 

I would really like to accept option 2, as I’ve always wanted to be an exchange student in Europe, and this is as close as I can get now while at the same time gaining job experience and money. I would then have to re-apply to the company of option 3 and see if they haven’t blacklisted me after rejecting the offer, and see if I can pass the interviews again. Graduating at 24 would make me kinda sad tho.

The alternative is to do another year as an intern in company 1, graduate on time, and accept offer 3. I would like to eventually move to a first-world country, as salaries and quality of life are kinda trash here.

What would you do?"

qlbjl0,11,2021-11-02,A long and earnest cry for help,noobymcgraybeard,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/qlbjl0/a_long_and_earnest_cry_for_help/,"Please pardon the new account, and accept my thanks in advance for reading this post. What I am hoping to gain from this, is some very specific advice, and in all honesty some personal help. I am a 43 year old man, looking to begin professional work in the sysadmin or related field.  

I have no professional experience, but for years I have cultivated a personal interest in Linux systems generally, and homelab/self-hosting projects in particular. I have run various services on old hardware ranging from eeepc netbooks, to laptops and desktops, raspberry pi, a Dell PowerEdge T20, and several VPS’. I have setup and currently manage: a remote VPS media server which includes an rclone mount, Jellyfin, \*arr, qbittorrent and Ombi; a raspberry pi NAS; the PowerEdge which I setup with Yunohost to run Nextcloud, Airsonic, FirefoxSyncServer, and occasionally other services; A remote VPS dedicated to being a Wireguard server, which acts as a proxy for my home server.  

I would say that I have a solid familiarity with Linux desktops and servers (mostly, but not exclusively Debian based). I am comfortable working in a terminal, managing user accounts and permissions, editing fstab and crontab, installing/updating software (though rarely from source). Examples of things that I am less confident with (but have still deployed with success) are nginx, wireguard, docker, systemd services. I know how to find log files, and I know how to search the web for things I don’t know. As far as other operating systems… not too much. I haven’t spent much time with MS products since Win7, and I know next to nothing about Apple products.

I live in a rural, northern California area, where there aren’t a lot of local jobs in tech. For the past \~10 years I have been employed in various aspects of the local cannabis industry. For what it’s worth, I generally have enjoyed the work, but I am past ready for a change. For one, I feel the need for more predictability and security than this work provides. In the past, this was offset by higher pay, but now it seems like the whole industry is racing to the bottom. I would here like to mention that I haven’t consumed cannabis more than a few times in the last 20 years, and not at all in the last 7 or 8. Obviously, I’m not bothered being around it, but it just no longer agrees with me.

Now that I’ve explained my technical know-how, and laid bare my current situation, I would like to start asking for some help. I often read on this subreddit and others, the sentiment among senior sysadmins that they prefer or would rather train the right candidate with maybe less experience, than one with a bunch of certifications. I feel strongly (based on reading I’ve done, and recent conversations), that I have the basis and capacity to succeed as a junior sysadmin. I feel however, that at my age, and without:  

&amp;#x200B;

\-professional experience

\-relevant degree (I have an unrelated B.A.)

\-certs (I actually did acquire COMPTIA Linux+ a few years ago)

\-ability to relocate (for a couple years while my wife finishes nursing school)

&amp;#x200B;

… I have about zero chance of finding a job by sending out applications. What I really need is advice for how to get my foot in the door somewhere. An internship or ‘mentee-ship’ would be perfect. As I mentioned that local opportunities are probably rare, a remote situation is necessary at least for now. Though I would be willing to travel occasionally if needed. What concrete steps could I take now to wind up with a sysadmin job? Specific certs, like LPIC-1? One of those Google IT certs? I find myself overwhelmed by the number and variety of these things, so the more specific the advice, the more I will be motivated to complete it.

Thank you so much for reading through all of this, and thank you for any advice or even just kind encouragement you can spare. I admit that I am nervous about having put this all out there, and about what kind of responses I’ll be getting. I will be happy to clarify anything I’ve written, or answer further questions."

qle6eu,0,2021-11-02,Looking for companies that are cool with an remote intern in school full time?,Beastinlosers,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qle6eu/looking_for_companies_that_are_cool_with_an/,"I can get a CS elective credit and another internship out of the way, but most companies (that I've seen) want students to not be full time at school. Can I get any cool companies willing to compromise on this? Will I mostly be looking at startups? Anyone know of any big companies who actually don't mind? I think I will have some room to negotiate since I have a google SWE internship lined up for this summer already (offer letter signed), so I'm thinking of doing one the following fall 2022, or Spring 2023 right before I graduate. I'd imagine its too late to do Spring 2022."
qle7nc,9,2021-11-02,Amazon Final 4 hour virtual onsite (SDE-1),ChairEmbarrassed175,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/qle7nc/amazon_final_4_hour_virtual_onsite_sde1/,"I had Amazon's Virtual onsite 3 days back which lasted for 4 hours  


**1st Interview: (Senior SDE)**  
Asked 3 behavioral questions and seemed okay with my answers  
Asked a weird coding question, where he expected me to write a function for an API call to check 3 valid conditions for payment, wrote the functions with if loop as it was only 3, then he asked me what if it was 15 conditions, I said a for loop is what I will use to run over a dictionary of 15 conditions and return the corresponding error messages, here comes the weird part, he asked me how do I return a proper error without keeping these validation points in my code, I was like what?! so instinctively I said put it in a try-catch and respond with system generated error, he didn't look much happy about it. Am I missing anything in the question here?  


**2nd Interview:(Lead SDE)**  
A very warm interviewer, asked 3-4 behavioral questions then asked me a couple of questions on my past technical projects, and then we went to the coding question, a little tougher variant of [https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-iii/](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-iii/). Solved it optimally. Overall a very good interview.  


**30 min break.**  


**3rd Interview( Sr Manager and 1 more Sr Manager shadowing):**  
Started by introducing themselves and their team, asked me a blend of behavioral and technical questions, seemed happy about all my answers. Then asked me a system design question on making a restaurant booking and review system application (something like Yelp) and asked me to design it, seemed happy with my answers, interrupted me once, and asked me to talk about in-depth code rather than just giving an overview of the design. Overall again I would say a very good interview  


**4th Interview:(Lead SDE just turned Manager)**  
A very warm interviewer, started with intros and asked me 2-3 big behavioral questions and then counterquestions on my decisions in my stories for the same questions, then we went on to the coding part, it was about purchases made after advertisement, was given two log lists and was supposed to give a count of purchases made by clicking each ad, started with a straight two-loop brute force solution, he asked me in between if I could decrease time complexity, I thought for a while and came up with a heap solution, he suggested use of a dictionary to even further drop time complexity and I could almost see my solution lying in the brute force code itself, he gave another hint and I understood, he asked me to verbally explain what I would do and it should be enough if its right, I explained he seemed convinced, overall a very good experience in this interview but I am not sure of the outcome because he needed to give me 2-3 hints.

  
**What do you guys think, do I have a chance?**  


I am a CS master's graduate and have close to 1 year of experience and two internships prior to this interview and also hold an H1B."

I am currently working in a company that gives $60k since July.

Recently, I got a job offer from other company for $78k but as I research on Google for the salary range, I have noticed that $78k for this company's position is at 25% percentile.

So I am wondering should I negotiate the salary even though I have only one internship experience and 3 months of work experience?

Honestly, I want to negotiate the salary because I think it isn't going to hurt me and if I don't make any mistake when I discuss with HR, they are not going to drop me with the offer letter.

I am wondering how can I successfully negotiate the salary with little bit of experiences.

Thanks!"
qlez0t,270,2021-11-02,To Answer This Sub’s Most Commonly Asked Questions: Amazon Edition,[deleted],csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/qlez0t/to_answer_this_subs_most_commonly_asked_questions/,"Yes, your behavioral matters A LOT. Amazon takes their Leadership Principles very seriously. Grind them like Leetcode. 

Yes, Amazon will let you move internships off-season. Communicate with your recruiter and not us. 

Yes, you can interview for one position and be offered another. This is most commonly seen with their BIE internships. 

No, Amazon doesn’t care if you renege. If you have a better offer, DO IT.  

No, we are NOT the Amazon portal, we have no idea when you will get a response or if you got the offer. 

Yes, Amazon’s interview process is unpredictable and random. Some people will get asked LC easies, some hards. There is literally no 100% way to predict what type you’ll get, as it’s interviewer dependent. Just go through their list on LC for best prep. 

Yes you can be rejected after having a flawless interview. Again, Amazon is random. 

Yes, if you’re an (URM) freshman or sophomore apply to the regular SWE internship and NOT APP. If you don’t get the regular SWE internship, they’ll defer you to APP, and you have a high chance of securing it anyway. Edit: Apply to both. 

Yes, Amazon is the easiest FAANG to get into. Many tech recruiters are (honestly) clueless and will see a FAANG company, and not it’s hiring bar when looking at your resume. 

Yes, when someone says they work at a FAANG company, they mean Amazon. 

No, as an intern you won’t have poor WLB. YMMV as a new grad / regular employee though. 

Yes, Amazon is still “prestigious.” No one outside of this sub and Blind is going to clown you for having an Amazon internship. 

Yes, Amazon is a (if not the biggest) feeder company for other FAANGs and Big N’s. Comb through LinkedIn, and notice the reoccurring pattern of people first working at Amazon before getting into Google, Facebook, Microsoft etc. 

Yes, Amazon’s bananas are really good, and yes, they are the only intern perks they give you (unless you count the free MAC chargers). Their insane intern pay makes up for it though. 

Random Miscellaneous Information: 

Good housing options (if your internship is in WA) are Cornish Commons, Seattle University, University of Washington (goated), the M, and of course subleases / Airbnbs. 

If you are in the office, make sure to grab the free MAC chargers and other free IT stuff they give you. My friend got 21 free chargers, and sold them each for a profit."
qlfgxc,1,2021-11-02,JP Morgan vs Zoom for Summer Internship,uclagal12,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qlfgxc/jp_morgan_vs_zoom_for_summer_internship/,"Im a third year undergrad (female) and I’m deciding between a Zoom internship and a JP Morgan internship for software engineering for this upcoming summer. Zoom is in downtown San Jose (but is remote for now) and JP Morgan is in person in Palo Alto (new offices). 

I’m leaning towards JP Morgan. They are giving more money and I like that the company is bigger and has more opportunities (locations, positions, projects) but I’m wondering if it’s better to work in a tech company rather than a bank.
Advice appreciated :)"

Im a third year undergrad (female) and I’m deciding between a Zoom internship and a JP Morgan internship for software engineering for this upcoming summer. Zoom is in downtown San Jose (but is remote for now) and JP Morgan is in person in Palo Alto (new offices). 

I’m leaning towards JP Morgan. They are giving more money and I like that the company is bigger and has more opportunities (locations, positions, projects) but I’m wondering if it’s better to work in a tech company rather than a bank.
Advice appreciated :)"

**Some background about me:**

I recently graduated and now work as a Software Engineer. At my current role and throughout my internships I have been exposed to different areas of development. I did some web development (full-stack but mainly front end), embedded development and QA (automated testing).

I like embedded development but I don't want to specialize in it. In school I did some basic AI/ML but didn't enjoy it. I am also not a huge fan of front-end development.  

**My interests:**

\- Networking (TCP/UDP, HTTP requests etc.)

\- Docker/Kubernetes

\- Python/C++

\- SQL/NoSQL

In my ideal role I want to code all day. I like setting up infrastructure (creating Docker containers, setting up Kubernetes clusters, etc.) but I don't want it to be my entire job. I also enjoy software testing but don't want to be a dedicated test engineer - I want to do some development work. 

What roles would align with my interests? I am considering backend engineering or something in cloud computing but don't have too much formal experience in either of these areas."

I know basic programming in C++ and Python, as I've had an intro to programming course with C++ and a data science class that required us to use Python.
Now I have a Hackerrank coding assessment for an Garage Engineer internship with IBM.  However, the instructions say that I'll need to use an ""SSH command shell/terminal"" for some of the questions and I don't quite understand what that means.  On the practice test it says I'll need to login to a server with the username ubuntu.  I did some Googling and found some stuff saying Ubuntu is an alternative operating system to Windows, so I'm rather confused about the whole thing.  Is this something I'd need a whole class to understand and so I should just give up on trying to get this particular internship, or is it not that different from programming in C++/Python?  If it is something I could reasonably learn quickly (like in a few days), what resources do you recommend?"

Then we changed gears and moved on to LeetCode Questions, wherein I got one easy and one medium, I gave a sub-optimal solution for medium question and then Interviewer gave the idea for optimized code and implemented it himself exactly **when I was about to type**.

qllej5,1,2021-11-02,NVME Gen 3 or 4 and what capacity for Flat and PCVR Gaming + Adobe Suite in 5900x/RTX3070 Rig??,ca1ibos,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/qllej5/nvme_gen_3_or_4_and_what_capacity_for_flat_and/,"**Skip to the Bolded part below if you don't want to read the overly long context preamble**

I may live to regret this but the parts I bought for my own build a few months ago but never had a chance to build due to life getting in the way, I have instead decided to gift them to my brother and his Fiancee instead of giving him my old 6700K/Z170/4x4GB 3200mhz CL15. Building a 12 Bay Media Server with that now instead.

For myself, I now have in hand or on order a 12900K/Asus Maximus Hero Z690/2x16GB 5200mhz CL36 Corsair Dominator Platinum RGB DDR5/RTX3090.

My brother is getting my 5900x/Asus X570-F/4x8GB 3600mhz CL18 that I never got to build with or use even once. He is also getting an RTX3070 I bought for him regardless of what CPU/Mobo/Ram combo I ended up giving him. The 3070 will be funded by the sale of a spare GTX1080 and RTX2060 I have. 

I'll be building it into a Thermaltake Core G3 case that when used on its side is a HTPC formfactor case. It will be going on a shelf in his IKEA TV unit. His main Display will be his 50"" 4k60 LG TV. I'm heavily modding the chassis of the case to accommodate a 360mm AIO, 2x 3.5"" HDD's ( Windows Storage Spaces or Drivepool Mirror) and 3 SDD's (1TB+500GB+500GB Pooled with Windows Storage Spaces or Drivepool). Will have 2x Corsair ML120 Intake fans for GPU on left side, 3x ML120's front intake on the 360mm Radiator and 4x ML120's as exhaust in the roof of this case used on its side. I have an old Corsair Graphite 600T Mesh Side panel with grommets for mounting 4x 120mm fans buried in my parts bin from a decade ago that fits perfectly where the Core G3's Acrylic Window usually is. While this level of intake and exhaust might seem excessive, remember this PC will be on a shelf in an IKEA TV unit with limited clearance of about 1.5cm  at the sides and 2cm clearance above, so I need to move a lot of air with minimum RPM's to keep it cool and quiet there. Also plan an Aida64 Sensor Panel Mod with a nice looking 181mm x 67mm x 25mm 1280x480 IPS LCD Display inset into the front fan grille.

It will be a real Wolf in Sheeps clothing kind of PC. Only the Sensor Panel hinting at the actual power inside. 

The final piece of the Puzzle is the OS Drive. When the original plan with the 6700K/RTX3070 was a pure Flat and PCVR gaming use-case, a 256GB Samsung 970 Evo+ for the OS drive seemed adequate as the games would be stored on the pooled SSD's. However, once I discovered my brother and his Fiancee have and use the Adobe Suite on her oldish mobile 1060 equipped laptop, she for some aspects of her work as a prop maker in Film and TV (Internship on The Last Jedi, just finished Disneys Disenchanted and is now working on Season 2 of Apples Isaac Asimov Foundation series). He is now using it for his Photography and Videography hobby he is getting very serious about. Well thats what planted the seeds in my mind about giving him my 5900x and me buying myself a 12900K instead. Between that and the RTX3070, thats his wedding present and his next few Birthday presents sorted!! LOL.

**However, I now realise that a 256GB NVME might not be enough now that I know they will be using the Adobe Suite on this PC as I think I may have read that that is a use-case people mention when talking about NVME speed and capacity choices. Can't remember the specifics or the answers though and thats basically what I am asking here. Is it a case that an Adobe Suite user uses an NVME as a working project storage drive which they then archive off to the HDD's when finished or do photographers use NVME's as long term storage?? So should I be looking at picking him up a Gen 4 or Gen 3 drive and should I be thinking 500GB, 1TB or even 2TB NVME's for his use-case?**"

I know that I have a very little chance of getting into pure CS itself because of the intense competition. That's why I'm opting for majors related to CS in the Letter and Sciences department. 

I looked at these three majors (Mathematics of Computation, Cognitive Science, and CS&amp;Ling) and they all have some amount of CS courses in them, which is what I want. But I'm not sure which one I would really be happy with. 

I am aware that CS&amp;Ling will have the most CS classes, since it's basically half CS and half Linguistics. It's just that I have absolutely zero interest in linguistics. And I know that in the upper division courses, they require a lot of Ling classes. I heard they aren't easy either. 

In Cognitive Science, it seems like their schedule is much more flexible. They can take psychology, philosophy, computer science, and more. But again, I want to focus on computer science. How many CS classes will I be able to take with a Cognitive Science major? And can I take any upper-division CS courses with it? 

Then there's Mathematics of Computation. I know it's basically just a math major with computer science classes sprinkled in. I do like math, so this major does appeal to me. I think it allows for three CS classes in the lower division and three CS classes in the upper division. But is it possible to take more? And is there anyone with this major that managed to get any CS-related internships? 

Sorry for the wall of text, but if anyone with these majors can tell me what their experience so far with it has been, it would really help my decision in the application process. Thank you!"

So many of the courses I've taken center around one of three things:

\- building very simple apps like to do lists and games

\- creating a basic front-end/back-end CRUD application limited to displaying data and accepting user input (like a mock eCommerce site, inventory management tool, etc)

\- learning how to pass coding interviews (algorithms, leetcode practice, big O, etc.)

All of this is great, but then I look at the Javascript that was used to build a third-party script I've incorporated into my project or some other functional tool, and it seems so far beyond my level of understanding. Like, I don't even know what I don't know. I could never build that kind of script because I can't even conceive of those possibilities in Javascript.  

I believe have to know your tools in order to know what you can build. To build a house, it's not enough to just know about hammer and nails. 

How can you even conceive of building a beautiful stair rail if you don't know what different saws exist, and you don't even have the language to look up things like ""spindle"" and ""miter"". 

I'm almost 40, I don't have the luxury of getting an unpaid internship, and that's not even why I'm learning programming. I just love doing it, and I want to do more of it, and make really cool things in my spare time. 

Are there more advanced courses out there?"

**UC stats:** UW: 3.83, Capped W: 4.10 (30 semesters), Uncapped W: 4.57

**SAT:** 1510 (For non-UCs)

**Class Rank:** I’m at least in the top top 8.7% of graduating seniors since a decile at my school is ~50 students, but I’m not sure of my exact placement within those 50 students.

Pretty large upward trend from Freshman year, I had a 4.83 GPA in my Junior year while taking my entirely AP classes (+ Japanese).

I’ve taken 8 AP classes and I’m taking 4 more this year, but I’ve only taken tests for 6 of them (though I passed them all). I’ve also taken every possible Honors course available for my classes that don’t have AP variants, totaling in 32 semesters (16 AP/Honors), 40 including those from this year. Also the reason why I’ve only taken 16/20 classes is because of mandatory CP classes such as PE, Language classes, and VPA credits. For more info see below:

**Freshman:** AP Human Geography (4)

**Sophomore:** AP European History (4) and AP Calculus (N/A)

**Junior:** AP CSA (N/A), AP Biology (3), AP Psychology (5), AP English Language/Composition (4), and AP US History (4)

**Senior (in progress):** AP US Government, AP Macroeconomics, AP Chemistry, AP English Literature/Composition

I have some impressive/unique things on my transcript such as taking AP Calculus Sophomore year and taking 4 years of Japanese (semi-fluent, currently taking Mandarin).

ECs:
- Piano playing and composition, though I haven’t won any awards nor have I competed for any, I’ve been playing for 7 years and typically contemporary pieces. (~6hr/week, 7 years)

- I manage the social media and create videos/images for a non-profit which helps formerly incarcerated people get back to having regular lives. (~4hr/week, 2 years)

- I’ve tutored and homeschool my brother who has dyslexia and dysgraphia between when COVID started and this most recent school year. (~5/hr week, 1.5 years)

- I use my own money to buy materials to contribute to an organization which provides the homeless with food, toiletries, etc.. This usually means going and buying a good deal of food, making lunches with it, then donating it the following day. (~3hr/week, 2 years)

- I interned at a law office over the summer to get some more hands on experience, though this isn’t all that impressive. (~12hr/week, 3.5 months)

- I act as dungeon master for a D&amp;D campaign which I play with my friends, not Ivy League material but it still takes a lot of effort even outside of the time which we’re playing. (~5hr/week, 4 years)

- I drive my brother to school each morning and sometimes pick him up as well, I have a good deal of family responsibilities though this is one that’s been a big one for the past while. (~5hr/week, 2 years)

- I just recently joined the Freemasons, so I hope to gain some more experience from that.

But I tried talking and expanding my friends circle when I was younger, despite how weird I was. I really blossomed in high school have a whole range of friends and really stepping out my comfort zone. I started going to the gym and really boasting my self esteem and established, some life long friends in high school. Then I came to college, and I really started being social. Going to parties and all the things. 
     However the charm of parties and college events and so on kinda wore off for me like around my sophomore year. I had some relationships with girls that went to shit and went no where, but I grew from them. However i started seeing that I went to parties and socializing less and less. However it really started when I found my girlfriend. I really wanted a good girlfriend and by god grace after a really bad relationship I found a good girl. My past relationship was bad my ex was, let’s just say not very good to me. After we broke up I distanced myself from my college friends, I don’t really know why. I thought maybe it was because they was still friends with her and one of my friends was still dating one of her close friends. So even though I wanted as much distance from her as possible, she was kinda around. 
     Then I met my current girl friend and unlike my pervious relationship she always wanted me around and always wanted to spend time with me. I saw myself spending way more time with her and less time with my college friends. She was pretty introverted like me but she was also a social butterfly. So I loved spending time with her and her friends and not really mine. Even though my friends now are very disconnected from my ex but I felt that is because my one friend broke up with her close friend. I also felt that they was making fun of me behind my back about how my ex treated me and how I let it happen. 
       I feel like that’s probably my own insecurities that is making me feel like that but they have said things that was sketchy to me. Like make sex jokes about teaching ur friends how to have sex. My ex made it clear she didn’t enjoy sex with me to many ppl after we broke up but never made it clear to me despite me being open about our sex. She said a lot that I heard from other ppl but it’s okay. My friends also have taken a bigger interest in partying and Social events even more. 
        I didn’t mind I just spend time with my girlfriend and hangout with my high school friends more and more. I at this point don’t go to parties anymore.  Then the pandemic happened and Social events events are extinct and I learned that I have an extra year in college to finish. So during the pandemic since I was by myself most of the time I just started learning about myself more and more. So fast forward to right now I decided to throw myself into my studies and the gym. Since I changed my major to something I actually like and I have a extra year to go I might as well try and boost my trash GPA and crush some goals I had myself in the gym and life in general. I’m working saving for a car and learning to drive looking for internships and jobs so i have something when I finish college. 
       But now I have a amazing semester GPA best I ever had, a nice campus job some driving under my belt and a deal for a affordable car I can save to get. But I feel so disconnected from my college friends. I have no desire to go to parties with them any more. I stopped drinking (never liked it like that anyway), completely stop smoking weed. I also started seeing I look forward with spending time with my girlfriend and her friends and playing video games and on the phone with my high school friends more. 
     I feel so disconnected from my school friends but honestly I don’t care and I don’t know why. I lost the desire for parties and some social events. I don’t know why. I get annoyed when my college friends who graduated come back to attend some party or something and need a bed to sleep in. And I don’t know why. I came home today early from my studies to ppl in my house my friends knew talking socializing with my friends and I felt so out of place. College Ppl say I stop caring about them and only care about my girlfriend and I don’t care. My girlfriend says otherwise but I kinda don’t want her to be my only company. Even though it doesn’t feel like that as I have other friends from high school and she feels I put them ahead of her. Why don’t I wanna socialize with my main college peers anymore. I dont make my girlfriend my focus however she is the one that sees and hear from me the most. I feel like I don’t get it anymore. Yet I’m content. Sorry for the long response I’m just talking from the dome. I kinda feel like I’m isolating myself kind of."

qlxda0,0,2021-11-03,Advice on which Internship to take,brimst0ner,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qlxda0/advice_on_which_internship_to_take/,"Currently I have 2 internship offers. Both in the same city. 

&amp;#x200B;

One offer is a systems engineer internship at a search engine company (not google). I think that having some experience with systems and infrastructure would be valuable and attractive for employers, but honestly I have no clue. Also this would be the teams first time with an intern. They assured me that I would have a structured project while working alongside a team.

  
The other offer is a software developer internship at a Fintech company. I want to end up in software and want the software dev intern title on my resume. This intern program is well known for being very structured aka not their first time with an intern.

&amp;#x200B;

 They both pay about the same, but I believe that the search engine company is more well known.

  
This would be my last internship before I go full time, leaning towards the software job but not 100% sure. I also already had a web dev internship last summer. Any advice would be appreciated!"

I have 10 years experience working in IT sysadmin/Infrastructure roles, but essentially none working in development. 

Things are feeling a bit stale in my current role and the business I'm currently working for hasn't been doing too well financially recently, so I'm thinking about making a move in the new year. I've been looking at some junior/paid intern roles to get my foot in the door and get some experience (even if this results in a substantial salary reduction). I live about an hours train commute from London, so working in the capital is an option for me.

My question is, would it be better to wait until I finish my degree to try and make the move and just hold out in my current role? I have some good foundation knowledge of python and java but not much else yet. With no real-world experience, would it be impossible to find a role without first finishing my degree? Should I just brush up my CV and see who bites for entry-level/junior positions?

Really confused about what I should do at the moment and don't know anyone else in the industry I can ask for help. Thank you for any advice, it really is appreciated!"

Last Summer, I did a SWE internship at a fortune 100 company, which I somewhat enjoyed and accepted a return offer (Seattle). I still interviewed however, and just received a verbal offer from a Big 4 firm as a technology consultant. I understand that software is more lucrative, but I personally don't think I'm good enough at leetcode to ever get into a lucrative company(FAANG). I believe that I can be equally good at software and consulting, it's just that the coding interviews are very hard to me. Also, since this is my final internship before fulltime, this next internship is likely leading into a full time offer and I'm afraid that if I take the consulting internship, it'll sort of cut me off from SWE for a while. My brother was a technology consultant at the same company and never even touched a line of code, but is now a project manager.

Side note, my personal goal is to be a tech dev team leader/tech project manager if that matters.

Any thoughts and advice would be greatly appreciated.

Context: I’m an international student in Australia and was offered a vacationer role in Tax at PwC Aus. I was also on my gap year in 2021. 

I got the opportunity to intern at a top Tier-2 strategy consulting firm in my home country and really enjoyed strategy consulting. Before this, I also interned at EY back in my home country as an International Tax intern and hated it. 

Sooo my question is:-

1. If they offer me a grad role after my vacationer ends, should I decline and apply for Strategy&amp;?
2. Should I take the grad role and ask for internal transfer to S&amp; a few months in my job

I’m not keen on option 1 ask I’m afraid that it will have a huge impact on my reputation at PwC and am scared that internal transfer is difficult as both teams are relatively different.

Also, it’s super hard for international students to land an internship/grad role in australia so I really don’t want to mess up my chances since I’m already inside the system.

I am just about to start my first job out of university as a junior data scientist, which is a fully remote position with a small startup (\~20 people) in the north of the UK. I will be the second data scientist at the company, working under the direction of an experienced lead. I should note that I have completed two internships, one in engineering and the other in DS, so I am thankfully not completely inexperienced. 

I have a couple of questions in particular, if that is alright.

**1) Do you have any advice for me, as someone who is about to join a small company that will likely have little ability to mentor me and is working on a 'as yet to be proven' software product?** 

I understand that I must be able to learn quickly and produce, but if you have any experience with a situation like this, I'd be extremely grateful for any tips you have.

**2) When in a fully remote position, is it generally acceptable to work from outside of the house, as long as it is a proper environment such as a library or even a rented desk in a co-working space?** 

I am currently still living with my parents (which the company knows about as it was mentioned in my interview) and as a result, I do not have the best working space. I have a small room in a pretty loud house and I do not feel that I can work to the best of my ability here. 

**3) If I am to work from outside of the house, I imagine it is advisable to utilize a personal WiFi connection such as dongle?**

At my recent DS internship this summer, I was still a student (it was an industrial placement as part of my MSc thesis project) and so I worked from the university library. My manager at the company became annoyed at me for doing that, as I was using the university WiFi for work and he was concerned about a possible data breach. I understand that may have been stupid of me.

I'd deeply appreciate any advice that you have and thank you for taking the time. Hope you are well!"

At 16 I worked at a cinema that had a three strikes and you're out policy. My first strike was being a dollar short on cash out. Second strike was calling out sick without a doctor's note. Third strike was getting my doctor's note to them too late after the fact. There were no vacation or sick days. The manager flagrantly disregarded the rules we all had to follow (hairnet at concessions, no jewelry, no nailpolish, typical food handler rules). My third strike was around the time I called her out on it. 

After that at 18 I worked at a tea shop four days a week. I had my own regulars. After a year I got fired and was told I was a ""seasonal"" hire that stayed on too long. No vacation or sick days again but we were allowed to drink free unlimited tea at work. My termination fell in line with me having one more cup a day than I usually did.

Then was a jeans warehouse at 20. Again no paid vacay or sick days, but the manager was lax when it came to calling in sick. I quit after a friend I worked with assaulted me. I had gotten him the job but he outperformed me in terms of charisma. I told the manager he had forced himself on me and I didn't want to work shifts with him. The manager told me I could work my scheduled hours with him or leave, it wasn't his problem because it didnt happen at work.

After that I worked at a bar as a cook, a friend got me the job. More no vacation and no sick days. They were night shifts because during the day I had culinary school. The job was fine for a while. I had to quit because at the end of culinary I got hired at the hotel I did my UNPAID 175 hour internship with (I did the math; regular hotel salary was 20 an hour for new hires before probation-- thats 3500$ they got out of me in free labor before taxes,  and both this and the bar job were full time. There was 0 free time for those 175 hours). I had to serve this bar a government ordered letter to get my tax papers.

The hotel... was awful. I was 25 afab in a sea of 45-60yo men. The sexual harassment alone even after I left was ridiculous. They would often have me finish at 1am and then have me scheduled for the breakfast shift- I had to be up at 4am to catch the subway. So three hours of sleep. When I mentioned the illegality of this, they told me all new hires did this to ""put hair on their chest."" They fired me before  my 3 month probation was up for not smiling enough; clearly I didn't want to be there. Didn't care to fight it because the workplace was shit and unemployment insurance gave me a nice break from the grind. Worth noting that after the 3 months my salary would have gone up to 23 an hour and I would have been unionized.

After the hotel it was a college bar. Only open during the school year and they gave forms for unemployment during the summer. No paid vacation or sick days. The first year was horrible; it was just me and the head chef he did days and I did nights. There was no tip splitting. At the very least I negotiated my salary up from 12 to 14 with my culinary degree. The second year there was a change in management (supposedy they rotate to prevent corruption?). The new manager was a twink 6 years my junior who came from money and looked like a stereotypical grindr page that read ""no blacks Asians or fatties."" He was constantly increasing our workload and making us do catering spreads for his own extracurricular meetings during lunch and dinner rushes. At the end of the school year my then ldr boyfriend (now husband) was coming to Canada for a week and it was the last week of work. I asked if I could take the last week off but still come in for the big clean. They said no. I said I was going to take off anyway. They said okay and fired me so I could get the usual unemployment instead. They didn't contact me for the next school year.

I decided no more kitchens because it was thankless. Got hired on as a barista/waitress at Mandy's (essentially a rich white mom salad restaurant). Vacation and sick days allowed, but unpaid. Raises every year. Lasted ALMOST a year, they fired me for ""theft"" citing my continuously giving free lemonade to the kitchen staff. I argued that this was ridiculous given that it was summer, the staff gets unlimited free coffee during their shift which is more expensive because they buy luxury brands, and we were told to give them lemonade during a period when the coffee machine was down. Well, none of that mattered because the coffee machine worked again and theft is theft. Never mind that we made the lemonade from scratch 7.5 litres at a time with simple syrup, lemon juice concentrate, and 80% water... I'm SURE my termination had nothing to do with the fact that I was trying to convince the girls who had been there over two years to go after the raises they were promised...

At the end of 2019 I decided no more hospitality, I'm done with restaurants. Now I work at an undisclosed hospital as a medical secretary. I've had three run-ins with the manager, one meeting between her and I with HR, and I'm not optimistic for the future lmfao. At least now I make a decent salary, have a secure position, and get 2 weeks paid vacay and 6.9 (what kind of random number is this??) paid sick days. Vacay days grow as my seniority does. But no raises ever.

Anyway that's where I'm at now at 29. I'm tired and burnt out. Would love nothing more than to hang in the towel and say fuck work forever."

for context, i’m 24F, and still living with my parents. the toxic parent in question is my father. i realized that there was something off about my home environment when i was in primary school. at that time people were still super into high school musical, lol, but i was never allowed to watch tv, so naturally i was left out of many conversations and that probably contributed to me becoming the introvert i am today. my father also for some reason decided to restrict my internet access (this was when i was 11-14) to literally one hour every day from 7–8pm (he set this limit on the router). this backfired in a terrible way i feel because it made me more obsessed with going online and making full use of this one hour every day so from an outsider’s point of view i was always fretting about absolutely having to be on the computer by 7pm and it made him feel like i was addicted. in hindsight, i wasn’t addicted i was just fucking deprived. this was to the point where i would even not do homework that required online research because it ate into my internet time. also, if i wanted to watch tv or anything i would go over to my neighbour’s house, but he found out and stopped letting me go over for more than half an hour each time.

for many years, my only outlet was reading. i wanted to escape from reality so bad, but he started controlling the kind of books i consume (all because some annoying nosy auntie from church told him i was reading harry potter and ~magic~ wasn’t that good an influence). i even had to hide the books i borrowed and read them in the bathroom, in the middle of the night using a handheld torch, or just under the table in school. his favourite punishment for me was not allowing me to read lol.

once i started secondary school, i got quite depressed, a major contribution was because i joined a sports cca but i always felt inferior and that i didn’t perform as well as everyone. on top of that, due to all the restrictions my father placed on my freedom (my phone was under parental controls, so apart from calling and sms, it was useless. no whatsapp, no safari, no social media etc.), it was difficult for me to make friends. i sometimes had training up to 4 times a week, and on the rare occasion i had no cca, i wasn’t allowed to hang out with my classmates. when my cca had updates / new schedules, i was the only one who couldn’t receive the whatsapp so someone would need to sms me the details. when the team had sleepovers, movie marathons and outings during the school holidays, i would be the only one not present because i didn’t get permission. he confiscated my phone so often that i might as well not have one at all. he reads my texts (and even fucking replies sometimes) so my friends etc. stopped feeling comfortable messaging me. i felt very alienated from everyone. once, our team had an away game scheduled with another school (on the other side of the island). i had informed my father beforehand that i had a game. but he still called up my coach after checking the gps tracker he placed on my phone and seeing i was not at school. coach got mad and asked me why i didn’t tell him, to which i answered i did, but was still punished to run 10 rounds around the field in front of everyone. i felt so wronged ok. i started self harming (but not in obvious places) and someone reported me to the school counsellor. to this day i don’t know who it was, but it might be from the team since it’s possible i accidentally pushed my sleeves up during training. the first thing my parents did when they found out was call me stupid and crazy, that i 吃饱没事做 (direct transl. nothing to do after eating aka. too much time on my hands). i knew therapy was out of the question. finally quit the cca and lived up to everyone’s expectations as a disappointment at the end of sec 3. sure, i let them call me a quitter, someone with weak willpower and was always ready to give up. but i was honestly so mentally and physically drained, i could not care less. and my results then were terrible, F9s were everywhere. i worked a little harder in the last two months and managed to improve my grades for O levels so it was one small feat for me.

the next issue was i chose to go to poly instead of jc. they were not happy and said they couldn’t afford to pay for my school fees. that wasn’t an issue in the end because i received a scholarship. by this point my phone was finally off restrictions, and my poly days were relatively stress-free. i think this was also because i stayed in campus from 9am to 11+pm nearly every day, trying to keep my scholarship and gpa up, then worked on saturdays so i didn’t have to interact with my father often. graduated top 3 of my cohort but i realized during my internship that i didn’t want to be in that line of work forever, so i applied to a different major in uni. got in after an appeal.

uni was another low point in life. i just graduated recently so these days i’ve been thinking a lot, and realized my uni life was quite disappointing. my social circle was almost nonexistent, mostly touch-and-go, since it wasn’t feasible for me to join a cca (i live all the way in the extreme east and couldn’t fork out extra to afford ntu hall fees, neither could parents pay for hall). the first 2 years were awful, when i had morning lab, i had to wake up at 5:30am. sometimes classes ended at 7 so by the time i got home it would be nearly 10pm. then there would be tutorials/graded homework sets. when my schedule freed up a little i squeezed in part time shifts.

for context, i took a IT-related diploma in poly and then jumped ship to a pure science major, so braving the learning curve was truly a gravity-defying experience rip. most of my free time was spent self-studying the h2 content i needed to bridge the knowledge gap, dying over homework or on the mrt. my first sem gpa was pretty bad so i spent the next 3.5 years just straight up grinding to get my gpa to over 4.0. never hung out with anyone from uni until i was in year 3 and found some breathing space. didn’t get to date or have that fun uni experience everyone raved about. i ended up graduating with a second upper so i guess the work paid off, and looking back, i’m glad i didn’t go through with the two times i printed out the withdrawal form haha. felt like a load off my chest and that the depression wasn’t for nothing but at the same time, i think these were the loneliest 4 years of my life. can’t help feeling like i’m losing out on some of life’s supposedly best years.

**——— the tldr / main point of my rant:**

i thought that since i’m officially an Adult™ now, my father would let up, but he still insists on micromanaging me. whenever i take up new hobbies, he would say things like “you’re such a quitter, what a waste of money” and i know he’s just spiting me but it’s so demoralizing that i end up dropping them.

covid has made this entire situation worse because i have no excuse to leave the house. back in 2020 when covid first started he didn’t even let me Step Outside, shouting at me whenever i even mention going out, saying i’ll bring the virus back into HIS house. i’m going crazy at home. i got used to that level of unreasonable demand from him but who knew that recently he would get even More unreasonable??

just to name a few new demands:

[ decided to edit these out because realized they are obvious identifiers for the family. ]

i have two younger siblings (i’m the eldest) and my father only micromanages and gaslights my sister and i. he doesn’t do any of this bullshit to my brother, he even encourages him when he takes up hobbies. wtf?? i feel like my entire experience growing up has just made me bitter, angry and emotionally repressed. my anger management is definitely better now, and the few friends i have generally know me as chill but every time i get triggered again it’s because of him.

i want to move out so bad. also, thanks to the new housing policy, singles and lgbt are disadvantaged again. i’m gay, lonely and crave personal space so much. i’d prefer renting a studio / dual key suite because i’m introverted and really, really no longer want shared spaces. is it trauma? maybe. but what can my traineeship allowance of 2.5k do, lol. i still have to save more than 60% of it because my prof is encouraging me to take my masters and when i’m doing so i can’t work full time. the more i stay in this house, the more i lose my mind.

am i the only one in this dead end of a situation?? like *please* someone tell me i’ll make it through. people with similar experiences, how are you coping?? i’m at my wit’s end.

**edit :** thanks for the hugs, advice and encouragement everyone. really appreciate it! and to those in the same predicament as i am, hang in there. if no one has told you yet, you’re doing very well. ♥"

1: Getting a 2nd degree at a local university, which will take about 2 years and 25k which is quite a lot of money.

2:  Going to WGU for online classes, but I do not think much will transfer there and it will take about 2 more years and another 12-15k approximately.

3: Getting an associated at a college near me, which should not cost too much and will only take about a year.

4: Studying and building a portfolio, maybe trying to get an internship this Summer. I plan on taking the AWS CCP exam soon for a certification then trying to build a project or two. My knowledge of java is alright, but hopefully I will get better soon.

qm7ahw,1,2021-11-03,"How hard is it to get a Software Engineering internship in a large, non-tech company? E.g. Home Depot, Staples, Lowe's, Office Depot etc.. (personal experiences)",ls91212,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qm7ahw/how_hard_is_it_to_get_a_software_engineering/,"I've recently attempted a career change and I've been trying to get on the path of software engineering. I'm currently enrolled in the prep course to get into the coding bootcamp Hack Reactor for the Software Engineering Immersive program (part-time). My reasoning is, if I can get an internship as a software developer in any sort of company - just to get some measure of professional experience prior to even joining the bootcamp it will bolster my chances of getting a job as an entry level engineer by the time I finish the program. My setbacks however are : I haven't completed nor am I enrolled in any sort of accredited Computer Science program ( I have an Associate's degree, not computer science related), I don't have any prior experience and I don't have a portfolio showcasing any independent projects. I have a foundation on the basics of  HTML, CSS and Javascript : I'm well versed in their terminology and can write code in IDEs and have taken courses with Codecademy and Galvanize but that's the extent of my skillset. Maybe I'm jumping the gun as I'm not even sure that I qualify for an internship. Does anyone have advice for someone in my position? Are their any companies  willing to take someone with those credentials? And if not. What's my next move? 

any advice is welcomed, thanks"

So do u think I should take IBM for summer or look for a better company for the summer or fall term? Note the Ford internship wasn't on my resume when I got IBM so it would be on my resume if I look for another company. Any advice is greatly appreciated!"

G&amp;S will charge a $0.49 + 2.89% fee. If a fee is incurred, a refund would result in PayPal keeping some or all of your fee, which I will not reimburse, so please be careful.

qm8u34,0,2021-11-03,Hired as an intern after a Bootcamp and I'm overwhelmed,ohUmeanTHATbracket,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qm8u34/hired_as_an_intern_after_a_bootcamp_and_im/," I graduated from a coding Bootcamp in March this year and after a grueling few months I gave up the search so I could focus on actually making money until I do find a position as a full-time software engineer.  I had a few interviews here and there but nothing that actually translated into a job in our field.

&amp;#x200B;

Last month I sent an application to a local company that has about 10 employees and was accepted as an intern. Congratulations...right? Well, I have never worked in the software they use in the company and since it is small, there as no training involved either. It was basically like, "" We are using this, and I need you to build out the rest of this product."" Granted - its relatively easy work, its mostly just CSS and HTML but there are a few things that have me worried  and one is I don't feel like I'm contributing enough. As an intern I had more of an expectation of being under the wing of a more experienced programmer for pair programming or something of that nature - not being depended on for the design of a project. I really feel bad about it because I work full time and I want to devote more time but its difficult when my other non tech job already demands 40 hours from me. ( btw this internship is unpaid). I'm not sure if I could deliver with what they are asking and I dont know if I should just step down to save myself from embarrassment or bother the already super busy developer/CEO of the company.  Am I overreacting or is this type of situation normal?"

I would appreciate some advise on how I can work towards more degrees. I am doing a part-time online MBA right now and will finish that shortly. But even with that I am struggling to give it enough time.

So I am looking for some options where the time commitment is very low (or as low as possible). I am also not very well off so ideally am looking for a low cost option too, but this isn't a huge issue as I am happy to borrow from my family.

My research obviously found all the buy a degree options which I don't want to do. I don't need to sit in all the classes, but atleast writing the exam (or doing the project) to get the degree is important. So would appreciate any thoughts.

I am not only looking for Science/Tech degrees. I am open to MCom, other degrees."

After working 2 years in this industry, I wanted a challenge and decided to gain more technical skills by going back to school. I wanted to work with data and become a data analyst, so I took some online courses on Python and Tableau. I wanted to gain real life experience, but a lot of internships were only offered to students enrolled in a full time program. I took my shot and enrolled in a community college where I managed to land an internship working on a project involving artificial intelligence and creating a chatbot. I learned a lot in this internship, most of the time I felt I was holding my team down since I came in with barely any experience. I was exposed to app development using the Angular framework, google developer tools to build my chatbot, and conducting user experience research for our application. However, my internship has ended and I am left feeling similarly lost as I was before

It's been about 1.5\~2 years since I started my learning journey. I've done so much reading on reddit and watching YouTube videos about advice for people learning programming on their own or transitioning their careers that I'm left with seeing multiple paths and ending up not being able to choose one path. I applied for graduate school and got rejected earlier this year, and recently I got rejected after two separate job interviews for a software analyst position and chatbot developer position. Someone once gave me an advice saying, ""you only need one yes"". But, I am quite discouraged and wish I had a mentor. 

I was interested in UX research after my internship, but I've been taking math classes like calculus to fulfill prerequisites and potentially get a second degree in Computer Science. Right now, I am not sure what to do. I've gotten so stressed that my skin condition, eczema, has came back and it is really inflamed. After clearing my head for me a bit, I became overwhelmed looking back at my experiences. 

*Should I continue taking community college courses like linear algebra, discrete math? Should I apply for a second bachelors in CS? What about a masters? But who can I ask for letter of recommendations? Or should I apply to jobs and continue interviewing? Should I build my portfolio and sharpen my knowledge learnt outside of my courses?  Do leet code? Do I want to be a user researcher? Front-end web developer? If I'm taking all these math and programming courses, I mine as well should become a software engineer right? How long will it take me? What should my focus be?* 

The pressure to figure this all out ASAP is stemmed from my household situation, I am the only sibling that can bring my household out of poverty, so there is a lot of pressure to find a high earning career. I believe I can do it. But I'm worried I will become so overwhelmed physically.. 

I think my issue is that I am not sure what my options are. If I want to become a software engineer, what should I focus on to get that role? I want to utilize my degree in Linguistics as it was interesting for me so a career working with chatbots would be preferred. But I do not want to limit myself as well. 

I am posting in hopes there are other people with similar dilemmas as mine that could shed some light for me.. or anyone who has advice would be appreciated.. thank you."

This will be quite a long story, and I also apologize in advance for any grammar mistakes, I’m Brazilian and English is not my first language.

In 2017 (I was 18) I met an American through an app called Yellow (it doesn’t exist anymore). He was 20. We talked for over two years before we got to meet in person. Our love grew and even though we didn’t consider ourselves a couple (because it would be crazy to start a relationship with someone that lives almost 10 thousand kilometers from you that you’ve never even met in person), we didn’t have anything with anyone else in the meantime. To be honest though, he wanted us to assume ourselves as a couple back then, but I refused. We were always messaging, video calling and sending each other cards for special dates, so we could have something palpable. 

In 2019 I got my very first job (was an internship actually), I didn’t make much, but I saved all the money to buy a plane ticket to go there and see him. Important to mention that his parents didn’t trust me enough to let him come here first, because there’s this stereotype of people from “third world countries” wanting to marry people from rich countries just to get citizenship, so in order to prove I wasn’t that type of person I had to go there first. I spent a long time trying to convince my parents to do so and also raising money for the ticket. Our mothers actually started messaging each other throughout the process, and that helped build some trust. Finally the day came, I got enough money for the ticket and bought it. That was one of the happiest days of my life. That was June 2019. We met on January 2020. The rest of 2019 I was just dreaming about the special day and I was so motivated I got the best grades ever at university. My life was perfect, I had nothing to complain about. 

So the day came. After almost 24 hours of flying and airport layovers, I was there. It was a feeling I’ll never forget: a mix of the good type of anxiety and victory for finally being able to meet the guy I loved. I stayed there with him from January to March 2020. He was extremely nice and romantic, I never felt so happy, he really was my soulmate. He was also a very emotional guy, wasn’t ashamed of crying and showing his emotions towards me. He asked me to be his girlfriend the day after I got there and he cried when I said yes. I never expected what I’ll tell next to happen though. On my last day there, his parents drove with us to drop me off at the airport, and he cried the whole way there. We spent some time by ourselves at the airport, and when the time came for me to go through security to go to the gates, he got down on one knee and asked me to marry him. I never expected that and I was just filled with happiness. Then I said yes but had to walk away, so yeah, even though it was a beautiful moment it was also very sad. 

I came back to Brazil and we just went back to our online relationship. He eventually came here on December 2020 and stayed until February 2021. We had an awesome time here, I took him to the beach, it was his first time seeing the ocean. I’ll never forget his smile when we went in the water. So towards the end of his stay we sat down with my family and told them our plans. His parents would give us, as their wedding gift, one of the best immigration lawyers in the United States, so I could get a K1 Visa and get married there. We started the process, sent them a bunch of documents and were just waiting on the government to give us a feedback. This process is a bit slow now because of the pandemic, so we spent this whole year waiting.

Now there comes the bad part of the story, that I never thought would happen. October 2021, the worst month of my life.
Actually, I need to go back a little bit, to August 2021. There was this Brazilian girl that did a high school exchange at his city a few years back, 2017/2018. They only saw each other in person once at the time, had each other added on Snapchat ever since, but never talked. When the Tokyo Olympics finally started, she posted a story on Snapchat about Brazil losing in a game of volleyball or something, that’s what he told me at least. Since him and I always watched the games together when we could, he knew about it and replied to her story making a joke. They’ve been talking ever since. He told her about me and our story, that we were engaged, etc, and she thought it was awesome and asked to follow me on Instagram. I accepted it. She was extremely nice to me in the beginning and also replied extremely fast. After a few days talking on there she asked me for my WhatsApp number. I’ll confess that I didn’t really want to give her because I barely knew her and I don’t like giving my number to random people. But I didn’t want to be rude so I ended up giving her my number and we started talking there. After just a little while talking on WhatsApp, she asked me if we wanted to do a video call with her (us 3). I thought she was moving way too fast with intimacy with us, but I asked my fiancé if he wanted to and he said it was up to me. I ended up accepting it. It was actually nice and we called once or twice more. Well, so this situation of her being friends with us lasted for about a month, but around the beginning of October I started being suspicious about some things with the two. We used to call every night before I slept (I’m at GMT-3 and he’s at GMT-5), and he started giving excuses to go to sleep earlier because he was feeling sick, tired, etc, and I believed him. Well, all those times he was ending our call earlier to call her for 3 hours straight. They also called at other times during the day that I never knew about. He also put ghost mode on on Snapchat so I couldn’t see when he was there talking to her, and he was always saying it was a glitch (I only believed that because Snapchat really is a very glitchy app, but none of the times I asked it was an actual glitch). He admitted everything after. They were flirting, sexting and everything and at the time it was just two months after they started talking.

I only found out because a few days after I started getting suspicious, I messaged him asking if she had ever flirted with him. He said yes, and I freaked out. I also found out later on that the moment I sent him that message they were on a call, and he told her so she was pressuring him to tell me the truth. That’s the only reason why he said yes. Then as I saw he wasn’t replying to my messages, I called him and obviously interrupted their call. He answered. This was a long call, I told him everything I had been suspicious about and he confirmed every single thing. Then, at night, we called again. Our longest video call ever. 9 hours and 37 minutes straight. I’ve been so bad lately that I can’t remember everything, but how it went was basically me telling him all my feelings, how I would do everything over and over again to have the same love and happiness feeling as I did when I went there, how I would sacrifice everything how many times I would need to, just to feel that way again. Then also about our dreams of having a family and everything, how he destroyed everything within a few days. I’ve seen him cry lots in the past, but nothing like this night. He was bawling his eyes out. The call lasted all night. It ended at around 7:30am and I slept until 8:30am.  He slept longer than I did. When he woke up, he sent me a long message apologizing, saying how bad he felt and begged for my forgiveness. Yes I know, I’m stupid, but I was going to forgive him. He was telling me that anything I wanted him to do to gain my trust back, to let him know. I told him to block her in all social medias. He did. He sent me screenshots of everything. 

The long call happened from a Friday night through a Saturday morning. His regret and attempt to try gaining my trust back only lasted until Sunday. These two days he spent apologizing and telling me how he wanted to grow old with me, that kind of stuff. Well, like all this didn’t seem bad enough, the worst part of the story comes now. On Monday morning, I was at the gym, and I got a message from him. The way he wrote seemed odd, so I asked if something was wrong and he said he didn’t feel good. I immediately left the gym and told him to give me a few minutes, that I would get home and we could call. As soon as I got home, I didn’t even shower or anything, I just went to my room and called him. Then he just finished shattering my heart. He said he needed to be honest with me. He said that from the very first time we met in person, when I went there, he felt something wasn’t right between us. That he didn’t feel a connection. He said kissing and other intimate moments felt weird. He said he only proceeded with everything, asked me to marry him, started my Visa process and everything because he was scared of being alone. Since he never had another relationship before and I was the first one that ever got interested in him, he felt like he had to do everything he could to keep me in his life, so he wouldn’t end up alone. Now that he had found this other girl, he felt he really connected with someone. I was stabbed in the back multiple times by the person that always said that I was his soulmate and by a girl that came into my life pretending to be my friend, and I actually believed that. This same day he unblocked her in all social medias and changed his profile picture everywhere (it was a picture of us).

So yeah, my world just fell apart in a matter of days. He became what he criticized the most and I became what I feared the most. I’m already a skinny person and I lost around 4kg in a week. I never had trouble sleeping, now I simply can’t have at least a decent night of sleep. I wake up in the middle of the night many  times with my heart racing, I have multiple nightmares about the situation. I even had a few panic attacks. I don’t have energy to do anything. I’m on my last semester of college and I can’t do anything. I can’t eat, I’ve thrown up multiple times and just seeing food makes me nauseous. I honestly rather be dead than have all these feelings. Less than a month ago I was the happiest person ever, I had something to look forward to, I had someone in my life that I thought that loved me. Turned out it was just a huge lie. 

No matter how much I write about this, how much detail I put into everything, I won’t be able to describe my sadness and emptiness. I would wish no one this feeling, not even them."

I am just about to start my first job out of university as a junior data scientist, which is a fully remote position with a small startup (\~20 people). I will be the second data scientist at the company, working under the direction of an experienced lead. I should note that I have completed two internships, one in engineering and the other in DS, so I am thankfully not completely inexperienced.

I have a few questions in particular, if that is alright.

**1) Do you have any advice for me, as someone who is about to join a small company that will likely have little ability to mentor me and is working on a 'as yet to be proven' software product?**

I understand that I must be able to learn quickly and produce, but if you have any experience with a situation like this, I'd be extremely grateful for any tips you have.

**2) When in a fully remote position, is it generally acceptable to work from outside of the house, as long as it is a proper environment such as a library or even a rented desk in a co-working space?**

I am currently still living with my parents (which the company knows about as it was mentioned in my interview) and as a result, I do not have the best working space. I have a small room in a pretty loud house and I do not feel that I can work to the best of my ability here.

**3) If I am to work from outside of the house, I imagine it is advisable to utilize a personal WiFi connection such as dongle?**

At my recent DS internship this summer, I was still a student (it was an industrial placement as part of my MSc thesis project) and so I worked from the university library. My manager at the company became annoyed at me for doing that, as I was using the university WiFi for work and he was concerned about a possible data breach.

qmjn1k,2,2021-11-04,Will publishing a paper on real time simulations with my professor help with future job applications?,MrBoogle_,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qmjn1k/will_publishing_a_paper_on_real_time_simulations/,"I'm currently in my 3rd year of undergrad and I've secured a decent 1 year internship as a SE at Red Hat. I'm also currently doing research with my professor in a field related to real time computer graphics which involves a lot of optimization, simulation algorithms, using the GPU for parallelism, etc. My professor has asked whether I'm interested in continuing with him to go on to publish a paper on our findings. I personally find it interesting but I'm not sure if I have the time, I'd have to dump in at least 100 hours in the next 6ish months which doesn't seem like much but I'm already swamped with a full time computer engineering course load and I already get ~6 hrs of sleep on avg. However, I'd have more of a reason to pursue it if I knew it could help me in the future and not just in terms of future research/grad school. Do you guys think having a publication with me as a main contributor + my internship at Red Hat would help me stand out on job applications? Would it significantly help i.e. is it worth the time? I'm studying computer engineering and I'm interested in both pure software and working closer to the hardware (i.e. operating systems, drivers, AMD, intel, etc).

Edit: I'd also like to say that being able to publish a paper isn't guaranteed, we could spend 100s of hours and come up empty handed. We've made some decent headway into what we're researching but nothing is guaranteed."
qmjy7r,5,2021-11-04,Should I start programming with courses on Udemy or those from top universities?,KLBS38,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/qmjy7r/should_i_start_programming_with_courses_on_udemy/,"Hello,

I was wondering if it's better to start programming with courses on Udemy or courses available online from major universities (Harvard, MIT, etc.)?

I hesitate between the two because Udemy courses (I think those of Angela Yu in particular) are very practical, while those of the big universities can be a little less, and turned more towards management and theory.

However, in order to find a job, it seems to me that certifications from top schools can be much more valuable on a resume.

I know that I should ideally do both: Udemy courses and a certification from a top school, but where do I start? I have to find an internship in 3 months and I would love to value my new skills as soon as possible, but I wouldn't have time to learn both in that time.

qmli19,6,2021-11-04,Rambling Thoughts: What Does It Mean to be rich? Why can't we be kind,smol-bean_,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/qmli19/rambling_thoughts_what_does_it_mean_to_be_rich/,"This is not an angry post or a rallying cry. I am, to put it simply, sad and confused. I am sort of posting just because I need to say this without having someone try to debate with me, or whatever.

The cynical part of me -- developed to respond to the (relatively small, comparatively) cruelties I have experienced -- wants to just yell ""humans suck! we all suck!""

I worked for an executive producer so psychotic and psychologically abusive (also sexist &amp; racist, of course) that I would have preferred to work for Harvey Weinstein (and I'm not the only woman who felt that way. Young women left his company to work for Weinstein, and the guy I worked for never sexually harassed or assaulted anyone.) I thought it was just this guy who was like this -- and he was running his own company, so there was no real accountability for him.

I started reading more and learning more about what happens to people who work in the entertainment industry -- and then realized it wasn't these abuses weren't limited to that industry. **But why is cruelty the default of so many managers?** Studies have shown that's not even an effective management style, which leads to higher turnover/costs. So this isn't even more efficient economically -- and I would assume that a general sense of goodwill towards your managers/company will likely lead people to accept lower salaries (although I have no evidence to support that.) Why would companies permit, and in some cases, encourage blatantly abusive behavior?

I was always theoretically pro-union, pro-labor, etc; but because of my upbringing (rich in early childhood, downgraded to upper middle class after the '08 crash &amp; my parents having to sell our home to pay for my college education several years after the crash) I never thought of these issues as something that would apply to me. I always thought I would go to college, maybe do some internships, drift into a middle-class job, and then slowly work my way up. These issues never felt real until I worked for that producer. I still have nightmares about him screaming at me.

And now, moving out of my parents, and trying to pay for housing, I (somewhat) understand economic fear for the first time. I am still unbelievably privileged -- I always have a place to go in my worst case scenario -- but what does it mean that privilege in our society still means you're a few paychecks away from losing your apartment? One serious medical emergency away from losing your apartment?

I am trying to be softer, kinder, gentler even though society is not conducive to that. It's important to have boundaries, and to be tough, and stick it to the man. But I try to tip as much as I can reasonably afford to, and be kind as often as I can - I'm trying to silence the cynic in my head because there are so many of us out there, who just wish we could all work maximum 20-30 hours a week and paint and look at flowers and go to museums or whatever your hobby is! And some people need a little softness before they can be kind as well."

qmmhio,100,2021-11-04,My mom is treating my application process like her application process,92coups17,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/qmmhio/my_mom_is_treating_my_application_process_like/,"I love my mom and I appreciate her and all that she's done for me. I really do. But I'm just so frustrated because she keeps on pushing me to apply to colleges that I don't want to apply to.

First it was with Yale; I wanted to ED1 UChicago because as a school and as a whole, it's my top choice, but she told me I wasn't aiming high enough and that my future would be ruined if I didn't give any of HYPSM a chance. I went to my counselor asking for support but instead he ganged up with my mom (she was also there), telling me that I should ""give it a shot"" and that I never know and that I might like it there 💀. I have high scores but literally nothing else on top of that so I can see where they're coming from but at the same time, I just didn't want to apply. They kept on asking me, ""Well, why specifically don't you want to apply?"" and I had to keep explaining to them that I don't know specifically why, but I just didn't want to - are my own feelings about the schools I'm applying to not good enough? But they kept on pushing and pushing, and eventually I gave in just to get it over with. We (my mom and I) had four days of arguments about that and I spent two of those crying myself to sleep because of how scathingly she was speaking of me, basically telling me I was a disappointment for not being ambitious enough. I've already submitted my REA app and I personally still don't think I have a chance (happy to help pad their low acceptance rate ig...) but whatever!

Anyway, that's done now and she and my counselor helped me a ton throughout the process, so I'm super grateful to the both of them for that! I thought I could get through the rest of my apps in peace now that I've applied to that one big name (I'm applying to UChi ED2!!). But then yesterday afternoon, after she came back from grocery shopping, she sat me down and told me ""I think we should try applying to Harvard"". Yes, she used ""we"", not ""you"" but ""we"". I told her that I was wary and I still didn't want to apply, but she said, ""but we've never had a chance. This might be the only time I can do this. I couldn't apply when I was young and there's no hope for your brother. Why can't you just do it?"" She specifically related it all to herself, and she isn't ashamed that she's trying to live through me, who does not want to do this. I really wanted to tell her that this is ***my*** application process and not hers, but I also don't want a repeat of all the arguments we had over Yale because I'm tired and busy enough as it is and I don't want more stress on top of that. We ended that conversation after I said okay and I thought I wouldn't have to think about it for a little longer, but as soon as she came home from work today, she sat me down again and said, ""So I was doing some research into the application process and this is what I found,"" and then proceeded to tell me that she signed me up for an information session (without my knowledge), added me to their mailing list, found their admissions criteria page, and told me to get to work. I'm going to ask my counselor to see if he can back me up and help talk her down from this, but given his track record I'm not too sure. So I guess I'm applying RD to H\*rv\*rd...

And a side note about my mom and the H-word: this has been her dream since God knows how long. She's been telling her colleagues ever since I was in kindergarten that I'm going to get into there, and once I was old enough to understand exactly how hard it is to get into there, I've been telling her that that's unrealistic. I'm a good student, but I'm quiet, slow on the uptake, and I don't work particularly hard outside of class. I haven't done an internship or a job, nor have I done any outside research or made a portfolio or whatever. I just checked their website, and I haven't even fulfilled the recommended high school coursework (I did 3 years of 2 different languages instead of 4 of 1 language, and I only have 2 years of social studies). If I were ever to apply, I would be an automatic reject because this is the H-word we're talking about. But my mom keeps on telling me that it wasn't fair that she didn't have this opportunity when she was younger and growing up in an underdeveloped country. She tells me that I were her, I would be fighting tooth and nail to get in because of how much it means. She tells me that if Harvard's graduate school had a better program for her profession, she absolutely would have applied there instead of the school she went to (one of the top for molecular science but, in her words, ""only"" T50). Basically, for as long as I can remember, she's been putting me into the stereotypical ""but it's not my dream, mom, it's yours"" situation except for college. I don't know how to tell her no without her getting super mad at me again, and I can't just not apply in secret or purposefully half-ass my application because she reads over all my applications like 5 times before they're sent and she works closely with my counselor to make sure that everything is going the way she wants it.

I know that it's my fault since most of my issue comes from my complacency in this process and how truly unqualified I am despite my mom's high hopes, but I still feel annoyed."

I know this might seem like FAQ. But I am can't really get over the fact that it seems like only young people get good internships during or after college.  
I'll be 27 when I graduate engineering here in Europe and am feeling a bit terrified that the market will put me at a disadvantage when trying to find good internships. I've finished my first year as probably one of the best in class. The only people who were better than were people whose way of spending their free time is reviewing their math homework for the 5th time.

After a few days, he started calling me randomly on my phone, video calling me and becoming more friendly than before. I started feeling uncomfortable but didn’t say anything ( biggest mistake). A few days later, he started saying love you to me and insisted that I say it back to him. I told him very clearly that I am not comfortable with all this and please don’t say love you to me. He said “ if you don’t want to say that’s fine, but I will”. He started calling me names like hon, babu, babe and what not.

I am a college sophomore pursuing a degree in digital marketing strategies. This past summer, I had the opportunity to intern with a small start-up company. I created their brand, ran their social media accounts, and created social media campaigns for them. 

I’ve been able to use this experience to acquire two internship offers. 

Company A is one of the largest US private companies. The offer that they are giving me is completely in line with the career path that I would like to pursue. Yet, having done more research on the company, I have discovered that they have a reputation as being one of the least environmentally companies in the world. They have also been involved in a number of human rights abuse scandals. This internship is located 18 hours away from where I live. 

Company B is relatively small, relatively unknown, and though it is a marketing internship, it is not completely in line with my career aspirations. The company has a fine reputation and provides services in a field that I am very passionate about. The internship would be virtual. 

I know that Company A would provide me a richer experience and greater connections, but would you still suggest that I pursue it given the company’s reputation? I suppose that the large distance from home has me concerned as well.

I’m currently a Junior in school and recently accepted an internship for next summer at Deloitte for risk and financial advisory (IT audit, yes I know). I didn’t have a ton of options so this plus a fall internship at a well known insurance company is the only intern experience I have on my resume. (previous job for ~3 years in client success) 

On track to graduate December 2022 so my question is if any Big4 consulting groups allow recent grads to apply for internships? I would really like to go into strategy consulting but know it’s tough to get out of IT audit. Can I get a consulting internship in winter 2023 after I graduate, should I spread out my graduation an extra semester, or would I have okay enough success applying for full time consulting jobs when I graduate. 


Any advice is welcome, can provide my resume or more info!"

As the title says, I'm supposed to graduate with a bachelor's in computer science next month. ideally, I would like to work in web development. Unfortunately, despite sending out probably hundreds of applications, I have been unable to land so much as an internship at any point. My only professional experience is in retail, where I worked as an associate/supervisor for a college bookstore from 2014 up until I lost my job last year due to COVID.

I’m nervous enough as is about how being unemployed for over a year at this point will look to potential employers (I decided at some point to just focus on finishing out my degree, since I’m 25 and just tired of being here), but there's also the added issue of not knowing how to even present this experience in a way that matters at all on my resume, without it taking up a lot of space.

I guess my main questions are:

1. **How much info about my retail experience should I include?**  
Right now it takes up more space than I think is necessary, because I have to list what is essentially the same job twice. The company the bookstore operated under changed in 2018, when the original company lost the bid to contract with the school, so I was re-hired under the new company, and then I got promoted to supervisor and transferred to a new location after working with them for a year, so... I have the first company listed with my title as ""sales associate,"" with four bullet points summarizing my associate duties, and then the second company listed with my title as ""supervisor,"" with four bullet points summarizing my supervisor duties. Do I *need* to list those duties? Neither company provided any sort of achievement system like employee of the month, and beyond automating a few spreadsheet things I can't think of any impact I may have had on store operations.
2. **Should I include that I have both an Associate of Applied Science in Computer Programming as well as an Associate’s Degree from the community college I went to?**  
I got the AAS in programming in 2017 and the AS (which was just my GE credits so I could transfer to a university) in 2019. I don't know if these are necessary to list if I will be graduating with a bachelor's soon, though?
3. **Should I mention projects I’ve worked on that are not publicly available on GitHub?**  
I have a few personal projects that are either not stored on GitHub or are currently set to private. My biggest project is accessible via URL, but not currently launched to the public (it is essentially complete though). Is it a good idea to talk about my work on these projects if the code is not publicly available?
4. In the same vein as question #3, **should I include my GitHub username?**

Thanks for any advice, and sorry for how wordy some of this is. Let me know if this would be better off posted in a different sub."

His main concern now is it showing up on his record for future internships or jobs. We've begun googling to see it it makes sense to pursue a service to have this expunged from his record but there is nothing really concrete on what to do. 

The other side of the equation is if the county will report this back to the university and if it will be counted as a strike.

Since August, I've been interning (I'm still in college) on a project engineering team at a Fortune 100 company. At first, I was very excited, as my interviewers made it seem like I'd be doing interesting, challenging work with lots of variety, but so far, it's been the exact opposite.

The term ""body shop"" refers to certain companies in the IT/software industries, but I honestly feel that it also describes my current work environment. Here are a few things that stood out to me:

• **Roughly half of the engineers here are on H-1B visas.** I need to stress that I'm not racist, and I have no issues with working with people of different backgrounds. However, it’s well-documented that companies that hire disproportionate numbers of H-1B employees also tend to overwork, underpay, and mismanage their employees.

• **Most of the work here is repetitive, low-context, low-skill task work for clients.** The engineers here spend most of their time creating drawings for three-dimensional models that are fully fleshed out. The dimensions and features of these models have already been determined; the engineers are just here to transfer them to a two-dimensional form. There's a pretty extensive training curriculum for new hires, but this ""training"" basically amounts to being told how to click certain sequences of buttons. The most ""critical thinking"" that I've done here is deciding how to arrange dimension text to avoid overlapping with lines on the drawing. I understand that every engineering job has its boring parts, but every. single. day. is like this, and even the full-time engineers spend most of their time on this type of work.

• **There's no mentoring or career growth here.** I tried to discuss my long-term career goals with my supervisor when I started, but he sort of brushed me off and made me feel weird for even bringing them up. Over time, he's (implicitly) made it clear that he's really only interested in making sure that I show up to the office and get my tasks done. The first thing he asks me in our weekly 1:1s (which I set up myself, and he frequently skips) is ""so...what are you working on?"", and he's made little effort to get to know me as a person since my interview. I understand that companies need to make money and engineers are hired to do engineering, but my previous companies at least had a semblance of a mentoring/coaching culture. At this company, it seems like managers (yes, including people managers) care solely about things like deadlines and output...at the expense of everything else.

• **The management style is archaic.** Technical/project leaders are (seemingly excessively) nitpicky of team members' work. People leaders micromanage their direct reports instead of mentoring and empowering them. Engineers generally receive negative feedback or no feedback at all on their work. Also, upper management recently required everybody to return to the office three days per week and created a new seating chart for ""culture"" and ""fun"" reasons. There's a huge ""butts in seats"" mentality here, which is very strange considering that it's 2021 and most of the work can be done 100% remotely. I also frequently hear people complain-bragging about logging 60+ hour weeks.

There are many other issues, but I figured that this post is long enough already. **Has anyone been in a similar work environment? If so, how did you keep yourself from going insane?**

I have only six weeks left at the company, but **I'm honestly tempted to quit early.** I understand that at my age, any experience is valuable. However, this is my fourth internship, and I already have impressive experience on my resume from my first three internships. I'm also only a third-year student (taking five years to graduate), and I'll be starting a co-op at a much better company in January, so it's not like this is my ""last chance"" to get experience before I graduate.

**This job has also taken an enormous toll on my mental health.** I have ADHD and anxiety, so being micromanaged and evaluated solely based on how fast I get work done is even more draining for me than it is for the ""average"" person. I have many hobbies outside of work, but when I get home from work I'm too exhausted to engage in any of them; weekends are the only time I feel calm and happy. Some of you guys might think I'm a ""snowflake"" or some shit, but I've had so many suicidal thoughts throughout this internship, especially after we were forced back into the office."

I’m in a bit of a tough spot right now trying to make a really hard decision. A few weeks ago, I got a really great internship offer from a defense contractor—they work on the stuff I’m interested in, they’re close to home, and they pay really well. I’d say it was definitely one of my top picks out of all the companies I applied to. I was actually about to sign the paperwork as soon as I got it, but I decided that I would keep my options open in case anything good came up within the next 2 weeks. 

Well, low and behold, something did. I got an interview offer with SpaceX, my dream company. I’ve always wanted to work for SpaceX, and the position I’m interviewing for is 100% aligned with what I want to do. I actually just went through the interview today and it went great—they seemed super interested in me, and I’m pretty convinced that I’m moving onto the next stage. Problem is, there’s at least one more interview after this one (probably with the hiring manager) before I can get an offer, and it’s certainly not guaranteed that the next one will go so well. 

My offer from the defense contractor expires in a couple of days and I’m 99% sure SpaceX will not get back to me before then. In case you guys are wondering, I do have offers from some other places, but they’re not as great as the one I’m considering, and they also expire soon, so they wouldn’t work well as backups. 

My question is, would it be stupid of me to forgo my offer at the defense contractor for a chance of working at SpaceX? If I do, I risk not having anything to do for the summer, or working for a company that doesn’t really interest me. But also, the opportunity to work at SpaceX is not something I want to lose. Perhaps I’m being naïve and overidealistic here, I don’t know. What do you guys think I should do?"

Note: I’ll 99% return full time wherever I intern next summer (ofc conditioned on the fact that I do well) because I won’t want to re-interview immediately

Quick few details about both internships:

Google:
1. Hybrid mode
2. Returning intern (was STEP previously) so i can probably return FTE without needing to re-interview if I do SWE internship. Also guaranteed team matching for internship
3. Better engineering practices (if not the best)
4. Better WLB than FB
5. More clout than Facebook
6. Probably more stable stock

Facebook:
1. Higher comp for returning interns as FTE
2. Probably more interesting and impactful work
3. Crazy fast promotions
4. Flexible team matching

Most people say take Google if you want to chill and Facebook if you want to be promoted faster and earn more. My leaning is towards the latter especially this early on in my career. However, I just want to make sure I’m not missing out on some other points not mentioned in the above list.

But having moved to a different company (WFH aswell) and working on actual tickets, I'm finding it difficult to get help from seniors.
Usually we would have standup then after that we are on our own. Of course I can message a senior at anytime but I just feel that it would be so much easier in person and would probably learn a lot more. 
This week has been my most frustrating one and I'm feeling overwhelmed. Granted it is probably my fault as well for not reaching out for help as much as I should.

And maybe more experienced devs can give their perspectives on how interacting with juniors has changing since the lockdown"

What advice do you all have as far as creating a resume when looking for internships. Do you leave off your previous experience that is unrelated or do you show that as well? I'm a little bit ahead of myself here, but just curious on what others have done."

Apparently I did quite well, our team expanded, then I was offered a Product Owner role for the same products. I've been in this role for 4 years already but I feel like I learnt a lot but not very much room to expand.

I'm really tempted to try some other companies but I feel very anxious participating in those interviews. I'm overly thinking all the bad outcomes of switching companies in these times, but I'm sure I'm also missing opportunities because of this. Having a family is also making me calculate every risk of making this move.

&amp;#x200B;

What advice do you have for my situation?"

qnfegp,2,2021-11-05,I'm graduating with a bachelor's degree in Business Management this December and I'm extremely depressed,[deleted],college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/qnfegp/im_graduating_with_a_bachelors_degree_in_business/,"At the age of 18, I embarked on a nonlinear journey of higher education at a local community college. I majored in graphic design because I really enjoyed the subject in high school and loved creating art throughout my childhood. However, after two semesters of major requirements, I realized it wasn't for me. I changed my major to general studies to get a sense of what I wanted to do, but I failed/withdrew because I worked a lot and quite frankly, my priorities weren't straight. I also failed to take care of myself. I just drowned my depression and responsibilities in music, stupid memes, and the occasional therapy session. My dad suggested to major in business because it's 'easy' and there's 'a lot you can do with it', so I followed suit. The following semester, I went back to school and took Principles of Marketing along with two core classes before transferring to university the following school year. I found the course work/lectures easy and engaging, and I was a lot less depressed at the time. 

This university is reputable, close to home, and specializes in business. I felt thrilled to transfer to university at age 20, but not for the right reasons. I wanted to separate myself from my emotionally abusive dad (he's abusive to my mother, not me, but it's very traumatizing to overhear/witness the verbal abuse and depressing that intervention doesn't deescalate the conflict). My dad flies of the rails over the slightest inconvenience, he's probably bipolar, but refuses to seek professional help. I also looked forward to sleeping around, but I didn't socialize much and was quite terrified of sex until I lost my virginity this semester. 

I was enrolled full-time (15-18 credit hours per semester) and pretty much just went through the motions of college. My professors really like me and my work; I received fairly good grades, participated in class discussions, got internships, networked with professors and their colleagues. Overall, I have a pretty good life at the moment. I just don't think business is for me. I worked in marketing and B2B sales and found it disengaging and unfulfilling, my boss also took advantage of me with benefits and compensation. I think I might have ADD/ADHD because I cannot sit still from 9-5 and have a poor attention span in general. 

My boyfriend is studying clinical psychology, and it's something that I deeply WISH I had pursued. He's going to obtain his master's in counseling in a few years and I'm jealous. I remember telling my mother in high school that I wanted to become a therapist, but she discouraged it because it requires further study. Despite my credit standing, I begged my mom to switch majors to psychology or behavioral science with a minor in women and gender studies, but it's not fiscally feasible and would take at least two years to complete that degree. 

What's sad is that my boyfriend could tell that I wasn't passionate about my major sophomore year and suggested to change it to psychology, but I didn't listen. I thought my lack of enthusiasm and depression was just me, because I've always been depressed. I'm taking Theories of Personality as an elective, and even the professor said I should've majored in psychology. I'm more engaged in the class than the psychology majors!

I understand that it's possible to become a mental health counselor with a totally unrelated bachelor's degree, but I still feel so defeated and lost? I'm anxious and upset all of the time, I can't concentrate on studies. I don't feel like I've learned much over the past four years, and I don't have the money for an advanced degree. I feel guilty that I wasted my grandparent's inheritance on something I don't even want to pursue anymore. I reminded my mom about my dream of becoming a therapist, and she still discourages it, mostly because counselors don't earn much money. 

My dad also believes psychology is a 'useless' degree, claiming that there are 'no jobs in psychology'.

I told him that my boyfriend is aiming for a PsyD/PhD later in life, and he had the nerve to ask me what is he going to do with that...

""What can a doctor do?""

Anyways, I proposed a plan to my parents, which is returning to the community college for some perquisite courses for allied health admissions. I'm interested in becoming an occupational therapy assistant (very similar to what I actually want to do without breaking the bank for a master's degree), physical therapy assistant, or even massage therapy. Enrollment is limited and competitive, but I can probably get in with my GPA and a compelling self-essay.  

My parents aren't very happy with this swift career change, but I need to take control of my life. Maybe I'll become a LPC later in life."
qnfq6v,115,2021-11-05,Facebook/Meta interview prep strategies,corn_addict42,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/qnfq6v/facebookmeta_interview_prep_strategies/,"I recently had my phone screen for Facebook (Meta) SWE Intern Summer 2022. I am a grad student, so I had very limited time to prepare for the interview and balance my school/research activities. I have shared some of the strategies I followed and what worked for me in the below post. Sharing the strategies I followed:

1. The phone screen is 45 mins. It includes a short intro, 2 coding questions, and questions for the interviewer. So you effectively have **35 mins for two questions**. I installed a leetcode timer extension and practiced coding out each question in under 20mins. Make sure you **cover all edge cases before running your solution** for the first time. Don't worry about minor compilation errors. Disable autocomplete in the editor.
2. Get Leetcode premium and complete the **FB explore card**. It covers all the topics pretty well. Ignore the DP section. Do the arrays/strings section at the very end as those questions are very ad-hoc. According to leetcode-discuss, FB focuses a lot on tree and string manipulation questions.
3. Don't worry about practicing hard questions for now. FB/any-FAANGesque-company rarely asks them for intern roles. Focus on **easy and medium questions on leetcode**. If some question has a series on leetcode (eg LCA, valid palindrome, etc), then do the complete series as those are the sort of follow-up questions you can get in your interview.
4. **Do mock interviews**. A lot of mock interviews. As many as you can. I practiced one every day for a week and I feel that's what helped out the most. It helps you get used to the interview mindset and not panic on seeing an unknown question.
5. This last one is just a suggestion. YMMV. Be very thorough with data structures and time complexities so that you can answer follow-up questions confidently. They should be on your tips. For eg, you should know how a heap or hash-map works internally or why the time complexity of quick-select is O(n) on average and O(n^(2)) in the worst-case. Any undergrad-level DS/Algo course would be good enough to get up to speed on them.

All the best!"
qnfxzu,3,2021-11-05,Question for HR Professionals regarding applicant with a disability [MO],On_Time-On_Target,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/qnfxzu/question_for_hr_professionals_regarding_applicant/," 

I need some advice. I have an adult daughter who has Cerebral Palsy. She has a bachelors degree with a business minor and after college she moved in with us (mom and dad) to do an internship which turned into a job that she has thrived at, and loved, for 4+ years. We had moved out of state while she was in college, so she did not know anyone at our new home. Unfortunately, she was never able to develop a social life outside of work, and I think she longed for the friendships and camaraderie she had in college. She recently decided to move back to the city where she went to college and is doing very well socially, but her current job is in retail, and the wages are limited and the schedule means working nights, weekends and holidays.

She had a recent phone interview with a company that she thought went very well, but she was not offered a job. Her resume and cover letter do not give any indication of the fact that she has CP. My question for those of you in HR. Would it be to her benefit to somehow make that clear up front? She is smart and capable of doing most any job. She earned the respect of her supervisors and co-workers at her previous job because of how hard she worked. She's computer literate (teaching herself to code) She drives herself, and doesn't need any accommodations at work (she has hemiparesis, so she cannot type 60WPM, but...). She doesn't need any assistance filling out the job applications so she doesn't pop up on the HR platforms as having a disability.

Do companies get some form of credit (tax break?) from state or federal government for hiring disabled workers? FWIW, my daughter has never received SSDI or any form of government assistance (not even a Pell Grant). So IDK if companies only get a tax credit for hiring people who are receiving gov't assistance? Are there companies out there with DEI metrics that would love to be able to identify a worker with a disability? If anyone has any input one way or another, I'd love to hear it. Thanks."

I am currently a Junior nearing the end of my BS.CS focusing in cyber security.

Starting at the beginning of August I began applying for as many internships relating to Cybersecurity and Application development in my city as possible just to cast as wide of a net as I could. However many of these Organizations don't start deciding on internships until December or January, and I have run out of applicable internships in my area, I don't want to just be idle and not applying for internships and was wondering what are some of the best Cities/States to look into for CS internships, I'm not going to worry about the logistics yet, as I'm sure I can figure something out if I end up getting an out of town internship, but advice for that would be appreciated as well.

TLDR: 1. What Cities/States would you recommend to look for internships in? 2. If I get an internship several hundred miles away, do you have any advice on what to do housing-wise?"

I know this might seem like FAQ. But I am can't really get over the fact that it seems like only young people get good internships during or after college.  
I'll be 27 when I graduate engineering here in Europe and am feeling a bit terrified that the market will put me at a disadvantage when trying to find good internships. I've finished my first year as probably one of the best in class. The only people who were better than were people whose way of spending their free time is reviewing their math homework for the 5th time.  
So Engineers of the world will I have issues finding some good starting positions as a 27-year-old or the idea of a young intern is just a myth?

While this would be fine by me (as I’m having a blast learning Java), I noticed that many internships require applicants to be proficient in many languages (Python, C++, etc.) In other words, I’m worried that following the common advice of “exclusively focus on one language until you are comfortable with it”, will delay/hurt my career. Does anyone have any advice as to what to do, and can perhaps answer the following:

-How do you know when you are “proficient” in a language (do you have a specific test/list of tasks to determine this?)

-As someone who only knows a little Java, what would you suggest I learn next (this could be a language, useful software such as git/github, a broader design concept, etc.)

Thank you so much!!!"

Is buying Grokking the Coding Interview: Patterns for Coding Questions or LC premium worth it for prepping for the interview? FB is definitely one of my dream companies, so I'm trying to be well prepared for this interview.

Thanks!"

------

Vice Admiral Andrea Winslow waited outside the archivist’s office. She carried a datagem filled with the data pertaining to every major incident involving Tyraxians serving on Terran vessels. The tan of her merchant fleet uniform complimented the mahogany of her skin. Her close-cropped hair was bleached to the same silver as the three stars on her epaulets.

The door opened and the clawed lower hand of a Tyraxian motioned her in. Andrea didn’t think it was possible for a Tyraxian to look as disheveled as the poor woman in front of her. Her cream-colored ruff was matted in spots and dotted with stains. Her rumpled tunic did nothing to hide the fact that her red body fur was sticking out in every which direction and sprinkled with dust.

In an effort to put the overworked Tyraxian at ease, Andrea offered her a piece of mango candy. What exactly it was Tyraxians loved about them, Andrea didn’t know, but she’d found it was a favorite of many of her Tyraxian acquaintances.

The Tyraxian took the offered candy and closed her eyes in enjoyment. “Thank you, Admiral. I appreciate the kindness. This is my favorite.”

“Please, just call me Andrea.”

“Anya. Pleased to meet you.”

“You look…tired.”

“End of cycle report season. Cataloging every major incident report involving a Tyraxian and another species. Good *or* bad.”

Andrea whistled. “That would include every species in the Federation, and a few outside it as well. Why, your people interact as readily with other species as we humans do.” She smiled. “It’s one of those things that must have rubbed off when we freed Tyraxi.”

“That’s very kind to say, but Terrans are still the champions of inter-species cooperation. I *do* like to think we’re trying very hard to follow that example.” Anya smiled, something else the Tyraxians had picked up from humans. “Well, yes, there are quite a number of species Tyraxians work with. Most of the incidents cataloged this year have been of the good variety.” Anya tried to smooth her tunic to little effect.

“Have any species finished all their reporting yet?” Andrea asked, feeling guilty over having taken so long to compile her own report.

“All reporting from other Federation species was finished nine galactic standard days ago. Since then, it’s been non-stop with the Terrans. The trade guild, the Housing and Settlement division, the Exploratory Expeditionary….” She shuddered involuntarily at the mention of the last. The claws of her lower arms extended, showing her barely contained stress.

Andrea opened her briefcase and pulled out the datagem containing her report. “I will try to be as quick as possible and get out of your hair.”

After plugging in the datagem, Anya began scrolling on her terminal. “Let’s get the bad out of the way first. As your people say, ‘*rip the bandage off*.’”

Andrea hoped that the record cycle for safety in the merchant fleet would assuage Anya’s angst. It had been the best cycle on record in terms of serious injury and accidental death or dismemberment claims for the entire fleet. Add to that, the only injury to *any* Tyraxian in the merchant fleet was a cracked claw, fixed with some high-strength glue until it could grow back.

Anya read the first two screens of data, then fell out of her chair wailing. “I can’t do this anymore!”

Andrea helped the distraught woman to her feet. “Come with me, dear. I’ll help you finish this up later.”

The weeping woman put up a less than half-hearted resistance to being led out. Andrea managed to get the woman’s address, bundled her into a ground cab, and rode with her.

With soothing sounds and soft singing, Andrea stripped the shell-shocked Tyraxian and helped her to her shower. After washing the dust and grime out of her fur, Andrea wrapped her in a blanket and began the delicate process of working the mats out of her ruff.

“Is it all bad like that?” Anya asked.

“Like what?”

“The Terran cargo handler, paralyzed when he pushed a Tyraxian out of the way of a falling pallet. The Terran burned when the Tyraxian janitor spilled a jug of cleaner….”

“To be fair, *that* was Tyler’s fault…the human. He didn’t ask what the spill was…didn’t even suss out from the smell that it was solvent…just ran the wet-vac over it and sparked it off. That compound is flammable; requires spill-dry to clean. He knew that but wasn’t paying attention.” Andrea kept working on Anya’s ruff.

“It just seems that we’re resulting in nothing but injuries and trouble for Terrans. Maybe we don’t belong with you, if we’re causing so much harm.”

Andrea chuckled. “No, you have to understand…this was the *safest* cycle in the entire history of the merchant fleet. Many of us…humans…consider Tyraxians wards of our society, our responsibility. We brought you into the Federation, we want to protect you.

“Knowing that we saved you from slavery and thrust you into the middle of the Federation, it tends to bring out our more…*maternal* instincts. It makes us conscious of your safety, even when we regularly ignore our own.”

Anya snuggled into the blanket. “Was there *any* good news in your report?”

“Tons. A couple highlights, though; two new Tyraxian navigators have passed their course and been accepted as interns on merchant fleet vessels. One new Tyraxian ship engineer skipped right past internship into a full position on a heavy cargo long-hauler. She’s fully qualified for sub-light, FTL, and fusion reactor work.

“She’s the only Tyraxian, and the third non-human to get a perfect score on her exams and practicals. Plus, she shows real leadership potential.”

The hours passed quietly, while Andrea worked out Anya’s ruff until it could be brushed completely. “That feels nice. Thank you again, Andrea.”

“Any time. Can you talk about what sent you into a panic? Was it a specific incident?”

“A Tyraxian needed trauma counseling? Something about an experiment and death of a Terran?”

“Ah. Jackson and Slate.” A look of sour disapproval crossed Andrea’s face. “I can assure you that the Tyraxian had nothing to do with it and was merely a bystander. He was offered counseling along with everyone else who witnessed the event.”

“A bystander to what?” Anya asked.

“Do you know what happens when matter enters a wormhole? Not counting a ship in an FTL bubble?”

“I don’t know that it’s ever been done. I would guess it comes out the other end?”

Andrea nodded. “Yes, it does…at near luminal speeds. Slate and Jackson decided to open a wormhole in the ship, between the mess and recreation hall, with the idea of passing snacks through without walking the twelve meters between.”

“That seems…foolish.”

Andrea kept brushing Anya’s ruff. “Indeed. Even more so when Slate stepped directly in front of the wormhole in the recreation room, and yelled out, ‘Send me a pretzel!’ The result atomized his head.”

Anya went slack. She’d fainted, her eyes still half-open. Andrea gently closed the Tyraxian’s eyes and carried her to her bed.

Andrea looked at the figure wrapped up in a blanket with her ruff brushed out silky and puffy, and made up her mind. She’d stick around and help process the rest of the Merchant Fleet file, and any others she might be waiting on from humans. After all, she couldn’t help but feel responsible for Anya’s well-being."

Both have essentially the same internship comp btw. I'm trying to get a return wherever I go, so I'm weighing what full time looks like too

Pinterest:

Pros: Seems like total comp after graduation is amazing, in the Bay area (hybrid in person - remote), they put a lot of consideration into team matching (i think), heard good things about WLB, nice culture, lots of perks (free food n stuff)

Cons: Never really used their product, to non-tech people may not seem as cool/important (although this shouldn't rly matter)

Riot:

Pros: Full time is in LA (although internship is remote), I know what team I'd be on and like it, I've been a gamer my whole life (although never played Riot games bc no PC) so I'll likely fit in well, pple are gaming all day which is an awesome culture, manager is incredibly personable/nice

Cons: Remote internship, Total comp and salary ceiling for new grad not as good but definitely not bad, sexist/bro-y culture (although I'm a guy so idk if this will be that hard on me)

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone knows which of these may be more transferrable to other jobs / look better to a tech recruiter or how likely it is to get a return, that'd be awesome.

It's a long way out, but I was just wondering since sometimes they have pretty early application deadlines. I heard about SIP and RISE from some people (and google CSSI but i think that's only for seniors?) but idk what they are and when i google them I can't find what they are (i'm probably just being stupid but i legit can't find them lol)? Are there any other programs you guys know of for someone who wants to do cs? 

also someone today gave me advice i should start looking for internships if that's interesting. Any advice you guys have? he basically said it's really hard unless you have networks, but since neither of my parents are in cs, I can't really do that"
qnq9fv,3,2021-11-05,"Got fired a while ago, left with doubts",alf_Lafleur,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/qnq9fv/got_fired_a_while_ago_left_with_doubts/,"Hello, this is something it happened to me a couple of years ago, few days before the first lockdown.
There are still so many questions about what happened, so I am sharing my doubts.

I got a job in the UK as a programmer in a startup  (I won’t say the name) at the  beginning of 2020. I knew that startups often represent an unstable situation, but I was willing to take the risk, because I really loved that position and to improve my cv in any case. We did not have an office and we were working from home.
This startup had two owners: my former supervisor (coding and planning), and a manager (not directly working on the product).

When I joined, I was given a load of tasks, many small things were new to me, but I was confident that I was good enough to do the job, since I got a PhD in the same topic plus other internship experiences. Also, over time things got better for me and I felt less overwhelmed. After a month and a half I felt like I had finally learned enough to deserve to be there.

I must mention that my supervisor had a habit of calling me from very random places (metro, pub etc), apparently without using any noise cancelling device, so organising work was more complicated than necessary and, since I am not a native English speaker, I admit that some time has been wasted due to an unfortunate misunderstanding, but nothing that cannot e fixed.

Then covid came, I started being very distracted and even paranoid, since I was in the UK, and lockdown was delayed, unlike other countries.
I recognise that, due to all these things and situations, I wasn’t performing at the best of my abilities, and I can say this because nowadays I am way more efficient with my current job.

Long story short: I got fired after a couple of months (or slightly less), still in my three months trial period. According to my former supervisor: “I still had to learn several things, and the fast pace of this startup could not afford that”. The two owners were sorry about the very bad timing, as the lockdown was about to be announced.

The owners decided to pay me the third month, though I only worked for two (by contract, I was due only one week of salary, so that was very nice from them). Also, they were willing to offer me references to other companies, and to officially transform this job into an internship, so it did not look bad on my cv.

I remember I asked face to face the manager (not to my supervisor, if it makes any difference) to keep in touch on LinkedIn and this person was initially willing to do it. Also wanted to help me and we had a couple of video chats during covid time, which this person asked me by email. I also got the names of a few persons to contact for a possible job, but nothing happened. I am aware that this was an awful moment for the job market, so cannot complain here.

However, when I added this person on LinkedIn, my request has never been accepted and, at one point, did not figure anymore into the sent requests list.
In the meanwhile, I had used this person’s contact as a reference for some related positions, but I am afraid this was a mistake from my side, since probably the two bosses may have been in reality not so keen to help me with this.
Several months after, when I got my current full time position, I naively tried adding the same person again, with a message happily explaining that I had finally found a job, but never got back.

Now my questions:

1-Do you think I was a bit naive here, believing that they wanted to help me, while maybe my former supervisor thought I was just bad at this job?

2-Why do you think the manager has been initially interested into my situation, but then totally disappeared and even rejected my connection request? Was it not professional from my side to ask for it?

3-Does it make sense to get fired after such a short time, even if I thought I could do the job? 

4-at what level do you think that the incoming lockdown may have affected their decision to fire me?

5-And how and why did I even get hired on the first place? The interviewing process was short, unlike some other major companies. Thanks for any help."

qnqyzh,72,2021-11-05,I GOT A JOB OFFER (Silicon Valley),Yosephk_,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/qnqyzh/i_got_a_job_offer_silicon_valley/,"Hey all, just here to drop by and say the dream finally came true. I'm a super senior EE and have the rest of the academic year left, but went to a career fair and mutually clicked with a company. After 5 or so interviews, including an on-site, lunch in the town, and tour of the office/manufacturing plant they told me I MADE IT. 
Going to pay very well, go beyond ordinary health care standards, 401k, and will pay for most of grad school when I'm ready. I AM SO EXCITED the team is awesome, and I'm gonna learn from some of the best in my field :). 
Now I get to cruise through the rest of my undergrad experience without job hunting! So relieved. 


My advice to those looking for jobs:

1) Side projects. Side projects relevant to your niche can take only a few days and could be the difference between landing an interview or not.

2) Tutor relevant courses. I know this isn't for everyone, but it offers a great way to grow engineering communication skills, learn how to hold meetings, how to explain your work, and ultimately gain fantastic fundamental understandings.

3) Internships. I personally didn't have an 'internship', but worked full time as a Lab Technician/Research Assistant for school research. Lots of hands on experience! 

4) Join a club!! Very important one imo. If you don't have an engineering club at your school (formula one, CubeSat, etc.) maybe you could be the founder! Great show of teamwork capabilities and relevant engineering processes. Also shows you enjoy the engineering process! 

5) Make a website/update LinkedIn/continually improve resume. You need some of the previous list entries to highlight on your website but Google Sites makes it sooooo easy to make a portfolio website. Easy as using Google calendar. Your future employers will def check out your website and LinkedIn, assuming that your resume is competitive! Great way to put your best foot forward with a company. 

If anyone DOES want advice or details let me know! I've been tryharding the undergraduate extra curriculars and would be happy to share what I know :-) 

Cheers all, YOU CAN DO IT!!"
qns1zr,43,2021-11-05,"Graduating senior in December, just got hired FT locally. One piece of advice.",jcgoble3,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/qns1zr/graduating_senior_in_december_just_got_hired_ft/,"I'm graduating next month with my BS in CS with a 3.95 GPA. I needed to stay local because I'm older (35-ish years old) and have aging parents (67 and 70) that I, as an only child, need to be around to take care of, so FAANG and such were not on my radar. Being practically in the backyard of an Air Force base meant probably ending up at one of the many defense contractors nearby.

I had two local internships. One was a local startup whom I interviewed with literally the day before COVID blew up; that ended up being my only offer because of COVID and I worked from home for the entire summer of 2020. My second internship was at a Fortune 500 company with a local office, hired in January 2021 part-time while in school and intended to continue through graduation. Unfortunately, I was laid off in May after the Army cut funding to the project I was on, so I ended up having the summer off before going back to school for my final semester.

I spent September submitting job applications here and there, probably about 15-20 in total, mostly to the various defense contractors surrounding me. I also suited up and went to a small career fair that the engineering college hosted for CS and engineering students, where I had conversations with about a dozen employers. Remember that.

I got contacted by several companies beginning in late September, and was extremely busy throughout October juggling school, homework, and job interviews. Finally, this past Monday, November 1, I received a job offer, followed by a second offer on Tuesday. I accepted the second offer on Wednesday, and just had a phone chat with my soon-to-be new supervisor this afternoon.

I will be working literally right across the street from my university beginning in January, with a starting salary of $74k (with low cost of living and less than $7k in student loans thanks to many scholarships), opportunities to move up quickly, and will be getting a security clearance that will open many more doors for future career moves. I couldn't be happier.

**The one piece of advice I could give you?** Earlier I mentioned to remember something. Of all of the job applications I submitted on my own, three of those companies contacted me for a first interview, and all three ghosted me after one phone interview. I did have three second interviews, but none from the applications, because *every second interview I had and both job offers originated from a handshake and a conversation at that little career fair I attended.*

So the advice is **don't skip the career fairs!** If you see a career fair that you have the ability to attend, go to it! Put on that ~~torture suit~~ professional interview outfit and go talk to employers. There's a big difference between a cold electronic resume on a recruiter's computer monitor and a smiling (or masked) face with a warm and candid conversation, and that can easily be the difference between getting that job offer or not."

qnu18k,2,2021-11-06,How to start interview preparation with LeetCode if I suck at recalling concepts?,hookup1092,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/qnu18k/how_to_start_interview_preparation_with_leetcode/,"**Questions:**

* When you started preparing using Leetcode, did you use notes and resources if you forgot how to do something, whether it was basic or advanced? For example, forgetting how Insertion Sort or a Linked List work, or forgetting how to convert from an int to a string, etc.
* If you have used notes, when did you stop using them? How did you transition away from it effectively? Did you stop using them?
* Is it advisable to use notes and resources when you start?

**Context:** Currently a junior taking my DSA college class (struggling). And I am looking to apply for summer internships (and eventually jobs), to get experience as an undergrad before I have to apply for jobs. That seems to be important.

I see a lot of posts providing help with starting interview &amp; Leetcode preparation. And while the majority of these are super helpful outlines on where to start, I haven't personally haven't been able to find a post specifically talking about what to do if you suck at recall, like *really* suck at it. To the point where I will finally understand how Quick Sort w/Partitioning works, and then forget how to create a vector or how to access a specific index of a string.

For example, let me walk you through a situation I just went through:

Yesterday, I took my first ever coding technical interview for an internship/job ever. Never done any prep before (just college), and the most programming practice that I have done has been in my college DSA class assignments. Don't even know how I got past the phone screen.

They asked me four questions, three of which I later found on LeetCode after the interview:

1. [Self-Dividing](https://leetcode.com/problems/self-dividing-numbers/)
2. [Additive Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/additive-number/)
3. [Colorful Number](https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/colorful-number/)
4. Code With Strings (could not find this one)

When I read some of these, I had some abstract idea of how to approach it (no idea if it would have worked, but I am surprised I had something at all). But when I went to approach, lets say the Code With Strings, I realized I forgot how to access indexes in a string, or how to convert from int to string, or use ASCII, etc. I just haven't used them in ages. Some problems I just did not know how to solve, but that expected.

I am so used to seeing pseudocode when programming Algorithms or Data Structures for school assignments, or searching up how something works when I forget, that it threw me off when I had to remember something specific on my own without resources. Don't even feel like i've learned anything over 2 years of coursework."
qnu76u,27,2021-11-06,Feeling Super bummed out and can't sleep (Rant),ApplicationEast9069,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/qnu76u/feeling_super_bummed_out_and_cant_sleep_rant/,"Hi everyone, to begin this rant I want to start off by saying that I'm sorry if I sound super winey in this post or ungrateful, I know compared to most people in the world I'm super fortunate and my problems seem pretty miniscule. Basically I can't sleep cuz took to much caffeine and I been overthinking like crazy so I just want to post this here just incase someone is going through something similar or to just hear what you guys think. 

Before I get into the meat of everything I live in Canada and attend a top 3-4 University. I have one brother who is a tech lead at FAANG at a really young age, my dad is pretty successful in his line of work aswell so I've always felt some pressure on me to be ""great"". It's pretty unwarranted because my family is nothing but supportive of me and is always there for me but after these events below I felt like a disappointment and through it all they supported me.   


My ""problem"" is that I feel like I've just been super unlucky when it comes to everything surrounding me finding internships and jobs so far. To begin, I'll go back 1 year ago when I was looking for positions for summer 2021 internships, I discovered this subreddit and started reading every post on here and felt super left behind in terms of my career, I realized that I'd been ""slacking off"" and if I took everything more seriously I could easily get some big internships and finally ""satisfy myself"". So I started practicing Leetcode, creating some projects and applying to a ton of job postings (200ish). I found myself not really getting a lot of responses until Feb where I got to finally do some interviews.

I had an interview scheduled with a Big N company , and a med sized company and was super excited. One day before my interview with the big N, I noticed an email come through and it said my interview was canceled and felt super bummed out and was confused since I didn't get a reason why, it just said canceled. I reached out to the recruiter and three days later got a response that they had filled out all their positions. This was a blow to my confidence, it shouldn't have been but just knowing it got canceled was kinda upsetting since I prepared for it and the day before it gets canceled. 

Next, I interviewed with the mid sized company and honestly it was the best interview I'd ever done, in terms of the behavioral I answered every question super well and the person interviewing told me that I had done terrific, after this I got to speak to one of the new grad's they had hired and he told me that I asked awesome questions and in general I clicked super well with both of the interviewers. After this, I did the technical interview portion and again, it was literally the best interview I'd ever given before, solved both questions without any help and explained them super well and got positive feedback from both the interviewers (solved 1 easy 1 med optimal time and within 30 mins of a 45 min interview). A few days later the recruiter reached out to me and told me she had the results of my interview and finished it with an explanation mark, I know its a small detail but in my mind I was like OMG my hard work paid off I finally got a great internship only to be told that I didn't get it on the phone call, I asked if she had any feedback from the interviewers and she said they all liked me quite a lot and there was nothing negative and they would love to reconnect with me for full time next year. Overall this literally felt like a punch to the face, not only did I feel like I got baited by the interviewers, the recruiter wanting to call to tell me I got rejected just felt 30 times worse. Small detail but just sucked in general. 

Now moving towards where I feel like where everything just went super wrong, I got an interview with a company in SF, a recently IPOed company and was super surprised that they would even consider me since the position was for something I had never worked on (ML). I did okay in the interviews, didn't really clique with any interviewer for behavioral and did pretty suboptimal in terms of the coding aspect (was med-hard lvl questions) but to my surprise I got the job. I honestly was ecstatic felt like wow this past year finally paid off. Now you honestly might think that this is a troll post but somehow I got screwed over again, when they tried to get me a visa to come to the US they weren't able to and they said they wouldn't be doing remote for this position. I won't lie, at this point I honestly just felt terrible and given on everything, my grades dropped from A's and B's to barely passing and I just didn't feel like doing anything anymore. 

It was may and I honestly kinda gave up on applying for jobs and told myself to just prepare for new grad positions so more leetcode and give my self time to relax for the summer, I applied to a few jobs on linkedin that I saw come up one day and it was through a ""Recruiting agency"" looking for interns just to be ghosted when it came time to the phone calls, I did however get another interview with a smaller start up type of company, honestly its really my fault and I feel so terrible for the person who had to interview me because I was just not in the mindset of anything anymore because when I went into the interview I got asked to implement basic rest api calls, something I did a 100 times before and just blanked out completely. I've never experienced something like that before in my life... like I literally stopped thinking and the guy was asking me if I understood the question like 2-3 times. He was super nice though and walked me through the solution, I knew I just wasted this guys time and felt so awful and honestly wanted to apologize to him during the interview and literally wrote up an email that I didn't end up sending just saying sorry for wasting his time. 

Just overall as you can imagine my confidence was 0, the entire summer I spent telling myself that I was good enough and just a victim of a couple bad circumstances, I spent the first 2 months just getting mentally ""better"" and slowly getting back into leetcode and programming. I ended up creating more projects and grinding leetcode (did around 300 meds). I felt confident in my abilities again.

So now the new grad position finding began and I got responses from FAANG and honestly felt ecstatic, I felt prepared and confident and completed my first interview last week, when I went into the interview I had a clear mind and started the interview a break down of how it went is below.

First Interview: The guy didn't say a single word to me the entire portion of the coding, literally not one just watched I guess. My approach to the problem was right but didn't get feedback and ran out time when I had like 1 line of code to write (LC hard so and like 50-70 lines of code). I didn't get any feedback and after the interview I realized I made an error in the code which was super dumb of me but it was one of the first lines I wrote so I was surprised the interviewer didn't point it out.   


Second Interview:  The guy basically copied a word problem and didn't explain anything and wrote one super basic test case which felt more like an edge case and a word problem like ""Here is an apple, apples would go under the fruit category"" . I had to ask a lot of clarifying questions because honestly the way the problem was worded it felt like a system design question rather then a leetcode question. I asked questions and solved through it and turns out it was a OOP + Leetcode question in one kinda like LRU cache but worded like a system design problem. I came up with the solution optimal and everything but I felt like I asked too many clarifying questions.

Third Interview: did well solved the problem optimally but the guy was literally watching me type every character, at one point i fat fingered and wrote ""int i = 09"" because I fat fingered it and literally 1 millisecond before I could delete it he started pointing it out. not sure if he held that against me.

Got my results back and failed. I wasn't too upset over it honestly when I got the results, felt like no matter what I did was out of my control and just learned to try my best and whatever happens, happens. Overall was fine until tonight, usually I don't like drinking coffee but I drank some for some reason and my mind went into over drive thinking mode, and just started remembering the past and feel like shit. I have another interview with another FAANG company this coming week and I'm honestly thinking of just canceling it, feel like I will fail anyways. Super shit mentality to have but it would save me and the interviewer the time."

That’s all. It’s in cyber security…I came from a science background…like sonography, anatomy, physics. I changed my major when covid started and it feels great to be sort of successful in my transition to cyber. Salary is good for entry level. It’s a consulting company that I did interview rounds with and they hired me based on performance. I feel relieved tbh.

Edit: I do not have a degree, in the process but not yet done. I also said no IT experience, but that can still mean I’m a photographer, and those client engagement skills impressed my recruiter. 

Edit; wow some people are mean. Lol also why is everyone saying He? Women can’t have nice jobs? funny that no one considered me being a female lol But now that I did mention I’m a female I’m getting all these “Diversity hire” comments. Y’all are bitter. Lol, and I’m in Chicago, we’re diverse. How I got it? I kept applying and adding technical skills to my skill set. Try Internships, if u don’t have much luck, those don’t require a lot skill it’s for beginners tbh…People who said things don’t add up? Well I don’t know what to say to u. :/ 

Edit: people who DM’d me hate messages LOL y’all don’t know how cyber works? Learn some skills of YouTube and Udemy, add it to ur resume and show ur employer you’re willing to learn. Watch “ex-nsa hacker” on David Bombals video, do everything Neal Bridges recommends to do to get your foot in the door without a degree! 

Edit: someone asked about bonus, yeah 2k was bonus and 73k base, this is a pretty average salary for chicago.

I couldn’t get certs because my ADHD makes it hard for me to study. Not an excuse but just my experience. Do more practical practice. I plan on looking into CTFs. I haven’t left out anything relevant except my location. Lol if u DM me we can connect on linked in if you’re that doubtful. Cheers and best of luck to everyone."

I'm thinking about taking a two year online masters degree in CS and AI with either York or Keele University (UK). These are part time cs conversion 
Masters degrees. However the reviews on them have been either suspect or non existant. As well as this a lot of the coursework for it is written assessments explaining my reasonings and outline for code so I'm worried I won't have enough practical coding experience.

On the other hand, I feel as though its a good thing to have for my CV to get into tech with companies (especially internships). I also feel as though even if the CS degree content isn't the best, the resources from their career zone and York being a russel group university (good name to have on CV) may bring more value and it will kind of force me not to be lazy when it comes to self-teaching as I will have to complete assignments. 

There are some bootcamps and other options (I got accepted to digital futures and 01 founders) but I'm tentative about going to a bootcamp that will charge me if I dont like where they place me (not allowed to quit for two years or they charge 10k) or doing two years with 01 founders to come out with a lot of practical and group work experience but no degree. 

(I work in the education technology space now doing very basic HTML CSS stuff). I want to be a software engineer (C#, Java and Python interest me the most) and have the knowledge to code for fun in my spare time. 

I'm not really sure where to go from here. Any advice would be appreciated!"

I was intended to continue with a master's, but I can't afford the tuition for an MSc in the Netherlands for non-EU (eg. \~18k euro per year at TU Delft) so I opt for Germany, where no tuition is charged, the CoL is low, and, from what I heard, the quality of education is equal across the country regardless of ranking.

I didn't have practical experience yet, since, during my Bachelor phase, study workload is sometimes insanely intense, as a student who doesn't want study delay (a delay for half a year will cost additional \~5k euro) I have to finish my study on time, in addition, working in NL requires a work permit for non-EU. For these reasons, even though I graduated with cum laude, with no internship I felt totally unprepared for job searching, so I thought I would use my time in Germany to *gain practical experiences*, *learn the language* (first German, then Dutch), and by the way *earn an MSc degree*, then both Dutch and German job market is open for me.

However, things didn't go smoothly, my current German uni is in many ways not as satisfactory (I will not go into details here). So I am inclined to focus only on practical experience and language in Germany, and hunt for jobs in NL using the search year visa when I feel I am prepared. The MSc degree at this German uni goes on the least priority.

I have no doubt that I can get internships in Germany, I just need to learn a tech stack and practice the German language. But I am a bit unsure about the job prospect in NL with only a Bachelor's degree from a research uni. Because I get this impression that a Bachelor's degree from research uni is useless unless you combine it with an MSc from research uni, maybe because of their diplom legacy, that BSc from research uni is deemed as an **""incomplete degree""** (quote from study in NL subreddit). Indeed, an insanely high percentage of people continue with masters after their bachelor's at my previous Dutch uni (&gt;90%).

How will the Dutch job market evaluate me (say, one year later), as someone with BSc at a research uni, and a few practical experiences?

Besides, I am actually older than typical undergraduates in NL. I started my study in NL when I was 26, and this year I am 29, suppose one year later when I have 2 internships under my belt, I am already 30. Would age be a problem?"

I am a recent computer science graduate in Asia graduated in the UK, currently doing an internship in Asia (but mostly building apps using Microsoft PowerApps). I try to give my free time on the weekdays and weekends to learn more.

My problem is that I don't have a roadmap and I am steering everywhere and trying to learn everything. I've taken so many courses but because I don't have a clear roadmap I end up stopping mid-way and learning a something new. 

Currently I am trying to learn docker, Kubernetes, react and GoLang and trying to develop my own projects based on microservices, but I feel so lost without any structure of my roadmap of learning. I feel like in university it was so easy because I had all these structures that intertwine with each other and projects that were demanded instead of creating ideas. 

So currently I feel lost, has anyone felt this way and can you guide me through this whole mess, I just need structure in my journey that will help me lead to my end goal."

My only concern is that it's not an offer for a software engineering position, but for a position similar to SRE. During my internship I've enjoyed my time there and was working on a coding project the entire time, but my concern is that this might not be the case once I start working full-time at the company and I would rather work as a SWE. My recruiter has told me I can change my role to SWE after staying with them for a year given I pass the interviews.

Currently I am applying to other companies for SWE positions, but haven't received an offer yet (I need to pass the interviews first to even have a choice). Those companies include Twitter, Bytedance and Amazon. Now I'm concerned that if I stay with my current offer I'm locked into the career path and can't change as easily after a couple years of working into software engineering. On the other hand I'm not sure if it's a good idea to reject a faang offer to work for a smaller/less interesting company as a SWE.

qo3jr1,23,2021-11-06,Calling all Geriatric (35+) MBA's,MBAgeezer,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/qo3jr1/calling_all_geriatric_35_mbas/,"**Opening:** This post is for all those about to keel over and die AND contemplating getting their MBA. That is obviously in jest but when you read most of this sub that is what it feels like. I am looking for advice from people in my age group on why they got their MBA or are contemplating getting their MBA. I would also greatly appreciate any advice on my current circumstances which are laid out below.

**Here is my background:** Male, South Asian (educated in the US), 35, wife and 2 kids, B.S. Mechanical Engineering from an unimpressive state school (3.3 GPA). Currently I make \~135k in a large metro in the Midwest, I guess that's MCOL?

**Work History:** Graduated and went to work for the DoD/Navy (Civilian not commissioned) at a naval shipyard. Entered into the nuclear division with a class of 30+ new grads from schools all over the country. I was from one of the more non-impressive schools, most came from some type of major state school (Penn State, Michigan, Virginia, Virginia Tech, etc.). Long story short, we went through an initial set of testing and interviews to be placed within the different divisions at the shipyard. I placed 2nd overall and was placed in my 1st choice which was Nuclear Operations and Testing which subsequently required 2 more years of a training program, testing, oral boards, and overall abuse. I got through this and qualified and ended up leaving for commercial nuclear 3 yrs later. Spent the last 7 years working on the engineering side (component and program management) of nuclear and recently got out of the nuclear side of the business (large utility company) and am working as a project engineer/manager on large capital projects. All in all I have 12 yrs experience (not counting internships which are useless in my opinion).

**Rant:** The only reason I went through the effort of describing class size and rigor of training at work is to discuss the fact that where you go to school is absolutely not a gauge of your intellect and most importantly your ability to produce at work. I have worked with people from low-level state schools (like myself) to MIT and I have yet to find a common theme to say ""hey this guy/gal must of went to XYZ school"". This was actually extremely eye opening and demoralizing for me because I realized I set the bar WAY to low for myself. Most (definitely not all) people graduating out of prestigious schools are great at ""schooling"". This means they were able to put in the time and effort to complete the needed tasks to achieve the result of getting in and graduating from a great school. This is actually a completely different (and unfortunately sad) skill set than being exceptionally bright. NOW I will say that the kids I knew who were exceptionally bright DID end up going (for the most part) to a great university. I definitely am not exceptionally bright BUT I am brighter than the good at schooling crowd. I know this comes off extremely snobby but after years in the work force and generally in life it's the sad truth. I would like to add that there is merit to working extremely hard and putting in the hours for something you really want. The sad part is that in the workforce this translates to working really hard and putting in hours for low level tasks which provide minimal benefit all for the sake of working really hard and putting in a lot of hours. The even more sad reality of life is that these people tend to get promoted because they figure out the ""good at corporate ladder climbing"" formula.

I was never a huge fan of the structured nature of school. You could say this is because I am lazy but I honestly believe it's because my skill set is not best suited for schooling. I am completely capable of schooling, it just is not something I love to do. After finishing my bachelor's I was so burned out that the thought of going back to school was just out of the picture. To pile onto this was the fact that you don't actually use anything you learn in school on the job (for the most part) and I was able to excel at my job without additional schooling. After completing my 2 year training program I was making &gt;100k, but this included a lot of overtime and shitty work conditions. Either way, I felt as though I found a loop-hole into high earning potential. After I transferred to the commercial side I took an overall pay cut (higher base but not as much overtime) but much better working conditions. After an additional 2 years of commercial nuclear I was again over 100k and under 30. I thought this was a win and every time I contemplated going back to school I decided against it because I was not ready for the commitment. I should also add that getting an MBA in the nuclear field means nothing. You can easily rise up the ranks without it, operational and engineering background mean much more (which I had). 

**Why now:** So after reading this wall of text you may be wondering why the hell I am posting on an MBA subreddit. Well I have come to realize (way too late in my career) that it doesn't matter what makes sense, it's what the system wants. I recently transitioned out of the nuclear field because I decided it was no longer the career path for me. The overall working culture in the nuclear field is pretty toxic, the work-life balance can be terrible, AND most importantly the compensation does not match the level of commitment.  At least some of these other fields which require high levels of commitment and toxic work environment include high compensation (&gt;200k with potential of &gt;1M). You are not getting that type of compensation potential in nuclear. You have a great ramp in earning then steadily plateau.

I DO agree that an MBA can create access to a network which I do not currently have. Now that I am out of nuclear energy I feel as though I am behind the curve. The working environment is great and I would not mind climbing the ladder on this side of the business. My nuclear experience and my overall skill set sets me up great for outpacing the competition. The only thing holding me back is silly merit badges like an MBA. I know I can go catch 'em all like the good boy I'm supposed to be but it still kills me inside that I have to. An MBA is such a large time and financial commitment that I still don't know if it's the right thing to do. My main advantages are that I am a great leader, communicator, and I can get shit done. I'm not blowing smoke up my ass (maybe a little). I like strategic planning and want to get into roles where I start driving high level business decisions (i.e: director and above). At the end of the day though I want to make significantly more money, enjoy my work, AND have time for my family. This is possible, trust me, it is just hard to find.

**Options:** 

1. Go get my MBA. I will only get my MBA from a T15 because even though this sub is filled with prestigious pricks (kidding guys) I agree that the MOST valuable part of getting an MBA is the network and the stupid name on the diploma. I also would like to prove to myself that I am capable of excelling at a high level program with all of you prestigious pricks. Because of this I am most likely looking at an online MBA because I unable to take a break from work (main earner for the family). I do have one T15 in driving distance which I could consider in person (probably just doxxed my location). My company will pay up to \~8k per year for me to go back to school. So obviously not enough to cover all expenses but it is something.
2. Forgo the MBA and attempt to climb the ladder until they make me get my MBA. The negative to this is that they may ask me to get my MBA years down the line when I'm not mentally prepared to do so. At least right now I'm motivated.
3. Pivot careers for earning potential. I don't even know if this is possible. I have friends in consulting that claim my skill set would be greatly valuable in consulting. None of them have MBAs, just got into the field out of college and have risen up the ranks (Accenture and Deloitte). Also with my program/project management experience I might have the opportunity to pivot to a higher earning potential industry like FAANG (I guess is MAANG now?). The major obstacle IMO to pivoting is my non-impressive undergraduate school and obviously 0 experience in that particular industry. My key assets are best understood if you worked in the nuclear industry and most importantly have worked with me.

However the team that I was placed under does not really align with my interest. I also heard they don't have the best wlb. This will be my last internship since I graduate in spring 2023. I will still take the internship since I really want to work in Microsoft but I wanted to know how hard it is to change teams/orgs when you go from internship to full time. If anyone went through this process please let me know! I want to know how I should approach this and what time is the best to bring this up.

I'm humbled to receive offers from Explore and Salesforce SWE internships as a sophomore. Now I don't know which one to choose. Here are pros and cons that I listed out for both, hopefully you can give me some helpful insights.

Both have high conversion rates and I would rather not reinterview/ go over the whole process again for both.

## SALESFORCE (SWE):

**Pros:**

* Get to work with senior engineers, and it's a SWE internship so I can learn more (?).
* Full stack development project (Revenue Cloud) - which relates to what I'm doing now.
* Downtown SF, near Sillicon Valley -&gt; can network with tech professionals
* Higher compensation, greater perks' value (but might be eaten up a good chunk by Cali's tax)
* Great culture

**Cons:**

* I don't feel that connected to the team or the recruiter. Both take quite a while to respond my emails.
* I might have to Leetcode again to apply for bigger companies because I don't see myself staying in Salesforce for the long run.

## MICROSOFT (EXPLORE):

**Pros**

* Bigger brand name - but don't know if Explore internship would cut it as SWE 
* Greater tech overall
* Everything is taken care of (housing, gym, transportation, etc.) - as an intl student I really value this as I don't want to go through all the renting, hunting deals process in a very complicated city of a foreign country while I'm studying.
* Can switch roles in the future
* Easily network with other interns
* More relaxing work apparently
* Recruiters and interviewers are extremely friendly. I enjoyed talking to them so much!

**Cons:**

* I didn't get ask any technical question so I don't know if it's worth it (I know it's weird to say but I did Leetcode pretty hard for the whole internship process)
* Might be too content with the status quo to switch companies
* Despite Microsoft's reputation, Idk if it's not an actual SWE role, am I still competitive for SWE internship at other companies next year.

I asked my professor and she said I couldn't go wrong with either of them :) what's important to me is which one can get me through the resume screening round in the next cycle, because I have commitment issue.. jk, I might want to try something different. Also, feel free to reach out if you have any question about the process. I must admit that this whole job application thing got the worst of me.

Thank you!!"

Comp is pretty similar, Intuit position is located in Mountain View and Qualcomm is in San Diego. Crossing my fingers that they'll actually be in person, so if anyone knows if either company is leaning towards in person then lmk.

Intuit Pros:

\-slightly higher comp

\-tech tools more in line with webdev tech I've been picking up

\-better name on resume (?)

Qualcomm Pros:

\-Likely will be working with C++ / embedded type software, possibly giving me a better shot at HFTs?

\-Heard San Diego is more fun

Looking for opinions, especially from people who have worked at either company. Thanks!"

qocuml,2,2021-11-06,Should I quit my first internship?,Gibbeous,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/qocuml/should_i_quit_my_first_internship/,"So I am about to graduate in December with a degree in computer science and have no experience in the field. However I did just get this internship and it has been 3 weeks so far (about 60 hours in total and it’s $16/hr). 

The reason I want to quit is because they have given me absolutely no work so far except for this one thing that took about 3 hours. Literally most of my day I sit at my desk doing nothing, and if I ask someone for work they’re either in a conference or just shrug me off. It feels like they don’t value me as an intern at all. My second day on the job I walk in and there is some random guy sitting at desk. 

The thing is this company isn’t even the one paying me to work, it is some weird federal program that pays me to work there. I’m not even sure who my boss is. I seriously dread going into work especially because my first love ever dumped me right before I started and I started shitting blood ( I have IBD).  The reason I feel bad about quitting is because there was so much paperwork and everyone at the job has been nice. I’m just going through a lot of stress and doing absolutely nothing for 8 hours at the office isn’t exactly helping."
qocx7x,35,2021-11-06,EECS and L&amp;S most viable option is to get funding.,InfinitelyOutrageous,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/qocx7x/eecs_and_ls_most_viable_option_is_to_get_funding/,"Firstly, it is sad to see that funding problems are steering professors to limit  enrollment in classes. This situation is disheartening to see in any  university because it is a place of learning and exploring. It is  especially disheartening to see at Cal -- partly due to Cal pride as an  alumni (almost all alumni want students of their school to succeed), but  mostly due to the Cal being a powerhouse for academics. Limiting  students from taking classes at school like Cal sucks for both the  professor and the student...it blocks students from taking part in  certain research labs, prevents students from progressing in their  desired field of study, at times hinders students in getting certain  specialized internships, it prevents professors from creating  relationships with student who are passionate as they are about the  subject, etc. The list goes on.

What can the University and the department do about it?  
The two options that are floating around is *get more funding* or *limit the enrollment to classes need for a L&amp;S CS major to declare*.

***The only viable option, and the ONLY option is to get more funding or reallocate funding.***

* Limiting  the enrollment to classes not only screws over a L&amp;S CS student but  also an EECS student that need those introductory classes. What are you  going to do? Limit just the L&amp;S student from taking those classes? I  don't know the bureaucratic process on how that happens but it sounds  stupid. Good luck getting that plan through with the University. The  biggest question is how are you going differentiate between students  that applied as CS and didn't apply as CS? The students that did apply  as CS have every right to get into those classes just like an EECS  student.
* This raises the question: should the University dissolve the L&amp;S CS major? The answer is no.  
\---  If you look at it Computer Science is more related to Math than it is  to engineering, so it is odd Computer Science is even in the College of  Engineering through EECS. (This isn't a big point but is peculiar one)  
\--- You'll close the pipeline of double majoring. It's actually fairly common to double major.  
Double  majoring as a student of CoE is annoying, tedious, and hard as a  freshmen, and impossible as a transfer. Remember most majors at Cal are  in the College of Letters &amp; Science.People that want to go into  quantum computing will sometimes do Physics + CS. NLP? Linguistics + CS.  ML? Stats + CS or Math + CS. There are so many options that work well  with CS.  
Yeah, double majoring isn't a crazy deciding factor on a job  or grad school application but it's a pipeline you can never close off.  
\---  Employers don't care about LSCS vs EECS, but they will care when you  remove a well-known major from the University's catalog. How would it  sound to an employer if you tell them ""yeah...Berkeley removed L&amp;S  CS because of funding issues.""? You are basically writing on your  forehead Berkeley's EECS department doesn't have money. This  proclamation sends different signals especially to people industry. ***Budget cuts don't happen to strong and well-known programs.***  Employers know that EECS and L&amp;S CS are basically the same major,  so this will indirectly have an effect on EECS student as well.

People  cite the ballooning of the L&amp;S major as a problem of the funding  crisis because of the undeclared aspect of the College of Letters and  Science; thus, the school should do something to curb L&amp;S CS  enrollment. It's a valid point but you are literally fighting against  the future when you do that.

* What do you think is the most popular path in between the EECS majors? When I was in school, it wasn't EE.
* CS  as a major will only continue to grow. As a PUBLIC institution, the  department will eventually be required to meet some of the demand. What  then? You will obviously need funding.
* L&amp;S  CS has a GPA declaration of 3.3 overall GPA in some relatively  difficult classes. \*Artificially difficult because they need to weed out  students. You're telling me as an academic institution you are going  curb enrollment of students that are able to declare with 3.3 in  artificially difficult classes. That goes against everything a  university is. The admission officers already selected the people they  feel should be at Berkeley as a whole. So, why would you as a professor  want to turn down potential academically strong students in CS?
* ***To  see how much the extra L&amp;S students are affecting the budget, the  department would need to release accurate information on how much  students that put non-CS on their application but declare as CS. To  paint a clearer picture, they would also have to say how much of those  are double majors whose primary major is different, because the supposed  problem stems from people switching as a single major.*** I said double major is fairly common but not common enough to cause a financial problem.
* ***If  the administration wants to curb enrollment, instead of direct-admit,  the department should take the Haas approach for students that don't  double major L&amp;S CS and want to single major L&amp;S CS, if their  selected major was something else.*** It benefits everyone.  
\--- If you select CS on your app then no need for the application process, obviously.  
\---  For double major, the criteria should be you can't drop your primary  major and just do CS, if they want to do that then they need to submit a  Haas-type application. Double majors would just need to meet a GPA cap  and not submit essays and a resume. A question that can pop up is what  if people game the double major system by doing an ""easy""? Well, it is  okay. Double majoring makes it hard because of all the extra classes you  have to take - no need for an essay and resume application. The  administration would want a student that can time manage two majors.  Double majoring helps the other department have leverage for funding as  well.  
\--- Now what about transfer students? Just have a GPA limit,  because it doesn't matter if they switch. Most transfer students already  know what they want to do because they have went through the first 2  years of schooling so it is unlikely transfers want to switch majors.  Plus, if they do switch let them. No need to hinder their exploration  because they haven't had the same resources to explore the field like a  freshmen. The main point of university is to explore and learn. Also,  there's already a limit on how long any student, freshmen or transfer,  can stay at Berkeley due to the unit cap and the declaration hold. A  transfer student that applies as another major won't have the time to do  all the lower division classes like the math lower-divisions, if they  apply as a non-STEM. If it is another STEM major, then it is okay just  meet the GPA cap.  
Overall a transfer's time is substantially shorter  than a freshman's. They have to finish 2-3 years of classes in 2 years  plus find research/other opportunities in those years. They already have  it hard no need to make it harder with another application. Just prove  you can make the grade.  
The point of a university thus the system shouldn't hinder students from exploring and learning.  
\--- **The  current system is mainly gamed by freshmen students that enter and  declare CS as a single major while applying as something else, so have a  Haas-type application to prevent that.** It is *essentially the direct admit petition system*,  but slightly modified. Freshmen that truly want to switch because they  found they love Computer Science have time to build their application  over the first 2-3 years they are there. It also deters people to game  the system. People that truly like CS won't care; they will still try  and apply. That is the point of switching.  
It benefits the EECS  department because you are looking at pre-selected applicants. This  increases the chances that these already Berkeley students would've been  the main candidates you would look at in the direct admission process  through the UC application. The department can also be confident that  these students ""are Berkeley"". It is also better for the EECS department  financially because they'll have less application to work through --  less expense. This benefits the freshmen because it will allow them to  build a strong CS application at Berkeley, if they didn't get the chance  to in high school. They'll be able to create a strong application under  the guidance of Berkeley professors and counselors.  
This solution  still promotes the discovery aspect of CS in L&amp;S while slowing down  the enrollment of CS by preventing the gaming of the system.  
If the  applicant is denied, then allow them to petition/appeal it but they need  a LoR from a EECS professor. If they have a LoR from a EECS professor  saying this person is the bee's knees, then automatically accept them.  Who cares? Again...the point of a university is guide students toward  their passions.  
This gives them ample chances to get into the major.  If they can't get in with this much leeway, it is highly likely they  aren't passionate about CS.  
This is like direct admit but some  benefits for double majors and transfers. It freely allows some students  to access the major, if they choose to. The freshmen that wants to take  the risk of applying to CS would need a back up major just like how a  Haas applicant needs a back up major.  
The proposed direct admit  system essentially blocked anyone that wasn't approved, because if they  didn't get approved at the time of acceptance they weren't likely going  to get approved with a petition no matter how strong of applicant they  were, since the department has a perpetual want of funding.

I  am surprised that department isn't fighting tooth and nail for funding  to meet the demand, but instead they are having public proposals for  direct admit to a major. Why not have public proposals demanding more  funding? Instead what they should be doing is using the leverage the  department has to get more funding. The department has powerhouse  professors. They absolutely have leverage to get more funding. ***You  are a world class department in the flagship institution of the richest  state in the country. Don't say you can't secure more funding with the  leverage you have.*** It's absurd. Having more is good for EECS student as well.

With  inflation and the growing expense of the Bay Area, they'll need to  demand more funding anyways. If they don't think that, then professors  and administration of the EECS department are delusional.

EECS  makes students take an ethics class...the EECS professors should  probably take an ethics class for a reminder of what being a professor  means. Professors need to embrace students especially strong students,  and fight for funding to support those students. Not shut them out.  Professors shouldn't be admission officers. As I've said admission  officers have already admitted the students they feel should be at  Berkeley. Now the department needs to work with it.

Berkeley  is a public institution with astounding achievements. This was done  because the faculty before knew how important it was to invest in the  university. This investment ended up giving birth to the UC system.  Every school in the UC system is amazing. That is unprecedented for a  public school system.

tldr: The bold sentences and the two bullet points under ""***The only viable option, and the ONLY option is to get more funding or reallocate funding.""***  basically summarizes everything. Also, I've added a modified  direct-admit system as I felt the proposed direct-admit system was  lacking."

A bit background about me: An international student.(needs H1B and stuff) Psychology undergraduate, did something totally not technical for 2.5 years after graduation and is currently in a master degree for CS. I feel like comparing to those who did a bachelor in CS I probably do not have that large project production experience. So I am a bit nervous/anxious and feeling imposter about doing internship... 

I already have offers from Microsoft &amp; Salesforce and is expecting to hear back from Meta really soon. Not sure if I will get the offer or not but I still want to see what people think of these 3 since I won't have much time left to make a choice once I know the result. The offer deadlines for both Salesforce and Microsoft are coming up really soon.

Microsoft:

Pros:

* bigger name even to people outside tech.
* Starts green card process right after onboarding if I can get that return offer. And even if I did not get H1B lottery they send you to Canada or something to continue helping you with H1B.
* wlb
* heard the return offer rate was 85%

Cons:

* Internship money is low, new grad money is still low.
* C# all the way and some people dont like it.
* even though it has good wlb some people say this is not the case for Azure. (I will be working for Azure)
* no idea about the team I will end up with.

Salesforce:

Pros:

* decent money for internship, decent money for new grads.
* return rate is even higher than Microsoft
* I knew which team I would be working for, the hiring manager was super nice and the things they work on seem to be very interesting for me.
* Great WLB as a whole company

Cons:

* Relatively smaller name compare with Microsoft
* won't start green card process until you get H1B lottery.

Facebook(Meta):

Pros:

* decent money for intern &amp; new grad
* starts green card process in day 1
* (rumor) faster promotion and career growth
* big name, part of FAANG.

Cons:

* lower new grad return offer rate
* bad work life balance.
* pressure. heard some ""either get promoted or get laid off"" rumors about having to be promoted to E4/E5 within certain time frame and otherwise you will be laid off
* bad reputation. So bad that they have to change the name...

Any insight will be appreciate!! especially people who interned/worked there

qoggj0,1,2021-11-06,What is wrong with my mother?,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/qoggj0/what_is_wrong_with_my_mother/,"Some background: I'm 24 and working on my second degree in engineering (1.5 years left). I currently do school full-time, a part-time internship, and have a part-time job. And my mother is 52.

She is very reactive and will perceive anything as slight and just blow up. And then she will proceed to blame me for everything and that it was all my fault.

When I was younger, even though I always felt she was at fault, I would apologize to make sure she felt okay. As I got older, I have stopped doing it as I became more resentful towards her.

Like I said, every fight is over something small, its her blowing up into a rage, and then its her telling me that I pushed her to her limit and that I am to blame for the whole situation.

The latest incident was over asking her to unplug my laptop since she was sitting right next to it. And somehow, even I don't even know how, but it turned into a huge argument...and not even an argument since it was only her participating. I would never had asked had I known that fight would start

She starts to get really upset, and I just tell her that I don't understand what she was getting mad about and that I don't want to fight over this. She kept on going, yelling at me, building up her rage, telling me that ""You don't know what I am mad about?"" as if I should know. I then said I can't do this anymore  and that she is toxic and she explodes. She grabbed the pizza off the counter that I just bought for dinner and throws it. She starts saying that I am the ugliest piece of shit ever, etc. I tell her that she is insanely toxic again and walk to my room.

I put on my headphones with music since she will continue to yell names and talk about how there is something wrong with me. This will usually last around 5-7 minutes. And this is her being better. She used to come in my room so I couldn't get away.

I end up hiding out in my room for hours on end to avoid her. Eventually when I walk to my bathroom, I am whistling a song. She is in the living room and can hear this. She tells me to stop fucking whistling and is getting ready to fight again. I just say ""okay, that's weird"" and go back into my room.

For my whole life, these fights have happened. I originally lived with my siblings and the same fights happened with them to. Eventually my dad left her and my family, so I was stuck all alone dealing with her at 14. She had made it very clear that my dad was supposedly mentally ill, but the more and more I get older, I think its her. I don't know how my dad dealt with her for 23 years. I talked to him over email for the first time in like 10 years a couple months ago. I asked what happened between them and to be honest. He said that she was argumentative and that she was always right no matter what. And I'm not defending my dad, though. He is an asshat who left my family. Well..according to my mom.

I know there is something wrong with her. I have reached out to my brother and sister and they both agree. My brother said that he has describer her behaviors to his therapist, and that his therapist said it sounds like borderline personality disorder.

However, I'm not sure I can trust my brother. He is bipolar, and the last time I saw him, he randomly had a change of personality and started going off on my sister and I. He said that we don't know what he is capable that he would seriously kill me and chop me into pieces. And this was literally all over nothing. His personality switched like a literal switch. Instant. And my point in mentioning this is that maybe since he has something, she does too?

Last things I wanted to mention was that these constant fights with her have made me feel insane. She always blames me for everything, and I would wonder if it was really me and that I couldn't notice it? Maybe I was being mean to her without knowing it? Maybe there is something wrong with me? I can't tell you how many times over the years I've posted our fights on reddit trying to figure out if I am the issue.

However, recently, I've realized that I honestly don't want these fights to happen. I try to avoid her at all costs. If a fight does start, I then try to get away from it. And I'm not the one blowing up, calling names, throwing things.

And when my sister and her husband visited recently, for the first time in my life, she apologized to me  infront of them. She has NEVER EVER apologized to me in my life. It was so strange. It felt like she was just doing it to look good in front of them or that she knew she looked bad.

Anyways. That's enough random rambling. I guess I just want someone to verify that I am not the true asshole here. I'm not the crazy one right? I've always felt like I was the adult in our relationship. I know nothing else other than this."

Which should I choose?,_KingCharles,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qoh37j/gap_inc_vs_chickfila_for_summer_2022_internship/,"I've fortunately received two offers for a software engineering intern position for Summer 2022, though I am having difficulty choosing between them.

&amp;nbsp;


Here's a summary of the two offers:  

##### Chick-fil-A

Details: $27/hour with $2,000 housing stipend; flexible work schedule at corporate headquarters  

Pros:  

- Work environment and culture fit
 - Supportive, collaborative work culture
 - I have gotten along well with everyone I have spoken to
 - In many ways, a perfect culture fit for me
- Individual attention
 - 1 of only 7 interns; likely the only intern on my team
 - Get to choose which team I work on
 - At the company headquarters where interaction with upper-level executives is common
- Would get to work mostly in-person

Cons:  

- Pay
- Prestige compared to Gap? Reputation outside of the South? 
- Would have to spend my $2,000 stipend on housing in Atlanta compared to keeping the $3,000 bonus from Gap  

&amp;nbsp;  

##### Gap Inc.

Details: $38/hour with $3,000 bonus; work remotely

Pros:  

- Pay
- Prestige? I'm assuming Gap is more highly regarded among the technology field given the wage they're willing to offer
- Work from home would allow me to keep everything I earn and live near friends/family.
- 50% discount at Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy, Athleta

Cons:  

- Unsure of the work culture. I doubt it's *bad* but also doubt it is a greater fit than Chick-fil-A.
- Lack of interaction due to working remotely
- Less individualized attention. Gap has 50 interns this summer, though I'm unsure if this is across all departments or software engineering specifically.

---

All in all, I'm in search of which offer will

1. Allow me to succeed this summer
2. Best prepare me for a full-time role  

Also, both have high full-time offer rates and a good new-grad program, so pretty similar there.

For anyone that has some insight, which offer would you choose? Does the culture, environment, and attention that Chick-fil-A offers outweigh the $7,500+ pay advantage of Gap? And does this pay difference indicate a higher quality program?

Any help would be much appreciated! I have to make a decision by Tuesday. Thanks!"

Currently, I am in my final year in NUS and I will be graduating with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. I have been offered a conditional offer at the University of Queensland to pursue a Masters in Engineering and I also am going through the interview stages for a few jobs here. 

Personally for me, the type of job I would prefer would be ensuring things stay in order (quality/safety?) and I’m not a sales person. 

However, my girlfriend would be moving to Australia when the borders open up and she has no intention of working in Singapore next time (she’s pursuing a healthcare degree). With my qualifications, I can find a manufacturing job here but it may not be what I want. I am happy/neutral with Singapore as it is (altho stuff can be improved like better pay for hcw and the housing issue).

I have listed the pros and cons that I have researched so far below.

Singapore
Pros: SAFETY, Low tax, CPF, cheap public transport, parking is cheap, good n cheap food, good to travel

Cons: ME mostly hiring manufacturing, hdb need wait years to own, COE $$$, stressful environment, lousy(?) work life balance

Brisbane
Pros: Amazing nature (great barrier reef), more stuff to do on weekends (gold coast area), better weather, more affordable housing atm, cars are affordable

Cons: expensive shipping, high tax rates, racism more expressive, hard to find job as foreigner, prob need to intern every holiday to secure job, opportunity cost in moving since I have to study 2 more years (~150k in total costs not including salary from sg job)

The healthcare in both countries are comparable, and the income that I will bring back is also comparable (after taxes). I’m not sure about job progression in either country too. 

With that much being said, I am seeking advice from anyone that has experiences/struggles in moving overseas to live/work or job experiences from engineers that have stayed on in Singapore :)"

* Some academic and personal projects but not too great

I don't have any idea where to apply and it would be a great if someone can help me out. I am not targeting any top universities.

qopdwz,0,2021-11-07,How to Ask an Employer for an Unpaid Internship,DzondzulaSkr,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qopdwz/how_to_ask_an_employer_for_an_unpaid_internship/,I've found a couple of paid internship offers. But as I don't have any work experience and only one personal project I wanted to send my resume and write a cover letter where I would ask for unpaid internship. Im student and have completed some online courses about iOS programming.  Should I say that I really want that position or just mention that I would like to work for free.

Most people work remote but I make a point to come in most days I can. I also engage in meetings and actively contribute while “knowing my place”. I go to all the company events and conversations with the CTO and director the most out of the interns. Would this set me apart? I am doing full stack development and am probably middle of the pack of 5 interns but am showing desire to learn. Does all this matter or are they just going to take the best coders?

I did two internships at the same company. My bosses like me, and want me back but there is some issue with budgeting and they cannot give me an answer yet whether I can be hired in the months to come, and I cannot be unemployed for too long after graduating. 

My bosses at that company have all been very kind, friendly and have offered to help me find a job or write me glowing references for any other job I might apply to. 

I am not too well informed on how references work. From what I have seen so far, it seems to be something that employers ask when you apply for a job with them and they interview you and are looking to hire you - then they would reach out to those you provided as a reference. Is there any other way I can use professional references before the interview process, to secure an interview in the first place?

How would you best suggest I use their help to find a new job?"

So I'm two years away from receiving my bachelors degree in Computer Science. I'm maintaining a solid GPA and am looking into doing an internship during my senior year. I also do quite a bit of web development in my spare time (both front end and back end).

Aside from all this, what can I do to better position myself for a good employment after graduation? My goal would be to get either into software development or software engineering.

If it matters, I am going to a state university in Minnesota and am hoping to work remotely."

Would it be best to copy/paste and then adapt the project to make it my own?

I honestly dont expect to get the offer considering I dont have a ton of experience with excel, which Im sure is important and I would definitely like to get better at by the time I get another offer.

1. How long does the background check take, is it done immediately.
2. Do most employers verify all work experiences listed?
3. Do most employers ask for transcripts and graduation date?

At our school we have these internship jobs where we work at different places but because of the current state of the world, not everyone has a job. I applied for an HR job and he also applied of course he gets it and I was kinda proud that atleast it was not someone else. Last Friday was his first day at work so he was not at school. When he got back he started acting different. He kept saying I was following him and dialed 911. He then started telling the teacher that and I said I don’t know why he’s acting like this and just left home feeling really sad.

This sub has definitely been helpful in answering all my questions in the past and would love to get your advice and feedback on this one also! 

The main offers that I’m highly considering are the following: (Ranked in order) (total comp including relocation, bonus, etc.)

**· Amazon Finance Rotational Program** – 90k, FAANG, I like what I will be doing, but negative is my parents and friends teases that I will be packing boxes. I will be also on the Operations Finance rather than business finance. I do have the option to switch to business one but I honestly would love to get a foundation in operations. I also heard that the PIP plan is pretty scary.

**· Bank of America FMAP** – 70k, Rotational program, great company, I love Charlotte, low salary, and internship experience was kinda trash

**· Deloitte Consulting** – 95k, Consulting is cool \~ but never done it, Chicago, I heard wlb is insane for consultants, I do love travelling tho. But will I be considered a just another employee from a big 4?

**· Morgan Stanley IB** – 125k, good prestige and money, sponsorship for MBA, wlb is non existent, I will probably be miserable and gain more weight, but maybe a good sacrifice for 2 years?

**· KPMG Audi**t – 65k, will force me to get my CPA, good exit opportunities, wlb sucks, pay is crap, and its audit lol.

**Personally, I’m looking for three main things.**  

1. **Decent wlb** because I gained a TON of weight during undergraduate due to stress and trying to lose that as well as pursue some of my passions in life.

2.  **Carries “weight/prestige”** that would be a huge stepping stone for me if I do end up getting a MBA after 3-5 years of WOE or transition to another company as I don’t see myself staying in a company forever

3. **Something interesting/fun/ and I will learn a lot from**. As well as great salary of course.

**If you were in my position\~ what offer would you accept?**"
qp2nyy,1,2021-11-07,Looking for advice to become a CS/math teacher,forever_c0nfused,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/qp2nyy/looking_for_advice_to_become_a_csmath_teacher/,"Hello!

TLDR: I like computer science and math, and I think teaching is a good idea, but I don't know what I'm doing.

I graduated with a BS in computer science and math, and I'm currently working at a tech company. I ended up in this job because the description aligned with my interests and qualifications, and software development seemed like a good path that everyone else in my situation is doing. However, I'm becoming increasingly unhappy with my job, and it's feeling meaningless. I was also unhappy at a previous internship experience I had at a different company. It's strange being successful on paper, and working in the field I love, but being unhappy in reality.

At some point, something clicked. I remembered that when I was in high school, the only computer science class offered was the worst class I've ever taken. And most high schools in the US didn't even have a computer science class at all, I was lucky! I also remembered how I enjoyed my experience as a teaching assistant in college. So now I've finally found an idea I believe I enjoy, I'm good at, and can make an impact on a cause I find meaningful. Now at work, I'm daydreaming about teaching computer science and math.

I want to ask for some information and advice. I'm not expecting one person to answer every question I have, but these are the kinds of questions I'm asking myself and I appreciate any input!

How can I become certified as a teacher and what's the process like? Do I need to get a masters degree? I didn't get my degree with a plan to become a teacher, so I don't have education training. I see that there is ""alternative teacher certification"", but I don't understand what this means and what it entails. Is this something in-person or online, how long does it take, and what is the actual work like to get certified?

Right now I'm mainly focused on the idea of teaching math and/or computer science at a high school. But what other related opportunities might exist that I should consider? All I can think of is tutoring and coding boot-camps, and I know very little about them.

I'm also having doubts if this is a good idea. Of course there are downsides with being a teacher, like longer hours, less pay, the fact that students (and parents and administrators!) don't always behave well, etc. I want to think that every job has annoying aspects, but that it will all be worth it in this case. Do you have any insight about some signs that could mean I should/shouldn't be a teacher, or some pros and cons that might not be obvious to me? Maybe the only way to really know is to just try it.

Thank you for your time!"

But, again at this point I'm not sure what I actually want to do in life. So, yeah maybe I'm the only one but it would be of great great help if I could find a detailed article about this.

This is my first time posting so I apologise if the formatting is weird.

i (21m) am stuck and I don't know what to do. I had an interview semi-recently with a business abroad and they have decided to take me on for a year temporary internship so I can get experience in the hotel industry. 

A bit of background earlier this year I finished a diploma in hospitality and hotel management and at the end of this course was presented with an opportunity to have an interview with a very well established hotel in America. but because of the climate we are in has made it very difficultly to get anything done I.E getting papers, visas and interviews done to go on said internship.

At first, my partner (33m) was supportive and was ok with me going I had this interview last November and was offered a placement but the country I live in wasn't allowing people to leave so I change my start date to October. the date had changed again because of the problems in our country that we were and still are in. suddenly out of nowhere, my partner had a change of heart and no longer wanted me to go which has caused a wedge between us. it has been a dream of mine to work in the country where the hotel is for many years but I also have plans to work in other countries with my partner and create a life together. he thinks that if I go I might not be able to return to my country for a couple of years and thinks it is too much of a risk for myself, our relationship and make it harder to get jobs abroad in other countries (which we planned but if I take this internship it will take a couple of years after I return to try to work abroad again). this was really affecting him he wouldn't talk to me for an entire day when I said wanted to go. out of guilt, I said that I would stay but I'm yet to tell the business but I don't know what to do should I stay here and wait for a couple of years to work abroad with my partner or go abroad in the next couple months do the internship and potentially be stuck in that country for longer than I intended trying to get back to my country of origin and I don't want to lose my partner

Hey everyone, I'm planning on pursuing a Masters in Computer Science in Germany in the next Winter Semester 2022.

I had decided on 3 ways to boost my profile, and unfortunately, they are all clashing with each other. I've listed them below.

The timeframe I'm working with is around 5-6 months starting from this month itself. It's going to be a tight crunch, but I have to do whatever I can.

# 1. Research Paper / Journal Publish

This is my most preferred option, since I am eventually going to end up in research universities. However, my professor said it might take a year to get a journal publish in, so it's probably impossible due to the time constraint. 

That being said, if there's any alternative approach here, I'm open to hearing it.

&amp;#x200B;

# 2. Internships

I have applied to a few internships, but the timings they demand are a bit insane (50 hours per week?!) since I have a lot of college work such as my final year project to attend to as well.   


It's a commitment for sure, but unfortunately it's just not as valuable as research experience, so it's my second most preferred. 

That being said, they are definitely valuable as work experience

# 3. GRE

The GRE is my third preferred option, 4 of the colleges in my list strongly recommend GRE scores as well.  


However, I'm definitely weak at quantitative questions like in the GRE, and so require around 3 months to be able to get any real score. Due to the nature of the GRE, even then, a good score may not be guaranteed, further adding to the risk factor of this choice.  


# Clashing

Here I can only realistically focus on two of the above-given options. And considering that the research option takes too long, doing the scholarship and GRE seem to be the obvious choice here.  


That being said, my research is naturally limited, so I would REALLY appreciate any alternative approaches, or any differing options I should choose here based on your experiences.  


It has been driving me absolutely insane for the past weeks, so I look forward to hearing your perspectives! Thank you!"

qp8wpu,17,2021-11-08,Google STEP Application/Interview Experience (Sophomore),Character-Puzzled,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/qp8wpu/google_step_applicationinterview_experience/,"Hey everyone! I just recently completed the Google STEP application process and wanted to share my experience with you all. I've benefitted from hearing about the experiences and advices of others on this page, so I wanted to give my experience as well to help others!

My Candidate Profile:

I am an asian male attending a top 10 CS school (according to US News rankings). I am a sophomore studying Computer Science and have previous swe internship experience at large retail company. I wanted to share this information because I acknowledge that the recruiting process also takes demographic information and prior experience into account, so I felt this would be good context to provide.

My preparation and internship applications:

I've always been aware of the internship grind that happens every fall, so like many others, I keep a spreadsheet and track my applications and their status. As a freshman, I applied to 81 places and moved into the interview process for 7. As a sophomore, I've applied to 40 so far (planning to apply to 106) and have moved into the interview process for 9 so far. Google STEP was one of them!

For Google STEP and other internship programs, I read the first 4 chapters of CTCI. I have completed around 70 LC problems (40 easy/30 medium/0 hard). I also watch a lot of videos on youtube of people doing mock interviews (like Clement), because I am always interested in observing how the candidate communicates and thinks, as well as how the interviewer responds and asks questions. I think interviews are 50% technical skill and 50% communication/approach. Feel free to correct me if I am wrong, I am still new to this industry's application process!

My application timeline with Google STEP:

I applied to Google STEP on 10/2. I had a referral, which I am very sure makes a big difference on the timeline of your application. I received an email from a recruiter on 10/14 who said that my application has officially been forwarded to the hiring team for further review. On 10/26, I got an email saying I was selected for interviewing, and on 11/5, I had my two interviews (45 min each). I believe these are the only two interviews that are conducted for the STEP program.

My interview experience for Google STEP:

I was pretty nervous from 10/26 to 11/5 for the interview, but five minutes into the first interview, I lost all my nerves and was actually enjoying the experience with my interviewer. He was very nice and sort of playful the entire time. We were pretty much having a conversation the entire time and I was able to solve 2 problems and get 80% of a third problem. We went over time, and the interview lasted 55 minutes instead of 45 minutes. When my second interview started, I was able to solve the first problem in 10 minutes, and so the interviewer decided to ask me another problem, but not a leetcode type. It was a problem about asynchronous coding and callback functions, something generally seen in backend engineering. Luckily, I've done a little bit of work in that, so I was familiar with the concept. However, I was still working with the engineer to fully understand the problem until the 25 minute mark, and then came up with an answer that just 1 or 2 lines off of the correct solution. He was also very nice and fun to work with, and I did not feel nervous at all. He assured me that the second problem was not a big deal, and he just wanted to see how far I could go since we had done the first problem pretty fast. We went 10 minutes over time again, so he gave me the full solution to the problem and asked if I had any questions and that was the end of the interview process!

Final thoughts and response:

It has only been like 3 days since I interviewed so I obviously don't have a response yet. My main goal was to make sure I did my best, because I would be much more disappointed in myself if I messed up on an easy question than if I just did not know how to do a hard question. When I hear back from Google I will update this post! So I hope you guys will come back and see how it turned out!

Thanks again to the redditors on this page. I've gained a lot of advice and motivation from the posts here. I hope my experience can provide something similar to others. Good luck to everyone on the internship hunt this season!

UPDATE:

I got an offer!!! WOOOOOOOOO"

I have made subconscious/concious stupid career decisions which have driven me to suicidal ideation/depression. Every decision I made regarding career was Wrong because I thought, I would commit suicide before starting a job*

But I am still alive, WTF

*I should have just choosen Science and followed it by computer engineering then cyber security*

Here are list of my decisions.

1. I scored 77 in 10th and choose Commerce. I choose Commerce because I don't know why. 

(I gave aptitude test and I got science as the result). I regret that, I would have taken Science and all the regret, that I am experiencing wouldn't exsist.

2. I scored 78 in 12th and was doing company secretary cours,  because my friend decided to do it and I thought, it had MONEY.

I choose Bcom from a third class college. I ended up failing 9 times in CS Excecutive and dropped out. I never studied because I lacked intrest in it and it sucked.


3. To stay at home because I was depressed, I choose to start LLB. I choose a college which require no attendance. Stayed home and barely passed LLb exam.

Now in last year doing shitty internship.


I hate it!
 I hate it!

I would just shoot myself in the head, than wear that stupid white shirt and make a mockery of myself, following senior associate like a stray dog to the court room or read cringy memes on Law pages on instagram about ""how badass lawyers are""!!


On the other hand, regretting my life decisions about not getting into tech field.

I always had a knack for computers. I loved them and had curiosity about how they work and how I can reverse engineer a software and hack it /exploit them.



Now to avoid shitty LLB, I decided to give CAT and get into top MBA college so I can get good package. I want money at this stage now.

I would be dead in few days anyways. Life is so irritating and full of regret."

It turns out that I still have a chance to finish the project for a chance to get the internship but since I have just started the medication and am basically building my work ethic from the ground up at the age of 21 I am sacred that I wont be able to manage my time and commit both to studying and essentially working at the same time.

qpeegg,1024,2021-11-08,"White collar workers, this is your movement too. You can't get ahead, you're trapped by design too.",scoutsout71,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/qpeegg/white_collar_workers_this_is_your_movement_too/,"I do technical white-collar work for a Venture Capitalist owned company. This particular VC is all about 'people-driven private equity'. They came in a while ago, bought my company, and promised a people-first approach to growing the company, including compensation analysis, training and other promises.

Lies. It’s all lies. It only applies to their people. 9 months later? The promised training - there is none. The promised new hires to relieve the work burden, there has been none. The promised raises? Significantly less than inflation. They are all talk and no show. Funny how at this summer’s all-hands meeting, they talked about how we had a stellar year last year. Sure, after you cut our pay 25% due to 'covid reasons’.

And here's why you can't get ahead - there’s a glass ceiling - not sex based, not merit based, but based on who you know and how rich your parents are. This VC runs a program where they take MBA candidates from major universities - in my case they took two from a very well respected Ivy league school - and put them in internships for a year. At the end of the year, when they get their MBA, they get placed into portfolio companies the VC owns. At very high leadership levels, straight out of an MBA program, with zero job experience beyond a crappy internship. The program aims to get them into CEO jobs right out of their MBA, it says so right on the web page, they proudly display that. They get these cushy jobs with zero work experience, all based on who they know. And because these people are rich, they've never even held a retail job or anything. Just class privilege all the way through life.

Our two geniuses came in at the 'President' level, both reporting directly to the CEO. To manage complex e-commerce products from the top-down. Both late 20s. Both have never worked a day in their life. They now make more in a year than I do, after 35 years working. Instantly. 

These people have NO IDEA what they are doing and are causing havoc. I do IT* work - this new President of one of our e-commerce divisions had *no idea* about the various frameworks that she was now responsible for. Had never even heard of them, so we must guide her through this the first time. She’s constantly emailing the CTO directly asking inane questions that anyone in corporate America would know the answer to, because she doesn’t know how project management works, or how tickets work, or how to do anything basic. She, of course, fired all the leaders under her shortly after taking the President role, so she has no one to lean on now to learn from and the rest of us that have to deal with her are left scrambling. It's been a huge nightmare. Early next year, the compliance cycle kicks off for the other e-commerce product we have, and I get to do this all over again with the 'CEO in-training' that was plopped into that President job completely unqualified.

You cannot get to that level, you will not get to that level. Work as hard as you want, that level is reserved for the rich connected people, which you are not. You may be white-collar. You may be smart and hard working. You may be paid well, may even have decent insurance. They can take that away in a minute - I watched it happen to the whole team of people that she is replacing with 'their' people - all of which are unqualified, inexperienced and a nightmare to work with. But they know people, and they are all rich to begin with. That is what matters.

They sit on their Zoom calls, 12 foot ceilings in their office, giant panoramic windows showing off the acres of land and a giant pool behind them in their cushy 6000 sq ft houses. Straight out of an MBA program with zero experience. With their Gucci dresses, and perfect hair cuts, and the dark expensive bookshelves on the wall of the office. They talk the corporate-lingo perfectly, even though they don't understand a word they are saying

The privilege is astounding. There is an invisible glass ceiling -- passing through requires you to be rich and connected.

I now put in exactly 40 hours a week, no more. I do maybe 10 hours of actual work. Fuck them. It is not my job to train these rich entitled brats to do their jobs so I can make crumbs that tumble down, praying I don’t get laid off so my kids can have health insurance.

the TL;DR here is, if you do white collar office work, you may think you are comfortable, you may think you are well-off. You may think you are above this ‘antiwork’ movement. You’re not. It's a facade. One major sickness, one layoff, one emergency, or simply them placing the son or daughter of a rich friend in a position 3 levels above you, and you're out. With bills to pay, medical debt piling up, and hungry kids at home. 

We are all in this together.

Eat the rich.

Edited for privacy, sorry, my kids need insurance :("

Part of my internship is having one on one zoom meetings with my manager every Monday morning (literally just left it) to go over my tasks for the week. My supervisor is so nice and sweet and no matter how many times we meet, I just can't shake the anxiety. Every Sunday it's always in the back of my mind and I get so nervous. My stomach always hurts in the morning before my meetings and after it's over, I feel so shaky and replay everything over in my head wondering if she could somehow see how awkward and anxious I was feeling on the inside. My mom peeked in on my meeting this morning and she told me that I shouldn't say ""mhm"" and nod my head so much. But I just really don't know what else  to do! Im mostly just being told what I need to do for the week, so there's not that much input from me. I'm just so hyper aware of myself and how I must look and how I might sound and I get so hung up on it and I just don't know how how to relax. I feel like I sit so stiff and am not very reactive because I'm trying so hard to not show just how anxious I'm feeling on the inside. I also have a bit of a nervous giggle, and I often find myself doing that a lot. I naturally have a softer, higher pitched voice so I worry a lot that it sounds weak and shaky and that I'm not elevating it enough.  I know that's it's just all in my head, but I just can't shake the awkwardness and I always feel so embarrassed afterwards because I think I probably made myself look even more awkward. I just wish I knew how to better cope and ""fake it till I make it."""

Microsoft Pros:

\- Probably better name on resume for intern

\- I think higher new grad salary when I graduate

SIG Pros:

\- They’re a trading company, and I’ve always kind of been curious to see what happens at those types of companies.

\- Higher intern pay (by like a lot more compared to what msft offered me)

They’re both paying for housing and flights, so that’s not a problem.

Any thoughts would be appreciated about either company or just general advice about making a decision lol.

qpgtud,3,2021-11-08,Perpetually bad at working,nissanpacific01,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/qpgtud/perpetually_bad_at_working/,"
Hello, I have a problem. For every job that I had, I always end up being bad at it. My first job when I was 18, I worked in a call center and every time I didn’t know something, my colleagues who were older (like university age) helped me. Then at my next job, when I was 19, I worked at a customer service job and my colleagues (older by around 2 years) were more competent than me in every way, and they said that it’s fine because they are older. I always thought that when i got older, I would become better at working. Now I am turning 20 and working as an intern in a bank. But I am terribly incompetent and always get scolded by my boss. For example, I am always making mistakes with data entry and calculations, which angers my boss. I try to avoid mistakes but there are things that I just don’t know that i need to look out for, which has caused me to become extremely anxious at work. I am starting to think that growing older will not make me better at working, I am just bad at every job. What can I do about this, please?"

You might have seen posts about me not being able to get a job, so my mother and I devised a plan.

So I studied at a PA state school, which if you know anything about the actual state schools in PA, was pretty underfunded for anything outside of education, criminology, and nursing majors.  One of the consequences of this was a largely useless ""internship coordinator"" for the math and cs department.  I remember when I went to him during my sophomore year to see if he could help, he refused.  He explained that internships were meant for juniors.  I applied myself for that summer and didn't get anything.  Flash forward to my junior year and the internship coordinator showed me how to Google ""Computer Science Internship Pittsburgh.""  So anyways I was back on my own again and never got an internship for the summer between my junior and senior year either.

So now, 6 months out of college, I have no experience and the job search is largely hopeless.  My plan was to enroll in a better funded school, which will probably be Pitt so that I can commute and spend as little money as possible.  I would enroll as an undergrad working towards a software engineering major (they didn't have engineering at the school I went to, just CS).  The only point in me doing this would be to speak to the internship coordinator and see if he could help me out.  Then, once I have an internship lined up, I'll drop out and complete the internship.

Does this sound reasonable?  Specifically, I wanted to know about the usefulness of internship coordinators at larger schools with better funding.  Do internship coordinators help significantly with the internship search?

EDIT: I'm just gonna tack on an extra question at the end so I don't have to make a new post.  I will either go with this plan or just bite the bullet and go work for Revature. Is there a way to get a job at these companies without 3 months of training, I just finished 4 years. "

I need your help. What’s been happening to me is that I’ve been applying to jobs pretty consistently for about a month, 5-10 resumes sent out per day. I don’t customize the resumes and don’t add a cover letter so perhaps this is part of the issue. Also was told that my resume reads more like a “doer” rather than an “achiever”. Overall I’m getting very few bites — I’m lucky to get one person interested per week. It’s becoming increasingly frustrating and demoralizing, I don’t know what I am doing wrong here. I’m getting tons of rejection emails. My degree is like computer biology. 

I’m well-versed in all things python and data visualizations, and just general data analysis. I’m mainly applying to entry level software developer/data analyst positions. Graduated a few years ago, had one job since and it was in the biotech industry. Basically had me doing data analysis for bio. I was laid off from this position during the pandemic. So it’s been about a year of being unemployed... During this time I’ve been doing freelance programming using python making apps and all kinds of stuff. Also during my bio degree I did an internship that used a little SQL and Python. 

What should I being doing here? I’m also applying to bio jobs too but would prefer a swe/data analyst role. Still basically generating little results from employers and not sure why.

Here is the ninety-seventh installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.
* How do I find computer engineering jobs?
   * If you have no idea what you want, I would suggest just searching a job board (indeed, google, linkedin, etc.) for computer engineering jobs. If you know of a company you would want to work for (e.g., AMD), you can go directly to their website and look at their open positions. You can also use the information you learn from that job board (job titles, requirements, skills, etc.) to refine your searches on other job boards.

All the best,

\--Nick

However, im not really sure which I should pick in order to best reach my goal, which is to be a security architect. My first offer is as a network engineer co-op(8 month internship) for a fortune 500 energy company, it would be WFH and pays really well. The 2nd option is a summer(~3 months) internship for a defense contractor working as a network operations intern, with a chance for some cybersecurity. This one pays more than the first and I'd end up getting a security clearance with it. For those of you in the industry, which opportunity do you think would be help me get to my goal quicker? I'm torn between the longer work experience and developing a stronger foundational networking knowledge, or getting a security clearance, having some professional cybersecurity exposure but having less working experience before I graduate.

qpihix,6,2021-11-08,I think I screwed my future as an international student,mmkthecoolest,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/qpihix/i_think_i_screwed_my_future_as_an_international/,"A little backstory: I came to the US to study Computer Engineering as an undergrad back in 2017. Internships were required as part of my program, but I only managed to get 2 out of the 4 blocks I was supposed to do, and those two internships barely had anything to do with my major (it was really basic IT stuff). The other 2 blocks were waived due to COVID.

I started my grad program back in Fall 2020 in Software Engineering entirely online. I later did my Spring 2021 semester in another country because my parents insisted to come over. Probably the worst decision of my life as without getting into details, I did not enjoy living in their household, I failed one of my classes and I wasn't able to leave until late summer essentially.

Fast-forward to now where I am trying to get out of academic probation and need to decide whether I need to do a capstone and graduate early or an internship next semester and extend my program. I did not want to do a thesis because I suck at research and my advisor advised against it. My goal is to make a life of my own independent (through career opportunities in the US) from my parents so I don't end up being stuck with them again.

I am unsure what to do considering my visa is expiring on summer 2022. After speaking with my international services department, they basically said as long as I am a student in the institution with no travel plans outside the US, I can still stay and even apply for OPT later on. I haven't told my parents about this yet because I don't want them to know that I won't be able to travel out of the US after next semester if I choose to stay longer (this is kinda relevant since I financially depend on them for my college program).

To make matters worse, I have basically fucked up my job search for next semester. I think I only applied to 20ish jobs and I only got 1 interview and 2 coding tests. No offers. I have been dealing with motivational issues as well and am still playing catch-up with academic stuff. I am also going to be speaking with a faculty member about my capstone, and I just told her about my internship plans but she hasn't responded and I don't know if she is okay with it.

If I do end up only being able to get a job through OPT, what if I end up going in a shitty internship with no opportunities for sponsorship? What happens if my internships and OPT ends? Where do I go? Some people tell me to enjoy life by living in the moment, but I can't do that when my future can be potentially chaos. How do I not fuck up my career opportunities, provided I haven't already screwed them up?"

I spent 3 years at a 2-year community college where I switched to CS after 1 year. I had one semester left before graduating last spring when I dropped out because I had some ADHD and discipline and just generally didn't want to try at anything. 

Anyway, that's recently not a problem anymore so I've been more focused on having a career. After I dropped out, I moved to Minnesota and worked at Activision as a QA Tester for a year before that ended. I've been unemployed since that ended this last summer. 

Before I moved, I had one unpaid web dev internship for about 5 months which I quit to be a tester because  I needed money. 

I've been applying to jobs pretending I completed my degree but recently realized it's probably not a good idea. I've been doing code academy React and Front-End Engineer paths and want to be a front-end dev. I'm also interested in game dev 

The options I've come up with is to either 

* Keep doing online courses and full-fledged personal projects while working retail or similar
* Do a boot camp
* Take out loans to finish my 2 year or transfer to 4 year (I owe $2000 in loans from my previous degree) (I'm not sure how much I would get in aid, I'm 23 and married to a Chemical Engineer that recently graduated)

I've been applying to internships most of this semester in fields mostly relating to data analytics, data science, and web development. I've been interviewing with three companies the past month for data analytics roles, all of which I got to final interviews with. Company ""A"", in the internet service industry, has been the fastest moving of the three and just extended an offer for a summer position. It seems like a great offer. In the initial recruiter interview they originally said $18-20/hour is expected for an intern, but the offer I received is $27/hour. The issue with this one is the relatively bad commute, it's normally a reasonable 40min drive but with traffic it probably would typically be much more. The problem I'm facing is they only gave me 24hours to accept or decline.

Company B I have a final interview with on Friday, and Company C I just completed a 90minute 3 round final interview. Company B is a power tool/manufacturing company and is the best culture fit from what I've seen so far, with a better commute.

Company C seems to have the most developed internship program but is in insurance, which I'm OK with but is definitely less appealing than the others, and has a similar commute to B.

I'm not sure what to do here. I'm probably going to contact A asking for some more time, and email the other two to see if we can expedite the process because I have a time sensitive offer. But if it still ends up not being enough time to compare offers, I really don't want to reject this good offer just on the chance I get a moderately better one. The other option would be accepting this and reneging if I get a better one, but I don't want to be a dick and sever any potential job with them in the future. What are your thoughts?"

I want to make sure I get a good project for machine learning to prepare me for future work and help me grow. I don't care too much about returning to any of these companies, though I would consider it, and I find that the pay/benefits are pretty important as well. Some details on what I think about each offer:

Snap:

* 9000/mo pay and 2500/mo housing stipend
* already accepted this offer, so I would be reneging if I chose otherwise (though I don't think I would mind not working there in the future)
* would most likely work in Santa Monica, so I would need to spend more money on housing, but I think this would be more fun and I might be able to change locations
* very good benefits, including HSA and lots of free food
* will be able to choose preference and have a good chance of getting a good project, though I think that the product is a little more niche and might not be as applicable in the future
* culture seems good, though sometimes can be a little cringe
* smaller company, which I'm not sure if I prefer, though I did like working at Roblox last summer

Amazon:

* 9775/mo pay and 2425/mo housing stipend, 401k (best monetary benefits)
* would most likely work in Bay Area, so will save more money there since I can live with my parents and will be able to spend more time with SO/friends
* not much benefits otherwise
* cannot give any preferences, so more likely to get a more boring project
* overall I think the culture is a little more boring and I would not enjoy it as much

Facebook:

* 8423/mo pay and \~1800/mo housing stipend (unsure about housing, but worst monetary benefits)
* would most likely work in Bay Area, so will also save more money here in housing and spend more time with SO/friends
* about the same/slightly worse benefits as Snap (no HSA), but might have better perks in HQ
* will be able to choose preference and have a good chance of getting a good project, and I think that projects at FB will be more interesting/applicable than Snap
* engineering culture seems good and I might fit here more, though I am a little worried about moral implications
* larger company, so I think the infrastructure might support my learning more, but not totally sure

It would be great if you all could help provide your insights, and thank you in advance!

I used to be really shy and rarely initiate any conversation with anyone. But time pass by and I realize this is the skill I have to practice because human is a conversation species, I cannot be successful and learn new things if I just by myself. I am not afraid of people, I notice that I am really good at complimenting others, every person I meet I would always find something to give a comment on and it typically lead to a conversation. However, my problem is that I have such bad  memory and it affects the way I talk to people and perform well at work. 

I volunteer as a receptionist at the surgery waiting area and I typically provide updates of the patient who undergoing surgery to their family. I communicate a lot with the nurses and they would give me information regarding the room number, what bay they are in and direct the family to see their love ones according to that. However, I am so bad at remembering stuffs, I would forget the name of the patients, their room immediately just after the nurse tell me on the phone. Or sometimes I would just mix the names up and get the wrong family to the location. Its so bad when I first started, now I have volunteer here for 2 years, it's getting better but once in a while I would messed up like that.

When I started my internship at a biology research lab, I would be the same, forgetting protocols, small little stuffs that need to be done and always mess up the experiment. I'm so mad with myself and literally had a bad depression period where I just give up on studying and my dream career

Outside of work, when I talk to someone, I could never describe something or tell a story properly because I don't really know how to structure my story and describe what I want to tell my partner about.or sometimes, I would just forget about the words/ voca, names of the event to describe the situation. My mind blank out mid sentence.  People always have to ask me to clarify what I am talking about or sometimes they just uh huh uh huh the whole time but don't get what I'm talking about.

Also, I forget stuffs that people tell me really quickly too. I work in a nails salon and I try to talk to my customer and just be friendly with them while I provide them the service. Next time they come, I completely forgot who they were even though I thought they are familiar but just cannot recall how do I know them.

 I hate myself being like this, I want to have friends, I want to do fun things with other people but this memory problem. This memory problem makes it hard for me to work on my already bad social skill. Does anyone experience some thing like this? I think this is in my genetic because my dad and all my sisters having bad memory but not as severe as they cannot conversate or tell story. How can I improve in this? Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated"

I recently got my two transfer decisions back and I am torn on what to do. Before this semester started, I thought that it would be an easy decision to transfer if I got accepted to one of these schools. But now as I am nearly through with my first semester on campus, I have grown a bit fond of my current school and the friends I have made. Hence why I am having more of a dilemma between choosing to stay at my current school (UConn) or transferring to either the University of Michigan or Georgia Tech. Below I'm going to list the pros and cons I can think of for attending each school next semester.

&amp;#x200B;

(FYI I am a second year student and major in Computer Science in all of these schools)

&amp;#x200B;

UConn:

Pros:

Made a lot of friends and am socially doing pretty well in most aspects

Close to Home (Convenient and Cheap Transportation)

Cheapest

Already accustomed to campus and how things operate

Cons:

Least Prestigious Academically

Pales in contrast to the other two universities in terms of resources and class breadth

Middle of nowhere (mabye also could be a pro for less distractions?)

I'm constantly going to think what if? 

&amp;#x200B;

University of Michigan:

Pros:

Dream School

Supposedly the holy grail for a mix of student life and academics

Ann Arbor is great and more similar weather to where I am from 

Strong in my major

Summer Break starts earlier than most schools (advantage for internships)

Cons:

Have to start from scratch socially and academically (GPA reset)

Transportation is not as convenient or cheap 

Most expensive out of the three (I wouldn't have to take out loans still)

I may be 1-2 classes behind due to not all credits transferring

Slightly bigger student body and possible over enrollment issues for the CS major?

Many CS/Engineering classes are located away from central campus

Almost 50K students (not sure if this will be a shock from 30k ish students)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Georgia Tech:

Pros:

Strongest for my major?

Threads would allow me to gain unique experience in certain areas of computing

Tons of opportunities/things to do in Atlanta

I think all main classes will transfer

Cons:

Super Stressful Environment

Have to start from scratch socially and academically (GPA reset)

Transportation is not as convenient or cheap 

Second most expensive out of the three (similarly wouldn't have to take loans)

Don't know if the student body suits me well since it is a very academically focused school

Don't know if I would like the environment since i've lived in the northeast my whole life

&amp;#x200B;

Really, I am concerned that if I transfer, 1. Can I make friends and fit in? (Which I am somewhat confident I can by joining clubs and putting myself out there as I did this semester) and 2. How much more difficult will the academics be at these higher ranked schools? Is the difference in quality between my current school and these two substantial? Also does transferring in the winter/spring semester make it harder to integrate versus in the fall?

&amp;#x200B;

If any more information is needed please let me know, I'd love to hear all of your opinions!"
qprgmj,2,2021-11-08,MacOS or Windows+Linux? What sort of ecosystem do you guys use?,-___-___-__-___-___-,quant,https://www.reddit.com/r/quant/comments/qprgmj/macos_or_windowslinux_what_sort_of_ecosystem_do/,"I'm currently a CS+Math student working in the University's investment club. It's likely that I'll get an internship of some sort as a quant developer over the summer. My old laptop died and I need a new one so I'm on the fence of either getting the Framework laptop or the new Macbook Pros.

I would've gone for the Framework and ran Arch Linux solely if it weren't for the fact that I need Excel. I would still do most of my dev work on Linux but would need to either dual boot or use a VM to get it working.

I want to know whether or a Windows+Linux workflow would be a productive one or if I'm just asking for trouble. Is going with MacOS is simply the way to go?"
qprs2u,3,2021-11-08,Drafting an email as we speak asking my boss for a significant raise. Last minute tips or pep talks?,Dotaproffessional,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qprs2u/drafting_an_email_as_we_speak_asking_my_boss_for/,"You can skip to the last line for the main question, but there's a lot of context needed if you want the full picture so I included more than I needed to. you may skip if you wish. 

I am a software developer for one of the top 4 largest (in number of employees) employers in my state (trying to be vague for a reason). 

My qualifications: I have a bachelor's degree in computer science from an ABET engineering program. I had zero real world programming experience and no internships. Graduated right smack dab in the height of the pandemic. There were plenty of jobs technically, but recruiting efforts in my area were slow. It ended up taking me nearly 11 months to find a job (well, 13 months until I was formally hired, my hiring process took a while because they had to create the position for me). 

I make... much MUCH less many than any other software developer I've ever spoken to. My peers who are all software engineers in the same area started at 60-65k (1 made 70k, and one lucky bastard started out at 80k). 

I make 45k total compensation. My work is... in that grey area between being public sector and private sector. Its a private institution that gets a majority of their money from state and federal governments. Not so much a contractor, i guess you could peripherally say we're related to education. 

So I anticipated taking SOME compensation penalty. Anything that is considered technically a nonprofit associated with the government is going to have great benefits, a great retirement plan, but less than competitive wages. 

But I wasn't ready for 45,000. When I was given the job offer, 1) I was desperate, and 2) I was lead to believe that I would be allowed to do overtime. Doing the numbers, even a few extra hours a week of overtime would make the difference. we have a 37.5 hour work week. If i worked even 42 hours a week, it would make a drastic improvement to my bottom line. 

The first time I went 30 minutes over my weekly time (it was my first week and I missed an unpaid lunch break because I didn't know how it worked yet) and I got a message telling me I had to redo my time sheet to reflect a 37.5 hour week, and that I could just go home 30 minutes early one day the next week. So there wasn't any wage theft, but it was VERY clearl I would not be getting any over time. 

So now, I'm paying 850 dollar a month in private student loans, and federal loans are coming up next year in like february. I won't be able to afford them. 

I'm not going to go the route of making a case for why I'm WORTH more money. I'm a ""programmer level 2"" at my work. Its technically a 2 year experience position but they gave it to me with 0. the compensation range is 28.5k to 59k. 

I organically steered a conversation with my boss a few weeks ago towards programmer level 3, and he said that it was a 5 year experience position, and that he could probably get hr to approve it after 2. I cannot wait 2 years. 

I can't even wait to hit my 6 months (I started in june so I'm coming up on my 5 months in a few days). I certainly cannot wait until whenever they do yearly reviews (I requested a manual review once after 3 months and my boss indicated my performance was satisfactory (he said if I had a clone he'd hire the clone). 

My boss when he hired me pushed for the most money hr would allow him to pay me. Since the position was for 2 years of experience and I had 0, the most he could get was 45k (minimum was 28). 

Max is 59. 

I don't want to go the route of ""i'm worth this much because...."". I want to be honest with him. After taxes I make 2800 dollars a month on average, but because of the 14 day pay period, I maybe have more or less paychecks on any given month so some months I'll only get 2400. 1000 dollar's I pay on rent alone. Factor in 850 a month on loans, 400 on groceries (I live in a high cost of living city and am starting out in my first apartment, there are a lot of necessary first time transactions. I can't afford to buy in bulk either or food will be wasted). 

I was going back and forth on whether or not I should apply somewhere else, get an offer, and use that to leverage my boss for a promotion. I don't really know if that's a good idea. that might come across aggressive. I like this place. Good work life balance, I actually learn shit (which I was afraid I wouldn't). Tasks are created for me to bolster my skillset. 

I don't want to just walk into my boss's office. We have a good rapport and I'm not particularly a nervous person, but I don't want to put him on the spot, and I want to be able to make my entire case before he can respond. I know it might not be up to him. 

Is there anything else I should do? Should I reconsider all of this? Any advice?"

I was fortunate enough to secure a full time job (fully remote) and started working in June 2021. 

This job has nothing to do with my major but I will say that they trained me very well and I have become more confident with completing the projects/tasks. I will also say my colleagues, supervisors, and leadership are truly nice. The work environment has def made the transition a bit more manageable. 

But, I am still struggling! I thought college stressed me out but this is a different level. Everyday the thought of quitting comes to mind because I get so overwhelmed with all the work. The company size is smaller so we all wear diff hats which can be a lot. I thought from the job description that would be all that I would do, but I have had so many things added to my plate. But being as unqualified as I am with no experience and they still offered me the job, I feel like I have to prove myself. Many times I am working into the night (sometimes past midnight), skipping my lunch break and working on weekends. 

Now, I have worked part time jobs while in high school and I worked a paid marketing internship while in college. But the most hours I’ve done a week is no more than 30, and it was never this demanding.

Also, I feel as though I kind of rushed into this lifestyle since I graduated from college 2 years early. I did dual enrollment in high school which I am grateful to have been able to do but also wish I could still be in school like my friends and peers. It’s like I’m missing out and I just got shoved into adulthood prematurely. 

Lately, I have been trying to determine whether I would like to go to graduate school to maybe give myself more time to just be a young college student. But I think about the debt I would obtain and also how I now have bills that I am now responsible for so I feel like I’m stuck here. Which is why I’d like to know from others how long it took you to navigate and become accommodated in the “9-5pm lifestyle”?"

I've been really fortunate to land some great opportunities for the summer, and I wanted to see what you all think which would be the better option between these two. I should mention I'm a sophomore so return offers aren't the biggest biggest deal.

Amazon:

pros:

\- Huge org means lots of opportunity to land on an something pretty unique / ML related (which I'm really interested in)

\- Resume value pretty hard to beat (even though this sub memes it)

\- I'm from the Bay Area and would love to work in the Bay (hopefully full-time too)

cons:

\- Huge org so no real guarantee what I'll work on

\- Experiences are really team dependent

\- Hard to say if my work will have real impact with such a large organization

&amp;#x200B;

Datadog:

Pros:

\- cute mascot :P

\- I've never been to NYC and it sounds like so much fun in the summer

\- product is limited to \~5 teams, so I think I have a pretty good idea what I'll be able to work on / easy to switch to something that might grab my attention

Cons:

\- I won't really know that many ppl in NYC

\- pays just slightly less than Amazon

\- I really like ML and I'm fairly certain DDog's focus isn't on ML (whereas I've heard from others that Amazon interns get to work more with ML)

\- It is smaller than amazon, should I not really enjoy the experience I think it would be harder to move to different company after Amazon.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel a little guilty posting this because I know it sucks reading this while you're still grinding for your first offer so I just wanted to again say I'm super grateful to be in this position and say to anybody reading you got this! Thanks everyone! :)

I'm not that knowledgeable about the tech world, hoping some past interns or people with knowledge can give some input: thankfully, I was fortunate enough to receive an internship offer at Bloomberg and MongoDB for the upcoming summer. Same pay, and each company has both a big NYC office and a small SF office (probably fewer interns there, too). If you had the choice, to which company and location would you go and why?

Biggest logistical difference is that Bloomberg is in-person 3 days per week, remote 2, while MongoDB is fully in-person.

This post is more for venting but any advice would be helpful!

I started my first CS job doing development several months ago and I'm still really struggling. I was hired on knowing that I had no knowledge in ReactJS and that was perfectly fine. When I started I took a crash course in React. I then began working on bugs for several months without using any of the course knowledge. 

Ever since I have been given tickets to actually build code I have been struggling to complete them. 75% of the time I'm staring at my screen wondering what the hell is even going on because I just can't wrap my head around the code and the issues I'm having. I feel like I have been heavily relying on my team to walk me through errors and bugs to the point where I'm thinking they're starting to get frustrated with me.

I sometimes go 24 hours without a response to a question. In the time gap I google and watch every video possible to help with my issue. I have gotten to the point where I'm working 10-11 hours a day to get tickets completed on time and sometimes it still isn't enough. It's really starting affecting life outside of work whether I'm tired or constantly on edge because of how frustrating it can be struggling all day with no progress made. 

I know to watch out for imposter syndrome and have been able to recognize that this isn't the case. I know this because tickets that should be taking half a sprint are taking me 1.5-2 sprints to complete which is unacceptable. I could probably finish them much quicker if I had access to faster responses but then I'm worried I'll be relying on others more than I already am.

After all the hard work of graduating in the top of my class, going through several internships, and working so hard to land this job, it all feels like it was a waste of time and that I'm in over my head. 

What are your thoughts/comments?"

I learned a lot from this sub throughout the past few years, so I wanted to give back a little.

### Stats

Let me start by sharing my stats to ground the discussion:

University: UC Berkeley (Senior)

GPA: 3.92/4.00

Past Experience:

* Sophomore year: Household name non-tech company (think big bank, retail store, etc.) 
* Junior year: Local Series-B no-name startup

Alongside the above information, I had a year of TAing at Berkeley (1 semester for our DS class and another for the Discrete Math + Prob class) and a year of research. 

### Application Numbers

Here is how the 2022 job search panned out: 

* Applied: 121
* OA received: 42
* Phone screens: 19
* Onsites: 8
* Offers: 7 (5 new from onsites, 2 conversions from internships)
* Withdrew: 17 (stopped moving forward through the recruiting process because I already had offers which I knew I would take over the company I was withdrawing from)

### New Offers

**Google (Accepted)**

Compensation: 

* Base: $131k
* RSU: $170k (negotiated up from $125k using FB, L3 standard is $100k) (33/33/22/12)

* Relocation: $8.4k
* TC Year 1: $217k

Recruiting Process:

* Initial Application: End of August (with referral)
* OA: Received the OA end of Sep
 * Got 1 question completely correct (they have hidden tests but I felt pretty confident in it)
 * Couldn't figure out how to solve the other question so gave brute force solution
* Onsite: Had onsite scheduled for mid Oct
 * Had 5 interviews (1x30min behavioral and 4x45min technical) in one day
 * 2 of the technicals had 2 questions each (with followups) (all mediums), got optimal for all
 * The remaining two had 1 question each (with followup), got optimal for one (medium difficulty)
 * For the other, it was really hard in my mind since it tested combinatorial logic. Needed a *lot* of help from the interviewer to get the 'trick', after that the actual code was trivial since it was just a math problem.
 * Except for that outlier, a lot of graph/tree based questions
* Offer: 
 * After the onsite, was moved on to the hiring team 1 day later (asked them to hurry since had FB deadline pending)
 * One week later, was asked to fill form for product matching
 * One week later, received the offer, took a few days to negotiate using FB

### Leetcode

In terms of Leetcode prep, here is my distribution of questions practiced: 

* Easy: 50
* Medium: 104
* Hard: 11
* Unique Total Questions: 165
* Overall Total Questions: 231 (since did some common questions multiple times)

In terms of practice, I started with the Blind 75, did some of the most frequent ones from the Top 100 list by LC itself, and then the remaining ones were when I grinded for specific companies using their tagged questions (using LC Premium).

With regards to the interview process, I specifically grinded for Google and FB only. For FB, LC was king: I had 2 questions in my phone screen and 2x4 questions for my onsite for a total of 10 questions (and each had a follow up verbal question). Out of these 10, 9 of them were *directly* from the most frequent FB questions on LC (somewhere in the ~ top 30-40). Hence, grinding these questions out before the interviews was immensely helpful. 

In comparison, for Google, the tagged list was absolutely useless. None of them were related to the most frequently listed ones, and not a single question I was asked in any of my Google interviews (OA or onsite) was something I had seen before (either in Blind, top 100, or anywhere else).

### Lessons Learned

Now that I've described everything, here are some lessons I learned during this interview process:

* I know some people say that referrals don't really matter, but in my personal experience, referrals were extremely helpful. I only asked for referrals from 6 companies from my friends and ended up getting to at least the phone screen stage for all 6 of them. 
* In terms of LC, here's something I learned throughout the past few months: the process is *insanely* daunting in the beginning. Throughout college, every year I would tell myself that I need to grind LC to get the good internships, but every time I would start, I would struggle so hard with just the 'easy' questions and it felt absolutely soul-crashing + demoralizing. This continued until last summer where a switch just flipped in my head and I realized I needed to do something or I would graduate without a good job and so I just started with Blind 75. I didn't think what was 'optimal' or if there was a 'better' resource etc because according to my past experience, I would research and find all these amazing LC resources but never really stick to doing the actual questions, making them moot. This time, I did a single question every day, no matter what else I had to do, no matter how busy I was (if I was really busy, I just did a quick easy question I had already done before in 15-20 min). I did it first thing in the morning right after breakfast so that I could get it done early on and stop worrying about it. After a month or two, I slowly internalized the patterns and it was insane how I started figuring out what I needed to do for specific types of questions. Hence, for anyone struggling with LC, my advice is to give something similar to what I did above a try and see if that might help :)
* Sites like AngelList and TripleByte are really helpful if you're applying for smaller scale start ups. Considering how fast the process to apply is on these sites (sometimes literally one click), I found out that I received a surprisingly high percentage of responses. They allow you to set your preferences (such as really early stage - 5-10 people - startups or established ones etc) so you can tailor it to what you're looking for. In the end, quite a few of them reached out to me through Email/LinkedIn etc to schedule phone screens and onsites.
* See if your university has a policy regarding offer deadlines: Berkeley CS has a policy of recommending companies to allow up to Nov 1st for offer deadlines. I found out that if a company gives an offer deadline earlier than that, you can let them know about the policy and they will typically respect it. I was able to use it to get an extension for Amazon and my friends used it to get extensions for some other firms as well (be aware though that some companies straight up don't give a fuck though e.g. Microsoft told my friend to confirm their decision by mid Sep or fuck off)
* In terms of negotiations, I would highly recommend reading some of the popular posts out there ([this](https://haseebq.com/my-ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer/) one is quite commonly cited) since I was not aware of a lot of the subtle things recruiters due to swing the conversation in their favor. While both FB and Amazon stone-walled me with their no-negotiation policy, the lessons learned reading these posts were quite helpful when negotiating my Google offer (although I assume having a competing FB offer to match played the largest role)
* One thing I realized throughout the interview process was that your interviewer makes a world of difference. A good interviewer can literally be the deciding factor between acing an interview and completely bombing it. There were some interviews where the interviewer was so articulate, so clear in their explanation, and knew exactly the right amount of nudges to give when I got stuck that interviewing with them was a breeze. On the other hand, I also had interviews where I could clearly see that the interviewer had difficulty even understanding what I was trying to tell them, seemed completely disinterested, was extremely dogmatic by focusing on one single solution and constantly fishing for it, rejecting everything else. The worst were interviewers who were completely unresponsive, where I would try to engage with them and discuss my thought processes and feel as if I was talking to a brick wall: they would either stay silent the entire time or give one syllable answers. These interviews were really hard to get through - even when I knew the correct answer, I would second guess myself, I would be unclear about the requirements of the questions/the constraints imposed, I would be unsure of what they wanted me to return, all because we simply weren't on the same wavelength in terms of communication. 

### Mentality

Mentality is everything: one thing I realized throughout this recruiting process was that the way you mentally approach it is immensely influential. I'll share my personal experience in the hope that it might help some of you out. In my group of friends, I'm the 'dumb' one. I've never been bothered by embracing that label since I realized all the way back in high school that there is always someone smarter/better. However, it is a fact that all of my friends are much more accomplished career-wise: I remember sitting with three of my friends in our dorms in freshman year at the end of the Fall semester and each of them had an upcoming internship next semester at Facebook, Google, and Amazon respectively (literally, I'm not making it up, straight up those 3 lol). In one way this is good because it encourages you to be better yourself and enables you to struggle more to overcome your past self. However, if any of you are in this position, I would urge you caution since - at least in my case - it ended up being a hindrance as it made me believe that you needed to be an absolutely insane person to get offers from these popular companies. Hell, maybe that even is true, but the result of that mentality was that I *had already given up before I had started*. Throughout sophomore year and junior year, I didn't bother applying to these places when there applications came out since I thought there was no point and only applied really late (think March/April) since then I could delude myself into the argument that I only got rejected because I had applied so late. If any of you have caught yourself doing these kind of mental gymnastics, I would highly urge you to take a deep breath, embrace that *really* uncomfortable feeling of putting yourself out there and risking rejection, and still apply. This year, I kept track of when applications got released for popular firms and applied as soon as they came out, resulting in a response rate that is night and day from my previous one (obviously, considering how late I was previously applying). Anyways, sorry for rambling, but at the end I just wanted to share my personal experience in case someone can relate to some of it and if so, can seek encouragement from it :) 

Since we're on the topic of mentality, another factor that I think was really important and extremely helpful during the recruiting process was exercise: I suffer quite heavily from depression and anxiety (have been clinically diagnosed since freshman year) and I remember going through my FB interview. I went in extremely anxious since it was my first time doing an onsite for a company of FBs level and it ended up being this 3hr long slug fest that drained the life out of me. By the end of it, I was shaking from the adrenaline rush and just in really weird state. I decided to go out for a run and ended up just running and running until I had vented out all the anxiety and pressure and gotten back to normal. Hence, for those of you who can relate to such experiences, I would highly advise having something similar, a kind of 'vent' that you can use to release this build up of emotions during this highly stressful time, regardless of what it is. For me it was exercise, for you it could be reading a book, playing an instrument, losing yourself in a video game, whatever, have something where you can sink into the mindlessness of the activity and calm yourself down again, it helps a lot. 

### Conclusion

Anyways, I hope this insanely long post has helped some of you out. I don't really know if all of it will be relevant to everybody, but hopefully you will find some parts of it resonate with your own experiences, and you'll be able to take those parts and make something out of them. In the end, I personally tied off my 2022 new grad search by accepting my Google offer a few days ago. It boiled down to FB vs Google in my case and I found it to be quite a hard decision since working at either company was a dream come true for last year me. I went with Google because after all the constant struggles I've been through in college, I'm hoping to take it a bit easier after graduation and I heard Google has a slightly better work life balance. However, for those of you who are interested in working on really cool stuff and climbing through the promotions ladder fast, most people I've talked to recommend FB as the ideal place for that. 

Another reason why I chose Google was because I'm an international student, and I've read on Blind that FB is having some immigration issues with some law case of theirs stuck in limbo, so for international students, I would recommend doing your due diligence and making sure to pick the company that aligns with your future plans. 

Hope the post helped, please feel free to ask questions in the comments :)"

I learned a lot from this sub throughout the past few years, so I wanted to give back a little.

### Stats

Let me start by sharing my stats to ground the discussion:

University: UC Berkeley (Senior)

GPA: 3.92/4.00

Past Experience:

* Sophomore year: Household name non-tech company (think big bank, retail store, etc.) 
* Junior year: Local Series-B no-name startup

Alongside the above information, I had a year of TAing at Berkeley (1 semester for our DS class and another for the Discrete Math + Prob class) and a year of research. 

### Application Numbers

Here is how the 2022 job search panned out: 

* Applied: 121
* OA received: 42
* Phone screens: 19
* Onsites: 8
* Offers: 7 (5 new from onsites, 2 conversions from internships)
* Withdrew: 17 (stopped moving forward through the recruiting process because I already had offers which I knew I would take over the company I was withdrawing from)

### New Offers

**Google (Accepted)**

Compensation: 

* Base: $131k
* RSU: $170k (negotiated up from $125k using FB, L3 standard is $100k) (33/33/22/12)

 * For the other, it was really hard in my mind since it tested combinatorial logic. Needed a *lot* of help from the interviewer to get the 'trick', after that the actual code was trivial since it was just a math problem.
 * Except for that outlier, a lot of graph/tree based questions
* Offer:

I am about to finish my first semester this year mostly learning HTML and CSS language and just have been recently learning Karel. Next semester will include JavaScript and more in depth courses. I just need advice, I feel that maybe I’m not cut out for the job and would like some feedback from anyone who may be familiar with this type of job."

Overall I like my team, and the job isn't horrible, but the work is a lot slower than I expected and the code quality is a little iffy sometimes. I feel like if I stay in this role I'm going to stagnate and the longer I stay the more I'm cheating myself out of experience. 

Not only that, the cost of living in my area is rising significantly (rent went up 20% across my region in one year despite Covid) and I know my company most likely won't be able to give me a cost of living increase that even scratches the surface of that. I like this area and really don't want to get priced out...

I recently had a FAANG recruiter in my area reach out to me and I have my first round technical interview with them in a couple of weeks. Despite studying I'm not expecting much to come of that, but hey maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised? 

So far, I'm looking through job postings and it's pretty hard to find roles for people like me who have about a year to a year and a half's experience. (if you count my internship it's a little over a year and a half total I think) Most junior-ish postings are expecting about 2-3 years of experience. I'm only a year out from graduation right now -- would it be too late to apply to new grad roles?

My current (uneducated) choice is between Haskell and C. 

I’ve written down bullet points to help organize my thoughts, and I was wondering if anyone could share their thoughts on what to learn first and correct me if any of my thoughts are biased. I would really appreciate it!

**Here’s a little context for me first:**

* On a gap year before entering college as freshman next year
* Have done Java as part of intro to CS class + Python for majority of projects (overall \~3 yrs of coding experience)
* Interested in pursuing Machine Learning / ML Systems

**My short term goal:**

* Push outside my comfort zone and gain a deeper understanding/practices in programming
* Prepare myself for rigorous CS curriculums I’ll soon face
* Hopefully, gain a small advantage in resume screenings when I apply for DevOps/MLOps internships after sophomore year.

**Why Haskell?**

* The idea of Functional Programming itself interests me, and many have said it’s a great way to push outside the comfort zone and understand more deeply about ‘programming’
* I’ve heard many companies use Haskell for their “low-latency, high-volume database access”
* Project Ideas: Map-reduce?

**Why C? (Or maybe C++)**

* Learning C will expose me to more fundamental inner workings of computer systems.
* As I am interested in ML Systems, I’ve heard “writing highly performant/error-proof systems-level code” is an essential skill to have/practice
* Project Ideas: Database, Distributed File System"
qpyunp,1,2021-11-09,Salary (Raise vs Job Offer) Advice,0aky_Afterbirth_,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qpyunp/salary_raise_vs_job_offer_advice/,"I currently work as a software engineer for a small/medium-sized DoD tech contractor in Huntsville, Alabama.

I have worked for this company since graduation (B.S.) first as an intern, then as full-time.

I have been working there for 2.5 years. When I was first promoted to full-time, my base pay was $60K. At the time, I was living/working in Mississippi (low cost of living). After about 1 year there, I was offered a transfer to the company’s office in Huntsville for a raise to $70K, although TBH in hindsight this was little more than a cost of living pay adjustment.

Since then, I have received 3% and 4% annual performance increases during performance review cycle, the most recent of which was only a month ago, which lands my current salary at roughly $75K.

I cannot help but think that I am now being payed below market value. I have received excellent performance reviews, and I have taken on a fair bit of responsibility over the last year. I would probably think that I should speak with my supervisor about a raise, but seeing as I just received a raise a month ago and hadn’t asked for a raise then, I’m just not sure whether there’s a good way to do this.

I have also put in some applications elsewhere and have an interview scheduled later in the week and am hoping I can get an offer for around $85K-$90K. But I’m very happy at my current job and would only be moving for the money. So I suppose I could leverage any offers for a raise, but that feels a bit icky, considering I hadn’t asked my employer for a raise beforehand.

Any advice from those of you who have been in a similar position?"

I am an engineering undergraduate located in Australia. I will be taking 5 years to do what normally is a 4 year degree because I failed a subject in 2019 and had to redo it last year (where I landed a high distinction). Since then I was able to score two internships and made significant contributions to student clubs (astronomy and rocketry).

Despite all my progress, graduating late just cuts deep because I used to be a gifted kid in primary school and high school with a 91.45 ATAR back in 2017 and just seeing all the social media posts of my friends and classmates graduating makes me depressed.

I have this feeling that 2017 was the best year of my life and always will be. In 2017, I was near the best of my nation's high school cohort with a 91.45 percentile score (ATAR of 91.45) in my final year of high school, went to formal (prom) with my crush at the time, and had hope for the future."

I am a medical graduate from Lebanon and i have a work offer from a hospital in Germany. This requires the german Approbation and i am applying via the Gutachten route to have my file studied for degree equivalence.
A lot of documents required need to be legalized before submission.
My question is the following: i am traveling within 10 days and the Legalisierung process requires 10 days  at the German Embassy in Lebanon. Can i legalize the documents by a German Notary instead of at the embassy? My documents have been stamped by the relevant ministries in Lebanon.
The documents are:
- my MD diploma
- a transcript of records
- my birth certificate
- my Lebanese work permit
- internship certificate(s)
- clear criminal record
If i can legalize in Deutschland ill just travel with the documents instead of sending them by post later.

Thank you!"

Parts of java that I know are:  
 \- The common things you learn in every ""&lt;programming language&gt; tutorial for beginners"". (I think it's called programming fundamentals?)

 \- Object Oriented Programming Concepts. Not just theoretical knowledge but also practices making random programs that uses these concepts.

 \- I have solved multiple numeric, string, and matrix processing problems from coding challenge websites ( still can't pass most of medium from LeetCode though).

 \- I have also tried making random programs using the swing library such as calculator, clock, and a simple library management system program.

Looking at the job responsibilities, I realized that I tick most of the boxes except the years of experience required for the position. Regardless of that, I brought that up in the interview and expressed my willingness to be considered for Senior role. I told them how I pretty much do most of the things asked from a Senior person. They thanked me for being upfront about this and asked if I will be able to come to the site for the second round of interviews. A couple days after, I wrote a thank you email to them for their time and for especially considering me for the Senior role too. After 10 days, I wrote an email to the Technical Recruiter (she wasn't present in the interview) if they they had moved on with other candidates as I already had another job offer on the table and I would like to know their decision. She didn't reply back. Today I saw the Intermediate position is reposted, Senior position is still open. A dude that used to work for this company told me how it took them a month to get back to him.

It starts with a transitional program designed to divorce society from capitalist relations altogether...

*The capitalist system is at the root of the poverty, racism, instability, violence, and humiliation the exploited and oppressed face every day. To solve these problems, we fight for a workers’ government based on the program below.* [www.socialistrevolution.org](https://www.socialistrevolution.org/)

For class independence—break immediately with the Democrats and Republicans

Build a mass working-class socialist party armed with a revolutionary program that breaks with capitalism. Organized labor has the numbers and resources to effectively challenge Trumpism and the parties of the ruling class. By mobilizing the working-class majority in the workplace, unions, streets, and at the polls, we can fight and win against the bosses.

Rebuild the labor movement through militant class struggle

All workers should have the right to strike and join a union—organize the unorganized! Repeal all antiunion laws, including Taft-Hartley. No to multi-tier contracts, concessions, and give-backs! All union officials to be regularly elected by the membership with the right of immediate recall, and receive no more than the average wage of a skilled worker.

End unemployment—quality jobs for all

The right to a secure, full-time job with full benefits or a place in education. For a twenty-hour workweek with no loss in pay and a national minimum wage of $1,000 per week. Unemployment and Social Security benefits to be paid at full wages. Abolish temp work and unpaid internships. For a massive program of useful public works to create millions of quality union jobs to rebuild and expand public infrastructure, transportation, and housing. Wages to be tied to inflation through periodic cost of living adjustments. For union control over hiring and firing and the establishment of job training and hiring halls in areas with high unemployment. Voluntary retirement at age 55 with full benefits.

Quality, affordable housing for all

End the capitalist housing market, which leads to overcrowding, gentrification, and homelessness. Rent for all housing to be fixed at not more than 10% of wages, as part of a voluntary, socialized plan. Nationalize foreclosed and vacant homes, to be allocated to those in need under democratic public control. For an immediate and indefinite moratorium on evictions, with residents of foreclosed properties allowed to stay in their homes. No compensation to the foreclosing owners, except in cases of proven need.

Universal, quality health care

For a socialized health care system free at the point of service. Nationalize the health insurance, medical equipment, and pharmaceutical industries, the hospital networks and related clinics, and integrate them into a unified, democratically administered public health provider. Free scientific research from the profit motive and ensure universal access to the latest medical technologies, treatments, and discoveries, and expand accessibility to accommodate those with disabilities. Massively fund research to prevent and combat epidemics and disease.

Quality, lifelong education for all

Fully fund and expand public schools, colleges, and universities. Nationalize the private universities and colleges and merge them into a unified public education system. Abolish tuition and fees and cancel student debt. Provide students with at least $1,000 per week through living grants and paid internships. No to means testing, vouchers, charter schools, privatization, and corporate influence in the classroom.

Fight against all forms of discrimination—equal rights for all

Equal pay for work of equal value. Full paid leave for expectant mothers after the first trimester and parental leave with full pay for up to two years after birth or adoption. Free, full-time, high-quality childcare facilities and after-school programs. For affordable public laundry services and subsidized restaurants serving healthy, quality food to help free working women from domestic servitude. Full reproductive rights up to and including abortion. No to discrimination on the basis of gender identity, expression, or sexual orientation. For genuine freedom of assembly and expression—defend civil rights and liberties! Nationalize the means of communication and democratize access to the media and meeting spaces on the basis of proportional representation.

An injury to one is an injury to all! Fight racism with class struggle!

For the unity of the working class—mobilize the labor movement to combat sexism, racism, police terror, and mass incarceration. Reparations for centuries of slavery, colonialism, exploitation, and oppression can only be achieved by expropriating the capitalists and building socialism. Abolish the death penalty and release all political prisoners. No to walls, militarization, deportation centers, and repression at the border. End all racist immigration and asylum controls. No to temporary “guest worker” programs. For immediate and unconditional legalization: Full rights and amnesty for undocumented workers and their families. For family reunification and an immediate end to raids and deportations. Recognize the tribal sovereignty of American Indian Nations.

Only class struggle can combat the climate crisis

For an immediate transition to clean energy—retool the economy to ensure a safe and healthy habitat for generations to come. Massively fund research to develop climate change mitigation strategies and new production techniques. Paid retraining and guaranteed employment for displaced workers with no reduction in wages or benefits. Public ownership and control over land, mining, logging, transport, oil, gas, and other energy and natural resources. For a socialized plan of production for agriculture—nationalize the food distribution and agrochemical giants that endanger public health and nutrition in the pursuit of profits. Protect small farmers and agricultural workers’ job security. Fully fund nutrition assistance and extension programs.

Nationalize the key levers of the economy: the major banks, corporations, and industries

Break with the irrational chaos of the capitalist free market. No to austerity and privatization—make the billionaires pay for the crisis of their system! Consolidate the banking sector into a unified, publicly owned and administered entity to protect workers’ savings and guarantee affordable loans to all. All nationalized companies to be run under democratic workers’ control and management, integrated into a socialist plan of production to meet the needs of society.

Socialist internationalism and world revolution

No to imperialist intervention anywhere in the world. For international economic cooperation based on solidarity and the interests of the workers of the world, not a handful of multinationals. Abolish all capitalist trade and bankers’ agreements and write off the debts imposed by imperialism. Slash the military budget and invest instead in social needs. Unite with Canadian and Latin American workers in a Socialist Federation of the Americas as part of a World Socialist Federation."

**LORs:**

Physics Teacher - 9/10, She’s pretty chill with me during class, and I’ve used CS in her class as well as use the physics she taught with CS in my robotics team. She knows the CS/physics related stuff I’ve done and believe she thinks highly of me.

External Recommender (Robotics Coach) - 10/10, I’ve done a lot on the team and believe he wrote a really good rec letter. He is aware of both my technical skill and soft (presentational, organizational, etc.) skills and am pretty sure he wrote about them in the letter.

English Teacher - 6-7/10, I had her the year of COVID and didn’t participate much in her class. I don’t know what she will write about, but I know she won’t say anything bad. She has a reputation of pumping out good rec letters despite not knowing the student, based on my “brag sheet”.

Counselor - 5/10, I don’t know her at all and have had minimal contact with her. Don’t know what she is writing about, so that is why I’m placing this rec at a 5/10, not because it could be bad but just because 5/10 is halfway between shit and amazing and I don’t know where she will stand.

**Essays:**

Personal Statement - wrote about a sort of “cliche” topic, transitioning from middle school to high school. But I wrote it as a back and forth dialogue between me &lt;redacted&gt; (also using the &lt;redacted&gt; as a metaphor), showing anecdotes of my academic and social “opening up”. I believe the delivery of the message is unique, even though the topic is not much so.  


For the sake of time I’ll only put Stanford Essays here, but other schools will revolve around similar themes/spikes:

Most significant challenge society faces: &lt;redacted&gt;

Last two summers: Competing in the robotics state championship, creating websites to cure quarantine-induced-social-isolation by connecting people through the internet, lots of falling down YouTube rabbit holes, cherishing time with friends during late-night group calls, and finding new ones as colleagues at my internship or customers for my business.

Historical moment/event: &lt;redacted&gt;

Briefly elaborate on an EC: wrote about communicating with international clients, creating chatbots to fulfill customer’s requirements, and negotiating, all teaching me interpersonal skills.

One thing you are looking forward to: &lt;redacted&gt;

Reflect on an idea or experience that makes you excited about learning: talked about learning a new language out of boredom/wanting to uncover the strange symbols covering our home city. It was about an opportunity to connect with my culture as well as approach things from a new cultural perspective, and of course continuing to learn new languages as a programmer.

Roommate essay: wrote about my wack asf dreams and literally the word “bruh” and how much I say it. Thought it came across as quirky/friendly.

Something meaningful to you and why: &lt;redacted&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

**RD Colleges:** Carnegie Mellon, MIT, Caltech, Purdue, Cornell, UMich, UC Berkeley, UCLA, Harvey Mudd, and more top CS schools.

Let me know what you guys think, and please be brutally honest. I am targeting UT Austin, UIUC, and Georgia Tech. Everything else is a reach."

I have a 3.6/4.0 GPA and completed four internships and a TA position during my time in college.

My most recent two internships were with a notable (top 5) DoD contractor, and recently they offered me a full time entry-level position for $77k/year. That's about the market average for an entry-level software engineer. For being in the DMV area, I wouldn't consider this bad, but I feel like there's potential to make a lot more (maybe this subreddit has given me some wild ideas). There's also plenty of benefits that come with the position, such as free healthcare and receiving a top-secret security clearance, which could be useful for other positions in the future.

On one hand, I'm really happy that I got this opportunity, but on the other, I feel like I'm being undervalued for that much. I need to make the decision to accept or reject the offer within a few days, so there isn't much time. Should I risk not accepting the offer so I can apply to different companies and hope to score a higher-paying position entry-level position?"

1. **Each candidate, contingent upon the requirements and limitations of the candidate’s selected major and minor degree programs, may schedule courses under the Pass/Fail (PS/PD/UNS) grading system up to a maximum of 7 credits per semester for baccalaureate degree candidates and 7 credits for associate degree candidates during the regular academic (Fall and Spring semester) and 7 credits during the summer semester. Students must retain a minimum of 3 credits of coursework using the standard grading option in any semester. Baccalaureate degree candidates may select no more than 24 credits of pass/fail grading during their undergraduate career regardless of the number of degrees being earned unless there is a three-year period between re-enrollments. Associate degree candidates may schedule no more than 12 credits of pass/fail grading during their undergraduate career regardless of the number of degrees they are earning unless there is a three-year period between re-enrollments.**
2. **A student may choose whether to take a course using a standard or pass/fail scale at any point during the semester starting from the moment of registration for the course until 11:59 p.m. of the last day of officially scheduled classes for that course, but may at no point be enrolled for more than 7 selected credits of pass/fail grade courses simultaneously.**
3. **The credits for courses utilizing pass/fail grading count towards the semester standing (PS and PD only) but are specifically excluded from counting toward the threshold for admission to administratively controlled majors. Each administratively controlled major has the authority to list courses for which pass/fail grades cannot be used to meet entrance to major requirements. This information must be included in all materials outlining ETM requirements. In addition, where external bodies may require letter grades, departments may place restrictions on individual courses within their programs that cannot be taken for a pass/fail grade. This information must be included in all materials outlining applicable program requirements.**
4. **Standard grades for all students will be submitted by the instructor to the Office of the University Registrar (A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, D, F) when final grading is completed.**
5. **Where the pass/fail grading option has been selected, grades of A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+ and C will be posted in the final record as PS. These will fulfill any stipulated “C or better” grade requirements throughout the PSU curriculum and earn the designated number of PSU course credits but will not be factored into the student’s GPA.**
6. **Where the pass/fail option has been selected, the grade D will be posted in the final record as a PD. The course will not fulfill any C or better requirement, but will still count as PSU credits and may still fulfill curricular requirements where a C or better grade is not stipulated. The course will not be factored into the student’s GPA.**
7. **Where the pass/fail option has been selected, the grade F (Fail) will post in the final record as UNS. No PSU credits for the course will be earned and it will not count toward any degree satisfaction requirements. The grade will not be factored into the student’s GPA.**
8. **A student who has received an academic sanction through established university procedures as a result of a violation of academic integrity will not be permitted to select or apply pass/fail grading for that course.**
9. **Any student may file a petition to faculty senate to retroactively reverse a pass/fail grading option selection at any point until the last day of the designated final examination period for the semester in which they graduate. providing that this this change does not violate other semester or other undergraduate career alternative grading caps.**
10. **Students are strongly advised to research and consider all implications that selection of the pass/fail grading option may have upon entrance to major requirements, major, minor, general education and other degree requirements, honor roll, scholarship and graduation distinctions, graduation school applications, job and internship applications, and any other scenarios in which academic records may impact future life scenarios. Students should always work with academic advisers (whether faculty or primary-role) within their respective college, campus, or unit as well as with career and graduate school counselors and others student support professionals in considering use of the pass/fail grading option.**

I'm looking for some guidance on evaluating full-time offers from Edmonton-based companies. Most of my recent experience has been interning in the US (Bay Area &amp; NYC) and an applied ML grad internship in Toronto, so I am not as up-to-date on what to expect here in Edmonton. There's less data publicly available for Canadian companies than American ones, and even less for earlier startups. The explosion of remote roles from American and non-Alberta companies has also changed offers in the last year. I am currently exploring a number of opportunities, most HQ'd in Edmonton or at least Alberta, at earlier stage startups (seed round to Series A with 2\~15 engineers/scientists). The roles would be either ML Ops/Eng or backend/systems/infra software engineering roles.

**About me:**

* BSc Hon. in CS from UAlberta, MSc in CS (Machine Learning) from UofT
* Experience (0 years FT, \~2.5 years intern/summers)
   * 5 months of post-MSc applied ML internships (Toronto)
   * 18 months of undergrad SE internships (NYC, Bay Area, Edmonton)
   * 9 months admin/IT summer jobs (Edmonton)

**Questions:**

* Salary range?
   * I'm hoping for CA$90\~110k/yr but honestly can't tell if that is ridiculous or not.
* Equity?
   * I feel like Canadian tech startups often don't offer equity. Meanwhile, that's a fairly standard if not sizeable portion of TC at American startups.
* How much ""experience"" do I have?
   * Am I allowed to count my internships as experience? For example, when looking at [Levels.fyi](https://Levels.fyi). Other than the IT summer job, I would say that I was working essentially equivalent to an SE1 at Tier 2/just-below-FANG tech companies.
* Title?
   * I feel like *ML Ops Engineer* would align best with my career aspirations, but there are issues with using ""Engineer"" in your title without an Eng degree in Canada. What is typically used instead? *ML Ops Developer* sounds a little off to me.

Happy to add more info if needed, but may ask to do it over DM. So far I've been collecting comparables from GlassDoor and [Levels.fyi](https://Levels.fyi), but would love to have some additional data points to support my case!

EDIT: Just noticed on the rules that salary *sharing* threads are not allowed. Hopefully this post is alright as I'm requesting general guidance on what to expect when negotiating a Canadian, specifically Albertan, offer!"

qqgbe5,0,2021-11-09,Should I relocate or remote?,KickingCrave,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qqgbe5/should_i_relocate_or_remote/,"Hello!

So I got a return job offer with the company I did my internship this past summer. I graduate next month. The internship was remote given that all the company offices were closed and they will be until the end of this year. There will be a decision on if the company offices will open again at the beginning of January. I have the option to move to San Jose, CA or to work remotely next year. I live in the south in the U.S. I am debating if I should move or not. I got offered 120k, along with a relocation bonus. If I stay I can take advantage of the low cost of living I have where I live and be able to save, I'll be able to pay off the 15k student loans I have left too. (I know the salary will be lowered, but still). There is also the part of me that has a strong imposter syndrome and thinks of the worst case scenario. I feel like I didn't even prove myself to get this position, I only wrote like 8 lines of code during the 3 month internship, and no technical questions were in the interview. Plus with classes being online due to COVID these past two years, I feel like I haven't been able to learn everything I should.I was thinking that if some how I don't adjust to the position it would be easier to leave if I am living in my current state.

I also have the option of being remote for a few months and then moving to San Jose. I also tend to get anxious in new environments so I have to take that into account. I feel like if I moved after being remote for a few months it would be kind of overwhelming, having to adjust to work and a new city. I am leaning more towards moving, having a month off to get the hang of the city and then starting the position.

I know for a fact that I want to move at some point, that's not up for debate, it is a matter of when. It's either before I start the position or a few months into being in the position remotely.

This will be my first professional job and keep in mind I have lived my whole life in the south.

I am a little nervous about this transition none the less. I am the first in my family to graduate high school, let alone college.

Any tips or suggestions are appreciated!

I've mostly just been applying for internships - would companies care if I apply for their full-time positions at the same time? For companies that have rejected me from internships, should I wait before applying for full-time again at those same companies? I know that many companies have a 6 month or 1 year period that they tell you to wait before applying again."

My frustration comes from applying to jobs and seeing that there aren’t really any entry level jobs in IT other than help desk. There’s nothing wrong with Helpdesk but I just spent 4 years studying. If I knew I wouldn’t have went to school and just done help desk you know. 

These companies are also looking for 3-5 years of experience for entry level roles and it’s really depressing. 


I’ve applied to hundreds of seemingly entry level admin jobs but to no luck. 

Now I’m asking for advice from admins/engineers on what to do so that I can secure a decent job before graduation. 

Are there any roles that would help me launch my career?"

I support the school, town hall, police, fire, etc. I went to a technical high school for IT, earned my TestOut PC pro, Network Pro, and Security Pro (the CompTIA equivalent my school offered) and did an internship my senior year, doing simple things like workstation deployment. I got my current job at the end of high school, and have been there for about a year and a half. My work duties vary from simple password resets, account set up and workstation deployment, to group policy, OU set up, basic PowerShell scripting and VLAN set up. Basically due to the small team we have ( 1 director, 1 sys admin, and 2 techs) my hands can end up on most things tech related. Although I love my job, there is 2 issues. One being there is no room to move up, as the people above me have the intention of staying for another 10+ years, and the pay. As it stands, I currently make about 31k a year, in the Worcester MA area. Come next summer, I'll be looking for another job. What can I do to increase my chances. I'm currently studying for the Microsoft Windows Server Hybrid Administrator Associate cert. I'd like to be in the sys admin/ azure realm. Many thanks."

qqhg31,8,2021-11-09,Entry Level GIS Career Positions,SeaNoname,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/qqhg31/entry_level_gis_career_positions/,"Hi all, I am a student majoring in GIS who will be graduating in December. I am also minoring in Computer Science, and I have a decent background with programming.

My goal is to get into a GIS Developer position as software development with a side of GIS is what I am into. However, I doubt I have enough experience to apply to GIS Developer positions out of college. I have a good amount of experience with Python and writing scripts (from an internship), a good understanding of databases and SQL, knowledge of HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript including some small projects under my belt. That's about it when it comes to my ""developer"" experience.

My question is: how far am I from being ready to apply for a GIS Developer position? What else can I work on to prepare myself to be a desired GIS Developer?

Right now, it looks like I will be looking for GIS Analyst and GIS Specialist positions before I graduate and working towards a GIS Developer position in my free time. How long did it take you to get to a Developer role after graduation? Is it unrealistic to try to find one out of graduation or as a second job?"
qqhppn,76,2021-11-09,Starting to feel like I'm not smart enough to become a Software engineer/Developer,techgirl8,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/qqhppn/starting_to_feel_like_im_not_smart_enough_to/,"So I recently switched my major from computer technology and security to Computer Science with  one year left of college to get my BS. Just like 1 month ago, I decided I wanted to do a job that involves programming. This just came out of the blue. I always thought I sucked at math so I never pursued it before and avoided programming classes.(Although I do have prior experience in C++ and web design) I came to realize that it isn't all math. I actually enjoy learning code and I feel like it's a really awesome skill to have. I have fun doing it and look forward to it. 

Anyways, I was all motivated for this whole month since I switched my major and I've been programming every single day not just in my college classes but also on my free time(I also work 40 hrs a week). I am just getting frustrated because it takes me forever to solve a simple problem. I just started realizing how long it takes me. Even though my python professor says Im one of the best in the class and I get all A's. I just feel like I need to be a lot better at solving problems in order to get into this industry. I need to be able to make a project on my own without instructions or an output that it is supposed to look like. There is so much competition and I worry about putting my all into this and still not understanding it when I graduate in Dec of 2022. Plus I'm already 30 and going to be 31 when I graduate and I know there is ageism in tech. I feel like im on a time limit. 

I just wish I was smarter and could pick things up faster. Really need to keep my motivation up. I'm not giving up I'm just feeling kind of down after I had to look up a solution to a really simple problem today. I am a beginner even though I'm going to graduate in a year. I also need to do an internship before I graduate but I feel like I am not smart enough for that and I'm not ready yet. I have no choice because I'm running out of time to apply to those before I graduate. Overall I'm just feeling stressed out and sad right now because I feel like when I graduate I won't be able to get a job because I won't be as good as other people will be."
qqkcnj,141,2021-11-09,My 2022 Sophomore Summer Internship Search,a_tired_cs_sophomore,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/qqkcnj/my_2022_sophomore_summer_internship_search/,"Hey everyone,

I saw some other posters sharing how their internship search went for this season so I decided to look back on how my season went too. 

**Resume/Background:**

* Class of 2024 Student at an Ivy League, \~3.9/4.0 GPA
* US Citizen, Male
* Resume: One previous SWE summer internship at a startup, did full stack work in 2-3 personal projects and a student organization
   * I spent a few weeks checking resume format and making sure that there were a good number of keywords and quantitative achievement bullet points throughout my resume - I definitely think this is a worthwhile time investment given that the main bottleneck in sophomore SWE recruiting is getting the interview in the first place

**LeetCode: \~**100 Easy, \~150 Medium, \~20 Hard

**Results:** \~225 applications -&gt; 6 offers

* Facebook, an investment bank, and several decently sized F500 tech companies

Attempted Sankey Diagram: [https://imgur.com/a/l11kb53](https://imgur.com/a/l11kb53)

* I started ignoring some OAs or HireVues once I had offers from or was at the later stage of interviewing with companies I cared more about
* I cancelled 2 finals since I accepted an offer already, although there were other finals that I ended up doing regardless because I wanted interviewing practice

**Timeline:** I started applying around beginning of August and wrapped up recruiting around mid-October to November once I got a few offers. 

I made sure to send in most of my applications (just applied through online portal) during the summer when I had more time so that I would not be overwhelmed during school in the fall. As I went down the [Pitt CSC GitHub repo](https://github.com/pittcsc/Summer2022-Internships), I went through the Blind 75 and then worked my way through [LeetCode Patterns](https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/) (although I did not come close to finishing this list). I did some LeetCode the previous summer (entering college) so I did not start preparing from a blank slate, but redoing some problems and really honing my experience with string manipulation/arrays/etc. helped for OAs and interviews.

Because I had no referrals and I was only applying through online portal everywhere, I expected to have a very low response rate especially since I am still a sophomore, which is what motivated me to apply to at least 200 companies. I was pretty surprised when I got interviews from Facebook and an HFT.

Some important things I've learned along the way:

* Early is always better; doing LeetCode not only early but consistently is important
   * I kept track of questions that I had a bit of trouble doing the first time so I could re-solve them at a later date (spaced repetition). This really helped me improve my implementation speed and accuracy for technical interviews later.
* Start revising your resume around June or July, and not in one sitting because you may be able to catch any minor mistakes or have a new idea of spinning some bullet point better
   * If you are doing an internship that hasn't finished yet, try to gauge the scope of your project (including what technologies will be used) that you will be working on for the remainder of the internship so you can write about it in your resume (I got a sense of this through 1-on-1s with my manager)
* Start applying around August - a few a day should be a good enough pace for now because not that many companies have opened their portals and you should have time to complete any OAs that come your way if school hasn't started yet
   * You should keep in mind that big tech company intern pools mostly get filled up by the end of the year, and you increase your chances of your resume *being looked at* if you apply as soon as the portal comes out
* If you don't have much experience with technical interviews yet, you should apply to companies you care less about first so you can get experience doing any interviews you get before you possibly do an interview at ""higher stakes"" companies
* OAs can stack up and become a bit overwhelming - try not to avoid applying to like 50 places in a single day because you may get a bunch of automated OAs with close deadlines
* I purchased a month of LeetCode Premium a few days before my Facebook phone and did around half of the top 50 tagged questions - all my problems from phone screen and on-site were problems I solved already! Extremely worth it"

I've never really figured out what I wanted to pursue as a career after high school. Chose to do mechanical engineering due to a combination of being somewhat gifted in math, interest in automobiles since young and the advertised ability to enter any relevant industry. However, as of recent times, my interest in the subject itself has slowly waned (not that I'm bad at my studies, and I could push on but I recognized that I'm not enjoying much and I want to change). Also, my internship isn't doing me any favours as its largely a waste of time and I'm not able to learn much from it.

During my Diploma studies, I took a single subject that dabbled in the basics of programming, with C++ as our study material. It was my first exposure to the world of coding, and I genuinely enjoyed what I was doing, much more than learning thermodynamics or calculating stress points. I've always been a computer geek when I was 6, so staring in front of a screen for hours is not unfamiliar to me (in fact I'm perfectly fine with that aspect of being a programmer, I live an active lifestyle so I'm not afraid of being sedentary), add to that I'm a quick typer when given a good keyboard, programming is certainly something that is made for a person like me. I'm also a more logical person from what my friends have told me, which may be a great natural perk to have for a programmer. I've had relatives and family members pushing me to enter computer science or software engineering before I started college but I didn't listen, and I honestly wished I did now.

I'm asking this here because most of my peers are already halfway through their Bachelors' studies, and I don't want to waste any more of my adulthood making the wrong decisions in life. I hope to be able to do something I truly enjoy, am proud of, and make a living out of it. I've accepted that my 2 and a half years spent getting my Diploma may have been a waste, but I could see myself toying with mobile apps and software development for a good chunk of my life. Thoughts?

I've also read that a lot of programming knowledge and experience can be simply gained through self-learning and practice (the internet is a powerful tool). I'd like to start learning and perhaps work on something at the side before I begin my Bachelors'. What are some great sources and materials to learn from if I want to focus on mobile app developments?"

I am confused if I should go dor DRDO, BARC etc or if I should pursue MS abroad and look for opportunities outside. 

I have little bit of idea, how things are in govt organisation, because I was an intern there.

they start a project, simulate things predict outcomes, then go with sucessful simulations and analyse them with real world factors, may be even make prototype, to help them decide, then only go for real deal.


To be honest I don't have any idea what will be opportunities abroad, Will I be working in a private firm where research will be driven on business questions and business models, or there a opportunities like to learn something because 99% of research are failure.
I mean it just take lot of money and time, idk if private forms will be interested in that.

What is like scope, and what kind of projects do people work in private firms and how is it affecting lives of other?

Can indians apply for Professorship and become full-time professors in public universities abroad?"

I will explain what the situation is.

I work at a very small company with basically just the boss, me, 1 colleague and 2 interns (1 very bad one).  
Beginning of this year i had to move to another province and before i could allow myself to do that, i needed a job here. Hence why i am here.  


I have 13 years experience in my profession. My boss has this company now for 9 years.   
My boss has never had basic training in what we do, i see that every day. He makes mistakes (or does things in a certain way) that infuriates me everytime. Even the interns are surprised sometimes.  
It is nothing important, we work in an 'entertainment' company, nothing bad happens when he does things wrong but it is just infuriating to see sometimes.

Now he also does things very well sometimes, but he also 'works' non-stop and makes decisions i would never do.

* Sends texts and e-mails 24/7, to me and clients. Clients do respond, i don't. But since i do need to contact clients sometimes, they have my private phone number, which means they will text me 24/7 aswell.
* Seems to have no issue with working 24/7 even though he has a family. (My GF would kill me if i went working every weekend/night).
* Expects us to always be available because 'that is part of the profession'. (Now it kinda is, but we have rules in place to atleast not work ungodly hours unless we accept it first).
* The equipment we/he works with is, very non-ergonomical. I got serious pains and cramps after some days but investing in more ergonomical stuff costs a lot of money, and he doesn't want to spend that. (We do have very expensive furniture which we don't need and an Apple picture book...)
* He doesn't eat. So when we are working outdoors, he can go all day. I felt like fainting multiple times past year because we didn't get lunch or dinner (had to cancel diets/gym workouts because i just can't expect to eat at certain times everyday).

Now sometimes we have to do things during a project, that i find are a little absurd. I got 2 hands and 1 head and i can operate 1 machine perfectly, and if i have to operate multiple or just do multiple things at once, things go wrong for me. Maybe it is my problem but that's just how i work. These projects also require a lot of creative thinkinkg, but i have much difficulty with understanding what you or someone else meant or wanted to do creatively, and you expect me to just take your ideas over and put it into practice.

So yesterday, i had to operate multiple things at once and think about multiple things at the same time. Now i am used to it by now, but sometimes it is just too chaotic. I missed doing something yesterday and told my boss that 'it is almost impossible to do that while having to look after an intern that is ~~complete shit~~ not doing anything.   


And he told me, like he has done multiple times already, '*well i can do it when i am alone, why can't you?*'

Now first i felt guilty and stupid, because it makes me feel like i am bad at my job or something? But now i'm just angry. This is not my fucking company, it's his. I get paid way less and the benefits are zero to none compared to the job i quit last year (and that job wasn't that good aswell). Friends are surprised how good i am at creating things at my job and the job i quit basically thought i was God at what i was doing there. I've done this profession for fucking 13 years with multiple degrees under my belt. I KNOW WHAT I AM DOING, I'M NOT AN IDIOT!

Now i just don't know what to make of this. He is not a complete ass of a boss but i seriously begin to dislike him, and the job. He always seems to project how much and how hard he is working, but this is just not my company, why should i care?"

I'm starting to plan out a move in the 2-3 year timeframe. I graduated in 2020 from a highly ranked university with a 3.93 GPA and a degree in Computer Science and I have been working for 1.5 years at a FAANG company in the Silicon Valley and for a variety of reasons I've decided that I want out of the US in the long term (mainly lifestyle reasons more than anything else -- I don't feel like I will be able to live the kind of life I want to in the US). My specific experience is in operating system level computer programming (kernel development, device drivers, etc) in C and ARMv8 assembly, though I've also done a fair share of web development in internships and in college (Python, Django/Flask, Javascript, React, Nodejs). In my travels I've enjoyed the feeling, urban design, and lifestyle of London, Amsterdam, and Tokyo the most so those are the front runners for me, but any city in Europe. I'm wary of Japan mainly due to the harsh work culture (I actually speak Japanese to a ~B1 level so the language barrier would be less of a concern for me).

I'm aware that this will likely entail a *large* salary cut compared to Silicon Valley FAANG software jobs and I am willing to accept that. From my research, it seems like London generally has the highest paying jobs for tech in Europe -- though that's obviously balanced against a higher cost of living. For the rest of Europe, I'm not too concerned about the language as I am more than willing to learn the language of wherever I end up moving to. I think London is probably the most realistic target though so I'm primarily focusing on that to start.

I'm still trying to do a lot of research about this so I have a lot of questions. So if anyone familiar with the tech scene in these countries or the immigration process for US citizens, I would be very appreciative!

1. What is the most common types of visa that an American would get in this scenario. I have done some research into highly skilled migrant visas in UK and the Netherlands, but they still require company sponsorship from what I can tell.
2. How likely is a company to sponsor a visa for an American/non-EU citizen (I'm not sure how much Brexit has changed this)? 
3. Would a better route to be to try to transfer to a foreign office while working at a multinational/FAANG company? 
4. I'm aware my currently specialty might be too niche to easily find a job abroad so are there any specific skills/stacks that tend to be in high demand that I should focus on gaining experience with over the next couple of years? 
5. I'm also interested in potentially going to school for a masters/PhD at some point. Would it be easier to find a job/move over if I first got a student visa and a degree in country?

Thanks for the help!"

**TLDR: Chemical engineer; in 7 years and I've only had 1 promotion, make significantly less than my best friend from college who hasn't held the same job for more than 1-1.5 years, taken over a PhD role and outperformed the previous PhD (with only a bachelors/masters).**

**Always know your worth, and don't go above and beyond for an employer who doesn't do that same for you.**

I work at a large fortune 500 automotive supplier. I'm a chemical engineer and work with polymers/plastics. I know a lot of people here are more in hourly positions, but I wanted to show the extent of late term capitalism/corporate greed applies to anyone not in a Corporate position.

I started out as an intern (paid) in 2012, did 4 internships and was hired on full time when I graduated (2015). The company at that time showed me they valued me and wanted to make sure I worked there full time upon graduation.

A year or 2 into full time work, we get a new CEO. The previous CEO was an engineering background, which was great. Corporate needs to understand the technology and what is needed for highly engineered companies. The new CEO was a plant from an investment group, with a finance background.

Since then it has been constant cost cutting, with no understanding of what is needed for engineering production or R&amp;D. My R&amp;D facility went from \~400 people to less than 250 currently. Nearly everyone is doing 2-3 job roles. We have been on travel restrictions since 2016 and have to get VP level approval to travel. Which is just ridiculous. They also have their culture values of ""work and act like an owner"" but then treat us like toddlers and need approval from 4-10 people for anything over $1,000; in a $15 BILLION dollar company. I can't even get $20k-$40k for a 1 million dollar cost savings project.

So when I was about 2 years into my job, a PhD position left the company. I took over the role as I liked the position and was most familiar with what he did. No pay raise, just making the job my own. I told myself I'll prove that I can perform in a PhD position and then ask for a raise once I've proved that to myself and the company since I don't have my PhD but thought I could do the job.

\~5 years in the PhD role, received my masters degree, and delivered $5M in annual cost savings, with $3M more in projects currently, with constant manufacturing and quality support/improvement as well. I completed a few projects around 2019 that I felt showed I could perform the role well, and even better than the PhD was (my manager even said I was doing better than he did).

I was ready for a promotion, and the pandemic hit. We were furloughed (laid off) for 6 weeks to conserve cash flow. Even the Corporate shills took ""salary cuts"". I said ok, once the company is in a better place I'll get my raise then, and told my manager that.

Later we learned Corporate changed their compensation during 2020 and were paid MORE in 2020 than 2019, despite going negative in profits in Q2 2020, the first time since they had a negative cash flow since 2008. They said they took a salary cut, which is like 5% of their compensation anyways, then upped their stock bonuses and got paid more. All while furloughing employees, dropping benefits (401K contributions), and telling us we all have to make sacrifices for the company.

So I said enough is enough, laid out all the projects I've completed for my manger, $5M in cost savings that will be saved EVERY year for the next 10-30 years, plus $3M in current projects. I thought, shit, just give me 2% of what I've saved this company and I'd be happy. My manager went to his manager who went to his manager and eventually I was told Q4 numbers don't look great so we can't give you a promotion.

7 years and I've had 1 promotion, make significantly less than my best friend from college who hasn't held the same job for more than 1-1.5 years, taken over a PhD role and outperformed the previous PhD.

So now I do the bare minimum to stay employed. Probably work like 20-30 hours a week (instead of 4-45) just on things that need done so it looks like I'm working 40 hours a week. Play video games ""working from home"" 1-2 days a week, logged in to answer any emails or messages. Not going above and beyond anymore, because most companies don't reward that behavior. I started looking at outside jobs as the labor market is so hot right now. Have had 2 interviews, should hear back about the first this week and the other in a week or so.

Always know your worth, and don't go above and beyond for an employer who doesn't do that same for you.

And before people say my company will find out about this post, IDC and I've expressed all of this to my manager already. He agrees, but the company doesn't empower managers/supervisors to do anything about it."

* a member of the military, or a military spouse (any age over 21)
* At least a HS diploma or GED
* A passion for Information Technology (IT) - particularly infrastructure and networking

The  program is part-time and 16 weeks long. You will be required to attend  class Monday-Friday but we are mostly virtual. You may need to come to  our Downtown Newark office (33 Washington) for onboarding and occasional  guest lectures,  but this depends on where we are with COVID in the  next few months.

If you're  interested in learning more, please feel free to DM me. You can  also  learn more and apply directly to the program here: [https://www.npower.org/apply/tech-fundamentals/](https://www.npower.org/apply/tech-fundamentals/)

I asked them about the time frame that it would happen, what tech sector should I learn, and what’s my skill set I will be applying to in the future. 

I have another interview in the short time frame it is going to happen and it’s for a cybersecurity internship and I’m worried that I might’ve fucked up the other one so much that I don’t know if I can get this one up either.

I was pretty nervous and did not get enough sleep nor did I practice speaking well either. No technical interviews as well, as this is the beginner interview. 

How badly did I fuck up ?"
qqzvqo,7,2021-11-10,"I was offered internship, and was asked to work overtime plus weekends",maestro_7,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/qqzvqo/i_was_offered_internship_and_was_asked_to_work/,"What is wrong with people lol. I made 3 yearly salaries investing in crypto this year, and was pressured into having a job by family and girlfriend. 

Internship is fully payed by government, employer can pay more but not obligated. Intern income is like 40% of real wage. As I knew, for interns is expected to work 6h a day, no weekends. 

I was warned at interview that I would do same amount of work as full time employees (8h), overtime whenever it needed, and I need to be able on Saturday even Sunday if needed. Also, company isn’t in position to pay me anything. I humbly declined the offer.

I will use my free time to continue learning solidity and developing dapps on Ethereum. Wageslaving is not an option."
qr0rot,10,2021-11-10,I want to get out of the support project. Please advice,upen_11,developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/qr0rot/i_want_to_get_out_of_the_support_project_please/,"I am a 2021 pass-out. Recently I joined a MNC and they trained me in Advanced Java during internship and after FTE. But due to business requirement I am now in a B2B support project where I have to take care of tickets. I really don't see how I can get out of this before WFH is over(March probably). 

After searching on the internet I have understood that I have to upskill myself in the mean time. So I have chosen DevOps as something in which I want to get into seeing there is so much demand of Cloud (or so I have heard). If you think that there are better tech out there to start career in. Please tell.

I want advice on how my approach should be. Like should I ask for a release in between if I get to a comfortable level where I can give interviews or after cracking it. Because there is 60 days notice period.

There is also something called internal hiring. I do not much about that process. 

And at last the usual question, will the new company consider my resume if I don't have any experience or project and also for the fact that I have only worked in support. What can I do ?"
qr0sa9,2,2021-11-10,"I understand this sub focuses more on SWE internships, but are any of you applying to PM internships?",OllivanderAU,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/qr0sa9/i_understand_this_sub_focuses_more_on_swe/,"I’ve been mainly focusing on PM internships for this upcoming summer because I don’t think my coding skills are up to par. Whereas I have prior business experience and already hold a previous degree in finance. The CS degree just gets my foot in the door for opportunities that wouldn’t be there without it. With that said, am I the only CS major gunning for PM intern roles rather than SWE intern roles? Any feedback would be much appreciated!"
qr2ikp,39,2021-11-10,How long can you be unemployed before it's a problem?,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/qr2ikp/how_long_can_you_be_unemployed_before_its_a/,"I'm graduating soon, early next year, and I'm kind of dreading jumping right into a job.

I definitely don't have the bandwidth to job search while still attending my classes full time, in part because my last two terms are going to be very hard, and also senioritis is hitting hard.

So I don't feel like I'd actually start applying until after I graduate. From a few job fairs though it seems some of these companies hire on some kind of schedule and look for applicants to fill jobs like a year in advance, so to work somewhere starting next summer, I'd have to apply the previous summer or something.

I can't plan that far in advance, and I don't really want to. So if I start applying after I graduate, it seems like I may not actually be hired for a while after that. I don't mind a gap.

I know a lot of people feel insecure if they don't have something directly lined up after graduating, but after 5 years of engineering school, plus no breaks because of summer internships the past few years, I honestly could use a breather.

But I also don't want to be screwed and have them look at this gap of unemployment negatively. How long can I get away with not working/not going to school before employers see this negatively in the hiring process?"

Just any job relating to CS but I'm mainly aiming for software development. I'm a junior and currently applying to as many internships I can find but no luck because my resume sucks and I don't know what to write in it to improve it given my lack of experience and projects in java, python, and sql (what I'm taught in school). 

If I graduate with no CS offer, I'll probably work at a retail or something while doing coding projects I find on the internet to better my resume. Did you do the same?"
qr4i6y,2,2021-11-10,Recruiter Having Me Apply to Higher Level Position,anchovie_boi445,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qr4i6y/recruiter_having_me_apply_to_higher_level_position/,"So I am interviewing with some FAANG companies (or MAANG, now), and I had a phone screening this week with one of them. I received a phone call from my recruiter today to congratulate me on moving onto the next steps (on-site), but said ""you did so well that we would like to interview you for \_\_\_ Level II instead of the Level I.""

I am sure this is a great thing to hear from a recruiter in a FAANG company, however I am nervous that the Level II on-site will be much more difficult and what happens if I don't perform to Level II standards there?

Is there still a possibility that I am offered Level I if my performance in the on-site isn't perfect? I am not sure if this is a double-edged sword by being moved to Level II interview.

Any insight, help, or advice is greatly appreciated. 

For context I am a 21 year old who is graduating with a B.S. in Computer Science this semester with about 2.5 years professional experience through freelance and internships."

qr7oan,2,2021-11-10,"After a super prestigious internship in the summer, my grades plummeted this fall. Help?",throwiewt,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/qr7oan/after_a_super_prestigious_internship_in_the/,"TLDR at bottom.

What title says, got a really fancy internship in my field (CS) which I did really well in and got an offer to come back. Technically they would allow us to drop out and go work with them, but of course I want to finish my degree. Admittedly, being the person in my dept to get the nicest internship also has gotten into my head.

I've never been the best at theoretical stuff or at being a good student, but I've always gotten by with Cs or Bs which I'm ok with since I'm actually talented at what the field I want to go on to requires. Other than that, I'm taking for the first time a full course load. I'm also in my last year.

I am suddenly just unable to study or do work, the most I did for midterms was wake up 4 hours before each exam and kinda review. I unsurprisingly bombed almost every single one of my midterms, and the ones I didn't fail I maybe got 60s. I also sometimes I wake up and have no energy, kinda like a zombie. I can't fall asleep before 3-4 am and have been missing most of my classes.

I was wondering if anyone had any advice on how to break the cycle where I kinda just lay there and don't do any effort whatsoever for my classes - I wasn't like this the first years of my degree. I may be burnt out, but I don't really want to drop any classes.

**TLDR: need help getting back to regular college rhythm since I'm currently probably burnt out and giving no effort whatsoever in classes.**"
qr7qql,620,2021-11-10,Unpopular Opinion: Leetcode has lifted thousands of working-class students to middle class,owlwaves,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/qr7qql/unpopular_opinion_leetcode_has_lifted_thousands/,"I have seen so many posts on r/cscareerquestions recently about how leetcode is not the most effective way to gauge applicants' ability and thus we need a more ""fair"" system. 

However, I have to disagree. Leetcode is perhaps one of the most pro-working-class hiring system that has lifted thousands of working-class students to move up the social ladder.

No other industries (besides engineering) have given working-class applicants the opportunity in the field than the tech industry and thanks to leetcode, applicants with very little to no experience can break it into the industry. 

If you think the tech industry is unfair, it is because you have not worked in different industries before. For instance, in the finance and law field, your pedigree matters which weeds out students from a working-class background. If you want to work in politics, it is near impossible to even work as an intern if you did not attend one of the top 10 universities. (That's why most politicians are rich and I have yet to find a single politician from a working-class background)

However, because of leetcode, no matter your background, you have to go through the same trial, which gives equal opportunity to both poor and rich.

So really, IMO if you are against leetcode then you are in a way contributing to this anti-working class atmosphere.

Keep Leetcode! POWER TO THE WORKING CLASS"

You mention that a degree may not be necessary for a job in cyber security, do you have resources or online courses that someone could use to gain relevant knowledge? Edit: Although with some considerable delay, I would like to thank you all for your comments and your feedback. This is all very helpful and I’m genuinely impressed with how supportive you are! I’ll give everything you’ve sent a proper look and might bother some of you with additional questions.|Bob: I'm a fan of the Cybersecurity Body of Knowledge (https://www.cybok.org/) and you can learn tons just by absorbing the MITRE ATT&amp;CK content (https://attack.mitre.org/) (they update ~quarterly)
&amp;#x200B;|Jen: I completely agree with Bob's recommendations. For training courses, you can also look at SANS and also a lot of community security conferences, even smaller regional ones, offer training. They tend not to be free though.
&amp;#x200B;|Marc: There is [an excellent thread](https://reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/o4l310/what_are_the_best_resources_to_keep_up_with/) in /r/cybersecurity covering just this.
&amp;#x200B;|Also: [Mentorship Monday](https://reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/o98q24/mentorship_monday/) in /r/rcybersecurity.
&amp;#x200B;|Allan: I know most people don’t like social media, but infosec Twitter is a great place to learn and get help. People are always sharing resources, videos and little tidbits of information that can be very useful.
&amp;#x200B;|Jen: I also agree with Allan - I actually learn a ton from infosec twitter and asking questions.
^(the below is another reply to the original question)|&amp;#x200B;
I think it may be beneficial to elaborate a little more to accompany answers already provided- so let me share some of my experience. I've been employed in a full time information security role for about 10 years; with three different employers. Currently employed as a cyber analyst with a large law-firm. Previously, my specialty was a broad mix of infosec risk/cyber engineering/and web-application penetration testing. I have no college degree, and am 31 years old. My best advice to you, is to get a tech role in an organization- and gain as much on-job experience as you possibly can, even if this means you start in a different initial role. It'll be important to gain some technical knowledge, while grasping security concepts as you learn. Additionally, learn frameworks and standards such as **ISO 27001:2013,** and **NIST 800-53.** Read the requirements of the standards, and try to figure out how to correctly interpret them- and how you would implement them based on your interpretation. (The standard says this requirement must be implemented, but what does the requirement actually mean- and how would it be implemented?) Look up current vulnerabilities making their rounds in the wild, using resources like Tenable (https://www.tenable.com/research). Learn about the different types of Malware (https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/malware/types-of-malware/) and ask yourself; How can security be layered to prevent malware from finding it's way into an organization? (Look up **Defense in Depth.**) How does malware most often enter a network? (Look up: **Initial attack vector**) How can you find anomalous network traffic that may be indicative of malware spreading? (Look up: **Endpoint Detection and Response,** and **Threat Hunting.**) Read about security best practices (e.g. Google: **Access Control Best Practices,** **Data Loss Prevention Best Practices.**) Read the articles, and imagine how you would implement the recommendations. Some context for those interested: My first 'real' job (circa 2009, 19 years old) was in helpdesk/desktop support. I did my best to kick ass, and offered to take on issues that often went beyond the scope of my role. If I came across an issue that required engineer escalation or an issue with a server, I would do my best to find a potential solution that I could offer, and communicated the potential solution to the appropriate individual(s). After about a year, and much determination doing the above- I migrated into a Windows/Linux Systems Administration role. (Followed by becoming a VMware vCenter virtualization SME, but that's not super relevant.) Through ad-hoc learning, shadowing team members, and asking 100000 questions, I developed a reputation for being 'that kid who just got stuff done.' Being in a SysAdmin position, I was introduced to projects that essentially crossed the Information/Cyber Security 'border.' (Backup and restore testing; defining data retention requirements by working with upper management while juggling applicable regulations; early Mobile Device Management (BES at the time, yikes) redundant datacenter architecture to ensure data availability during adverse events; identity and access control, scoping penetration tests, and generally... understanding the entire tech stack. Some questions I'd ask myself when looking for risk, or trying to understand how a tech stack worked: \* What's actually 'open'/NAT'ed on our external networks, across all allocated IP Addresses? \* Should this resource be open publicly to anyone who knows the URL/IP? \* Why is it open, and what does it do? \* What does the NAT point to internally? \* What kind of vulnerabilities does that system have externally? Internally? \* Is the system hardened? \    * Does it have Anti-Virus, and does it send its logs to a centralized logging platform? (e.g. Splunk) \* What kinds of vulnerabilities may exist in the source-code/services that the system is serving (OWASP) ? \* Who has access to this system? Are any of these user accounts old? Do they use MFA or SSO for login? \* Do they follow a defined procedure [e.g. Secure Software Development Lifecycle] to consistently release new source code that is reviewed and scanned for vulnerabilities? \* Does a firewall properly segment everything? \* If data is stored in databases, is it human readable- so if an attacker were to dump an entire database would all the data be compromised? Now that I had the sysadmin privileges, I dove in deep when not busy with supporting my systems- and presented findings whenever feasible. A big project for me at the time was taking on a two-factor authentication implementation project. Back then, it was RSA KeyFobs and BlackBerry soft tokens that integrated with a SaaS application my employer developed. Once I knocked that out, and given the above- a full time security role was created (accompanied by a nice paycheck.) And hence, I was slowly vectored into a full-fledged information security role. Before I knew it I was implementing ISO 27001. 27001 was a fantastic way to truly transition into a security state of mind. It requires: developing policies, procedures, and implementing other technical controls required by the Annex A. Executing tasks, and monitoring activities to ensure the electiveness of our processes to ensure the CIA (Important, the C I A triad!) of assets. Importantly, conducting risk assessments to find gaps that required control (protections). ISO 27001 is very broad, and covers many areas of security. It contains sections (domains) regarding: risk assessments, security awareness training programs, access control processes, business continuity plans, penetration testing, vendor risk assessments- and was a fantastic way to get an inch deep- but a mile wide experience lesson into security. From here, find a niche within the space that you like. Sources to learn will be easy as you now have some fundamental experience. Keep in mind, info/cyber security is extraordinarily broad- just like any field. For example- If you wanted to be a lawyer, while it's possible to be a general attorney that covers multi practices, you typically specialize in one area. (e.g. Business law, contract law, bankruptcy law, securities law, copyright law, criminal defense law, etc.) Security is exactly the same. Find a niche in the area that you like the most, and learn that niche as much as you can. If you like poking at platforms/applications/programs/systems to find holes, and development- research reverse engineering techniques and vulnerability analysis and research. **Reverse Engineering:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6mVIos-S2M If you like Information Security Management, look into Security Operations and frameworks like ISO 27001. **27001 Basics:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJbK3jH677k If you like discovering and exploiting known vulnerabilities, look into vulnerability scanning and penetration testing. **Using Tenable:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x87gbgQD4eg **Using Metasploit:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lR27r8Y_ik If you like identifying and managing Risk, look into Risk Assessment Frameworks like ISO 31000 **31000 Basics:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi9EsdKOlAE If you like Security Compliance, become an auditor (best gig in the game imo) **Security Auditing:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW7W_6stSh0 Enjoy developing? Well, learn how to assess code against the OWASP Top-10 **Intro to OWASP:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO_sqXb-gKE If you like passive/active cyber defense, learn about Incident Response, or Security Engineering **Log Analysis:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xw536W7kbDQ **Threat Hunting:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmKSnRMW_6w **Incident Response Walkthrough:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BOOl8_nwjQ **Firewall configurations:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb1pTs7XamA If you like it all- you can be a generalist like me :-) Just keep in mind, It's hard for me to be an expert in one area, as I'm required to cover so much in my current role. Fortunately I do have a great security/network engineering team who basically maintain my entire network security stack (firewalls, VPN, network segmentation, server hardening, etc.) Granted- in my spare time, and when my employer gives me time for continued education- I hone my skills. My real interest lies a little beyond the standard scope standard cyber security, in SIGINT: **SIGINT Overview:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdJQo__vY8U **Universal Radio Hacker:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuubkTDAxwA **Fun Stuff:** https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/log-wi-fi-probe-requests-from-smartphones-laptops-with-probemon-0176303/ **More Fun Stuff:** https://fadeproject.org/?page_id=34 **Even more fun stuff:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJAWHGEB8HI|Marc: This is great advice. The only thing I would add is don’t discount how easy it can be to get real practical experience. Not only does it give you a chance to put some of what you learn into use but it makes it way more interesting and easier to keep in your head.
&amp;#x200B;|Even volunteering to do cybersecurity work is valid experience. Some of the best practitioners I know started out by doing cybersecurity work for NGOs or small businesses that couldn’t afford a dedicated person.
&amp;#x200B;|As mentioned above, fond what interests you and dive into it. All the best cybersecurity people LOVE what they do. For those luck few its not a job but a calling.
^(the below is a reply to the above reply)|&amp;#x200B;
So you're the guy who is responsible for my employer requiring 2FA via SMS every few ducking days! I must say duck you sir! (small /s)|Marc: Guilty as charged.
What is the most common, non-phishing vector?|Allan: Remote Desktop Protocol, either through credential reuse or credential stuffing attacks
&amp;#x200B;|Allan: There are something like 8 BILLION username/passwords available for sale or free on underground markets at any given time and that doesn’t even take into account the number or organizations that just use poor password management for internet-exposed infrastructure
&amp;#x200B;|Marc: Yeah I'd say insecure credentials. Insecure credentials into infrastructure, systems, or accounts that can be used to pivot.
It’s easy to get the impression from these recent events that infrastructure is fairly easy to attack. What do you think is the likelihood that either a state or a rogue group takes down some critical infrastructure for a long period of time that severely disrupts life—something that would be equivalent to essentially destroying infrastructure in a war?|Marc: Very likely as many ransomware groups have seen that high risk infrastructure is both out of date and backed by organisations that will rush to pay because of the impact when it goes down. As a result many of them actively look for vulnerable, exposed infrastructure associated with these kinds of organisations because they know there is a high chance of a good pay-out.
&amp;#x200B;|Jen: This scenario doesn't feel far-fetched at all. We've already seen infrastructure be a target in several countries, and this is only likely to increase without intervention. Even when the attacker offers up the keys as they did with the attack on the Irish healthcare authority (HSE), it can take a long time to get ops fully back up and running. HSE is saying they think full recovery will cost them $600m, so think of all the work that's paying for and how long that will likely take. https://www.scmagazine.com/home/security-news/ransomware/costs-from-ransomware-attack-against-ireland-health-system-reach-600m/
&amp;#x200B;|Allan: It has already happened in Ukraine and other places, so 100%
&amp;#x200B;|James: This question is one I think about often. It’s more nuanced than simply thinking about the ease of the attack.
&amp;#x200B;|For state actors, this very well could result in war. NATO, for example, recently said that cyber attacks would also be covered by the alliance, resulting in the possibilities of joint responses to cyber events. This may serve as a deterrent to state sponsored destructive activities. Use of cyber capabilities are almost assured in wars. This is simply part of modern war for those countries with appropriate capabilities. War is always a concern, and cyber events will be another component to that concern, so this likelihood is roughly the same as the threat of war. It is more likely, imo, that domestic or foreign terrorism would result in destructive attacks. It’s also possible that organized crime or individual actors could have a large impact to daily life. This is reasonably likely to happen in my opinion, as the ease of attack is generally there and the motivation to cause legitimate harm is there as well. Intelligence teams track these groups to stay ahead of them and hopefully prevent attacks from happening, but no intelligence efforts are perfect, and no one catches everything.
&amp;#x200B;|Bob: They may not make all the headlines like the pipeline incident but there are semi-regular cases of various types of critical infrastructure being impacted or having near misses. It really is just a matter of time before it happens.
Please list the top 5 things corporations, business entities and people can do that they currently don't to better protect themselves from cyber attacks and ransomware?|Allan: 1. MFA, 2. Patching, 3. Endpoint protection AND monitoring, 4. scanning of remote infrastructure, 5. threat hunting for attackers.
&amp;#x200B;|Bob: There are many safe configurations for workstations and servers that organizations either do not know about or have been reticent to deploy. Just shoring up configurations on Active Directory and SMB servers alone can do wonders to help thwart attackers from being able to move laterally and encrypt or lock-out at scale.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|&amp;#x200B;
Good list, I've often thought that remote VPNs from end users would be a big attack vector. Given people homes generally have pretty crappy endpoints. Any thoughts here?|Allan: Home routers are scanned continuously and are often targets of attack. Most people get their high speed routers from their ISP, plug them in and then never touch them until they are replaced several years later. That means no updates, no configuration checks or anything like that. So, yes, they, can be used as attack vectors which is why it is important to have a home firewall behind the router you get from the ISP, to protect your actual network.
&amp;#x200B;|Marc: VPN infrastructure has been a huge target since the move to working from home. You just need to look at the number of VPN infrastructure vulns disclosed or dropped to get an idea of how much focus there is on it.
&amp;#x200B;|Also many companies have huge amounts of technical debt with hastily cobbled together VPN solutions that skipped the usual careful rollout processes. Attackers know this and are targetting these too.
^(the below is another reply to the original answer)|&amp;#x200B;
1. Fund your goddamn infosec team. ________________________ Nothing ever goes wrong, why do we pay these guys so much!? *Cuts budget* We just got hacked, what are we paying these guys for!? *Cuts budget* _______________________ No CISO == no representation at C level. If the CTO is your representation, then you have a conflict of interest. If your Director of infosec is your “acting CISO,” you have no CISO. Gtfo. That acting title is just to have someone to throw under the bus when the headlines roll. ______________________ Why would the CTO have a conflict of interest? ______________________________ CTO is ultimately responsible for the budget and the systems that you are in charge of auditing / protecting. It’s possible the CTO wants to cover their ass by hiding the problems from the board. It’s also possible that they are incompetent and will side with IT over infosec.|This is a very good way to look at it.
Currently in school at an online college located in salt lake city ut. I'm in the CyberSecurity program but I feel like the program is kinda dated and the information does not line up very well with the test. Can I land an entry-level cyber job without finishing my degree if I have all Comptia certs related to cybersecurity?|Bob: While some jobs may require certification, many employers are looking for folks with the ""curiosity gene"" combined with the knowledge of where to go to find information and solve problems. I'd highly suggest gravitating towards organizations who look for those attributes over those who are just looking for a certification stamp.
&amp;#x200B;|Marc: You don't need a fancy degree to build a cybersecurity career. you need experience and knowledge. Even knowledge that seems old and minor can be incredibly useful. Take the opportunity you have and build on it by studying more current cutting edge stuff yourself. go to events like DEFCON and connect with the community. the more knowledge you can gain in your ""learning"" stage the better. However the best next step is to build experience, use what you have to take on volunteer/free/part time roles so start getting those hours of experience. there is no substitute for learning in a job.
&amp;#x200B;|protip: I have found charities/NGOs/ low income organisations a great place for this. they are desperate for the help and will welcome your donated time. Even if all you can do is keep them up to date on patches you will be doing them a huge favor and in turn that gives you cybersecurity experience and your first solid cybersecurity reference.
&amp;#x200B;|Marc: Its also really hard because the smaller the org the smaller the budget (if there even is one at all) to pay for security. Working in the CTI-League we ran into small medical facilities ALL THE TIME that lacked resources and personnel to help tackle even the simplest problem, This is definitely a huge challenge and something a lot of us are thinking about. we have to make sure that SMBs don't get left behind as we work to build a more secure ecosystem.
&amp;#x200B;|Jen: Employers in security are increasingly looking at hiring models and trying to break away from conventional hiring-from-schools models. Often landing a role is more about showing interest and making connections than what your resume says. As I said above, I recommend getting involved with local meet ups, attending free online events, that kind of thing will help build your knowledge and network.
&amp;#x200B;|Allan: You can, I don’t have a degree and have managed to grow my career. However, advancing in this field, as with many fields, is A LOT easier with a degree and there have definitely been job opportunities I missed out on because they wanted that degree. Keep up the good work and connect with us on LinkedIn so we can help you as you continue to grow.
What can a regular person with no cybersecurity or coding knowledge do to help?|James: A large part of effective security is up to the users, not the security engineers and administrators and the most important things are the most basic things too! Three things come to mind: 1) Use strong passwords that are unique to each site / service (a password manager can help!) 2) Keep good backups, and consider using more than one backup device where both devices are never plugged in at the same time. 3) Be vigilant! If something strikes you as odd, alert your corporate security team. Did you click a link and think it might be bad? Report it! Most ransomware actors take time to inventory networks after the initial compromise, so there may be time to still protect your network and your device! Time is of the essence here though!
&amp;#x200B;|Marc: Ransomware is a spectrum but most is opportunistic and relies on poor, fragmented security hygiene. Any contribution to up-leveling hygiene in a consistent manner makes an organisation stronger against many types of ransomware.
&amp;#x200B;|Marc: So every user from the lowest level intern all the way up to the CEO can make a big difference by working to support a consistent information security program. By challenging things that ""look wrong"" or which are suspicious, from always being skeptical with email links to reporting security flaws and operational issues. The best defense for a company against ransomware is that company's workforce itself.
&amp;#x200B;|Allan: Pay attention during security awareness training, know what the threats are and be cautious about emails your receive (especially if they have a warning flag).
^(the below is a reply to the above)|&amp;#x200B;
Do you recommend Dashlane as a password manager? I've recently started using it.|I do not have any specific recommendations for password managers. I would generally look for audits / reviews that confirm the encryption is suitably strong and one that works for you! Find something that is convenient to your purposes and use case.
What is the largest sum one of your clients ever had to pay?|Allan: Our clients make the ransomware gangs pay ;)
&amp;#x200B;|Jen: The biggest demands we've heard of are in the $40-50mill buckets, but they are definitely outliers.
What type of software would you recommend against ransomware and things of the sort?|Allan: Unfortunately, there isn’t a single software solution that will solve the problem of ransomware (or other types of attacks). It really does require a holistic approach to security. Not just software, but the right policies, people and protocols in place to quickly identify and stop threats
&amp;#x200B;|Marc: agree - theres no single bullet, however theres a strategy (see the IST [Ransomware Taskforce Report](https://www.securityandtechnology.org/ransomwaretaskforce/report)) that shows how organisations and industries can make themselves hostile to ransomware. Most ransomware is opportunist, just by toughening yourself up to become a much less attractive target. by strengthening security hygiene and turning on things like MFA you make lateral movement much harder. solving ransomware is a step by step journey, not a shrinkwrapped piece of software.
&amp;#x200B;|Bob: There is no path to purchasing your way into ransomware defense.
How can an end-user or consumer can protect him/herself? There are too many security products, like Bitdefender, Kaspersky, Sophos, etc, and one can check received emails or the sites which he/she can visit, but even sometimes that is not enough. Years ago, on a Windows 2012 server I saw a hacker running his apps as a built-in service user from remote desktop services. No AV found that malicious at that time. So, what can we do? Which software / hardware shall we use? How can we protect ourselves? I am aware nothing is %100 bulletproof but we have to start from somewhere.|Bob: Keep your home router patched and consider replacing every few years. Limit the use of ""smart"" devices in your home. Scrutinize every email and every link in social media. Limit the number of browser extensions you use and consider using an iOS device for more ""risky"" web activity. Keep your systems and software patched. Have regular, offline, backups handy. Much of this is the same advice folks have been giving for a decade or more.
&amp;#x200B;|Bob: Also use a password manager, preferably one that is plugged into services like ""have i been pwnd?"" so you know when you need to reset credentials (but you should be using services that offer or mandate 2-factor authentication).
&amp;#x200B;|Marc: String security hygiene is one of the best defenses we have. Patch exposed systems, turn on MFA and implement best practice like endpoint protection and you'll create a network thats hostile to ransomware.
&amp;#x200B;|Jen: Be suspicious of emails or texts from people you don't know, or that include links or attachments. Don't give out sensitive info, particularly your passwords. Use a password manager and use two-step verification wherever you can.
If you had to choose between paying a cyber ransom in gum or pizza, which flavors would you choose to increase your bargaining potential?|Jen: Obviously pineapple
There is an argument often made that if ""the military"" and ""law enforcement"" begin to crackdown on infrastructure in a much more forward leaning manner, that these gangs will still be able to persist, regroup, reattack - i.e., that even working with private sector partners, there isn't enough data/insight available to really take it to these networks. Agree? Disagree?|Jen: There is definitely a huge challenge in that these criminals often operate in nations where the government either can't or won't stop them, and that makes it super hard for law enforcement to be effective. We need governments around the world to collaborate to crack down on these so-called ""Safe harbor"" states. This was actually one of the commitments that came out of the recent G7 Summit, but it remains to be seen how the G7 members will follow through on it.
&amp;#x200B;|Marc: While its absolutely true that to really hit the ransomware gangs hard we have to take the fight to them, we mustn't loose sight of how important it is for us to toughen. up and work together to make our whole ecosystem hostile to ransomware. By addressing the low hanging fruit many of the opportunistic gangs will get shut out, by improving our detection capabilities we will increase the data and forensic material needed to attribute them. There's a huge amount of stuff to be done at both ends of the fight and its my firm belief that we can only achieve it in partnership.
&amp;#x200B;|Allan: Right now, ransomware is the most profitable form of cybercrime, aside from possibly BEC. So, yes, even forward leaning efforts by law enforcement won’t necessarily stop ransomware attacks. Ransomware groups have been good at adapting and evolving their attacks to evade defenses. However, a more aggressive law enforcement stature will scare away a lot of the 2nd and 3rd tier ransomware actors (we’ve seen this already with Avaddon and other actors who “retired” this year). That reduces the number of groups law enforcement has to focus on.
&amp;#x200B;|Bob: To riff off of Alan's answer, the massive proliferation in attacks has been led, in large part, from Ransomware as a Service offerings which enable low-skilled attackers to get in on the action. Curbing that activity will be a huge help.
&amp;#x200B;|James: There is a tendency to sometimes reduce success to a simple “yes” or “no” question. With ongoing defensive efforts, the objective is to improve and adapt.
&amp;#x200B;|With the offensive efforts, the point is to take the attack to the attackers and make them have to adapt, change techniques, and generally be less comfortable in their belief that they can operate with impunity. The IST’s Ransomware Task Force report recommends using many different capabilities to help address the threat in a holistic way. Part of that multifaceted effort is to go after attackers and disrupt their capabilities.
What is the best path to start a career in cyber security?|Allan: The best path is the one that works for you, everyone is different, I started in the helpdesk which was great because I got to learn about the problems that people had and it allowed me to be more empathetic as I progressed in my career.
&amp;#x200B;|Marc: The best cybersecurity people come from the ground up. Get a good baseline of knowledge in technical areas - often working low level IT jobs as an intern or first job can be a great start. Then work on building your base of cybersecurity knowledge. At some point you have to start getting cybersecurity work experience. Experience doing cybersecurity jobs is better than any piece of paper alone. Sometimes this can be gained from low level jobs by taking on cyber responsibilities - by being that IT guy checking patches and ensuring upgrades are done you can build cybersecurity experience.
&amp;#x200B;|Almost all the best cybersecurity people come from backgrounds like this. few have specialized degrees. I am one of them. I gave a more fuller answer in /r/cybersecurity
&amp;#x200B;|Bob: Cybersecurity has become a diverse field with many areas you can specialize in. Learn as much as you can about each area and see which one appeals the most, then dive in! You don't need permission to start learning a particular topic, and there are tons of local security meetups all across globe, plus many online communities that can help you get started.
&amp;#x200B;|Once you truly settle into some area, there are numerous pathways to more formal education (all the way up to PhD level). Just be curious and don't be afraid to keep asking ""why"" and ""how"".
&amp;#x200B;|Jen: Look for ways to educate yourself on what's going on and meet people that are working in security or have similar interests. Going to local meet ups, attending free online events, that kind of thing will help you build your knowledge and network. You can also look at open source security tools and free cyber ranges to try building your skills without having to spend a lot of money.
Should we ban ransomware payments? Alternatively, should we just ban coverage of ransom payments in insurance policies?|Marc: We should NOT ban ransomware payments. Many organisations find themselves in a difficult position where they feel they are trapped between their shareholders, their customers and law enforcement. This gets even worse when you consider healthcare. If someones life hung in the balance would you want a hospital prosecuted for paying a ransom to bring a surgical suite online?
&amp;#x200B;|let's not forget who the criminals are and not criminalize the victims. It only drives payments underground and destroys our chances of collaboration. Instead we should work to make ransomware payments more attributable, organisations hostile to ransomware and work on the world stage to eliminate hiding places where these cybercriminals can operate with little recourse.
&amp;#x200B;|Marc: Additionally I believe that we should work WITH ransomware insurance companies to make ransomware insurance more expensive for companies that aren't doing the basics. Insurance has been an excellent level for eliminating safety issues throughout history and it can be here too. Eliminating it removes one of the levers we have to influence how we fix this.
&amp;#x200B;|Jen: The reality is that both Bob and Marc are correct, and that's why this is hard.
&amp;#x200B;|From an idealistic point of view, I think a lot of people agree with Bob - ransom payments fund organized crime which is responsible for some pretty heinous things, including child exploitation and human trafficking. Also, if ransomware is primarily profit motivated, so the expectation is that if we take away the attackers chances of getting paid, they will eventually stop.
&amp;#x200B;|This is where Marc's more pragmatic position comes in. Because as we've said here, there is little risk or real expense or friction for attackers today, so before they give up on ransomware as a revenue stream, they are very likely to pay a big ol' game of chicken with victims. To tip the odds even further in their favor, they will likely focus on organizations that have the least resilience, which is either SMBs who face losing their entire business, and critical infrastructure providers that have no tolerance for downtime due to the criticality of their service. That's what we've seen when hospitals or fuel pipelines have felt they had no choice but to pay.
&amp;#x200B;|Even if a government tries to shore up these organizations, there is no such thing as an entirely bulletproof organization, and recovery always takes time. So we could end up seeing business leaders make payments in secret, which puts them in an even more vulnerable position.
&amp;#x200B;|So the net of all that is that we should figure out how to get to a state where banning payments could work in practice without causing a lot of unintended harm, but we're certainly not there today.
&amp;#x200B;|Bob: We should totally ban supporting child and sex trafficking through ransomware payments
Question - Is email tracking by invisible pixel or visible still possible in 2021? If impossible, do you know of anyway to track the geolocation of the person opening the email without them knowing and without their email application preventing this process from occurring?|Bob: Pixel tracking is alive and well and one of the most-used techniques. If your mail client stops images and will not execute javascript (or load external resources of any kind) then you're not going to be able to be tracked.
Isn't there a better payment/effort ratio to be on the side of the hacker? You guys are playing goalie right where you have to block all the shots 100% of the time and the hackers only have to get it right once. Illegality aside.|Marc: A yes, the age old question ""but couldn't you make more as a criminal?"" the answer is yes I probably could. However what stops me is morals, ethics and laws. I have a family i want to see grow up in a safe country and I love my community (the hacker community) so I want to protect them. I can't do that as a criminal.
&amp;#x200B;|I also hate bullies and fighting cybercrime is the ultimate bully takedown. Especially when the bully you take down is an entire country.
&amp;#x200B;|James: Valid question. Yes, criminals have the easy path, no doubt. They prey on innocent victims from all walks of life.
&amp;#x200B;|But where is the challenge in the easy path? Attacking is way way way easier than defending. Hollywood glorifies the hacker / attacker, but most attacks are very trivial. No challenge.
&amp;#x200B;|Morals and ethics is a good answer too, and that’s certainly part of my personal decision.
To defend myself from mal/ransomware: Can you recommend a firewall to use for my homelab? Is a hardware firewall better than a software one (using proxmox to virtualize).|Marc: ""can you recommend a firewall?"" - personally I use pfsense at home because its easily customised, runs on a lot of easily obtained consumer devices and has a solid feature-set and performance. remember though a firewall is only as good as the way you use it. a lot of sophisticated attacks jump things like firewalls by relying on the user to bring them inside the protected network.
&amp;#x200B;|Get a good firewall but if you are really interested in being secure look at all the ways you can up-level your security hygiene (ensure everything is kept up to date even that 7 year old IOT tv, ensure that you have segmented networks for untrusted devices like that laptop the annoying person brings when he visits, and be careful with what you connect, plug in or run. DONT CLICK SHIT.)
&amp;#x200B;|Bob: Using a firewall is one, small portion for defense. Without knowing your setup it is difficult to make recommendations. Keeping it patched, and the configuration as diminutive and tight as possible is almost more important then the ""brand""/""flavor"".
&amp;#x200B;|Allan: Given the proliferation of phishing as an attack vector for ransomware a firewall alone is not going to protect you. As to whether or not you need a hardware or software one, it depends on how comfortable you are with managing the underlying operating system and how much time you have. I use a hardware firewall at home because I have enough to do at $dayjob that I don’t need the headache of dealing with underlying OS issues on my home firewall.
Is the Anonymous group real, and do they fight for good?|Allan: Anonymous is real. I don’t think they define themselves by good/bad.
&amp;#x200B;|Bob: They are a real group.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|&amp;#x200B;
Silly questions aside, in your career what has been the best highlight of your time fighting cybercrime? Is there more the general public can do to help people like you fight against them?|Marc: Probably the hi-light of my career as a cybercrime fighter was watching 2,000 security professionals, law enforcement personnel and other government staff come together to fight cybercriminals attacking hospitals during the pandemic as part of the CTI League.
&amp;#x200B;|James: For me, it is all about influencing the overall security of the world. There is no other work for me that compares to being able to enable human freedoms and a free exchange of ideas on a global basis.
&amp;#x200B;|Individuals and companies are constantly protected from threats by altruistic efforts of public and private sector defenders who mostly go nameless and without any fanfare. Getting to sometimes contribute to those efforts is truly rewarding."
qr7yeq,206,2021-11-10,"I hate being pressured to get a CS internship, so here’s how I got one in 3 weeks",Aggressive-Twist-252,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qr7yeq/i_hate_being_pressured_to_get_a_cs_internship_so/,"**Context**: I feel like some context is needed. The uni I’m in makes internships so much of a big deal to the point of annoyance. So I took it upon myself to find one as soon as possible. BTW, **my focus is in gaming** since I want to get into game dev, but **ended up in telcomms for this internship.** 

**I know this is rushed and this isn’t for everyone to follow**. It’s still better to slowly build your side projects, get a good CV, and study for your interviews well. But I know there are some here like me who’s looking to get into an internship ASAP so it won’t stay an academic burden, so here’s what I’ve done:

1. **Online job listings are a godsend.** While it says “job listing,” a lot of companies also look for interns via these websites. You have to be patient with creating your profile but it’s worth it since you can use these sites when you look for actual work. Websites I joined where companies replied in a few days were:
   1. [**Leaderboard Jobs**](https://www.leaderboardjobs.com/?r=1). Their site focuses on gaming and they have dedicated pages for resources, seminars, and conferences. I recommend you get into a job listing site that is dedicated to or has a section for the particular industry you’re trying to pursue. 
   2. [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search?keywords=Programming%20Intern&amp;location=United%20States&amp;geoId=103644278&amp;trk=public_jobs_jobs-search-bar_search-submit&amp;position=1&amp;pageNum=0). Being a professional hub, LinkedIn proved to be reliable to me. They have Easy Apply, so if you have a LinkedIn profile/resume set up, you can just apply in a few clicks. 
   3. [**Indeed**](https://www.indeed.com/q-Computer-Programming-Intern-jobs.html?vjk=c4ecdb0c2bf88de6)**.** I recently realized that they also have a lot of programming/CS internship roles open too. 
2. **Put your game face on.** And this is quite literally. One thing my professor told me that stuck with me is that professional life in CS is sorta like coding - problems are mostly solved when thinking outside the box. I realized this is the same when finding internships. Don’t hesitate to skip the textbook method of just waiting for emails and get yourself out there.
   1. Get ready to talk to a lot of people. I forced myself to get over my social anxiety if it meant trying to establish new connections in this 3 week period. I managed to talk to people I would never talk to unless needed. These included strangers like security personnel, front desk employees, professors, and even professionals I reached out to.
   2. Everything has a connection. Since you’re looking for a company that might look for CS internships, try to look for places nearby where your target companies might have a presence. 
   3. Go straight for the gold. If you discover a contact to a company via a job listing or announcements, don’t hesitate to reach out to them directly regarding internships. 
3. **Check your uni’s database.** It’s impossible for your uni or school not to have connections with other unis or companies related to CS, especially for your department. I discovered some companies to apply to by looking into:
   1. Try to check any recent seminars or conferences that a company held in your school. Chances are, your department officials might know how to reach out to the contact person there.
   2. Try to ask your professors if they have any connections regarding companies that might be interested in internships. This might be a shortcut, but it’s still worth the ask, right?
   3. Try to check what other universities are doing. Try to follow the above steps but with other schools. I discovered a handful of companies that did some talks in other schools nearby so I tried reaching out to them as well.
4. **Prepare the paperwork anyway.** It’s very likely that your internship will be remote. My internship will be remote. But one thing I did to be sure is to print out everything I’ve sent to the companies when applying. These include my CVs and cover letters and other requirements your school might need you to submit. Always have some thumb drives ready with some projects you can show interviewers. Relevant for the next stage.
5. **Personal visits still work.** If you’ve seen companies that offer internships that are nearby, don’t hesitate to make a visit. Remember, when you do, bring any COVID safety requirements if ready. This is important for the sake of anxiety, as you’ll want to make sure that your CV and cover letter reaches an actual person’s hands. Some pointers when visiting companies to give out your CVs/cover letters:
   1. Prepare an itinerary when visiting multiple places. If you’re commuting, it helps to have at least a proper sequence of companies to visit so you don’t get too stressed with your trip. The more companies you visit in a single visit, the better. 
   2. Ask for a contact person, be it an email or a mobile number. This lets you know who you’ll be expecting an email from.
6. **Prepare to settle.** Since I’m rushing the process, I removed any semblance of being able to choose where I get my internship. I can’t afford to choose when I’m focusing on getting one as soon as possible, so when the opportunity came, I took it and now I’m hoping for the best. I do have plans of taking another internship next year of my own accord, since I ended up in a telcomms and I really want to pursue gaming. 

I hope these tips help. I can’t share where I’ll be working because of an NDA (I earn $16/hr). If you have other tips, please include them as well so we can help each other out. Thanks

qr8nbb,3,2021-11-10,About to graduate and realizing that I have very little to actually offer - what to learn on my own?,_blair__,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/qr8nbb/about_to_graduate_and_realizing_that_i_have_very/,"Hi there,

I am currently about to have one more semester of undergrad with a degree in Operations and Supply Chain. Ever since I arrived at my college I have been doing nonstop internships; A start-up for operations, a private equity firm for finance, a Major Defense Contractor for Supply Chain, and now working at a Large state Beer Distributor. I have lots of experience, a great GPA, and I have great social skills. I also have lots of basic competency in computer skills like Excel VBA, Excel formulas and pivot tables, Project management software, and tableau. 

My main problem is that I look pretty hireable but I have very little to actually offer a company besides being a tried and true worker and can do lots of busywork. I want to enter a career that doesn't just lock me to supply chain forever so I want to have skills that are helpful in many aspects of business not just join a company in a SC role when I graduate and then learn skills that won't be helpful if I were to apply for a finance role down the line. (The main things I'm interested in are Continous Improvement efforts and operations management)

So what I'm asking is, what skills should I try to learn on my own to become an asset across fields? The ones that come to mind are potentially learning Python then SQL. I have a pretty good base for statistics but would love to have some skills that would make me very hirable across fields so I can earn as much as possible for my family.

TLDR: What skills to learn on my own to be a valuable asset across Operations, Supply Chain, Finance, and Management?"

* What team/work did you get to work on? Did you find it interesting? 

* How was wlb? Did you get to meet a lot of new people as well?

* If you took corporate housing, where was it and what was it like? 

* Which office did you work at? Seems like they have 3 locations in NY

* Did you get a return offer?

Would really appreciate any insight and am super excited to work there next summer. If you're wondering about the process I've left some additional details below:

* Applied 8/5, received code signal request immediately

* Sent codesignal (726) on 8/15

* Auto rejected 8/19 (Mixup with Codesignal invite link)

* Un-rejected 9/2

* More information request 10/06

* Final round invite 10/08

* Behavioral + technical interview 10/19

* Case interview 10/26

* Debrief call invite 11/2

* Received offer 11/3

During my debrief my recruiter asked me for top choice locations and I picked NYC, Chicago and McLean. Was told first two needed approval, and received offer letter for McLean the next day. Had a mixup in offer deadlines and told my recruiter that I actually needed a response today and she asked ""leadership"" for approval and was told that I could switch to NYC. Hope this was helpful!"

And to do it gracefully without pissing off your new manager and being put on instant PIP lol.

I know that Capital One has a rotation program for New Grads where you have a major say in what kind of work you want to do in your second year but it seems like Amazon has no such formal process.  Also, the average tenure at Amazon is \~13 months so it seems a lot more preferable to be in a specialty that you are interested in and can build industry experience in from the get-go.

Now **in principle**, I agree with the idea that as a New Grad, I should be ""open to new experiences"" over my own personal preferences.  The problem is that in my own specific case, all my internships were in backend-only roles focusing on Data Engineering, Cloud Computing Infra, and DevOps **with nada for frontend**.  So that actually makes an even stronger argument that I should go for a frontend role but I am worried that based on my past experiences that Amazon will want to throw me onto a backend-only role for some AWS Service.

TIA for any advice."

I recently received offers from Duolingo and Tiktok, and have no idea which one to choose. I don’t really care about pay, but I’m looking for an internship which will help give insight on the SWE industry, and is a good opportunity for growth. I made a pro con list:

Duolingo:

Pros:
- Great culture from what I’ve heard/people I talked to
- Good morals/ethics relative to Tiktok

Cons:
- In Pittsburgh, but HQ is in NYC (edit: whoops HQ not in NYC, but pgh is a con because I go to school in PA and want to explore new cities)
- Dunno which team I’m gonna be on yet

Tiktok:

Pros:
- Better name (?)
- Haven’t talked to team but the team Im landing on seems pretty interesting
- Cali

Cons:
- Scared of the culture, don’t really know what to expect

Is there anything else I should be looking out for? Any advice appreciated.

Also if anyone has insight on their previous intern experiences from the companies, that would be much appreciated!

So I keep going back and forth between there is a chance and no way.

STEM/business/econ majors. I am a sophomore at a t20 school known for grade deflation. Took some Ls due to family deaths and depression in my 1st semester at college. Maintained/maintaining an upward trend right now but my GPA will be around 3.6 when I apply. My high school stats are the typical t20 student stats. 

Currently working three jobs(well two, and a paid internship(about 5 hours/week)) to support my family and myself. 2 leadership positions in organizations at school + 1 or 2 other organizations. A clothing startup. A potential summer internship with companies like Capital one and BCG.

I want to transfer due to lack of specific programs and  I also don't feel supported by the city(lacks elements of culture I need to thrive) and school. I have more specific/personal reasons as well. Anticipating strong recs from 2 professors(In a 1 on 1 zoom call at the end of last semester,one of them offered to write me a rec at any point during my career without me asking for one).

Hooks- minority/immigrant/first gen.

qrfvfb,130,2021-11-11,Things to note when applying to colleges abroad from the perspective of an Indian student,[deleted],india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/qrfvfb/things_to_note_when_applying_to_colleges_abroad/,"1. Choose your colleges wisely. Do your research. This is the single most critical decision any prospective student can make. Select 3-4 colleges(maybe 5, wouldn't recommend more than 6) with a good mix of dream, safe and reach colleges. Check your college's reputation and ranking , check employment reports if available.  Customise your essays based on the college you're applying to. Overpreparing is never a bad idea in these scenarios. I strongly believe you should settle for mid tier colleges in the worst case scenario. Going to a 100th ranked college in the US will make it exceedingly difficult for you to land a good job which will help you pay off your substantial loans.


2. Avoid consultancies if possible. Most are shady af and try to make you settle for lower/safer colleges which have tie ups with these consultancies to refer students. Check their reviews online thoroughly and go in with the expectation that there's a significant chance the consultancy will be useless during your application. 


3. Come up with your SoP on your own, especially if you're targeting a tier 1 college. Seriously. Don't cut paste someone else's SoP. Colleges go through thousands of these every year. More often than not, most adcoms will know which ones are fake and which ones sound authentic. The consultancy template SoP or someone else's SoP will very rarely highlight your strengths in your profiles unless you substantially tweak it. Attend student outreach events, show interest in the events to stand out and get an idea of how your life might potentially be. 


4. Figure out your funding options before applying. It'll save you a lot of mental headaches later on. That means having a conversation with your parents, looking at student loan companies and seeing if you satisfy their criteria. Don't pin your hopes entirely on scholarships. Weigh the risk reward ratio before taking the plunge. 

5. Have a clear idea of your career goals post your degree and how the college and the country you're going to will help you . that'll help you immensely if you have an interview with the adcom(if you have one) and give you the clarity and focus you need to get the most value out of your study period.

6. Network like a mad man/woman once you go there. Foreign colleges don't have the concept of campus placements so it's imperative you know how to network with employers and your classmates effectively if you want to land a job there. Don't stick exclusively to the Indian circle you'll find there. Build your circle as large as you can, and interact with people from as many nationalities as you can. Multicultural experiences open new perspectives. Join student clubs once you go there to find people with common interests

7. Maintain a good GPA. Your struggle doesn't end once you go to your college of choice. Masters programs require significantly more effort and work than your Bachelors. Don't think you'll go out drinking 5 days a week and study one night before the exam and ace the test. You'll be able to scrape past the min marks doing that and that is if you're lucky. 

8. Start looking for internships and opportunities the moment you land there. Internships are invaluable experience and if you do well, you can convert it to a full time gig.

9. Learn the local language if it isn't English. This is absolutely critical in the EU where local language is the medium of preferred interaction in your day to day life. You should have atleast a B1 level of proficiency by the time you graduate to stand a chance in the European job market unless you're from an elite elite institution or a future Nobel winner. 

10. Try to choose a country which is popular as a student destination for Indians. I'd suggest sticking to Canada, US, UK or Germany or France more often than not. It's easier to get funding and you'll have more information on the visa processes. I applied to a country in the EU which isn't as popular with Indian students and my visa has been in processing hell for the last 2.5 months almost and it likely won't be processed before the deadline.

PS: All this is based on anecdotal evidence- my own experience and the experiences of those around me who successfully took the plunge"

I am currently working in an 'IT' firm in data integration for about an year, just after passing out of college( bachelors). It pays meagre and the job is depressing to say at least. 

    
That said mostly i run the same boring SQL commands and work on Informatica all day. Sometimes they even ask me to work on Salesforce. Its comical. I neither learn anything and am least interested in my workspace. 

I really want to shift to Data Analytics and have a keen interest towards stats along with programming languages in general (R / Python) and related technologies.   
Also this is a vast field comprising from ML models, deep learning, tensorflow, etc etc to Hadoop , Scala and I need to invest a hell lot of time to grasp atleast a fair bit of knowledge about them to be presentable in the industry. 

&amp;#x200B;

Can you guys suggest me if I should leave my job altogether and join a course and study ? Or study parallely , and if I do so, should I aim for certifications ? If yes, then please drop some examples / suggestions as you guys feel. 

I specifically asked this because I dont have any revelant industry experience / internship in this field but only a deep desire to work. 

Am curious for any suggestions."

I am not sure which one to go for engineering as it has both pros and cons. I like PSU’s prestige in engineering, great alumni connection, while ASU’s location, climate, and that it's ranked No. 1 for innovations in the US.

One of the main factors for me is location and opportunities. I'm not too fond of isolated places in the middle of nowhere, as they are genuinely depressing. I know that I will like ASU with its atmosphere, but not sure about Penn State.
However, I am not sure which one offers better opportunities in terms of internships, maybe co-ops for internationals, to get more experience in my major.

Tuition of both for internationals is ofc pricey, but there's not much difference (PSU is a bit more expensive), so price tags are not a significant factor.

After graduated, I started applying to internships and junior dev jobs but couldn't get past the interview stage. Sometimes, I feel you need connections and some source to get into IT companies but being a really introverted person, I wasn't able to build any connections during college. 

During the same time, CloudFactory applications were open, so I applied and got accepted. This job was only meant to be for a short time and to earn some pocket money. However, due to the ongoing pandemic and lockdown situation I got stuck with this job and am still working here. I have been applying to internships and junior dev jobs but the IT companies I apply to don't reply and the ones which invite me for interview reject me. With each rejection, I feel low and lose self-esteem. The last interview I had recently went pretty bad. I found the interviewer to be really rude and looked down on me. This broke my confidence a lot. 

I know it's my fault too for not trying hard on my own and learning and creating projects on my own during lockdown but with my family member getting infected with Covid and losing my grandmother to Covid and having to spend much more time helping at home while also working at CF left me with no time and energy to do self-learning. It also took a toll on my mental health.

At this point, I'm so confused as to what I should do. I'm sick of working at CF while the people I studied with are having great  careers in IT. I feel the need to join training institutes like Deerwalk and Broadway Infosys in hopes of getting back to programming and getting placements. Should I join training classes and work hard to land a job or should I leave CF and self learn and apply to jobs after getting confident with my own programming skills?"

I had enough potential and was always sure of having a bright future after graduating from University. The country I’m from follows a strict and rigorous schooling system. One has to work really hard to stay ahead and get ahead. Although it’s a dog eat dog system, I was still fairly confident in myself, and never worried of failing in the long run. Basically, I was a nice, hard-working, good guy with all the good manners in this world, all the professional etiquettes, all the good things parents would generally expect from their child. I’ve been an obedient son, a good student who always packs the maximum respect for his teachers/professors, and a good performer overall. There’s no way, no chance for things to go wrong and I always dreamt of living a happy, independent life after 23 (i.e., post-graduation).


After Class 8 (8th standard), things began going south for me. Family issues drained me mentally and being a victim of favouritism, my academic performance began to drop. My parents have always preferred their elder son (my evil, opportunistic, crooked brother) over me and instead of punishing him or correcting his ways, they would double down on me, curb my freedom of speech and action. They wouldn’t punish him for whatever physical harm or injury he would inflict on me, rather they would simply ask me to back down or blame me for defending myself or for hitting back. This dirty nonsense at home shook me mentally. I had no one to cry for help, so I had to swallow all this. I approached my Grandfather as a last resort, but since he also blindly prefers my brother no matter what the crooked, nasty guy does, he didn’t help me at all. My grades dropped and I fell into the average category and then into the semi-average category.


I managed to bounce back and God offered me a second chance in the final two years of high school (Class 11 and 12). Still dealing with the family issue at home, I tried my best to get back to where I used to be academically. However, things at home only got worse and worse to the point that my Biology tuition teacher could literally read my body language and she would ask me at the end of every class if I was okay and what’s wrong. One day I couldn’t hold back any more and told her briefly about the hell I had to deal with at home. My brother used to be her student too but she quickly found out the kind of crooked, bad person he was. My Biology tuition teacher showed me sympathy, gave me hope and that’s all she could do within her limits.


Things at home were so brutal that depression slowly consumed me. My evil brother would make up false, nasty stories about me and inform my parents who would then punish me without even verifying the truthfulness of his fabricated stories. Not only that, he would steal my possessions or inflict damage upon my electronic gadgets. He even sold my PS3 just days before my final high school exams and my parents didn’t do a single thing about it – neither did they punish him nor did they compensate me for my loss. All these false stories and rumours made my parents so mad that they literally took away my freedom and I was refused to step outside the house for two months. I didn’t have any friends, no help, no contact, nothing. I was treated like a servant while my crooked brother was treated like a prince and got away with every bad deed he committed. He failed in Class 11, and barely managed to pass his final high school graduation exams, but my parents seemed to be fine with it and all the pressure was on me. My parents had sky-high expectations and I burned out. I broke down nervously. 


Because of what I went through at home on a daily basis, my mental condition wasn’t good and as a result I lost my friends. I even narrowly escaped a murder attempt; my parents didn’t punish my brother for inflicting the grave physical injuries and once again they let him get away with what could’ve been a murder. I narrowly escaped death that day and although I wanted to report to the police, my parents quickly shut me up and silenced me. 


One thing I must add here is the fact that my father was supportive of me and sympathetic towards me, but he didn’t do anything to protect me or right the wrongs happening at home. I trusted him blindly as he is the head of our family, and instead of doing something for me, he simply asked me to endure. My parents don’t have a harmonious relationship because of the many differences they share, and as a result, my father didn’t bother to stop my mother from doing injustice towards me and through that, he did injustice towards me as well. 

I became lonely. Nobody around my age wanted to befriend or mingle with a guy who had so much pain and agony hidden behind a smiling face. I had two best friends who did stick with me but we quickly fell apart following our high school graduation.


Following high school graduation, my father forced me to pursue Law despite the fact that I wanted to pursue Engineering. My mother did ask me to pursue Engineering, but I didn’t listen to her as I have always had trust issues with her. Rather, I chose to obey my father as always and he put me into Law/Legal Studies. That was the biggest mistake of my life.


I cracked the Law Entrance Examination of my State and was among the top 60 rankers. Naturally, I secured my seat in the #1 Law College of my State but little did I know that the enrolment was the nail in the coffin.


My Law course was of 5 years (10 semesters). Despite being totally uninterested in Law, I convinced myself that it’s a prestigious profession without having any clue of the ins and outs of the game. I chalked out my 5 years on the very first day of college and proceeded accordingly. I studied extremely hard for the first two semesters and was among the top 5 rankers in my batch of 120. I continued to work harder and in my third semester I landed an online blogging job. I began working as a freelance content writer and earned good money for the two and a half years that I worked. Managing studies, college, household chores/errands and work wasn’t easy, but my hardworking nature and sheer determination helped me sail through. Meanwhile, things in my house got even worse, I was openly treated like a slave and my relationship with my mother hit rockbottom. As for my relationship with my father, we were simply diplomatic as he would be nice to me on my face but hate me to guts behind my back. 
For the hardcore gadget-lover that I am, I began purchasing gadgets with the money I earned via blogging. And my brother didn’t hesitate to cause damage to my beloved gadgets either. Upon informing my parents, they simply told me that they won’t reimburse or compensate for any loss, and that I am fully responsible for buying the gadgets and for any damage inflicted by my brother. My mother has always been jealous of my success, and she has never wanted me to outshine my brother. Quite naturally, she couldn’t stand my gadgets or my earnings either and sided with my brother, thus helping him damage/steal/destroy my expensive devices that I purchased through my hard work.


I was supposed to begin my Law internship in February 2019. Everything was finalised and then the COVID-19 pandemic took the world by storm. One year of my life got wasted – the internship fell through. Just sitting at home, studying, taking online exams, and doing the blogging job. I quit the job in November to focus on my final year’s assignments. Because of the pathetic level of corruption in every level of infrastructure in our country, the students of my batch got F*d big-time. Instead of conducting online internships and teaching us practical legal work (such as drafting, compliance), the Professors simply wasted our time (and future) by teaching us irrelevant stuff during our online classes and piling us with assignments. This continued for the final two semesters; we submitted our final thesis and graduated this Fall. 


Throughout these 5 years, I have been suicidal multiple times. I have no support at home or outside. I have been a constant victim of depression for the last seven years and now I am tired of fighting it. I am the guy who graduated from a prestigious Law College as a ranker (Top 5) but with zero work/internship experience and zero practical knowledge. I look back at the younger version of myself and hang my head in shame. My dream was to be financially independent at 23, but here I am at 23, dependent on my parents with no career or future at all. I am tired of Law and I am already out of time in this profession. I simply cannot spend the next 3 years of my life working as a free slave under a senior Lawyer only for the purpose of learning the very fundamental aspects and basics of this profession (ethics, drafting, pleading, conveyance). My once bright-and-promising career is now doomed and I have absolutely no future now. I want to quit. This career is over.
I’ve tried my level best fighting all the suicidal thoughts over the past 5 years, trying to hold onto the last bit of hope, but I’m simply exhausted, worn out and hopeless. The guy for whom giving up was never an option has now given up. I’m ashamed of myself as I find myself to be a shell of the smart, promising guy I once used to be. The enhanced mental torture at home during this lockdown/pandemic has consumed me and turned me into something I’m not. I’m not loved, not wanted, a total failure career-wise and I can’t see myself going on like this. My career suicide happened when my father pushed me into Law 5 years ago and I’m paying the price today.


My narcissistic and manipulative parents had no right to bring me to this world and treat me like a piece of shit. I wasn’t even raised by my mother, rather I was raised by a nanny while my mother raised and breastfed my brother. My father betrayed me while I kept trusting him blindly and idolizing him despite all that I went through at home. He could’ve changed everything in a second but he chose not to and allowed me to be toyed around at home. I wish I had a loving and caring home, a supportive family. Today, my brother who has stolen HUGE amounts of cash from my parents (over the last decade) and once made their lives troublesome is now the ideal guy for my father simply because he has found a way in his career.


My life has no meaning, no purpose. All those motivational videos on Youtube or podcasts don’t help either. Those are simply generic advice that never analyse the external factors a person has to deal with, external situations that are beyond one’s control.
I’m a victim of my circumstances, a victim of my own fate. I have never drank or smoked, always been the good, polite, kind guy who always cares for others and respects others. But this world is cruel, selfish and cold. Good guys like me don’t get rewarded, we only suffer and perish. But bad, crooked guys like my evil brother are appreciated and rewarded in this world.
I have lost the zeal in my life, lost all my motivation and drive, and I’m as lifeless and lonely as a rock lying on the pavement. I’ve forgotten what happiness or harmony tastes like, and my sole existence is so empty that even the wind wouldn’t care to blow me away. My parents don’t care about my career anymore (my father sees me as a loser and my mother is happy that I’m stuck and trailing). I’ve lost all ambition in life now and I don’t know where my dead career goes from here expect for the fact that the door is open for me to commit suicide. 
I’ve tried everything in my capacity to overcome my hurdles, I’ve used every ounce of energy in my body to fight against all odds and rise above. But all is in vain because my career has hit a dead-end and this situation is beyond my control. I’ve spent 5 years in University for nothing and it’s game over for me now.


I sincerely want to thank everyone who read my story from the beginning to end. It’s a long read and I don’t think my wretched, haphazard story is worth the time you spent reading. I apologise for that, and I personally thank you for walking with me to the final sentence.
This world judges us for who we are not rather than who we are. If only the people who judge saw themselves in the shoes of those who suffer in pain, this world would understand that not everyone who takes his/her life is running away. Sometimes a person has to resort to suicide not because it’s THE way, rather it’s THE ONLY choice he/she is left with.

You only cry for help if there is help to cry for."

I'm hoping that an ex-MongoDB intern can provide some insight into the intern program at Mongo. I'm curious specifically about the following:

1. How are the projects? Are they genuinely interesting? Do they get put into production?
2. How's the culture, and how easy is it to meet and befriend other interns? Are there events?
3. Did this internship help you get interviews and connections at some top tier companies, including those based in SF, etc?

Thank you!"

qrpia1,4,2021-11-11,IBM vs Publicis Sapient,throwaway38203947238,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/qrpia1/ibm_vs_publicis_sapient/,"Hello!

I have been super grateful to receive offers from IBM as a Front End Intern and Publicis Sapient as an SWE intern. However, my offer from IBM expires **tomorrow** and I'm conflicted on what to choose. I am currently a third year (junior) student and this would be my last internship before graduation.

&amp;#x200B;

IBM definitely has the bigger ""name"" and could potentially open up more doors when I'm applying for new-grad/full-time roles next year. However, IBM offered me a front end role and I'm looking to do more full-stack (as my previous experiences have been front-end as well) and I feel like accepting IBM will make it difficult for me to pursue full-stack or back-end roles unless I make a full-stack/back-end project to help boost my resume. I've also heard not great things about IBM's culture and the WLB which is definitely important to me. Publicis, on the other hand, would offer me a full-stack experience but the internship would consist of working on a group project with other interns rather than being integrated onto the team (which would happen at IBM).

&amp;#x200B;

Something else to keep in mind is that I have some final round interviews with companies both this week and next week which I would accept over both of these companies if I was to receive an offer. My main issue is how tight the IBM deadline is (PS's deadline isn't until early December). 

**TL;DR: IBM offered me a front end role but I'm looking to do something full stack for my final internship before graduation. PS would give me that full stack experience but the internship would consist of working on a group project with other interns.** 

Should I accept IBM and potentially renege them later or just reject IBM now, see how my interviews turn out, and accept PS if I don't receive any other offers?

&amp;#x200B;

Any insight is appreciated (especially if you have interned at either company before), thank you so much!!

qrpopu,18,2021-11-11,Clown managers are in all fields of work not just retail. Job offer rescinded after viewing college transcripts.,madmax299,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/qrpopu/clown_managers_are_in_all_fields_of_work_not_just/,"I see a lot of abhorrent manager stories here but most are from retail and restaurants where you have a lot of incompetent, uneducated, and inexperienced management. So here is a story from a white collar engineering perspective.



This happened two years ago when I was first looking for a software engineer job out of college. I went to a notoriously difficult school, with competitive students and learned an ungodly amount of stuff for a bachelor's degree. This meant my grades were usually a B- or C+. But overall GPA was a 3.0


I interviewed for a entry level programmer job, it was extremely casual and no technical questions. I am the best candidate they've interviewed by far. A few days later I get an automated rejection. Oh well. Then the next day I get a call that they're writing me an offer letter. They ask what my salary range is, like they don't have one thenselves. I say 70k, which is low for the field, and the hiring manager laughs at me. Then a few days later they need to see proof of my degree which I didn't have yet so I sent transcripts showing degree completed. I didn't censor any of my grades. 100% guaranteed they saw a few C+ grades and got worried (in subjects they have no clue about that covered 2x the usual amount). I get a call the next day saying they changed their mind on hiring me but can offer me a paid internship. I accept and say I'll go ahead with the internship. A week passes and then I hear there is actually no internship. Lol. Since then I was hired at their superior competitor making way more than they wanted to pay me."

The people that I know for a fact have plenty of free time, meanwhile, claim to be doing 6 internships at once that I've never heard about (usually with the title ""student researcher"", ""ambassador"", ""social media intern"", ""event director"", etc). And, obviously, despite them not actually doing much of anything at these positions , this second group's resume appears substantially better and gives the impression they have more experience.

Maybe this is a brazenly obvious fact of life, but I hate the idea that it seems to pay off more to accrue a bunch of superficial ""research"" and ""marketing intern"" positions more than it does a couple of demanding club roles, or part-time jobs.

Obviously in the real-world of thorough job interviewing, the people that have experience could get sifted out from those that amass a bunch of random internships, but in the handshake-student-internship world of software-resume-sorting, the ""more the better"" approach has a distinct advantage.  ... which (at the risk of sounding butthurt) at least in my view, disadvantages people that take risks, are  passionate about what they do, and/or need to financially support themselves.

This isn't something I've thoroughly researched at all and is entirely anecdotal, so lmk if I am wrong, but imo this seems to be the case.

... And (as someone with a time-consuming job and club role) if anyone has any advice on how to counteract this resume-wise, lmk..."

I got myself into a somewhat tricky situation and I would appreciate any opinions on that matter. 

A week ago company A offered me an internship position which I was happy about and I confirmed via Email that I would like to accept their offer. 

One day after I have accepted the offer, company B wrote me and said that they would like to have an interview with me to discuss a potential internship.
I went through with the interview, because I thought that it couldn't hurt, and I have to say, that the internship company B offers is better in pretty much every single aspect. 
Company B said that they need up to 10 days to decide whether or not I get the internship (because there were of course other applicants).

The issue is, that comany A already sent me a contract and they want me to sign in the next few days, so I can't wait for company B to respond. 
The contract that company A sent, clearly says that I can cancle the contract immediatly within the first 4 weeks without a reason, so I am thinking of just signing the contract 
and if I get a positve responds from company B, I would simply quit. However, I feel like a total piece of shit for doing this, because company A probably already told other candidates 
that the position is taken and that they are no longer interested in them and they would have to interview new candidates...
I considered to tell company A about the position I am in, but if company B decides for someone else, and company A also says that they cant wait or won't wait that long, then I am 
stuck without an internship which I badly need. 

Does anyone have an idea how to handle the situation better, or is it fair to put my own interests first like this?"
qrwdpm,2,2021-11-11,Offers: Deloitte Cyber RFA Analyst vs EY CDP Technology Consultant,Ironhombre,Big4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Big4/comments/qrwdpm/offers_deloitte_cyber_rfa_analyst_vs_ey_cdp/,"Debating between these two offers, could use some help. I’m an engineering graduate, the comp is pretty much the same for both. My past internship experience is in software engineering and I’d like to stay close to software development. Ideally as much coding and exposure to different technologies as possible, I’ll probably exit into tech in a year or two. 

I really liked what the Deloitte partner had to say about possible placements for me. Development oriented projects or pen testing, things of that nature. My background is in development, not Cyber. I’m sure they have plenty of tools and internal development to work on? I hope that’s the case because I definitely don’t want to get sucked into monitoring and analysis.

On the other hand EY won’t even tell you the sub group you’ll be placed in before accepting your offer. Some of the groups sound really interesting, but I honestly have no idea what they entail. The recruiter said there’s a need for engineers/programmers so I don’t need to worry about that skill going to waste. Is that true or am I gonna be pushing power points?

Which position is going to give me the most opportunities to learn so that I can pivot to Software Engineering in a year or two?"

I landed my dream job at new space company as a propulsion engineer designing rocket engines! I got a BS in Mechanical Engineering with \~3.5 GPA and two six-month internships in undergrad (non-aerospace). I also did 2 years worth of rocket club experience at my school, including being team lead for one year. With that experience, I still couldn't find any aerospace positions I wanted, couldn't even get interviews for the companies I wanted to work for.

I went back to grad school to get my MS in Mechanical Engineering, spent two years doing aerospace related research and graduated with a \~3.9 GPA (grad school classes are way harder, but way easier to get an A in my experience). Both BS and MS were at a state school that is far from top rated. I also took a six-month internship at a space company between years in my masters. I defended my thesis a few months ago with no jobs lined up and no interviews. I stuck with it and kept applying.

I received 3 (three!) offers to work at space companies developing rockets. Even better is that they're offering well above what I expected to be paid! It's been a long journey to get here, but I'm very glad to be in this position and to finally see my hard work paying off. Now I'm looking forward to the start of the next chapter working in industry!

Don't give up on chasing those dream positions!

My advice for Freshman/Sophomores/Juniors wanting to do similar work, but struggling to find jobs/internships: 

Join a club at your school ASAP. Get very involved. If you're not getting any work, keep showing up, asking questions, and stick around after the meeting ends to ask for projects to work on. Not all the projects will be glamorous or exciting immediately, but if you stick with it and put your best effort in, you'll start to get more important and more exciting work. I recommend a rocket club or FSAE, but do whatever you can get projects on that you're interested in. You'll have to sacrifice a bit of your free time, but it will pay off. Almost every interview question I got was related to my experience in rocket clubs, not the year and a half of internships I did (though I don't know how big of a role they played in landing me the interview). If you wait to join until your senior year, you won't have anything resume worthy until the end of the year, after you've ideally lined something up.

qrxi1s,1,2021-11-11,I Feel MASSIVELY Helpless,[deleted],Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/qrxi1s/i_feel_massively_helpless/,"This is gonna be a bit of an all over the place vent, so thanks for bearing with me.

I just turned 27 last month, honestly had the best and only successful birthday outing ever for the first time since my 16th birthday. It was the most fun I've had with a friend who wasn't my (long-distance) girlfriend in the past year and some. Now that friend's quitting where we work together and for the first time in my seven years of working at my job, I'm actually really fucking shook by the her leaving. Not that I haven't had any friends at work before that really touched my heart, but goddamn I've never actually felt so solidly comfortable and connected with a local friend before.

On top of that it's the four-year death anniversary of my co-worker who got shot. I had to drive his girlfriend to the active crime scene and honestly, I'll never get over that. So yea, extra pressure.

My girlfriend, who is a medical intern, is moving back home this week and she's been ghosting me for over seven days now, I'm honestly kinda frustrated? I completely understand she's busy and tired as fuck, but she leaves all my well-wishes or attempts to cheer her up on read. Right now, it really feels like I need her to talk to because she understands fully who I am and the shit going on at my house. I'm doing the whole, hanging back and letting her comeback to me when she's ready, but it's honestly super painful.

Now the big jewel of my reason for feeling like I'm drowning in a massive vat of helpless goop, the general state of massive paranoia in the world. I don't really care if you believe in conspiracy or mess with the shit-show that is modern American politics, but can we all collectively agree people have gone INSANE? People are entitled to believe/do whatever (at least I hope within the certain realm of legality and morality) makes them happy, but omigod can we all CALM THE FUCK DOWN.

At the hotel I work at, I have people coming in with buckets on their heads and spraying a trail of Lysol on the ground and getting mad because we don't have a hot breakfast while simultaneously screaming that us being at 100% occupancy is irresponsible because of COVID spiking cases.

I'm tired of hearing people speak like politicians are the equivalents of messianic beings or saying there's massive underground trafficking rings for Satanic vampires funded by Travis Scott who killed people with 5G and bullshit like that. Let's all collectively get a grip and think of how INSANE all this sounds, how fanatical every side of politics have gotten. All any of this has divided people more than they were pre-COVID, it feels like it's only gonna get worse. Politicians/government have and will never be trustworthy or work without a hidden agenda. Having the vaccine doesn't make you a better person, not wearing a mask doesn't make you a better person. EVERYBODY HAS A CHOICE OF WHAT TO DO WITH THEIR BODIES AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH.

People have gone into this state of MASSIVE PARANOIA and it's like goddamn, I'm watching people in my family go from relatively open-minded to going full-dive paranoid hate-machines. Literally, it fucking breaks my heart to see people I've adored be so poisoned and blindly follow such bullshit. Because no political ideology, Left or Right, is worth fucking turning your back on another human being even if you don't agree.

I don't know if people will ever be normal or not influenced by out of the realm of reality conspiracy and the absolute embarrassment of ""modern journalism"" (aka mass media owned by the same 4 companies), but goddamn I feel like there's no hope and no way for me to even make the smallest dent in the massive wave of insanity.

Honestly, at this point, the only thing keeping me going this week is memes and the new DUNE movie which has me reading the book (pretty solid tbh). ""Fear is the mind killer"" has never been such a goddamn relevant quote.

TLDR: People have gone insane, everybody's leaving me, and I can't do anything about it."

But I do not hold EU citizenship. Before applying to jobs, I want to know what are the odds that companies in the EU willing to sponsor new graduates. If anyone is tried this what are the outcomes?

I have used C++, C, and Python(for automating stuff) in my internships.

I'm a computer science major who's been in a rut for years, and I'm looking to get another internship related to my field. I haven't had my resume reviewed in QUITE some time so I know it's probably a mess. Since 2018 my job history's been spotty, none of those jobs have lasted long enough to warrant listing them, and I've dropped the ball in my studies (hence not including my GPA on the resume). I also have no relevant organization/volunteer experience to list, I've done neither since high school and I graduated years ago. How can I make myself more appealing to employers?

* Should I list projects I've done, even if I haven't done them in awhile? Should I list personal projects and school ones?
* I've heard making your resume too colorful or flashy actually discourages employers. Is this true, or should I make my resume look less boring?

I was just making my resume for trying to get a summer internship. And, not shockingly, I have nothing to write except some awards and my GPA. Past few days, I have decided to also do something extra like learning android development, but I get no time to even fucking start at the end of the day. I am really tense right now and confused. I cant get what I want.

Do you think I should trade off my (almost) perfect score to learn something else, like android or web development? I know this might sound weird, but I am genuinely confused.

I'm also feeling a bit stale in my current role and I find I enjoy project work more than BAU/maintenance.

Currently my TC (base+super+bonus) is ~130K full time which is equivalent to $577K daily rate according to http://www.contractorpermie.com so I guess I'd be applying for the $600-700 daily rate type gigs. 

Have gone from 

* startup (part-time 8 months) -&gt;
* internship (part-time 6 months) -&gt; 
* internship (full time 1 year) -&gt; 
* full-time (1 year)

So have approx 3 years experience doing a mix of webdev doing react, vue, vanilla js and backend mostly python/nodejs/sql/mongodb/AWS and microservices plus some jenkins and minor kubernetes stuff. I also have a Computer Science degree.

Atm I'm thinking it may be worth jumping one more time to get Java monolith experience in an enterprise environment as I've heard it's basically mandatory for any government contract regardless of whether you actually use Java as it tends to be omnipresent.

I'm also thinking it's probably a good idea to complete either an AWS Solutions Architect, Azure Equivalent or Google K8s cert to show I do actually know how to use the Cloud. 

As far as contracting niches I guess I would prefer to not do web and do data engineer/pure backend so wondering if it's required to have full-time experience doing Scala/Hadoop etc. or if certification would be enough? I'm somewhat familiar due to personal projects."

qs2721,2,2021-11-11,Deciding Between New-Grad Offers - Deloitte (NYC) vs CapitalOne (Wilmington) PLEASE HELP!,imtooflytodie,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qs2721/deciding_between_newgrad_offers_deloitte_nyc_vs/,"I am a senior graduating with a computer science degree, and currently have two offers that I have a few weeks to decide on, and I would really like some help.

One is from Deloitte, in the position of Solutions Engineer Analyst, with a starting salary of $90K in New York City. The other is from CapitalOne, for a classic Software Engineer position in the TDP (Technology Development Program), with a starting salary of $116K in Wilmington, Deleware.

Though on the surface it might seem like an easy choice because of a significant salary difference, location is really big for me, as I really thrive off exciting life outside of work/school, and I have completely fallen in love with NYC and all the opportunities for that there. Because of this, and with Deloitte still being a livable wage, I am quite heavily leaning towards Deloitte.

**However, my main reservation is in fact with the work itself.** I have done two summer internships, both of which were traditional software dev positions, both specifically being full-stack web development. CapitalOne seems to offer something much closer to that, and I feel like I am guaranteed a much more ""safe"" route career- and experience-wise with it.

In order words, I feel like if I do move on from my first job, CapitalOne's position description and the experience I got from it would be taken quite well by other companies with traditional software development jobs.

With Deloitte, on the other hand, it's not so clear. Firstly, the work would change every few months as I switch projects. Secondly, it's hard to know what my day-to-day could look like, how similar it would be to a normal software engineering job at CapitalOne, for example. Because of this, my fear is that if I moved on from Deloitte, my experience wouldn't be valued as seriously and I would have started my full-time career on a bad foot if I'm going down the software development route, which so far is where I've been going and likely see myself continuing down.

**So my main question is really:** are my reservations about this fairly accurate? Would this position from Deloitte not be considered as seriously by, say, a job recruiter later down the line for a normal software job? Or is it not really the case, and software work at Deloitte is taken as respectfully as with a company like CapitalOne.

Any and all advice is appreciated! Additionally, if something else sticks out to you that you'd like to bring up to me, I'd really appreciate that as well. Thank you everyone!"
qs2usa,9,2021-11-11,"I can't deal with the memories of abuse and continued abuse, suicide seems like the only good option",S-u-n-f-l-w-r-s,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qs2usa/i_cant_deal_with_the_memories_of_abuse_and/,"It feels that all my life has been filled with blackmail and abuse. I've tried to hard to move past it but recent events have put me back into the worst mental state ever.

My dad suffered from a lot of health issues and was interned into a mental health facility against his will about 4 months ago. He was finally discharged a month and a half ago and came home. Upon coming home we find out that a nurse at the facility was sending him love letters, and a bit of talking later it seems that she had kissed him and had an obsession for him. Obviously I don't know what else may have happened but the general consensus was that he cheated on my mum.

My mum has obviously not taken this well, but she's completely lost it on my dad. Every day, without fail, she goes and screams and argues with my dad very loudly, sometimes she even hits him and puts him outside in the cold and takes the key away. She sometimes laughs hysterically and does not seem okay. She completely does not care about my existence in this house, the neighbors, anyone.

She wants him to leave the house, but the problem is they both have ownership over the house and its under a mortgage. We're also under stay at home orders where I'm at right now. Sometimes the argument starts at lunch time or dinner time and goes through well into the night - 4am usually and on average she can go for 14 hours of arguing, yelling and screaming. Now, we have very thin walls and I sit constantly in screaming and yelling. I've cried and gone and begged her to stop but she ignores me or screams at me and gets angry because she wants me to yell and abuse my dad as well.

A week ago I got very sick and had the worst migraine and fever. I was crying and throwing up at 2am and begging her to stop, but she just looks at me so coldly and ignores me. I started self harming because I felt like I didn't want to exist anymore and she kept ignoring me and looked right through me. I feel like I don't exist to her anymore. I don't know how long I can take this anymore. I know being cheated on is bad, I am not trying to invalidate her feelings at all, I've sat and validated her for hours at a time. I don't know what else to do. She treats me like I do not have any feelings and is stone cold to me, will only talk to me if I'm validating her feelings and shit talking my dad. She honestly scares me.

She told me if I called the police she would make sure to tell them that I am lying and paint it out like I abused her. I'm so sick from this. She pushed my dad the other day and he cracked his skull open and bled everywhere. Immediately I lost it and she warned that she'd call the police and blame it on me or intern me in the hospital ""because you're crazy like your dad"" if I don't shut up. Then both her and my dad called the ambulance and lied about him falling. The other problem is that my dad never really cared about me. He won't even talk to me or try work with me, but that's just his personality. He told me I was a b word the other day. I feel so alone and awful. Calling the police won't be an option because I'm truly scared she'll start doing the same things she is doing to my dad. She even did this to me when I was a kid, because I wasn't making money (I KNOW it sounds absurd and quite honestly I do not think she is mentally well) or when she'd get angry that I was lazy - I was literally 12 and she'd kick me out of the house by the hair in my pajamas and lock me out and let me sit there for hours while I cried while she taunted me. I am constantly worried for both her and my dad and I feel so drained and sick. I can't understand this situation.

I feel so guilty, when she yells at me and screams that I don't want to confront my dad. She says that this whole situation of her screaming and me not being able to sleep is his fault. I did confront him about things, but apparently it wasn't enough. She even went as far as to say that he was my ""lover"" because I wouldn't scream at him 24/7 like she does. She has no limits. I don't have it in me to scream at someone and hit them, I just don't. I wish she would understand how big a toll this is taking on me. I feel guilty because my dad is still sick and I don't want to yell at him. All my childhood I've been abused by both of them in unique ways, and none of them stood up for me ever and honestly I want to heal and move on. But she is very stuck in her ways, she also decided to blame the abuse she put me through all on my dad. She wants me to stand up for her. I feel like an asshole, I can't deal with this anymore, I feel so sad and anxious and alone. She's constantly reminding me of all the awful things her and my dad have done to me, obviously saying that my dad influenced her to do them (honestly I do not think this is true). I've spiraled so bad and I have suicidal thoughts all the time"

The thing is, I'm not sure what the new grad timeline would look like for someone who graduates early a semester, any clarification for that would be great. I also don't really know how I would do applying for fall 2022 internships in spring 2022 since although I could have ""Incoming at Amazon"" on my resume, I wouldn't have any real internship experience to talk about just yet.

I feel confident that I could do well and secure a full-time offer (at Amazon at least, I suppose), but if I graduate a semester early do I just have to wait a semester and do nothing or can I apply to these companies right away? Still, getting another internship at a top company might be easier than applying for the New Grad positions. I'm pretty conflicted.

My long-term goal is to retire by 30, so that's one of the reasons why I would like to graduate early, but I would like to get a new grad position at a big name tech company that will open a lot of doors for me. I think Amazon full-time would be decent, but I would like to do a little better.

For context, i have a law degree and a master’s degree in Human Rights (specifically in the Middle East where i am from) and took an internship with an NGO which i loved. 

I never really liked the idea of being a lawyer in a law firm and it’s why I pursued a master’s degree that isn’t directly related. 

I come from a country where you need to take 2 bar exams to become an official lawyer: the 1st one is right after graduation, and the 2nd one should be taken after 4 years of work in a legal firm. 

I passed the 1st exam and started working in a respectable law firm, i am good at being a lawyer but i really dislike it. 
I took the 2nd exam and i failed it, however my law firm didn’t want me to quit (they want me to take it a second time) and so they gave me a very decent raise. 

I personally don’t want to take the bar exam a second time, as i feel like i wasted enough time on a career I dislike, and i prefer to start looking for a job in international NGOs, which is what i studied in my postgraduate degree and it’s what i love. 

The second exam will not take place before 6-8 months, and the results may take about a year, and I’m confused and don’t know what to do.

Deciding to take the bar exam again means i have to stay in my law firm for at least one more year (i have to be actively registered as a lawyer in a law firm to take it).

Deciding not to take it means I’m throwing away the last 4-5 years of my life, but it also means i can start applying for jobs i want (my initial plan was to apply to these jobs as an official lawyer which could be a plus but i have my master’s degree which makes up for it).

Any advice?"

My goal is to get a CS degree and work for Jane Street or a comparable FinTech company with 1- 2 years of graduating.

Right now, I have a BS is Business Administration, and I'm planning to start taking classes to prepare for CS in March 2022 
-3 calc courses
-2 stats
-1 discrete math
-1 linear algebra
-1 differential equations
-1 phys (mechanics)
-3 CS/IT

This should take about 1 year, and then I want to transfer to the CS post-bacc at Oregon State University. The OSU program should take another 1.5- 2 years, and I'm going to try to get FinTech internships while studying. After graduating, I'm hoping to get an MSCS from a top grad program. If I don't get into a top master's program right away, then I'm planning to get a graduate certificate in financial engineering before applying again.

Ideally, I would like to have an offer (or internship) at one of the firms I've mentioned after graduating OSU, but if that doesn't happen then I'm planning to apply again after getting a grad certificate, again while studying for MSCS, and again after finishing my master's degree, if necessary.

Obviously nobody has a crystal ball or knows all the answers, but does this plan make sense? Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!"

* Academic Reputation
* Chance to Study There at Grad School After Graduation
* Chance to Find a Summer Internship After the Semester (either in industry or in a research lab)
* Possibly Low Life Expenses or Chance to Have Scholarships or Erasmus+ Grants (I know probably all cities are expensive, though. And although my income isn't very low for my country's student standards, it's very low compared to these countries. So, even a discounted dorm room would be very helpful.)
* Cultural/Geographical Closeness to Balkans (I'm from a Balkan country, so I'm looking for possibly a place not very different from here.)

So next tuesday I have a job interview for my 'graduation internship' (something Dutch) for a front-end developer position. They described the function as: 'HTML, CSS, Javascript and a bit of React'. Now I am not an IT student and I don't have a lot of experience with Javascript (like I made a simple Battleships game using too much code and some small other stuff.). I do have a lot more of HTML and CSS knowledge but I am not being educated for this kind of postion (like web developer). But still my study (Communication &amp; Multimedia Design) has some simular courses and I personally like to become a front-end developer. So I still applied for this function and I am invited to see them for an interview.

So basically what I'm struggeling with, is that I may not be qualified because I don't have much Javascript experience, and I still need to learn a lot when it comes to web developing. But I really want this job so I can learn it!! 

Please let me know if you understand my situation and if you experienced something like this. And how did it go or how do you work this out!"

Due to the madness of the admissions season (and me moving halfway across the country), it's only now getting published.

There was also some 'no you do it' going back in forth between Alex and me, so if you like this, please throw him an upvote too so I don't feel bad about being the one to post it.

For online networking, the premier professional hub is Linkedin. Linkedin has the largest professional user-base of any networking site in the world. 

Linkedin is often the first platform where industry pros share important announcements about opportunities that may be relevant to you. Internship opportunities, digital introduction meetings, webinars, and important pieces of news are all circulating on Linkedin. 

The platform also allows new users to connect directly with seasoned industry veterans, so LinkedIn can offer an amazing opportunity to students who are beginning to dip their toes into the professional waters. 

But with power comes great responsibility. Having access to everyone under the sun **does not** mean that you should reach out without first planning about your approach. 

## The Basics: Setting up a Profile

The first step in conquering Linkedin is to complete your profile in a way that attracts the right kind of attention to yourself. That means being thorough and filling out each major section of your profile. 

**Photos**: Start by adding a nice, professional profile picture (or at least one where you’re looking at the camera and your eyes are open!) and a banner photo. If you don’t know what to add for a banner photo, I would recommend something non-controversial and easy to look at, like a nature photo. Banner photos are sized at 1400 x 425 pixels. 

**Bio**: In the bio section of your profile, write a short paragraph summarizing some key elements about who you are, why you’re on Linkedin, and what kind of opportunities you’re looking to attract. Be modest and realistic in your bio. You don’t need to inflate your accomplishments or pad your resume. It’s OK to not have an extensive bench of experiences. Just be truthful. 

**Experience Section**: Fill out whatever experience sections you can without misleading. If you’ve worked a job, add that to your resume. If you participate in extracurricular activities (debate, athletics, an esports team, etc.) make sure to list that as well. Focus on filling in the one or two most meaningful experiences you’ve had. 

With each experience you have a choice about whether to add a description or not. It’s perfectly OK to leave it blank: this may be the best course of action if you’re feeling unsure about what to write. 

If you do fill out the description, provide succinct, bulleted summaries of your achievements and responsibilities. Limit your bulleted count to 3 per experience (not a hard rule, but a best practice to avoid fluff). 

As a student, you may not have the most extensive resume. Don’t worry about it. Just represent who you are truthfully and with humility; people will see that and appreciate your honesty. 

## Building your Network on LinkedIn

### Searching for Contacts

Searching for people is probably the most straightforward method, and if you’ve got a definite idea of who you want to find, this works well.  For example, if you were trying to find Bill Gates, just type “Bill Gates”.  

But let’s say you’re trying to find everyone who works at Facebook in a given location.  As there are a lot of people at Facebook, you’ll find yourself scrolling through, but eventually you’ll run into the “Commercial Search Limit.”

Unlike other social media, LinkedIn only makes a portion of its money from ads.  Instead, they want to pay for Premium.  And unless you’re willing to shell out $40 or more a month for a premium subscription, LinkedIn will limit your search results.

Instead, think of the search bar as a bit of a scalpel; use it sparingly, but it can help you find the most effective path to a specific person or company.

### Deepen contact searches by using company filters

Earlier, we used the example of Facebook as a company that you might want to research.  Scrolling through the tens of thousands of people who work at Facebook is exhausting.  Instead, try this.

Search for Facebook, then click the company’s profile on LinkedIn.  

From there, you’ll see a number of tabs, one of which is the People tab. 

Click it, and suddenly you can sort through Facebook’s employees based on where they live, where they went to college, their job function, and their skills.  

Now this does count towards that Commercial Search cap, but here’s the thing - even with that cap, LinkedIn still displays two or three top results.  If you’re searching for Engineers who use Python and went to UC Berkeley, then you can do that, and find someone who meets that description.

### One more ninja strategy for outreach: Use LinkedIn Groups

Typically, when you find someone on LinkedIn, you’ll message them via a connect request. We cover the best practices for composing a message below. 

The basic problem with outreach messages is that the length of those messages is capped.  Sometimes, you’ll need a few extra letters.

The solution for that is LinkedIn Groups. 

LinkedIn Groups exist for a variety of interests; there are groups devoted solely to networking, and there are groups devoted to incredibly precise topics. 

Ideally, you’ll want to join a few groups that are interesting to you, even if you don’t participate in the discussion. Many of them are full of people who think they know everything, but they can be a useful way to add new stories to your feed.

But that’s not why you should join groups. 

**Instead, you can message people who are also in your groups without a cap on the character count. If you’ve found someone whose work really resonates with you, this is a great way to do it.** 

Here’s how to **really** make sure your message gets noticed:

* Wait until they say something in a group (or in their own feed) and message them in reference to it.  
* If you really want to zero in on someone, follow them and then comment on their posts - this is much more effective than most other methods when the person you want to connect with is incredibly famous.

## How to outreach like a pro

It can be a bit scary to do “cold” outreach to strangers on LinkedIn. But remember: making cold introductions is what the platform is for. 

That said, it’s important to not overstep boundaries with your outreach, or to ask for something that’s unrealistic. 

If you’re sending invites and messages to Marc Merrill, CEO of Riot Games, don’t expect much in return. For business leaders at smaller, more accessible companies, you may stand a better chance at getting through - but here, you need to make sure you’re sending the right message. 

Generally speaking, you shouldn’t expect a cold contact to be very interested in reading an essay-length message. Your first outreach should be short and to the point, with a pre-written message that clearly conveys a few things:   


1. Who you are. 
2. Why you’re reaching out and why you want to connect.
3. What your “ask” is. (This one may be optional depending on your goal in reaching out.) 

Here’s an example of a short, well-formatted Linkedin outreach message: 

Hi \[FIRST NAME\]! I’m a \[high school/college\] student exploring opportunities in the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ industry. I’m trying to learn from professionals who focus on \[TOPIC\]. I would love to connect in a brief introductory meeting to ask your advice about my future. Do you have any time in the next week for a 15-minute chat? Thanks! 

You might not want to schedule a meeting right away. If so, your message might look like this: 

Hi \[FIRST NAME\]. I’m a high school student--just wanted to connect with some professionals in the \_\_\_\_\_\_ industry. Thanks!

From there, provided you find some willing folks, you should be able to set up a fairly consistent stream of introductory meetings. You’ll be well on your way to building out your Linkedin network. 

## Conclusion

With that, you probably know more about using LinkedIn than your parents and teachers do.  If used properly, it’s an incredibly powerful platform.  Again, you don’t have to show out on it (trust me, doing so will get the occasional eye roll).  Instead, be honest, be yourself, and start building your network."

This is solely me asking about what would be the best way to approach this situation from a career-wise perspective, hence why I'm here asking about my particular situation.*

--------

- So I'm a brand new developer straight out of college with a Computer Engineering degree, in a fairly large company that started late July 2021.

- My team is based entirely out of India, except me. 
- I have never done any web development in my life, but wanted to try it, so I asked for that kind of work in my team-selection process and this is where they put me. I understand I asked for this, but I feel that've put a lot of responsibility on me. 

- They basically have tasked me with basically becoming the main developer for a web-application that two interns wrote this past summer. The interns are now gone and so I don't really have a point of contact for asking for help on technical side of this application, so I've mostly been tracing back code-flow via debuggers, chrome developer tools, and trial and error myself.

- Throughout all this, I've made big life changes, having moved into the city on my own, dealing with ADHD, relationship issues, and having dealt with depression for almost a year. 

- **I have finally reached a point this week where I have literally done almost no work and I feel that my depression is to the point where it hinders my ability to get out of bed, work, and gather the motivation to start on a task.**

- It doesn't help that since my team is entirely based out of India, it is very hard to communicate with them on my own time, it makes me look bad as a new developer because I take much longer to complete my tasks. I work remote 3/5 days of the week with nobody to talk to on my team even when I am on site. Then the ADHD doesn't help the very few days I finally have the motivation to work on something, but the concentration isn't there. And the rest of the days, I'm too depressed to get out of bed to even get on my standup call.

- **I really don't want to tell my work about my mental state, but I feel that if I don't communicate to my work somehow, I'll look really bad and that I'm a lazy developer when I don't mean to be at all... I just want to know what might be some good things from a career standpoint to do from this point out to finally get back on my feet again?**"
qsk2o0,3,2021-11-12,How should I fire my friend who works for me (And should I fire him at all)?,Designer_Nectarine_1,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/qsk2o0/how_should_i_fire_my_friend_who_works_for_me_and/,"So about four months ago, I was allowed to hire an intern to help me with my workload (everyone works from home). I shared the job opening on social media and a friend who used to be my roommate and works in the same field as I applied. He got the job, mainly because I knew that his work was good.

In the meantime, I got a promotion to team manager. My first promotion + my first intern. So it's up to me to handle this situation.

However, he's been missing deadlines constantly. I know his personal life is a mess; his mom is moving to another country, the landlord is asking for his apartment back; it's a whole thing that started after he was hired. My company is very understanding, and I made it clear that he could get a few days off if needed. I pointed out several times he could come to me if he were finding something difficult. We work remotely, so communication and fulfilling deadlines are paramount. We don't keep track of work hours.

Still, he misses deadlines and leaves me in the dark because he just disappears. On the next day, he apologizes and delivers the work (most of the time incomplete. If he had communicated, I would be able to give early feedback and receive a better final product). 

I told him that, but things did not change. Right now, I'm waiting for a deliverable that was due yesterday.

Again, I know his life is a mess, and not having a job wouldn't help him. And he seems excited about the work on our team's weekly calls. Plus, it would be an ordeal to find another intern.

I'm not sure if I should give him an ultimatum (like, ""fulfill every deadline for the next month, or we'll have to fire you"") or straight-up fire him. I never managed a team, and for the most part, I feel like I'm doing a good job, but now I'm facing this situation of possibly having to fire a friend... I could use some advice!"

I have realised Pen Testing (HTB, THM) may not align with my interests &amp; skills, and I am wondering how I may be able to move my career towards a blend of Cyber (mainly) with some (more than current) programming involved, quite regularly. I appreciate that this may not be something I can do straight out of University, however I am just looking for some ideas about how I may go about achieving what I want, as I gain some experience.

Overall, though I would just like an interesting, fulfilling career path, that's going to make me use brain. (also, I much prefer Cyber working culture over that of SWEs, so that's a no go at the moment)

Any help or input is appreciated, thanks for reading."
qsn1e9,2,2021-11-12,Applying to summer internships late winter.,[deleted],csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/qsn1e9/applying_to_summer_internships_late_winter/,"I get it, I get it, FANNG (MANGA) or bust right? Well, I am probably not going to get a big tech internship, and that's ok. My question is though, what are the chances of me getting any summer internship if I apply late winter/early spring? I am actively Leetcoding but it feels like it is taking forever to feel competent. I personally feel like I just won't be ready until a couple of months from now, I keep bombing the OA's companies send me. Maybe I am dumb? Regardless, let's say I do get good, but not until late winter, will there be any companies looking to hire for Summertime internships around the season?"

qsp9qr,1,2021-11-12,academic v/s personal projects,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qsp9qr/academic_vs_personal_projects/," 

Hello, I am a sophomore pursuing computer science at one of the top 50 schools. All my life, I have given a lot of weightage to academics. In my first year I have had 97%, and on the track to get the same in my second year. I was just making my resume for trying to get a summer internship. And, not shockingly, I have nothing to write except some awards and my GPA. Past few days, I have decided to also do something extra like learning android development, but I get no time to even fucking start at the end of the day. I am really tense right now and confused. I cant get what I want.

Do you think I should trade off my (almost) perfect score to learn something else, like android or web development? I know this might sound weird, but I am genuinely confused. How did you get time for personal projects, or just doing online courses and stuff? I would love to hear about your experience."
qspbua,15,2021-11-12,Confused on what path to take,JuanCiro,quant,https://www.reddit.com/r/quant/comments/qspbua/confused_on_what_path_to_take/,"Hey everyone. I'm very interested in Quant Trading and/or Quant Research, but I'm confused on what path to take to achieve either of those things. Here is some information and questions that I have.

*  I'm an undergrad Junior at a small not very known college. I'm a computer science and math double major with a 3.8 GPA, I have some research experience but have not published and I will also be doing a software engineering internship next summer but it won't be at a well-known company. I'm also very interested in Data Science/Machine Learning. 

Now some of my questions are:

1. To get into QR and QT I've seen that higher education helps, then will a Masters in Machine Learning or Artificial intelligence help me get an internship/job?
2. Is it smart to maybe work a software engineering job for experience then go into Quant or would it be better to just go into a Masters program and apply to internships and hope to get an offer?
3. What kind of things are these companies looking for in a resume? Is it past projects where you're taking in data and applying it in anything or projects that align more with money/trading?
4. Would it be hard to go from Data Scientist/software engineer to Quant? I've heard is easier to go from Quant to Software engineering.

Sorry for the long post. It was about 4 days ago that I actually learned about Quant and it sounded very interesting to me. I was struggling in picking a career where it used math and computer science a lot so I was thinking of Data Science, but Quant sounds very challenging and fun to me."

I could really use some help/advice with what to do next, I am currently a Senior in Uni studying Information Systems and I have started to look into what is next for me. I have started to look into a masters program for either Data analytics, Software engineering, or a ML and AI focus. 

I have taken CS1, a python class, and in the spring I will take a App development class. I have told myself that if I do well in this next class I would like to pursue a masters in a programming discipline whether that me an ""applied computer science"" or an ""masters of software engineering"". Both of my programming classes I made B's in and it seems that any internship I look for is software based, I feel programming is in such demand that everyone is hunting for programmers, and I want to be on of those people who is programming. 

My question is, do you think that someone who comes from another tech discipline like Info Systems could attain a masters software engineering. And I know that I would like to design mobile apps or possibly web apps, I feel like my goal if I were to be a programmer is to make apps/website simpler with their UI simpler and easier to use.

qsr4q9,22,2021-11-12,"Academic Over-Achievement and the Job Market: The Experiences That Led Me to Anti-Work as a Recent Graduate, and My Thoughts on Our Modern Economic and School Systems [Warning: Long]",AntiWorkBurnoutTAway,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/qsr4q9/academic_overachievement_and_the_job_market_the/,"For everyone on here still in school/college that considers themselves an over-achiever, I know it’s long, but consider reading this post. It may make a difference. Take this as a cautionary tale from someone that graduated a year and a half ago, and let me offer you a bit of advice. This is my story, the reasons why I find myself jaded toward a system and lifestyle I once saw as a way forward and now find myself wholeheartedly supporting the message and aims of this sub.

Throwaway, because I’d prefer if this didn’t come back to my personal life, though I don’t care that much. Still feel free to share if you find it helpful.


**TL;DR:** Graduated top of my class (bachelor’s). Pretty privileged guy. Still struggled to find entry-level work. Only got the sort of job I wanted through personal connections and after moving. Still only paid $15/hour. School doesn’t matter on the job market; employers do not care. You are not unique out of school, you are another individual in a mass of recent graduates. Do not listen to people who tell you to do something as a resume builder, it will scarcely help. You will not rise above or stand out from the crowd; employers will look at you as just another faceless cog. Don’t give up on school, just don’t get sucked into the school system to the point it becomes part of your identity, and try to expose yourself to the world outside if you can. Job market is bleak. Modern system sucks for everyone outside the uber-wealthy. Maintain solidarity with the masses wherever you can. Your mileage may vary. Good luck.


I think I’m like a lot of burnouts my age. While in school, I had achieved and excelled at pretty much everything available to me as a student. I was a double major (International Affairs and Political Science) and double minor (Philosophy and an interdisciplinary honors program). I had a 3.99 GPA: my lowest grade was a single A- in Spanish. I participated in extracurriculars (Mock Trial) and an academic student conference. I completed two directed study projects my senior year, both of which were major research papers that stretched over 13,000 words without footnotes – around 50 pages, each. I studied abroad in Europe. I even had a paid internship one summer at a national governmental institution doing real policy analysis. All of this brought me considerable recognition within my department and numerous academic awards. None of this is an exaggeration.

I’ve always been a generally anxious person, having been diagnosed with OCD in my youth. I’ve always been worried about the things I heard online about the modern working world: people my generation unable to move out of their parents’ houses, drowning in debt, dealing with abhorrent working conditions and shitty, aging, out-of-touch employers, barely being able to achieve any semblance of financial security, and looking toward a future that will likely see a decrease in the average standard of living. That said, I always found comfort in my achievements, in the idea that, no matter how bad things were, I would at least find myself ahead of the curve, above my peers. “At least I’m not a fuck-up,” I would think – those are the people that really get screwed by the system. I thought that it took something to achieve what I had, and that those in power would recognize that something in me, and would therefore pick me out of the crowd, use me, and guarantee my wellbeing, because they would come to need me as an asset. I’ll admit, this was a shitty, elitist outlook, but it truthfully is what put my mind at ease in this system where those belonging to the mass are easily discarded. I saw myself above the mass. This was a grave mistake.

I graduated in the Spring of 2020. I began looking for work, hoping to get a job – any job – at a law firm. I see myself becoming an attorney, and I wanted to get experience in the field before inevitably sinking myself into debt with law school, so that I could feel more confident that I wanted to do that sort of work before committing myself to it financially.

I thought I did everything I needed. I had about as strong a resume as a student could have, which I uploaded to Indeed, LinkedIn, and Handshake. I sent applications to every entry-level opening that interested me, ignoring how all of them called for relevant experience that no one my age could possibly have. I re-entered the same information about myself over and over again on company websites. As terrible as it sounds, I even thought I might benefit from my privilege, my being a white man living in the wealthy suburbs of a major city thanks to my parents. And I waited for the responses to flood in. I naively considered what my life might be like with each company I applied to, how I might enjoy the work, what the commute would be like, what restaurants were by the office. If only I knew how much time I was wasting.

No one that I applied to responded. Not an email, not a call. Not even an outright rejection. Just stinging, degrading silence.

One day, I received a single message on LinkedIn from a recruiter, who said I seemed like a good fit for a company she was searching for candidates for. I thought this was my chance, that I was finally going to be recognized, that I’d only been repeatedly rejected so many times because computer software was weeding out my applications for reasons unknown, and now that I was talking to an actual human, they would recognize me for what I was. I was on the highway when I saw the notification come in, so I pulled over and responded to her message within the hour, saying I was interested and asking for more information about the company and position.

She ghosted me.

I was unemployed for a total of five months. In that time, there were two other instances where I thought I had landed a job. The first was when I applied to be a contact tracer for Covid through a state funded program. I completed their training and was told they would reach out in two weeks to assign me to a team… which never happened, as the global pandemic eased up enough that they stopped hiring new people. The second was three months in, when some guy reached out to me on Handshake about a financial advisor role. It sounded interesting and I took the bait. I almost went along with it, until I realized I was being sold on the job rather than being vetted as a candidate; I was going to have to fund my own training, was expected to use friends of my friends and family as a client base, and was essentially just selling people life insurance and an algorithm to manage their finances, all to be paid on commission. It was a borderline scam that looked attractive in my desperation. How naïve I was, that someone would recruit me for something I didn’t even apply to. I wasn’t as special as the recruiter made me feel.

I declined that job. He asked me if I knew anyone else that would be interested. I said no.

After five months of this, I was broken. I was lying around all day, doing nothing but playing video games. I have passions I wish I had pursued in that time, like reading and writing, but I lacked the energy to pursue them. I felt defeated, discarded. And I felt stressed, judged, like I wasn’t doing enough and therefore didn’t deserve to feel happy. Playing games just felt like procrastinating, a temporary distraction to take the edge off and avoid thinking about what a failure I was. I was borderline suicidal: whenever I’d drive anywhere, I contemplated careening my car into a tree. I saw a therapist and went back on SSRI’s, medications I hadn’t been on since high school when my OCD was really bad, but none of that helped me escape my circumstances.

It destroyed me, suddenly going from an environment where I was consistently praised for my accomplishments and told that I would do great things, insulated from the realities of our modern system, to one where those accomplishments meant nothing and I was just another body in the mass of desperate, young people, perceived as useless by those established in society, not worth the effort to train to do anything of value.

I was lucky to break out of this cycle I was in. I attempted again to find something, anything to do. I went to volunteer for the campaign of a local opposition candidate for the House. I thought that, given my background, they’d probably find some use for me, doing research or at least some sort of clerical work. After all, I – a college graduate with a relevant degree and broad academic experience – was now offering an unlimited amount of my time for free, for a cause I at least kind-of cared about. Instead, I found myself at an orientation with a group mostly consisting of retirees, being told that we would be doing cold calling and canvassing. This was a final blow to my pride. In my emails to the organizers, I had made it clear that this was not the sort of work I was interested in doing, but they grouped me with everyone else anyways. Granted, it was late in the election and I had no connections to the party; in retrospect, I shouldn’t have expected to be trusted doing any real work for a political campaign. Still, in tandem with everything that had led up to this point, it was a final straw that made me feel worthless, like everything I had done in my academic career was for nothing. I broke down, and this time, subsequently had a fight with my parents – who are generally pretty sympathetic people – where I was more or less accused of being lazy and told that I had to do something.

I think it’s fair if you, the reader, think this all sounds entitled. It probably is, I was pretty spoiled as a child. Admittedly, the whole job search did involve some teeth-pulling. College was a lot of fun and I enjoyed the free time I had. But I knew I would have to find a job afterwards, and I did genuinely want a job in some ways. A job was necessary for the maturity and financial independence I desired to achieve, so that I could prove to myself that I was able to exist on my own, that I wasn’t some coddled rich kid who had nothing to show for themselves but their parents’ money, that I wasn’t a leach. Still, the whole idea of working 40 hours a week dissuaded me from the process at times. Why work when there’s no immediate need and the better parts of life are in reach? Not that I ever let myself experience those better parts, since I thought them undeserved – instead, I took procrastination with video games as an unhappy acceptable middle ground. On another note, while I do try to open myself up to learn about the harsh realities experienced by the majority of people, to accept that I really don’t have anything (at least materially) that could be called a struggle, it’s hard to undo my sort of upbringing. This all probably made my initial experience of the job market feel more ruinous than it objectively was. Regardless, I resist the conclusion that the fact of my upbringing invalidates my experience, that it’s not worth sharing, that it’s too unrelatable for the majority of people, that nothing can be learned from it. And so I write on.

I know no one promised me a particular job, and perhaps I should have expected the need to put in more work to find one. Maybe I should have looked elsewhere, swallowed my pride, worked retail like almost everyone else my age… but what was I to expect? Teachers, parents, friends’ parents, guidance counselors, scout leaders, media spokesmen, children’s cartoon characters – everyone, society – had told me for as long as I can remember that, if I wanted to do well in life, I had to do well in school. Sure, I’d also heard about societal problems that kept competent people from being able to achieve a decent life – cycles of poverty, racism, sexism, addiction, shitty home lives – but I didn’t find myself in any of those categories. Was it not reasonable to expect that my hard work in school would have paid off? That it would have translated into being able to do something, anything in line with what I wanted after I graduated? I wasn’t aiming to lounge around all day or end up with a cushy job where I’d press a button or two a day and get paid. I was looking to earnestly put in full time work for modest pay – I never asked for a higher salary than $20/hour on any application – at a job I could do that would translate into a fairly common white-collar career path.

Why couldn’t I achieve that? And how could I explain my failure without concluding that I possessed some gross, unknowable defect that torpedoed every opportunity I came close to? How could I justifiably live if I couldn’t achieve self-sufficiency?

Fortunately, instead of pushing me over the edge, that fight with my parents served as a wake-up call. I realized that asking these questions kept leading me to self-destructive conclusions that were eroding my self-esteem, and it was best to stop asking them altogether and instead simply act. I further realized that I did need to do something, and that something was to live for myself, to do what I wanted instead of trying to min-max my life over economic and long-term concerns. The latter was getting me nowhere and slowly killing me. Pursuing the former, I made the call to move in with my girlfriend, about 200 miles away into a poorer rural region of my state. I got back on the job search, this time willing to work anywhere in order to afford rent and be with her. I put aside the bulk of my pride and accepted that I was in the same boat as everyone else my age, that any advantages I had were marginal in the eyes of employers. That decision to move was probably the best decision I’ve made in my entire life. If it wasn’t available to me, I fear to think about what I may have done.

Ironically, my job search there was more successful, albeit barely. I was able to get a job as a paralegal with a local attorney, but only because of a personal connection my girlfriend’s mother had and that attorney’s desperation after her previous assistant quit on the spot. Every other non-retail application I had sent (aside from one, which also involved a personal connection) was met with the same silence I’d become accustomed to – even though I was now overqualified for many of the positions I’d applied to, with most employers only asking for candidates to have a high school education given the brain drain in the area.

I only stayed at that job around a year. To make a long story short (not a talent of mine, if you couldn’t tell), I really liked my boss: though she could be difficult to work with at times, she was very nice and fair as both an attorney and an employer. I respected her. Then we merged with another office that took advantage of us. The guy we merged with set us up in a new office 50 miles away from where I lived. I continued it for a while – I felt like I had no other choice, I felt I owed it to my original boss, and I did like the work well enough. However, I eventually realized my new boss was a massive dickhead, and my old boss wouldn’t put her foot down to change anything (fucker expected us to run an entire office for him as two people, while he worked a total of four hours most days, overcharged his clients up the ass, refused to hire additional staff, directed business away from us, and had us deal with the terrible clients he didn’t want – but that’s a story for another time). I got burnt out of working over 40 and commuting over 10 hours every week, and so I requested to be moved down to part time. My old boss was fine with it, but my new boss staunchly refused to allow it, so I finally quit.

Now I’m doing pretty much the same work I was doing in another office a lot closer to me. The fact I had prior relevant experience definitely helped me land this job immediately after my old one, but there were also some personal connections at play. I do enjoy my job (about as much as a job can be enjoyable when compared to interests, hobbies, etc.), and I like my new boss and coworkers, but I’m also only paid $15/hour. I feel like this isn’t a normal amount for the work I’m doing (I know from client billing that I’m bringing in at least twice what I’m making), although my last job only paid $18/hour at the height of my time there, and I don’t know anyone else in my position to compare myself to. Frankly, given my past and the horror stories I hear from others on this sub, I’m begrudgingly thankful to have anything like this – but is it not depressing, to be thankful for being exploited? There are other things I find grating: my boss brings his poorly trained dog to work and leaves it with us, and most of my job is helping clients that are far wealthier than myself buy and sell real estate, and they constantly bitch me out because things aren’t moving fast enough, while half the time it’s another office holding things up, and the other half, I have to take the blame because my boss won’t regularly sit down with me to review my files when they get to the point that he requires he review them before moving forward (at any rate: holy shit, closing on a vacant piece of land for $100k that you don’t plan to build on until the spring a week later is not going to kill you) – but I digress. Nevertheless, the experience should suit me well in the future at least, and I don’t plan to stay here more than a year, so I can bare the issues. I’d have thought I would have had more choice or say in the conditions of my employment, but after staring into the abyss of joblessness, this is good enough for the time.

If you’ve read this far, thank you sincerely. It’s been cathartic to get this out, even if I’m just screaming to the void (or automod).

To sum up my experiences with the job market, I’ll say this:

Our system is fundamentally broken. I came from an extremely privileged place in the world with heaps of academic accomplishments, but at the age of 23, I am barely at a point of relative stability and financial security – a point that is just narrowly cash-positive thanks to living with a girlfriend that splits our shared expenses, living in an area with low rent and cost-of-living, and having parents that cover my phone bills, car insurance, car payments, and health insurance. Had it not been for help from my girlfriend, my parents’ financial support, and the connections of my girlfriend’s mother, I doubt I would have ever been able to break into this white-collar career I desired with just a bachelor’s degree; even if I did, I would probably need to take on a second job to support myself. I am extremely fortunate in that my degree did not saddle me with any debt, thanks to my parents, scholarships, and my decision to attend a state school. Still, despite being more fortunate than a good chunk of the people I hear about on this sub, I feel like my life hinges on an economic precipice. I struggle to imagine the circumstances I know many others have to deal with – if I was forced to work retail straight out of college in order to repay debt, burdened under a real form of wage slavery, there’s a fair chance I would have eventually gone off the deep end. I feel a mix of sorrow and respect for those that continue living that sort of life against their wishes, and I hope that one day we’re able to make a difference in eliminating that sort of suffering.

I’ll admit, a good amount of my experience is down to my own problems and particular situation: I have issues with a diagnosed mental illness that I’ve needed to learn to manage, and my experience in the initial job search may have been different if I had been looking for something more permanent. I did not want to lie outright to prospective employers, so I often vaguely disclosed that I was thinking of going to law school eventually. I guess this is where honesty gets you. Point is, not everyone’s experience is going to be the same as mine. A good friend of mine from college that was a business major recently got a job where he’s earning over $60k/year as a starting salary (and according to him, he’s doing fuck all at that job), and my girlfriend makes a bit more than me at a bank with the same degree and comparable academic success. Still, I have other friends that are far less fortunate than we are, working retail jobs they despise for a pittance or otherwise kept from being able to live the sort of lives they would prefer, lives that should be achievable.

To conclude, I advise as follows:

Do not rely on school as a template for what your life will be like. I’m not saying to give up on school, or that it isn’t important. Education is a valuable thing, and the pursuit of knowledge is one of the highest callings a person can dedicate themselves to. Doing well in school certainly doesn’t hurt your chances at success, and it is very important if you want an education above a bachelors. But don’t sacrifice yourself day-and-night for school – you’ll probably turn out the same as the rest of us either way – and don’t base your life, your identity, or your future on your time in school.

The capitalist system is nothing akin to the school system. School at least attempts to be meritocratic with how grades are assigned. The world outside is not. Effort is not always justly compensated. Wealth, the means to achieve most of whatever you may desire, flows according to the rules of the market: from those that have it to those that provide the haves with something, with said provision of goods and services also requiring wealth in their production, thereby creating a vicious cycle wherein those without wealth must expend whatever they possess to obtain what they need to survive, while those with wealth and power can continually generate more of it by investing it back into the market system. Effort and talent have little to do with this system, they’re just another good or service, and they can be substituted if the cost justifies it. It is highly unlikely that you provide anything unique or irreplaceable in this system, especially at the time that you are entering it, fresh on the labor market, without experience. Therefore, you will not be uniquely rewarded. 

Furthermore, people prefer what they are familiar with to what is objectively best; they often lack the time to consider anything outside of their usual sphere. Hiring is therefore largely nepotistic. If you do not already have a connection to the circles you want to be a part of, it will be very difficult to break in to them. 

College may give you a greater ability to pick a career you want, but it is not a guarantee, and there is a lot more you’ll probably have to do to get there. It is not an investment with a guaranteed payoff. Do not be deceived into thinking employers in x field are looking for y major because of z quality in those majors – unless there’s a direct correlation between what you do in school and what you’ll be doing for work, it’s bullshit. Employers want direct experience, not people they will have to train. Remember that most academic departments need to justify their own existence by showing their utility to the workforce – the pursuit of knowledge for knowledge’s sake unfortunately isn’t sufficient to justify expenditure under capitalism. 

Maybe things are different for STEM fields, I don’t know, I don’t have experience there, but I doubt it. Things might be different if you attend an ivy-league, as people do like easy-to-process brand recognition and ivy leagues undoubtedly carry a certain prestige (even if the actual education they offer isn’t that different). I think – hope – the job market is different for postgraduate schooling. I am still planning on attending law school myself, in part because I do like my work (I just wish I had less of it to do, and that it could be more so on my own terms), in part because I don’t know what else to do with myself, and lastly because there’s no career mobility in the legal field without a JD. But I don’t know for sure, I’m not there yet. Pray for me.

Also, do not fall for the lie that white-collar work pays better than blue-collar work. I’m on a white-collar career path primarily because I enjoy the work more than I think I’d enjoy blue-collar work. I’ll admit, social connotations are also an influence – it’s bullshit, but other people do seem to respect white-collar more than blue-collar work, even in my rural town. Blue-collar work does also seem to be more physically taxing. That said, I make $15/hour. One of my coworkers here, a paralegal with 30 years of experience, has to work a second job to make ends meet. My old boss, despite working as an attorney for well over 50 hours/week, only made around $65k/year, and is still paying off student loans in her mid-forties. By contrast, she had a friend making about the same amount working a 40-hour week as a gas station manager. Her cousin, with no education or training before being hired, made $42/hour installing HVAC units. There are white collar jobs that pay very well, but the correlation is not as strong as we’re led to believe, especially now that there’s a greater supply of labor for white-collar jobs than in the past due to the increased availability of university education. If you have any desire to do blue-collar work, sincerely consider it; do not brush it off as many are apt to do, and do not consider it to be a low career choice. Blue-collar work is desperately needed and highly respectable, at least in my opinion.

I really hate that this is our reality. If you show a desire to do a job, and have a history of accomplishment, it should not be this difficult to find work. Unfortunately, it is what it is. And that’s just an entry-level problem in modern society that we are expected to bear. We all work too much for an age where work is increasingly becoming automated. Customers and clients are far too demanding in their expectations, and that problem seems to be growing with the technologically-enabled immediacy that people are becoming increasingly accustomed to. The workplace overall feels incredibly stressful, and it often isn’t worth it to put in an earnest effort. All an earnest effort does is undercut your coworkers and raise the expectations placed on you. Your only chance at real wealth is entrepreneurship: no one is going to pay you better than themselves, and you’ll never own any means of production or gain sources of passive income as an employee. But entrepreneurship seems to come with its own problems. If you’re starting out as a small business, you’ll likely either have to work ridiculous hours for decades or be strangled by debt before you have any chance at being able to afford to delegate your responsibilities, kick back, and enjoy yourself as you leach off the system you’ve created – the stress doesn’t seem to be worth the risk to me. This may be an unpopular opinion, but small business owners seem to some of the most exploited (and deluded) members of our system, and the stress created by that exploitation probably trickles down and creates many of the terrible working environments that employees encounter. Success at the level of the truly wealthy is a pipe dream, and most who think it’s attainable are fools. Those at that level did not get there fairly or morally without being born into it, and it would probably be better for society if they were brought down a peg, their wealth redistributed for the good of everyone.

I don’t know if that’d necessarily result in a better system. I don’t know if I’d call myself a socialist or some other term, besides discontented. All I know is that I’m fucking sick of the system we have, a system that isn’t working for anyone but an elite few, and I’m open to alternatives.

Most of all, do not make the mistake I made. Do not think yourself above your peers. Swallow your pride and recognize that we all burden under this system together. Do not fall for the lie that you will certainly be rewarded for your hard work in school later in life. That lie only serves to perpetuate our system, by breeding a misplaced envy toward over-achievers in those that are not top students and inculcating the belief that their lackluster positions later in life are deserved, that they would be elsewhere had they worked harder in school, and that those in power are there for justifiable reasons, because they worked hard, beginning with school. Likewise, the lie fuels an elitist attitude among the over-achievers, and later, when the boons of their efforts are nowhere to be found, furious discontent, or a dejected, pitiful attitude that they’re close to making it, if only they worked a little harder, making them easily exploited. The school system thereby sews division among the working mass, adding yet another barrier preventing the mass from standing together for their collective betterment.
 
Remember: you are a member of the mass, not an individual standing above it. Maybe someday we’ll be able to achieve a system that dignifies every individual, where each and every person’s qualities can be recognized and our collective wellbeing can be assured. But until that day, proceeding with a mindset to the contrary, living in your own world, will have disastrous consequences, both for you and those you should be standing in solidarity with. Undercutting the majority eventually means undercutting yourself. Look out for yourself, and remember that you’ll achieve the greatest security and prosperity by looking out for others too. This is the greatest lesson I have learned.

Fuck work and fuck the system. Support your fellow men, women, or whatever, and stay alive out there.

Sincerely,

A young burnout."

What I'd basically be doing is building apps on the Salesforce app exchange, learning about einstein analytics, and getting certification passes on Salesforce Trailheads. 

I am thinking of using this internship as a stepping stone in order to apply to SalesForce as I would be very familiar with Salesforce already and may stand out as an applicant.  

My questions are:

1. Do you guys agree with this idea? Would SalesForce be looking for developers that have experience developing apps on their app exchange? Or would this be something I wouldn't be doing in an internship?
2. If I am not able to land SalesForce, will these skills I picked up in developing apps in SalesForce app exchange be applicable to broader software development positions in other companies? Or will these technologies be too niche specific to SalesForce?  

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated. Thanks."

I'm not very good at putting sentence together in English.


I'm an undergrad student currently in my final year pursuing CSE. And have pretty good grasp on DS &amp; Algorithms. And totally believe that by putting 3-4 months in leetcode grind I can make it to some of the best SDE roles.


Only thing that is stopping me from doing that is my love for mobile app development. I devote all my free time developing android apps. I've done couple of internships in past as android developer and my current internship has the possibility of conversion into full-time role as soon as I complete my graduation. But salary won't be exciting, average I must say.


Am I hurting myself by being role specific? By hurting I mean pay wise.

qsv3jp,23,2021-11-13,MBA Imposter Syndrome,lovelybee23,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/qsv3jp/mba_imposter_syndrome/,"I'm a current MBA student at a pretty well-known university and am finding myself in a plight, any advice from other MBA students would be greatly appreciated.

I just started my first year in a full-time program and have been experiencing the worst imposter syndrome of my life. I've connected with the counseling services but they haven't wielded very much useful advice, so perhaps some people here could offer insights on how they overcame this personal challenge?

For me, it's absolutely a variation of feeling both out of place in comparison to my peers and immense pressure to do well in my program. I received a complete full-ride with additional funding to cover my monthly living expenses during the academic year and health insurance. On top of that, I received a fellowship that pays for my travel to conferences. Yes, I did cry when I received my offer letter... but throughout the summer I began to realize the amount of pressure that would be placed upon me: to not disappoint the university.

Now that I'm living across the country in my program, I'm performing below average to my peers in my quantitative courses (which makes complete sense since my background was in the nonprofit sector and very qualitative). I know that my grades do not matter since I'm not pursuing a career in consulting but regardless, I don't want to disappoint the university with my lackluster performance.

I'm also feeling like my peers generally look down on me and probably even think I'm the dumbest of the cohort. I'm here because I want to learn and I want to excel, so I can't help that I love to engage in class discussions. I'm 100% certain there's no bad blood towards me as I do everything I can to support them. i.e. Internship searching/interviews, and offers to review their papers anytime they need, etc. Only one peer knows that I received so much funding and as of right now, I haven't met another student that is not paying to be a student like me. I don't want others to know because I want to avoid any contempt it could create.

What are some ways you overcame imposter syndrome or these feelings I'm experiencing? TIA!"

Now, I have an offer from Adobe and I just gave Amazon's final round that went great. I'm leaning towards Robinhood but the role is that of a front-end. I would prefer a full-stack role but I don't think interns get that. At Adobe I'll be working in a cool backend domain that is highly sought after. Their internship TC is high too. Although, their full-time TC is comparatively much lower than RH. I'm still waiting for details from Amazon.

Keep in mind I am a grad student with more than a couple YOE. So, after graduation I would be aiming for SE2 or SSE roles. Also, I'm an international student so I have to consider H1B and GC applications too. I've heard Amazon is the best for these applications as they've got a plethora of immigration lawyers. Adobe should be helpful too as they apply for a lot of H1Bs and GCs every year. RH does too but their numbers are low. My main motivation is $$$ after graduation and impact of my work.

RH: $49/h + $2k/month housing + $100/month wellness

Adobe: $54/h + $8k joining bonus + $600 wellness + 1 year free cloud membership

Amazon: $8500/month + $2500/month housing at Seattle

(also looking back, i know i was a bit misled to think that a CS major is a really versatile major but a lot of my friends and family at the time really convinced me it was.) anyways, now i'm just kind of worried that majoring in information science won't give me as much range and that it also won't be as appealing to employers when compared with a computer science major (which is known to require more higher-level CS classes).

i know that if i wanted to, i can still be a SWE even if i choose to major in info sci since my coding skills are much more important than what major i am, and many people have told me that CS 2110 has most or all of what i need to know to do well in interviews (and lots of practice / leetcode). my main concern is just that having a computer science major might be more appealing to companies than an information science major (if i even do decide to become a SWE because i, again, have no clue) and switching majors would lower my job opportunities / make me a less desirable candidate to companies. also alot of my friends who are cs majors seem to be getting really high-paying internships with good companies and i'm just worried i might not be able to make as much as an information science major. and i know this sounds shallow, and i know i shouldn't do things for money but i can't help it; money is still a very important factor in my decisions after having grown up in a low-income family. can any info sci majors or grads share their experience with getting internships / jobs ? or even just any cs majors or anyone wanna share their thoughts? idk it's like 2 am and i'm just rambling here so feel free to ramble out literally anything back if you want or send me a chat bc i'd love that and would appreciate anything"

Struggling to find a way out

As a bit of background I have a decent undergraduate degree (GPA 3.3) in biology and a top class masters (4.0 GPA) in a numerate subject (computational neuroscience). Never had any internships or placement years or anything like that as I was struggling with drug addiction in the latter portion of my UG so obviously internships were the last thing on my mind.

I am now looking for graduate work in data science. It is so so scary to me. Terrifying. Everything about the professional world intimidates me.

I'm scared of being judged by a big panel of interviewers. Im scared of having several bosses of increasing seniority. Im scared of being assigned a big deliverable and being absolutely lost and not knowing how tf I'm going to hand it in and getting reamed by my boss. Im scared of participating in meetings and looking like a complete fool in front of everyone. I'm scared of giving presentations to bosses/clients and coming off as an idiot that doesn't have a clue what he's talking about.

I feel like I'm not going to be capable of passing interviews because I have no professional experience. I feel like I'm not capable of doing the job should I be able to land one. I feel like I have no professional qualities that employers want.

I've been a bartender for several years now. Its how I supported myself through my masters and it feels like it's all I'll ever be capable of doing. My girlfriend is a very successful public health analyst with a lot of professional experience so she obviously wants to help me as much as she can but this whole thing has now reached the point where if we even discuss me applying for graduate work it sends me into a spiral of despair. Half the days I just want to cry. I hate myself for the fact that I used to be one of the most ambitious and intelligent people in my year at school but now all of my peers from uni, all of my friends and most of my peers from school have far surpassed me professionally.

How can i get over these enormous fears of professional life? I know on some level that my fears aren't realistic since plenty of people with no internship experience and ""worse"" degree classes than me get grad jobs without too much trouble. I feel like I'm drowning and that I'm going to be stuck pouring pints for the rest of my life. Can anyone that has successfully got past similar struggles please give me any advice?"

I had a job oportunity in India where I am right now and the job is actually really nice, considering that I was warmly welcome in the country etc. 

However with this job I discover more and more about the ""corporate"" world. And something striked me really hard in the face:  how top people (meaning direction etc.) are bullshitting everyone with titles that does not have any purpose except giving a false value to someone. 
Especially if in their eyes the title is just wind, why using it? 
In the corporate world a employee is a ""collaborator"" a janitor is a ""surface technician"", an intern becomes a ""copy engineer"".
Every company I am dealing with is like this. And if you don't use it, OMG what mistake are you doing!

Instead of giving titles, in the company I am working for they call a cat a cat and they give proper advantages to their employees: all engineers have their rent paid, all phone bills are taken care by the company, phone provided by the company as well, 13th month for in december, scholarity of their child up to hoghschool paid for and most importantly despite being the big boss, my boss will put on the hard work with the rest of us despite his age (72 years old!). 
In addition of that he is making HUGE donation to the schools etc where his employees'kids are going. 

For the first time.in my life I am actually proud to work for someone. 

So I was ranting a bit but my point is: corporate world please stop your bullshit, call a cat a cat but treat your cat really well.

qt4qlf,8,2021-11-13,Should I take up a role that I have not enough knowedge / not enough interest in?,TheInspiredConjurer,developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/qt4qlf/should_i_take_up_a_role_that_i_have_not_enough/,"I'm currently a final year (5th sem) MCA student at a Tier-3 Govt. College, due to graduate next year.  


I have been learning HTML and CSS all by myself, as our course does not have it, for the past 1 year. We have been taught Java and PHP in college, which I know, but not confident in, as I haven't made any projects in it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still learning JavaScript and the 3 projects that I have done using pure HTML and CSS (I only used Bootstrap in my latest project) are not particularly ""production-level"" and/or ""with real value"".

&amp;#x200B;

As I've begun applying for internships, I wanted to stick to stuff that I know and am comfortable with, i.e, Web. I have this mindset of, ""If there is an internship or a job that I will do, then it HAS to be in web. Otherwise, I won't do it"".

&amp;#x200B;

However, I had a talk with my seniors and they are suggesting me to not be rigid and basically apply for software development roles as well. They are telling me to accept any role that comes my way, and not restrict myself to only a particular set of roles (i,e.,, Web Developer). When asked about the consequences, they tell me that I just need to know the basics and the company will take care of the rest as they will have to train me. They tell me that with time, as I work in it, I will get comfortable and that as a fresher, I should not be choosy. That I should accept whatever comes my way and then start being choosy once I get some experience.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

They told me to talk to multiple people and take their views as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I stick to web-related internships/jobs or accept any role that is given to me, even if that role requires working in a technology that I know nothing about /  am not comfortable in (e.g. Java, PHP, C++, etc.)?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, if your answer to the above is the latter, then please answer this question as well:

if I'm given such a role, then how would I handle it? I would have a very basic level knowledge in it, but I won't have practical experience in it, as I would not / might not have enough knowledge about a language as to how to approach a particular problem.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for your time in reading this post and answering the question."

Weird part is that after calling my potential manager they were super vague about *what* I was actually going to be doing, giving the super generic 'we support this' answer. 

I don't want to be doing something that I don't enjoy, and considering that the position is a systems-role with lots of potential tasks I am hesitant.  Am I overthinking this?  At all of my prior internships they were pretty up front with what my job tasks could entail, even if it wasn't an exact answer.  Is this vague nature normal?"

I'm a third year cs student at a private but popular engg college. Right now only 9 pointers have been allowed to write tests for internships. My cgpa is 8.6 and I'm good at leetcode. Looks like this will happen next year for placements too(not sure). I have a decent GitHub profile too. What can I do to improve my chances of landing a good job? Should I take up a course or work just on my cgpa or apply for internships on the basis of projects?


I can only get my cgpa to reach 9 by scoring 9.5 and 10 in current and next semesters. So it's highly unlikely to get 9cgpa."

I was doing my law internship for past 1 month. It was a daunting and terrifying experience for me. I got the internship due to nepotism under a good senior criminal lawyer because my brother's friend is his close client.


1. I was the most unproductive intern out of 17 others.

2. I was unable to put pins in stapler, write applications and do simple tasks, that are told to law interns.

3. I am unable to even find files and do simple paperwork.

I used to cry and think of suicide everyday for these last 4 weeks.

*Lowest moment was when I was told to turn on a computer to take printouts. I wasn't able to find the switch. I stood over there for 5 mins  figuring out, how to turn it on!*

Then another associate came and told me that, the switch is down below and I found it.

Then I was told to turn on the printer which was down and I wasn't able to.


I think, I deserve it and diasbaled to do any job.


I think, I have no hope left in this life and won't make money for rest of the life.


How can I do anything, If I can't do basic things right?"

qt8wjh,1,2021-11-13,"Recently hired as a full-stack developer with only an associates degree. Currently on my first semester of my junior year at university, starting to wonder if it's worth continuing my university program or if my time off work would be better spent self-learning and save the $20k+",Ill_Hold8774,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qt8wjh/recently_hired_as_a_fullstack_developer_with_only/,"As the title suggests, I was hired as an intern immediately following my graduation from community college with an A.S. in CS. I was extremely humbled and glad to be finally doing work involving my passion, as I had done a lot of coding before school (and of hobby during). However, my internship was only contracted for 6 months, so at about the 3 month mark I started looking for another job/internship as I was afraid of going back to doing DoorDash and making less money, missing out on valuable coding experience. Imagine my surprise when after only 2-3 weeks of searching, I was offered $37/hr for a 6-month contract position as a fullstack engineer, and $70k/yr + benefits as a fulltime backend engineer for different companies. Even more shocking, when I told my current company I was going to accept the $70k/yr position, they extended an immediate hire offer for $65k and a better benefits package. I accepted to stay with the current company. 

&amp;#x200B;

For reference, I live in Nebraska, the COL here is extremely low and my current position I can go remote, so I can choose to live outside the city to save even more money. My current position is offering $70k/yr as soon as I get one certificate which should take 2-3 months tops (and will provide the work-time to study for said certificate, meaning I wont have to do it on my own time) and $77k/yr when i get my second, with a similar situation of all studying being done during work hours. In Nebraska, $80k/yr\~ is a VERY comfortable salary range - especially for someone who barely just graduated from a community college.

&amp;#x200B;

During this time, I have been enrolled in university full-time, first semester of my junior year and am finding the material extremely dull, and far too simple given prior experience and study. I am finding that not only do classes move slowly in terms of material to cover, but most of my courses over the next two years seem wholly unrelated to anything I will ever want, or need, to know or use. I am beginning to wonder if it would not just be wiser for me to save the $20k+ I would spend on university classes, and time invested, and invest that saved money and time into self-learning the tools and resources I know I will actually be using. I still have a passion for learning CS  -  mathematics, data structures &amp; algorithms, but don't see a point in learning the material for $1k/semester when I can learn it simply from the books that we would already be required to purchase anyway. In-fact, during my last summer break, this is exactly what I did. I studied maths over the summer, and am currently in a discrete maths course which has been an extreme let down, as a few weeks of reading a proofs writing book has covered more material than the entire 17 week class, at a cost of $20 (for the book) vs $1k\~ for the class.

&amp;#x200B;

In brief, would it be too risky of a career move to transition out of school, and focus on this path of self-learning, building projects, and saving myself some debt, or would I be putting myself at too far of a disadvantage when compared to somebody with a Bachelors or Masters?"

The other 3 recommenders know me personally and have had a lot of interactions. Would having this 4th weak (?)

I want to make sure that I am picking the right degree/major/minor for becoming a business intelligence analyst/specialist and a data analyst. .The degree is called MIS (management information systems). The degree is a mixture between business and information technology. All the business classes I already finished like marketing, accounting, finance, management, etc. 

1. The soon to be technical classes I will take are python, database management systems, SQL, system analysis, data warehousing, ETL, data analytics, business intelligence, project management, and an internship.  Are those classes worth taking for the data field? I already now those are classes that are good in the data field but I just want to make sure.

2. Are any of those particular subjects difficult to learn as in are the concepts hard to understand? If you need a comparsion for something I find difficult it's something that requires tremendous hours of studying to fully understand the concept of what is being taught in class like computer engineering majors. How would you rank them from being the most difficult to being the easiest?

3.If it turns out that I don't like data analytics once I graduate, what other carrer fields can I go into that aren't a business intelligence specialist or a data analyst?

2. Are any of those particular subjects difficult to learn as in are the concepts hard to understand?

3.If it turns out that I don't like data analytics once I graduate, what other carrer fields can I go into that aren't a business intelligence specialist or a data analyst?

Other than internships and freelancing, one interesting path I've looked into is creating side projects (i.e apps, websites, related services) that I can generate money with. I have attempted this in the past, but it ended with me spending too much time creating the product and not enough time marketing and releasing it.

One way I've seen to approach this is to release a lot of projects without devoting an absurd amount of time or hoping to create a viral hit. However, how do I ensure that every project I create has the potential to be profitable?"

qteyde,22,2021-11-13,GPU design interview advice,asicg33k,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/qteyde/gpu_design_interview_advice/,"Hey guys, so I have a phone interview scheduled with the GPU design team at a company for an internship role and have questions about the same.

1) At the time of applying, I did not apply to a specific role as the application mentioned about roles in various teams such as design, verification, physical design, dft etc but I had submitted my resume which mentioned about being interested in  physical design. Should I expect this to be for a position related to PD as the recruiter didn't mention it being for a specific team within GPU design?

2) I haven't worked on projects related to GPU's specifically. Do I need to know concepts related to GPU's to get this job? If yes, what concepts am I expected to know specific to GPU's?

Lastly, any suggestions to crack this interview would great as I don't want to be at a disadvantage when it comes to knowing technical concepts. Thank you."
qtfsez,9,2021-11-13,Transitioning from architecture to RTL design,LikeForeheadBut,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/qtfsez/transitioning_from_architecture_to_rtl_design/,"I'm just about to finish my Master's in CPU architecture - I have a job lined up on Apple's SOC architecture team once I graduate, where I expect to work for at least the next 4-5 years if not longer. This will be my first job ever, but I do have a bunch of pretty good internship experience (worked on Samsung's GPU architecture team the past summer). My point is that I expect to have a pretty strong resume in a couple of years. 

I absolutely *love* architecture, definitely my dream field. However, unfortunately most jobs (apart from machine learning accelerators, which I have no interest in) are in California or at least somewhere in America. In my hometown (Toronto) there are next to no opportunities. While I'm happy to live in California for the next few years, unfortunately for personal reasons I would have to move back to Toronto in 10 years or so at most.

I do want to stay in architecture for now because I enjoy the work so much, but ultimately I know that once I move back to Toronto I would have to leave the field... I'm also relatively interested in RTL design and it's *way* easier to finds jobs in that field outside of California, so I'll most likely try to switch over once I return to Toronto.

Assuming I have a very strong architecture resume by that point, how challenging would it be for me to make the switch 5-10 years into my career? I will have almost no RTL experience (except for one internship I did a few summers back) at that point - would I basically have to start as an entry level engineer?

Of course, one option is to start working in RTL now so I never have to make the switch, but as I mentioned I want to work in architecture for now because I really enjoy the work. Also, just to clarify, when I say architecture, I mean using some sort of C/C++ simulator to do architectural modelling and exploration -  I would however be working closely with the RTL team since they'll be implementing our architecture."

&amp;#x200B;

This past Summer I had an internship with a FAANG company in an IT position. I was told that I would receive an offer letter within 4 weeks of the end of the internship. 6 weeks after the internship was offer I received an email saying that they would be extending an offer but I had to wait 2-3 weeks for the letter to come from HR. I am now in week 7 of waiting (after the initial email saying they will be hiring me) and I still haven't heard anything. Is this fairly typical for FAANG companies? I feel kind of disrespected and unwanted because of the missed deadlines with little information being passed down. I'm currently interviewing with other companies but obviously would enjoy the higher pay and the opportunity to put the FAANG company on my resume. Is it worth pursuing other avenues and just forgetting about the FAANG company and moving on or should I just wait?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to seem like I feel entitled to that job or anything it just sucks. Just looking for some advice overall I guess since this would be my first ""real"" job in the IT field outside of internships."

I feel like I’m in a slump. I see that I have a ton of great unhoned skills that don’t know how to be applied. Both my SQL and Python are at most mediocre, and my analytical skills are average I would say. I am great at communication and telling complex data stories in simple terms. I severely lack industry experience. I know I can be great at this but I feel as if I don’t know what I don’t know.

Both my SQL and Python are at most mediocre, and my analytical skills are average I would say. I am great at communication and telling complex data stories in simple terms. I severely lack industry experience. I know I can be great at this but I feel as if I don’t know what I don’t know.

I love my career and don’t know how to advance it. I would love some wise council on my current position.

I have some friends that already got internships from MANGA🤨but it seems like they asked personal questions about interests but one friend told me they asked about projects and I don’t really have any projects.

These questions come a lot in this subreddit but I just want to gage where I should be at.
qtjgic,105,2021-11-14,Keep Your Head Down And Stay Motivated!,nlogn_,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/qtjgic/keep_your_head_down_and_stay_motivated/,"When I tried to apply for internships last fall, I failed the few OAs I received and was resume rejected/ghosted by everyone else. I found the whole process really stressful and questioned whether or not it was possible for me to break into software engineering. 

If you're feeling this way right now, here's some advice:

**Remind yourself of why you started to study computer science in the first place and explore that interest**. Stay engaged in your coursework. Materialize an idea you have (literally anything) and start coding. Learn git. Make a simple portfolio website. Just do whatever you can to get your feet wet. It's not important if your first internship is with a FAANG company. Any opportunity you get to write software will bolster your resume and help you to clear resume screens. 

On the topic of resumes: **find someone who has hired for SWE roles and have them review your resume.** You don't want generalized resume advice from your school's career center. Your resume should be fine-tuned for a SWE role.

On the topic of OAs/interviews: **Put your hours in and grind.** The only way you're going to get fluency with interview questions and topics is by seeing the same patterns over and over. Don't get discouraged when you can't solve a problem. Study the solution until you understand it well enough to write it from memory. Remember that this is a long game. In the likely case, you will interview many times again. Interview questions are a well-defined hurdle. Study the hurdle and then jump it.

**Most importantly, do your best not to compare yourself to others.** It's easy to get caught up in a FOMO mindset on this subreddit where it seems like everyone has top offers. The biggest challenge in the overly-stimulated time we live in is to be happy with what we have and where we are. There will always be an endless stream of content providing points of comparison. 

If you can filter out those points of comparison and focus on your own growth, you'll be amazed at where you end up. The same company that looked me over a year ago offered me a full-time position after graduation. 

This process is difficult and random. Don't let your self-worth be defined by a random process. **Focus on what's in your control and good things will come.**"
qtki5f,4,2021-11-14,Facebook / Meta vs. Robinhood vs. Datadog SWE Internship,TyrannicalThunder,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/qtki5f/facebook_meta_vs_robinhood_vs_datadog_swe/,"Hey all I'm super fortunate to have received these offers this recruiting cycle and would like some advice as to which internship I should take for summer 2022. I'm currently a junior so I'm also considering the potential full-time return offer. The things that I am considering the most right now are career potential and growth, technical experience, company culture, and compensation. I don't particularly care about location. Would love for people to share their thoughts and experiences in the comments!

**Application Process Timelines** (accelerated due to Amazon return offer):

Facebook: Applied (late August) -&gt; First Interview (mid October) -&gt; Second Interview (\~1 week later) -&gt; Offer (2 days later)

Robinhood:  Applied (late August) -&gt; Submitted OA (early September) -&gt; Karat Interview (\~1.5 weeks later) -&gt; HR Call (\~2.5 weeks later) -&gt; Onsite (\~1 week later) -&gt; Offer (2 days later)

Datadog: Applied (late August) -&gt; Interview (early October) -&gt; Offer (\~1 week later)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm mostly leaning towards Facebook / Meta or Robinhood right now.

**Facebook / Meta (Menlo Park):**

*Pros:*

* Big brand name
* Doing some cool stuff (Oculus, etc.)
* Good benefits

*Cons:*

* Already worked at big tech before (Amazon)
* Bad WLB
* Less impact since its a large company

**Robinhood (Menlo Park):**

*Pros:*

* Also well known
* Can try out the financial side of tech
* Bigger impact since its a smaller company
* Higher new grad compensation

*Cons:*

* Position is Backend Engineering Intern (don't want to restrict myself to a specific area of CS so early)
* Not super excited about financial side compared to Facebook's products (although my opinion may change since I haven't tried it before)

ITE interns at my workplace are failing. Our boss put us at the forefront of a new project with only one supervisor, who actively makes us send the emails so he doesn't take the heat for mistakes, should the customer respond. Ofc we are generally bad at our job as well it's not just upper management, and we are being threatened with being fired. 

Should the worst outcome happen and we do get fired, does anyone know what happens to my EAE position? I have accepted the position already but the website states that ITE HNT needs a minimum GPA of 2.0 to qualify for their position. My GPA currently is 3.8 but If I fail Intern I'm not even allowed to get the cert unless I retake. 
Does the poly (In my case NP) check to see if I've attained the certificate? Cause I know adults can just take EAE, get accepted, and just walk in. Can anyone advise on what will happen?"

The confirmation of the diagnosis somehow has pulled a trigger within me and everything seems all the more difficult.

I have my semester exams coming up, this December. And I have prepared a routine to stick to, deligating tasks and assigning times and all that. BUT I CAN'T JUST STICK TO IT. at all. Maybe I start working on something, but I leave it half way or do it half heartedly. Either way, I end up in a pickle.

I also have an entrance exam coming up in 6 months, which can be pretty life altering for me. I need to paralelly prepare for that as well.  But again, i just don't find the motivation. I love the subject, I love the field, I love what it offers, but i still can't get down to it.

Over the past one month, I've failed at keeping 3 deadlines, which has resulted into letting go of  potential offers for three internships. I am really messed up. I wanted those opportunities.

Everything feels overwhelming. When it comes to planning and organizing, I am very good at it. Execution is where I give up at. I can't stick through my schedule, and I always convince myself to postpone the task to the last possible minute and then either end up not doing it at all or turning in a very poorly done job, which could've been done way better but wasn't.

It feels like I'm not tapping on to my fullest potential. And it sucks big time for me.

I am in for any tips or suggestions that y'all may have to offer on how to manage college work, adult life and ADHD."

I made a similar post a few hours ago but it was plagued with so many errors because I did not proofread it which was obviously a really bad idea. So here I go again. 

I'm a 22M, from Sri Lanka.

I have an undergrad bachelor's degree in Computer Science (a 2nd upper degree from University of Westminster, UK) and a work experience of 1y as an intern, 6 months as a Full time Developer (Back-end, APIs etc) and currently employed as a Full Stack Developer for a startup for the past 3 months.

I don't really enjoy living in this country honestly, and the economic situation has started to collapse and I've been urged by my parents to look for a way out, and it was my plan too initially.

The idea is to get into a University to do my Masters in Computer Science/Software Engineering, and to work, and eventually maybe get a PR, but the PR is just optional and would just be a bonus. I just want out ASAP. Studying for Masters COULD come later as well, I'm fine to work for a year or two and then get into a university if that is the easier route. 

I prefer English speaking destinations, but if the need arises, I'm open to learning any other language too.


I'm not that well off financially - I'm not poor by any means, but I'm not rich either. I could potentially afford a university with a tuition of around the range of 7000-8500 Euros a year(8000-9000) USD will be a fair amount, with slight flexibility. 

 I've been to Singapore for around a month and it would be my dream destination actually, but I know it's very hard to get into a Singaporean university, and even if I do, I know it's gonna be very costly.

Anywhere is fine, but I have a few countries in mind and those are Singapore, Canada and most countries in EU are also fine. Even Japan, South Korea are all good options for me, maybe even Australia. But really, anything is fine at this point and I'd like to hear your opinions and feedback. 

Thanks in advance guys!"

I’ve been a Senior Financial Analyst for years and always wanted to become a software engineer / web developer but would always end up back in Finance roles. I don’t want to pursue data analytics (the logical transition with SQL and Python) because after all these years I am tired of having to analyze bad data, corrupted tables, and a minefield of failed implementation and tired of presenting decks and dashboard to management. I also don’t want to specialize in just Oracle or SAP that’s depressing. I would much rather help CREATE an app or a website and be challenged to learn and implement new technologies.

Here’s what I’ve figured out so far as far as my options:

1) self study something like a full stack web developer or even a single language such as Java and build out some projects and apply to entry level SE roles on my own HOWEVER there’s risk of stagnation and lack of motivation and structure doing it myself, I’m not a super disciplined person unless I know it’s the best course of action 

2) go to coding boot camp and take advantage of their employment services - there’s one near me that places grads regularly with good companies HOWEVER it’s tough to have a family and no income for 4 months unless, again, I know for a fact this is the best option and can convince the wife 

3) apply to a place like Revature which basically teaches you coding while paying you min wage and then shops you around to their clients where you work for them for peanuts for two years under contract 

Either of these options I’m will to do but there has to be some sort of paid coding internship or second career program with good companies somewhere that is a better option for someone like me with prior professional experience and a lot of motivation?"

For context, I'm a high school junior. Recently, using the powers of LinkedIn, I managed to snag myself not one, but TWO internship opportunities. Yay! However, now I must decide which one of them to actually do, since I don't think I can do both. Not as yay.

Internship #1 is for an edtech company. Their overall vision is to reform education as a whole, but they're starting with math. My role would basically be front-end dev and some server-side logic to make questino generators and the like. This role probably suits my current level of experience more, and also helps with my current interest in edtech (have done some work in this domain before). I emailed him a question regarding the coding exercise he sent, but he hasn't responded yet (it's the weekend), so this one is currently in limbo.

Internship #2 is for a nonprofit that makes tools that allow people to explore connections between campaign contributions and political narratives and outcomes! Super cool! It's also NLP-related, which I've previously done research in. This role I'm a bit more excited about. I was told to write a proposal for what exactly I wanted to do, but as I'm looking through the GitHub, I feel like I'm getting information overload and am questioning my abilities a bit.

I am a PCMB student and although I'm going to appear for JEE and probably NEET too next year I don't think my heart lies in either of those streams. And the thought of spending the rest of my life doing something I am not even interested in the first place, really disturbs me.

qu57e5,0,2021-11-14,Is it possible for me to get an internship freshman year?,ArianaVentiButera,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/qu57e5/is_it_possible_for_me_to_get_an_internship/,"I'm just a high school student.

For context. I have done nothing for high school. Which is entirely my fault and I obviously shouldn't have been so irresponsible. I have no extracurriculars. I only have good grades, but no ECs. I have no experience programming besides an intro CS class which is worthless. That's because I've only discovered computer science recently, up until now i didn't know what i wanted to do with my life.

I know it's really hard to get an internship freshman year.

But I really want to work for it. I'm serious. I want to grind SO hard for it. I will go to every networking event, grind leetcode, spend my freetime learning more skills, anything. 

But specifically, i wanted to learn programming over the summer. C++. I have nothing to do during the summer so I can dedicate my entire summer towards learning. I do plan on doing a double major at Rutger's, CS and Math. I want to go to every club, every event, work HARD at home to learn new skills. Literally anything I can.

If i grind that hard, surely i can get a freshman internship? anything? it literally doesn't have to be at a MAANG. that can be for my sophomore year."

qu6f11,7,2021-11-14,Full time vs internship at Microsoft or Adobe,mochi_beanz,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/qu6f11/full_time_vs_internship_at_microsoft_or_adobe/,"I currently work full time for a startup. I am a bootcamp grad with \~1 year at the startup and my current TC is $160k due to a recent promo. I am currently doing an online masters program which allows me to apply for internships.

I have always wanted to work for a big company but I haven't done well interviewing for full-time roles to those big companies. When my TC was less than $100k, I applied to internship opportunities for these large companies. Recently, I was accepted to both Microsoft and Adobe for summer 2022 internships.

When I applied to these internships, I was making significantly less money (\~$60k less than I do now) and I wanted a change. However, with my current TC, I am making more than I would be making given a new grad offer from these big companies. It feels like taking a step backward compensation wise. It is also risky since I may not get a return offer, etc.

I'm not sure what to do. Do I consider an internship if it means getting my foot in the door at a large company? If an internship makes sense, do I choose Adobe or Microsoft? Do I stick it out and try again for full time roles at these big companies (not so confident I'll be able to get them)?

Any advice appreciated! :)"

Like many of you, I'm feeling pretty burned out this year. I'm in my 4th year of teaching in an upper elementary school. I'm not quite ready to leave the whole profession yet, but I'm looking for a change. I've spent all my years in education--literally even my own K-12 experience, internships, teaching, etc.--in one district so I'm looking to try another in hopes that something will be better.  


I'm making a list of questions I would want to ask an interview panel about the schools I'd interview at. My list is definitely too long and I'll need to narrow it down, but what things do you think are most important to know?  


Here is my list currently:

* Do teachers have duty-free lunch breaks?
* How much planning time do teachers get?
* What expectations/requirements are there about lesson plans?
* I’ve heard every Wednesday is an early release. How is that contract time without students utilized? Is this time used for PD? Team meetings? Faculty meetings? Teacher planning time?
* I’ve heard every Wednesday is an early release day. How is that contract time without students utilized? Is this time used for PD? Team meetings? Faculty meetings? Teacher planning time?
* What requirements are there for behavior management? Are clip charts, Dojo, etc. required?
* How are extreme classroom behaviors handled? What kind of support is there for exceptionally challenging students with behavioral disorders such as ODD?
* Is there a dress code for teachers?"
qu6j3e,1,2021-11-14,Seeking advice for first job out of college decision,Ok-Potential-8734,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qu6j3e/seeking_advice_for_first_job_out_of_college/,"Greetings,

I'm finishing my undergrad in December, I currently have two offers. Neither of them are my dream job, but they're what I've got.

Offer 1: a tech consulting company in Chicago. Starting pay is within 20% of six figures, no idea what the increase will be over time. Seemingly great culture and it's a 3 year development program where I will bounce around different teams. They specifically recommend no other endeavors like a Master's during these 3 years. Also I've been advised not to get into a serious relationship because statistically travel doesn't work for them. I don't really want to travel, but the contract requires willingness to travel 80-100%. 

Offer 2: rotational technology program with a financial services firm in Missouri. It's full time but I'm not quite a full-blown employee yet. Starting pay is a little over $60k and after a year they said I'll almost definitely be given an offer and a pay raise. They're also paying for some FINRA licensing and my interviewer said they paid for his MBA. Downsides are less money upfront and I think I'd like Chicago more.

Overall, I'm leaning toward the Missouri job strictly because of the travel. It's not that I'm unwilling, it's just the fear-of-the-unknown. I'm the kind of person who believes in structured free-time. I plan days, weeks, or months in advance. I don't want to have to fly to Topeka or some God-forsaken place every week for months at a time. But no one can guarantee me that's **not** what the job is. The Missouri job also has the perks of getting me into the financial sector, which I don't think is going anywhere soon... Cost of living is definitely a factor, but I think Chicago is the more interesting city, especially for tech anway. The consulting job definitely has the higher upper-bound in terms of cool projects I could get into (the company does have many big-name clients), but I'm sincerely opposed to living in a hotel for weeks on end. That being said, if it's truly what pays off in 3-5 years, then I'll do it with a smile on my face. I don't really plan on being with either company for more than 10 years... 

Last bit of info, I go to one of 3 biggest public schools in the US, I've got a 3.5GPA, and I completed two internships (one in industry, one in research). But none of this attracted the FAANGs or similar companies. So to all of you dear fellow programmers, I humnly ask for your guidance. Thanks."
qu6x7q,1,2021-11-14,Need advice/help selecting harware (MCU andbuffer) with a data writing speed (to sd card) of at least 5ms (200hz),sonic_75,embedded,https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/qu6x7q/need_advicehelp_selecting_harware_mcu_andbuffer/,"I need to find a microcontroller for a project (internship) which is tasked to collect samples, then display them on a LCD screen, and write the readings to an sd card. This is where the problem comes in.

The project specification states that the board will require at least 5 mS data writing speed (1/5ms = 200Hz), otherwise connect the board to a buffer that stores the data and then writes it. I have no idea what physical freq this is reffering to, the clock of the MCU or the SPI freq perhaps?

Would a data logger connected to an ESP 32 (to drive the dispay) be a good starting point? But then again, I don't know what specificaiton to look for on the hardware when it mentions ""5 mS data writing speed"".

Cheers for the help in advance.

edit: So the project will be powered off a LiPo battery, and the amount of data needed to be stored will be in the megabytes with the ultimate cost of failure being quite significant.

For further detail, here are some articles that the project manager has sent over, but i still cannot find a solution to this. [https://forum.arduino.cc/t/micro-sd-card-sampling-rate/312158/4](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/micro-sd-card-sampling-rate/312158/4). There could also be a workaround [https://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?t=30557](https://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?t=30557)

For further technical details, here the excerptfrom the report. "" For writing the signal data to the micro SD card, the Arduino IDE requires the data file created in the micro SD card to be opened and closed per reading, to prevent corruption to the file.  This additional processing requirement increased processing time to where the analog signal was obtained at often 15ms intervals, where each eighth multiple data value may be 25ms to 45ms. Amending the time interval to 15ms, will correspond to a sampling frequency of 67Hz, which is less that the maximum frequency of the circuit; and amending this further to account for the 25ms to 45ms intervals will reduce the sampling frequency further. """

Last semester I took my first intro programming course, which means I have only been programming since  January 2021. I am currently taking the second continuation of the course where we are learning java. Whenever my instructor writes code in class, i am good at understanding what each line does. However, I struggle with writing code myself. Whenever have a coding assignment/project all I see is a blank cursor... I am unable to write code myself. I feel as if I did not get the write understanding when it comes to the fundamentals in the beginning class. As a result, I feel that I lack the proper problem solving skills a programmer should have. I am currently trying to get an internship for the summer as well and will soon begin to practice coding problems for interview. I believe that my struggle to write code starts with my lack of problem solving skills, as well as, my overall lack of understanding for object-oriented design. As a result, I have been severely stressed and anxious these past few weeks as I have been struggling in this class. I truly do love the idea of becoming a programmer as I want to utilize my creative abilities and bring ideas to life or be a part of a company leading change, however, this learning curve has mentally drained me.

qu7vru,174,2021-11-14,My story of getting hired as a dev (motivation for everyone trying to get hired. Don't give up!!),BabyRona,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/qu7vru/my_story_of_getting_hired_as_a_dev_motivation_for/,"TLDR: It took me 1.5 years to get hired as a dev after coming from the service industry (SI), it sucked, it was the biggest challenge in my life, below is my story, and a paragraph about my fiance's story, please DM me if you have specific questions, don't give up Juniors!!!

I saw another inspiring as fuck post about a dude who went from minimum wage to six-figures and want to keep that ball rolling, because I know that before I got hired as a dev, I was ready to give up literally every day and seeing others’ stories of success really got me through some dark times! So I want to pay that forward.

Below is the mid-winded tale of the hardest fucking 1.5 years of my life. And this post would be incomplete without one paragraph dedicated to my fiance's journey to get hired as a developer too, so I'll give a blurb about her at the end because her story is actually more badass than mine but I'm me so this is about me.

I bartended and served for over a decade. After college I went into tech sales for 6 months, hated it and went back to the SI to figure it all out. Then I took a job in sales for a remote SEO agency, so I could travel and work, with the intention of switching to actually doing the SEO (bc fuck sales).

I worked for two SEO agencies remotely for a few years and in my travels, developers I met in hostels/ co-work spaces allllllways told me to learn programming bc it's generally more lucrative than SEO and has tangible deliverables so it can feel more rewarding than SEO, in my opinion at least. And as an SEO, I already kind of wanted to learn code because you kind of stare at it all day even if you're not directly working with 98% of it.

So then Dec. 2019 I went back into the SI to attend a full time, six-month coding bootcamp and convinced my fiance to join me. COVID hit halfway through the bootcamp, so I had to go on unemployment. Around this same time, a friend of mine who owns a startup let me pick up a part-time unpaid dev internship  (in case anyone is wondering, my friend’s startup was suuuuuuper early stage so he absolutely had zero money to pay me). 

It took me an entire fucking year of interning for free, applying to literally 800-1000 jobs, going through the interview process with probably 40 companies, doing a dozen or so technical interviews, getting ghosted more times than I can count (one of which was AFTER a technical interview which was super shitty), messaging hundreds of hiring managers on Linkedin, fitting in time for projects outside of my internship to get my portfolio in shape, crying literal tears, getting kicked off unemployment and going back to bartend, feeling so fucking beat every single day.. before I FINALLY got hired with an incredible organization in May.

I just got my first promotion and 15% raise on Friday and feel so fucking fantastic. I can say with 100% certainty that all of the blood, sweat and tears, awkward and failed interviews, higher blood-pressure, the money spent on bootcamp etc., all undoubtedly worth it. 

Now my fiance's anecdote: She was in the SI forever like me. Unlike me though, she did NOT go to college and had zero professional experience. And though she love-hated the SI, wasn't sure of what she wanted to do nor how to leave the SI.. I convinced her to attend the bootcamp with me. She got hired with an incredible non-profit two months before I got hired. I give her brief story because she did not have prior tech/ digital marketing experience like I did. She literally went from bartending to coding and I am so so proud of her.

In conclusion, do NOT under any circumstances give up. You are on this sub for a reason. If you're still reading this, you're reading it for a reason. You want to leave your current job for a reason. Seriously just stick with it. Do NOT let the imposter's voice win in your head that is telling you you suck and can't code. It literally just comes with practice. Enjoy being a junior because if you stick with coding, you WILL get hired. No god-damn doubt in my mind for anyone on this sub.

Oh and please DM me if you have any questions or need pointers or anything!!!!!!!! I would love to mentor where I can."
qu80ya,52,2021-11-14,"After a summer of mistreatment, we unionized (a national first)",lorifejes,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/qu80ya/after_a_summer_of_mistreatment_we_unionized_a/,"(Sort of TL;DR) I've been lurking on this sub for a couple weeks and finally decided to post the story of how, after being mistreated for a summer, me and my friends/coworkers started the unionization process that eventually cost my employers much more money than the raise we asked for initially.

[I'll link an article that explains much more in detail](https://spec.hamilton.edu/hamiltons-admissions-workers-form-a-union-how-it-all-happened-f91999bb568d), but I will also recap in this post, to the best of my ability.

I go to Hamilton College, in upstate New York. In a labor setting, you might have heard about Hamilton trying to squash a facilities worker union a couple years ago, or from the Kozik v. Hamilton  case, where they overworked athletic interns. Either way, the information everyone needs to know about Hamilton is that it is a *very* wealthy institution. Compared to its small size (1,800 students) it sits on a $1 billion endowment, 20% of its students come from the richest 1% families of the United States ([NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/18/upshot/some-colleges-have-more-students-from-the-top-1-percent-than-the-bottom-60.html)), and, as it pertains to this story, their VP of Enrollment takes home [$283,000 every year](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/150532200).

Me and a couple other students have worked for the Admissions Office as tour guides for a LONG time. The tour guide position was always a prominent job you could get on campus, and students went through long rounds of interviews to start, then a semesterly verification to remain in that position. We understood the importance of our work: in many cases our presentation of the College would make or break a family's decision to commit to Hamilton. I count myself lucky that both visiting families and my supervisors recognized the quality of my work, and after giving tours for over a year I started noticing students on campus who had been on my tours, and even took a class with one of them, which meant we were doing a great job. 

In 2020, reaching into 2021, however, our supervisors began to micromanage us bit by bit. We no longer greeted families, or split them up between ourselves, but our supervisors did. They would send us the longest emails you have ever seen and hold self-explanatory training sessions for various Zoom events, etc. You'd get called into meetings if you spent too much time with a family, and for other meaningless little details. You'd have to lead three separate time sheets, and still get accused of wage theft if your supervisor didn't believe those hours. Small things, which you notice if you do a pretty independent job for years, because most of them were about taking away our agency in doing our job. This process came to a climax this past summer. A couple of us stayed on campus to give tours over the summer months, which, this year, were really hot. In July we hit a heat advisory, and were still expected to spend the hour-long tours out in the sun, walking and talking for that time. Our boss—who lived and worked in air conditioned rooms all summer—told us the solution is that we should drink more water, while we lived in rooms with no air conditioning. For sure, we could have had it worse, but we started to get pissed off. Additionally, as it turned out, they underhired for the summer. We usually give 1-on-1 tours to individual families, but because of the lack of guides, we ended up leading tours with often as many as 8-9 families. These families were not asked to show proof of vaccination, but could take their masks off and not observe social distancing based on the honor system. 

In a conversation among workers, we realized we never knew what our exact hourly wage was. That's when we also realized none of us ever saw our contract, which we didn't think of much initially, since most of us had been working there from before. So, we asked to see our contract. Our supervisors kept making up excuses that we either didn't need a contract, or that our interview and acceptance email was our contract (none of these talked about wages at all, mind you). Eventually we received a carefully crafted email from a supervisor that said the email was, in fact, our contract. The congratulatory email that offered us the job. 

We decided to ask for a raise. We found out that based on wage guidelines, our supervisors thought we only merited 8 cents above our minimum wage for our work. Just down the road, we could have made $1-$1.50 more/hr if we worked at Dunkin Donuts or McDonald's, respectively. So in our weekly staff meeting, we asked for the raise. Our middle supervisor, who would never attend the meetings, showed up, and told us no. We asked why, when she had complete control over our pay within our wage bracket, and she said because she will not give it to us. When we raised our points about the fast food restaurants and their pay, as compared to ours when we represent a $1 billion-endowed institution, she told us ""and you have the option to work there."" Previously, we agreed that if we did not get the raise in the meeting we would strike that weekend.

We started working Saturdays around mid-July. At this point, our supervisors decided to extend our lunch breaks to a full hour, as opposed to the half hour that we previously took. At this point we suspected they did this to make sure we never, not even with our Saturday hours, reach 40hr/week and overtime pay, however our suspicion was never confirmed. The strike that we planned we eventually cancelled, after a student organizer told us that we had no labor protection. Our plan was to show up one Saturday, and tell our supervisors that the 30-40 families who travelled to campus that day will not be going on tours. We were operating on the belief that since they are understaffed they cannot afford to fire us. As soon as we knew we had no legal protection however, we sought the help of a union. That's when we started signing authorization cards and started an avalanche.

By the end of the summer as the fall semester began, many other tour guides returned (around 60 of us at that point) to campus. In the meantime I quit my summer position, and then got fired from two of my semester positions (which, when you're on work-study, and paying for college by yourself, is pretty difficult) for disagreeing too much with the leadership of our supervisors, although to this day they argue I quit those positions. Organizing for the union at that point was in full effect, relying on a team of 6-7 students and 3-4 local organizers. In September, we submitted the petition for a union election.

The College at that point, hired Bond, Shoeneck, and King, a law firm that specializes in anti-union rhetoric and tactics, and the firm they relied on when they were fighting the custodians and facility workers a couple years ago. All of a sudden, high raking officials in HR and Admissions began having open office hours to discuss [why a union is (not) needed](https://www.hamilton.edu/offices/studentemploymentoffice/faqs) for college students. Their communications and press releases tried to discredit unionization efforts and, in a classist way, tried to smear the union for mostly representing grocery store and food service workers, and how that was unbecoming of Hamilton students. Another large argument the College made was that union dues would actually leave us poorer and with a smaller wage than before. The College achieved what they wanted and many students in the bargaining unit  turned against each other. Interestingly, however, most low-income students supported the unionization effort, while the opposing voices were of students whose families owned multi-million-dollar summer homes and the such.

The weeks leading up to the Election Day were filled with anxiety for many of us. I was trying to claim that I was still an employee and they fired me, which they tried to brush off as me taking another job on campus (which I've had for years simultaneously) and quitting. Many other organizers were scared that we would experience backlash for our activities and open support of the union. We were pinned against our friends, which probably hurt the most. The union vote passed 25-20. It was a tighter victory than what we had anticipated, but turns out our bosses fully believed the vote would fail. Our boss later on went on to say ""I trusted \[students\] to use common sense, but I think the emotion of it got to them and this was an emotional vote…students will vote with emotion instead of rational thinking,"" which angered many other students on campus who previously did not pay close attention to the unionization news. 

About a month after the union's passage, another two unions have filed to vote at Hamilton. Now, over 80 students who work as DEI ambassadors and as Residential Advisors are seeking representation through a union, and it seems that the union-busting law firm will have to remain at work at Hamilton. I find this aspect the most fascinating of all that happened: Hamilton College would rather pay a law firm to squash labor rights efforts, than pay their students a couple cents more every hour. It appears that whatever money or status quo they tried to preserve over the summer is long gone. The money now sits in the pockets of anti-union lawyers, and the status quo is this: Hamilton College students became the first undergraduate students to unionize in the nation, after a Trump-era ban on undergraduate union efforts was lifted by the Biden administration. We were soon joined by unionization efforts at Kenyon, a college whose organizing inspired us and encouraged us in our own efforts and journey. As I mentioned, Hamilton now has to deal with two more union elections, after they already showed us what they are capable of. 

Our union made the news in a couple places, I'm linking that [here](https://www.insidehighered.com/admissions/article/2021/08/30/hamilton-admissions-workers-seek-union), [here](https://romesentinel.com/stories/union-backs-bid-by-hamilton-college-student-admission-workers,120586), and [here](https://www.uticaod.com/story/news/2021/10/13/hamilton-college-student-admissions-workers-vote-join-union/8439318002/). 

I hope you can appreciate our story—it's definitely a win for the worker, and a loss for the boss. Thanks for everyone who supported us and for all the organizers spending time, energy, and effort to make our lives better.

Also, as a disclaimer, I am not affiliated with the Admissions Office or with union organizing at Hamilton College as of the time of this post. If you're a fellow student reading this, please help correct me in the comments, so I don't misrepresent anyone!"

It seems as if every admissions counselor in the world has the exact same rosy advice for prospective transfers into the UC system, irrespective of each campuses' unique attributes, and most of these ""sources"" fail to address the nuances of specialized majors - especially business admin. Hopefully, this brief guide will provide some novel insight into the routes that my classmates and I took to get into the Haas School as Community College transfers.

**Disclaimer:** ***All opinions and statements herein are proprietary and I am not affiliated with the Haas Undergraduate Admissions Office in any capacity.***

**Edit 11/15/2021:** Changed ""The Interview"" to reflect updated information on the [Haas website](https://haas.berkeley.edu/undergrad/admissions/application-process/). 

&amp;#x200B;

* Part 1: You've landed at Community College, now what?
   * *Since your time in community college will largely determine your chances of admission, this section is* ***much*** *larger than others.*

# Part 1: You've landed at Community College, now what?

This section is going to be dense, but is vaguely broken up into paragraphs with the following topics:

1. You're in College Now.
2. Planning Your CC Experience - Big Picture
3. Planning Your CC Experience (cont.)
4. Should I get a Degree?
5. **Work Experience**
6. Extracurriculars to Pursue
7. Programs and Events

Regardless of what drove you to enroll at a CC, you now have a new lease on life and a clean academic slate. UC transfers benefit from the unique ability to completely shed their entire High School history. Your prior grades, work experience, extracurriculars, and recommendation letters are not considered in the UC admissions file, so rest easy knowing that your C- in AP Environmental Science is gone with the wind. However, be mindful that *no* private and *few* elite public institutions share this leniency with transfer prospects (eg: UPenn-Wharton, MIT-Sloan, Cornell-Dyson and CMU-Tepper).

In your time at CC, your counselors will likely fail to offer you any substantiative or meaningful advice because their offices are horrifically underfunded. I know \~15 Econ/EnvEcon transfers that were dissuaded from applying to Haas by their CC counselors despite having extremely strong backgrounds in industry. **Despite the unceasing shitposts on this sub, Haas students have tremendous respect for those in the College of Letters and Sciences, and I strongly recommend that you only apply for Economics at Cal after thoroughly considering your interests and strengths - while you will have the same access to employment opportunities post-grad, your time in Berkeley will be spent doing highly theoretical and extremely quantitative work.** While you chisel away at CC degree requirements, you will have to do a lot of digging to find course enrollment times, and will generally have to coordinate your coursework schedule all on your own. For this reason, [Assist](https://assist.org) will be your greatest asset in planning the timeline for completing your prerequisite courses. Plan early and often, and do everything in your power to gain priority enrollment at your school. Do your best to maintain a full course load every term, and take a few classes that you actually care about in addition to some difficult quantitative courses. Loading up on strictly business coursework is not advisable in any term, as you will lose your edge in other subjects. Additionally, make sure that you fulfill the requirements for a Transfer Admission Guarantee, and plan to complete prereq's for at least four non-UC business programs. I know a few people that are taking an additional year of CC coursework because they didn't hedge their bets against admission to UCLA or Berkeley. Optionality is everything, and the Econ/Acct and BizEcon programs at UCSB and UCI are great tracks (in more enjoyable locations, climate and campus-wise) that provide greater opportunities and placement than many of the Top-15 undergrad business programs.

Aim to have ***all*** of your prerequisite courses done before the Spring Semester (or Winter Quarter) of the year you plan to enter into Haas. This engineers a margin of error for the admissions committee, who can rest assured that *even* *if* you fail your remaining coursework, you are still admissible to Haas. You should aim to have a CC GPA of 4.00 for your best shot, but many transfers have a few A-'s sprinkled in. I know that holding that GPA may sound daunting, but if you are really committed to Haas, you will find a way to make it happen. If it is any consolation, Community College classes were much easier than my HS coursework, and I went to a poorly ranked no-name public high school. Tutoring is widely available at most CC's, and **professors will go out of their way to help driven students succeed**. Additionally, use resources like [Transfer Camp](https://transfercamp.com) and [RateMyProfessor](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com) to sift out crappy professors that are overly harsh with grading, or those who simply cannot teach.

I lightly recommend that you get an Associates in Business, as well as *at least one* degree in some other subject. This is not advice for Haas in particular, but rather can set you apart in candidate pools for admission to private schools. Economics, Mathematics and Statistics degrees typically line up well with the Haas prerequisite courses, and only require a few more classes at most schools. A certificate in Accounting is also really helpful no matter where you end up transferring, as you get a significant head start on what is, in my opinion, the most important coursework you will take at Cal.

Arguably ***the most impactful part of your admissions profile will be your work experience***. Aim for high-commitment roles in business-related positions. **This** ***seems*** **to be the ""secret sauce"" that pushes applicants to the top of the pile**. Coming from a CC, it will be extremely hard to land ""top-tier"" summer internships, but do your best to find gainful employment in the business sector by whatever means come available to you. **You will have to market hard**, I sent hundreds of resumes and went through dozens of informational interviews before I got a single offer, and know many others that have had similar experiences. Use LinkedIn, follow a Resume Template, and try your best to be personable and respectful of every person you meet. Once you get into a role, keep your head down, **work your ass off,** and learn as much as you can. Whether you get a 9-5 job or not, Entrepreneurship is looked upon extremely favorably in the Berkeley community, and if you have a clear vision of your product, I'd explore that avenue if possible.

Now let's talk extracurriculars. UC Berkeley loves seeing applicants with demonstrated leadership ability, as well as those who exhibit excellence in civic engagement. I think that heading your student government and/or being a leader of a club is the easiest way to tick this box, but have seen other transfer students demonstrate this ability off-campus in non-profits and NGO's. Put simply - you will have to find something that is deeply meaningful to you and take initiative. As I'll cover later, there are only four spots for extracurriculars in the Haas application, so make sure that you have a good breath of experiences. **If you put ""Club Member"" down four times, you have failed to demonstrate your ability to be an effective leader.**

There are dozens of programs and events that each give you incremental boosts in your chances of admission to a top UC campus, and I'll cover two here. First and foremost - I highly recommend that you take honors curriculum (if available) at your CC and become a part of the honors community. Honor class materials are generally unchanged from the standard curriculum, and the classes only require an extra paper or project that is fairly easily completed. With the satisfactory completion of your schools honors program, you may be eligible for the TAP program at Cal/UCLA, and Honors to Honors at UCI, among others.  Second - attending ""Envision Haas"" events was a great way to connect with the Berkeley campus and garner some motivation to push through the application process. If you can spare a day to make the trip, or live in the area, I'd highly recommend it.

&amp;#x200B;

# Part 2: The UC Application

After over a year of slogging through the hideous bureaucracy and lackluster campus life at your junior college, it's finally time to shine.

The collection of resources regarding generic UC application advice is broad, and most of it is applicable to any college application process. My points mostly mirror what you can find on any admission counselors website. Be sure to look back on applicable and meaningful experiences, bullet-out your points, and **be** ***sure as hell*** **that you have compelling personal, professional, and academic reasons to be admitted**.

The Personal insight Questions are unquestionably the most painful part of the application process. You'll be forced to write about deeply meaningful topics with a crippling word count constraint. Give your admissions reader a chance to relish in your success by offering them a defined narrative, clear wording, robust paragraphical structure, and a reason to care. If you don't find yourself needing to trim off \~200 words after your first attempt to address a prompt, you should probably pick a different one.

While still painful, the activities section of the application places a ceiling on the level of misery you will experience. Since you only have four spots for each section, make sure to only use your most impactful experiences in this section. EG: While your involvement in the chess/hiking/math/etc... club may have been a significant portion of your community college experience, it should take a clear backseat to your tenure as the student body president. Simplify your bulleted action items in a fashion that would make them easy-to-read for a toddler, and don't list anything you can't back up.

**DO NOT** wait until the last moment to start or submit your application. You should have 4-5 peers/professional coworkers/family members read through the entirety of your application to make sure it doesn't suck. Additionally, even though we have the #1 computer science department in the country, our application website still finds a way to crash on November 31st like clockwork - and extensions are rarely granted.

# Part 3: The Haas Application

Unless you stumbled upon this guide after submitting the UC app, your activities section should remain mostly the same across your UC and Haas applications. Be sure to extrapolate the key points, and make it exceedingly easy for readers to understand why you are a rockstar that belongs at Haas.

Additionally, the Haas essay will have a similarly vague and uncomfortable prompt that will require you to dig deep for meaningful answers. The prompt seems to cycle around every 4-5 years, and will generally cover an easy behavioral question you will have seen in at least one of your interviews up to this point (Eg: tell us about a failure, how did you foster a collaborative environment, etc). As always, you should plan to triple-check your writing with others before submitting, and submit early.

# Part 4: The Interview

Historically, the interview was a ""final check"" for transfer applicants. For example - I don't know a single person in the '22 or '23 transfer class that did not have an interview. 

However, the interview is now being offered to all applicants, and is an optional part of the process. Given how the interview was used in prior admissions cycles, **I would unequivocally  recommend you take the opportunity to submit an interview**.

Be sure to dress for the occasion (business professional with tasteful tie), brush up on your interviewing skills, and go into the experience with confidence. Questions from prior years are always floating around on CollegeConfidential, but the topics covered in the interview are extremely basic and should come easily to you if you've done any interviewing for other schools or jobs. The interview format was lackluster for me, and I had to pace myself through the six answers you will provide over six minutes. Make sure to use the [STAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation,_task,_action,_result) method to formulate your responses, and don't waste time. Previously, you had two chances to do the interview, and the questions do not change if you reattempt your recording. If this remains the same, I'd highly recommend that you use the second chance if you don't feel as if your first was 100%.

# Part 5: The Offer

Your decision will come much faster than you expect.

If you get the offer - Congratulations. Go celebrate, and then get ready to grind and network like never before. I *highly recommend* that you enroll in the PreCore program and begin your housing search immediately.

If you don't get the offer - don't worry. Keep an open mind to other programs that will enable a similar level of personal and professional development, and knock the lights out once you enroll. Keep maintaining your focus on academics and demonstrate success in employment to prove the undergraduate admissions committee wrong when you apply for your MBA.

**Either way, work hard and never stop learning.**"

quecoz,54,2021-11-15,Is it worth moving to Silicon Valley?,SnapeHalfBloodPrince,developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/quecoz/is_it_worth_moving_to_silicon_valley/," Hello everyone.

I am a Pre Final year Computer Science student at Tier 1 IIT(Not in the Top 7IITs) and recently got an intern offer from Salesforce India. I was pretty happy after getting an intern offer until I saw some of my seniors from IITs/IIITD/DTU working in Silicon Valley. Most of them got offers after graduation, and some of them transferred to the US. Basically, I'm suffering from FOMO after seeing their career.

Personally, I don't want to move to US/Europe because I don't want to leave my family and country. My question is that

1. Is Silicon Valley so much better than Bangalore/Hyd as most of the good folks I know are moving to the US?
2. Is it just peer pressure? Like what I'm feeling right now?
3. Are most Indians who move to the US doing better in their careers than those who settle in India?"

quf4tn,2,2021-11-15,"I'm stuck between choosing to get my college degree, or my own happiness",Throwawayoftheday09,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/quf4tn/im_stuck_between_choosing_to_get_my_college/,"I've got a problem when it comes to college: it stresses me out to the point I get depressed all the time. I've been studying for 5 years on and off and for about half that time I've been doing everything against my own well-being. I sort of know the root cause of the problem, although my therapist refused to elaborate on the specifics before kicking me out.

I have autism, and I'm mildly affected by it. Mostly when it comes to doing things I'm not exactly certain of that I'm doing them right. The stress gets so bad that I completely block everything out that's productive (be it for college or any other aspect of my life) and go into typical avoidance mode. It's making me depressed because it makes me feel stuck and immobile, and I start questioning my own mind and it spirals down from there.

I've been in college for over three years now and I should be in my final year, had I not taken a break back in February after an especially frustrating and stressful group project. I liked my freedom so much I completely missed the deadline for getting an internship this September so now I'm effectively on a year-long break. It has honestly been the best year of my adult life. It's only undermined by the looming dark shadow of courses I failed and have to finish before February, if I want any shot at getting that degree by 2023 (a year late).

I'm really looking forward to my internship that's now set to take place from February. But honestly, I'd rather stay at the company that ends up taking me than go back to college. Although, maybe I'll also shoot my shot at doing an international exchange after the internship. 

I've had trouble getting effective guidance from school. I've seen multiple counselors and teachers and I do reach out when I run into a problem, but the teachers either don't reply (or reply a few months after the deadline, real story) or they keep referring to other people in circles. It's now gotten to the point where I feel reluctant to ask for help, and I even feel some guilt for asking for extra time out of their already busy schedules. They keep hitting us with the ""in real life you need to be able to handle this independently"" which just adds to the insecurity.

I'm on the verge of deciding to drop my deadlines for February and calling it quits after I finish my internship. I don't think many companies will complain if they get to keep their intern right away (in fact I've already once been turned down because I couldn't stay). The sheer freedom of life without college seems so goddamn appealing, and in sure I'll find a way to cough up the few dozen a month to pay off loans... 

The flip side is that I don't get a piece of paper that says what I'm capable of. Maybe I don't totally deserve that paper either; I'm not capable of what it says, independently. People around me have heavily pressured me to go to college or uni and honestly I regret giving in. Is that piece of paper worth that much if half my country will be drowned in 30 years? If I'm not even really planning on using it for more than maybe a decade, for one or two jobs? Is it worth my own happiness, my life, while that is still worth something?

There are of course some really compelling reasons to try to finish it. I'll save more money that it'll cost me through the reward my government gives to graduates. I'm kinda scared I'll miss out on time and financial opportunity to learn for the sake of learning, because there is so much I still want to learn (but not just about the topics of my program). And of course, I just want to prove to myself that I can, I fact, do it.

I am living a mediocre life. I  go to work and come back and listening music and go to bed.

Occassionally, I get on apps and try to meet a woman because I want to have sex.

I didn't feel any bad about this kind of life but I don't know... something hits me really hard few days 

ago.

I got sick of masturbating, chasing women and making excuses.. all etc bad habits.

It's been few days but I started going to the gym early in the morning before I go to work,

when I am at work, I try to learn as much as I can.

I deleted apps and tried to focus on sexual discpline ( monk mode)

because apps and porn fucked my head and I act so awkward around girls and acting desperate and I 

really hate myself for that. I am trying to control my emotion in stressful situation since I act 

emotionally  a lot.

Monk mode is tough, but It's necessary for me

However, I realized that my greatest friend gets in my way and whenever I see him,

he talks about why I do not have any gf for long time.

he knows the story of mine but It seems like he only focuses on girls while he doesn't do anything with 

his career but only thinks about making a lot of money. 

I told him that making money isn't a joke and we have to discpline since we just graduated with no 

experience but it seems like he doesn't really care.  

I feel like I need to keep a distance from him and this was the first time I thought about it.

I still like him as a friend but I just got sick of dealing with him.

I’m still a high school senior right now. 

I wanted to get any sort of internship after my freshman year. My goal is to get any internship for all 4 summers. 

I think I’m underestimating how hard it’s gonna be to be honest. I heard how hard it is for freshman to get internships but I’d really like to work hard for it to make up for high school.

I heard Google Step is actually a bit easier since it’s specifically for freshmen and sophomores but I fear that it’s still gonna be hard for me because of my nonexistent high school resume and no experience prior to college.

I’m asking about companies in NYC because I want the experience of working there. But if anyone knows of companies that’ll accept me AND will pay for relocations, that would be very appreciated. Thank you."

It's not a bad semester, but not the best, I mean it's pretty average. Anyways, I have been bothered by the idea of internships. I am really tired of this stigma of ""having to get"" internships. I just find the idea to be really dumb due to all the garbage postings from startups or I feel like unrealistic requirements. I find LinkedIn and those other ""recruitment websites"" to be a toxic cesspool. I just see myself being a number on those websites despite actually making my profile look more alive than the many blank ones from my colleagues. The entire process seems way more than it needs to be and intimidating for many. I am currently stuck in a situation where I am trying to figure out if an internship would help or not. My current situation, assuming all goes to plan, would be that I would graduate with a Computer Science Major, and minors in Computer Forensics and Computer Information Systems. I have also been working via Work-Study for my school's IT department as a technician for the past 2 and a half years, and I plan to continue that so I should be leaving college with my major, minors, and 3-4 years of work experience in IT. I am debating whether an internship would be useful or even worth my efforts. I am open to ideas and feedback or different perspectives. Again, I have just been really stuck and I am currently under pressure from friends, parents, and others to pursue them, but I want to weigh my options. I am not necessarily against getting an internship, although my current outlook on them is negative. Any advice or feedback would be highly appreciated.

And it has become near nightmarish and has turned me almost completely away from the industry. It has become the main source of stress in my life. 

When I first started this summer, I was entry level after a two year internship and expected to have to go through some training. I did, but never got paid for any of it even though I was essentially working for them while training. Didn’t see a dime. (Pretty sure this isn’t legal most places?) It took a long time for me to be “officially” on the schedule for pay and when I was, they tried to bring my pay down from what they had initially promised it would be. Thankfully I was able to convince them not to change it from the original quote, but I didn’t feel good about it when I realized that I couldn’t really trust them to be honest with me. They also said that they get the schedule out on the fifteenth of every month for the entire following month. I still don’t know what my schedule is for November and we’re halfway through it. October was the same. I didn’t know what I was doing until the week or day before. 

I work in the concert industry, so work really depends on when shows are, so full time isn’t really a thing. But when I asked, they said I would be busy enough working for them to warrant leaving one of my other two part time jobs. I did and kept one of them. There are regularly at least three or four shows in a week. I have worked a total of fourteen (paid, not training) since I started there. Thats fourteen paid shifts since September. Only two in all of October and none so far in November. I’m essentially left working my one part time job and that’s about it. I haven’t been able to talk to my manager about it until just this last week because they’re gone for weeks at a time, and it was finally made clear to me that they expected me to continue coming in for training on my own time so that I could get put on the schedule for more shifts. That is — they want me to come in off the clock, ask one of the other workers (the manager does not want to be in charge of training me themself) to come in on their own time and train me. Both of us unpaid during that time. And this other worker has been working almost every shift there is, so they’re already overworked as it is. I’m not sure I understand why I need to be in charge of my own training. How am I supposed to know what to train on? “If this is what you want to do, you’ll make it happen.” Yeah. Okay. If you want to keep employees you won’t simultaneously overwork one and underwork the other. 

It just isn’t what I thought it would be. Not to mention, the manager is constantly gone because they don’t even want to be in this job. They told me when we had a meeting the other day “this place pretty much runs on its own when I’m gone” and I told them respectfully that it absolutely does not. Nobody gets advances for shows, nobody knows what their schedule is until that week or even just a couple of days prior to their shift. It isn’t a sustainable way to run a business and no one is happy. 

I’m pretty positive I’m putting in my two weeks soon (not that it matters, I’m not on the schedule anyway), but even though it’s a crappy work place, I’m having a hard time with the decision to leave what was supposed to be the job I had been training for. I’m disappointed. But I know I’ll be better for getting out of an industry that runs like this."

Here is the ninety-eighth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.
* How do I find computer engineering jobs?
   * If you have no idea what you want, I would suggest just searching a job board (indeed, google, linkedin, etc.) for computer engineering jobs. If you know of a company you would want to work for (e.g., AMD), you can go directly to their website and look at their open positions. You can also use the information you learn from that job board (job titles, requirements, skills, etc.) to refine your searches on other job boards.

All the best,

\--Nick

I have been working an internship for 3 years the company has a long history of hiring long time employees. Here’s the problem, my degree would have been in information technology and I’m working a software engineering job. 

How should it tell the company if I can’t pull my grades up? Is it a sure thing I’ll get fired if I drop out? Any advice on next steps would be greatly appreciate. I am smart, I am an excellent programmer but a terrible people person. I always like computers because they are consistent if something doesn’t work you can fix it. 

Anyways advice on informing my employer of my new status of not in school anymore isn’t gonna be easy. Hopefully my teacher bail my ass out. 
Either way I want to just be an employee my job got In the way of my study’s and now I’m afraid it will cause me to lose both"

CGPA: 9.34/10

GRE: 159V, 170Q, 4A

TOEFL: 112 (30,30,27,25)

2 research projects: One in computer architecture and one in deep learning (ongoing)

A software development summer internship at a well known firm.

The LORs will be written by professors (2 of them were my research guides) so I don't have much control over that but my SOP highlights important parts of my research and software development experience in detail.

My target schools are UT Austin, GA Tech, UIUC, UCLA, UCSD, Princeton, Columbia, UPenn and NYU Courant.

Thanks in advance."

I got a total of a year of experience (6 months internship+ 6 months a s counting at current company), my current compensation is too low imo (12k/year for making CRUD apps all day long) but I live in an underdeveloped country and the job's with a European company.

I don't wanna necessarily leave my job now but I wanna grow enough to not only increase my pay range but also grow my skillset. 

What skills can I learn that'd increase my value and allow me to finally break from the junior title and its pay bracket? 

When's even the time to decide I need a job change for salary increase purposes?"

quwrny,5,2021-11-15,"Realistically, how good can i get at programming in 1 year?",ArianaVentiButera,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/quwrny/realistically_how_good_can_i_get_at_programming/,"For context.

I’m a high school senior and i have no experience at all in programming. I plan on majoring in CS and math in college. I wanted to do a lot of self study in programming so I can get really good. 

My overall goal is getting good enough so I can get a freshman internship.

Here is my full plan.

I can get a new Macbook Pro this summer. I plan on learning C or C++ as my first language. Give or take some weekends and some weekdays, I can dedicate my entire summer and all my free time towards learning programming. 

During the school year, I’m going to spend ALL of my free time continuing to learn. I’m gonna be joining some clubs and I’m gonna have a part time job too, but any free time I get will be put towards programming. No breaks at all. 

My deadline is may, which is right before the summer when I presumably get my internship.

With this plan in mind, how good can I get at programming from June 2022 to May 2023?"

So basically I have heard from a few employers that internships is the top priority for straight out of college undergrads, that I don't question. However, one question I do have is whether research or grades is more important when it comes to resume building. For context, I am interested in going to grad school (key word interested, but not confirmed) but if I were to go that route I would love to go in the work force first (in other words whether I go to grad school or not I would rather work first). So for me, the real question is whether grades or research would be more important for BOTH grad school and job prospects? Thanks!"
quzh2a,18,2021-11-15,Stuck in a Catch-23,eyaf20,GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/quzh2a/stuck_in_a_catch23/,"Yes, a catch-23, I think my situation warrants a step up from the pedestrian -22. 

\[I apologize if this seems rant-y, I really just need an outlet for this as well as a way to formulate my thoughts so that I know what to ask for\] \[I'm in the US\]

I got my bachelor's in May 2020 from a well-regarded school. Sadly, I didn't get to make use of a lot of the resources there (nor were they helpful when I asked; ""just look on LinkedIn"" isn't really advice, thanks), mostly due to my indecision in terms of major and career plans.

I eventually graduated with a major in what is essentially ""science communication,"" a niche field (and a major that fortunately accommodated my diverse coursework) that I'm constantly told is brimming with opportunities and welcoming to newcomers, but I certainly have not experienced these positives. Despite having a degree specifically in this field (this major exists hardly anywhere else, especially as a bachelor's), I've had next to no success securing real opportunities. 

This, despite being told over and again by family, friends, and people in the field that I've had conversations with (informational interviews, basically) that I certainly sound intelligent, have plenty to offer, am insightful, and conduct myself professionally giving good impressions. Yet I've written over 150 cover letters, earning me \~5 interviews, ultimately landing 0 paid positions. In the time since May 2020, I've completed 2 unpaid internships, the most recent one directly related to my studies, receiving praiseful feedback. In between these roles (both part-time), I spent countless hours searching for relevant opportunities, applying, receiving rejections (if anything at all...), and wondering what has made me so incredibly undesirable. -- BTW, the vast majority of applications I've sent in are roles that I'm 90-100% qualified for per the listing -- I've exhausted pretty much all the resources that I've been pointed to; people keep telling me ""hey check this newsletter they post opportunities!"" and ""join this Slack group!"". I've done essentially everything suggested to no avail. I've actually been assured by recruiters that my resume is attractive (presentation-wise, at least), and even graciously received some edits to my cover letter which I've implemented ever since.

Now, I'm nearing the end of 2021 and refuse to bury this year as a failure like the last. Enter: the catch-22. The classic 'you need experience to get experience' line. I feel like I'm not being allowed any opportunity to get experience. Apart from the aforementioned internships, I've spent time volunteering on diverse projects: contributing to data visualization, tutoring high schoolers with college apps, acting as a media lead for a climate action group, and I picked up another project just this week. I've been poring over resources like MIT OCW courses and local educational streams, helping edit posts and friends' work, reading papers and books related to my interests, networking the best I can (given a paucity of connections leaving uni), learning how to code (albeit slowly since I'm constantly fending off guilt for being unemployed and can hardly justify spending time on things other than remedying that), practicing my target language, and of course scouring job boards. I've been doing *far* from nothing. Today I just started an account on UpWork hoping that some freelance gigs (if I get any..oof) will bolster my portfolio.

I'm lucky to have amazingly understanding parents who wouldn't dream of kicking me out unsupported. But it's gotten to a point where my extended family wonders if I've decided to call it quits. Knowing that I've spent over 1.5 years in this situation during what is a formative part of one's life has been no solace, of course. And then covid...if anything it's acted as an excuse for my failures so far.

I worry that given my long string of unemployment, I come off as completely repulsive to potential employers *due to the very fact that they haven't listened to me and give me a chance that I more than deserve*. Hence, the catch-23: I feel like I've been disregarded so long, that in and of itself has made me less likely to find employment. ""If this candidate actually had decent stuff to offer, why would they have such a hard time finding a job??"" Naturally, this whole ordeal has had major negative effects on my already jeopardized mental health. College was a psychological hell that I won't get into here, a positive feedback loop of (diagnosed) mental illness; no, it didn't have to do with it being 'too hard.' My point is, I graduated in a highly vulnerable state (though I guarantee this has NOT shown in interviews and applications; I'm skilled at disguising it) and having gotten the shaft ever since has done little to boost my confidence. These days, I'm lightyears better than where I was then, nevertheless insanely frustrated. Still, I'm afraid I'll never be able to gain admission into a master's program solely on account of an academic transcript rendered in throes of mental struggle, meaning I have to rely on my bachelor's for the foreseeable future.

Here's the issue. On one hand I think, well, perhaps my degree is useless - that's a fair argument, and surely lovely news to my grandparent(s) whose educational fund set aside for me I squandered. But I digress. Should I focus my efforts in an unrelated area? But... *If I can't get a job in an area that I'm surely qualified for, how could I possibly get a job in something that I'm \*not\* qualified for and have no training in?* I just feel that my each and every effort is getting me no closer to A JOB.

Questions you might be able to help with:

1. Are the sizable gaps in my resume as abhorrent as I fear? I've never explicitly been asked about them, but surely they're not well-received at face value.
2. Should I just say screw it all and live as a hermit.
3. My focus is on writing/editing, but hilariously I don't have much to show for it since I never really considered this my focus until now (tbh out of necessity..). I'm in a Slack group with loads of science writers who've told me ""oh yeah I had no prior experience so I did this internship"" -- meanwhile I've been rejected thrice for said internship despite having the qualifications. And then ""Just reach out to this and that publication, or this and that uni department"" which again, I've done and received literally no responses. I have a dang degree in this thing! I've offered to pen things for free and have gotten no takers. I'm finally just starting a wordpress site for myself. Any other avenues from those in a related field?
4. Are there tips to presenting myself that I've overlooked? Again, I've gotten only positive feedback from my interactions, so the ghosting and rejections only result in my confusion. Should I stop trying to show that I'm excited for a role, and just pretend like it's strictly business, thereby making me seem more experienced and less wide-eyed? When they ask for my salary expectations, I have no clue what to answer because I have no baseline or prior knowledge. And people who freelance make wildly different sums. AND they almost all have prior experience in legit, salaried positions.
5. I've seen so many 'technically' less-qualified people my age just soaring into new positions and schools, meanwhile I'm stuck at home wondering what on earth I'm good for. On an emotional level, how does one deal with this. Stoicism? Ignoring it? Venting on Reddit like I am now?"

For some background information, I am from Louisiana and this past May I graduated from university with a Bachelor’s in History and a minor in Pre-Law and Paralegal Studies. After completing the Pre-Law Program, I obtained a paralegal certificate. When I was in university, I worked as a student intern for a few different programs to build some work experience. After I finished university, I got a job working as a part-time legal secretary. The attorney that I worked for, her and I agreed this would be a temporary job. She let me work for her so I could get some experience in a law firm. I did that for 5 months. 

Well, Louisiana just don’t offer a lot of legal jobs or jobs in general. I mean cities like Baton Rouge and New Orleans have jobs, but they want candidates to have 3 to 5 years of experience. I’ve applied to jobs on indeed and even called around to small local law firms. No one is really hiring like that down here. Not only that, I’m tired of living here. I was talking to my dad tonight about how Louisiana didn’t have a lot of opportunities and he actually encouraged me to apply out of state. I see states like Texas, Florida, and Georgia have a lot of entry level work. I’m single and I don’t have children, so relocating is not an issue for me.


What was your reason to move out of state for a job? Was it worth it?"
qv1959,29,2021-11-16,What is Happening to the Local News Anchors?,icravejazz,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/qv1959/what_is_happening_to_the_local_news_anchors/,"I work as a late night host on a talk show after the late night news. Some of the things I have witnessed from those anchors will always haunt me. 

Now those I tell this story to tend to not believe me. Ever. They always ask things like “If it’s truly like that you wouldn’t willingly work there.” Or “Wouldn’t the public know if these things were actually happening to figures such as them?”. People think I am beyond crazy. I have been to multiple psychs, therapists and even exorcists searching for answers in the last ten years I have worked here. They all give me the same answers. It’s all in my head.

Now I know it’s not all in my head as my former co-host saw the same thing I had seen. Unfortunately he couldn’t make it out to tell the story to its extent. I will never forget his screams. 


This all started ten years ago when my co-host, Jerry, and I began our late night talk show that aired at our local news station after the late night news. It had all started out fine. We would mingle with the anchors between airings, they seemed to be decent people. Boy was I wrong. 

Three weeks into the show it was booming. People loved watching two best friends (one Irishmen and one Scott) answering advice, hosting celebrities and doing skits. We were the Saturday Night Live of our little town, that only had local channels so to them we were a new hot commodity. We had just finished up an airing an episode where we dished out relationship advice where things started getting weird. We were walking through the back corridor to leave as our night was over. It was 3:30am at this point so all of the 12am anchors should have been gone. 

We pass by their dressing rooms on our way to the exit and all of the doors are wide open, which is unusual at this time as security usually locks them up right at 12 so he can nap the rest of his shift. The lights are off in all of the rooms and the alternating floodlights did little to nothing for visibility. I tried to stay close to Jerry, an uneasy feeling was rolling over in my stomach since entering the hallway. It was when we heard a very sloppy slurping sounds from one of the rooms did we freeze. 

This slurp was not like someone trying to get a mouthful of spaghetti, it sounded as if something was trying to drain every last drop from a trash bag full of oatmeal. The feeling in my stomach turned to nausea as I caught a glimpse of Monica, the traffic anchor hunched over half naked, using her teeth ripping bits off of one of the interns, Brian. I wanted to scream but all I could do is run and drag Jerry with me. I didn’t dare look back as I heard several sets of bare feet padding on the floor behind us. Monica and whoever else was still here had noticed us an I could tell they were out for blood. 

I burst through the exit sprinting to the car, Jerry not far behind. We both slam the doors breathing heavily. “What. The fuck. Was that.” Jerry breathed. I shook my head utter disbelief at what I had seen. Monica has looked like a rabid dog, ripping and tearing at flesh. She had an almost grey hue to her normally olive skin, skin hanging loosely off her bones. “We had to have just been seeing things, let me get you home.” I say before driving Jerry back to his apartment down the road in silence. After seeing Jerry into his building I begin the hour drive back to my cabin. At times like this I wish I didn’t live rurally. Every shadow, every coyote I could only see Monica and her rabid state. I continued to brush it off as me hallucinating Monica and Brian once I got home. It didn’t take long for exhaustion for take over and I passed out. 


The next day Monica was back at her spot telling the watchers about the traffic. She looked perfectly healthy, her skin olive and taught, no longer hanging like fabric. Her smile was pearly and white, not bloodstained like the night before. I once again chalked the night prior up to exhaustion induced hallucinations. Until Monica made an announcement to the public about their need for an intern as the last had a very serious “accident” and to put in applications if you would like the position.

Jerry had just started walking in as she was saying this and his face drew pale, and I knew he was feeling the same I felt in that moment. 

We went about our show as normal, although with a thick tension in the air. We were both terrified of what we would find tonight. I had asked for security to stay up to walk us out but like always he had fallen asleep, leaving Jerry and I to the wolves. Well anchors. 

We crept the hallways hearing the slurping coming from a room across from Monica’s. Not bothering to freeze we booked it being smarter than the previous night. I also knew I couldn’t stomach the sight once more. 


This had gone on for months where we’d make it out by the skin of our teeth. But we always made it out together. Until one night when Jerry had wanted to get a closer look to see what was causing these anchors to become these monsters after they clock out. I begged him not to go in but he insisted if he was quiet they would never notice him. I stayed in the dimly lit hallway while he crept into a dressing room oozing with the sound of slurping. I could barely see Jerry from the lights but I could tell this wasn’t going to end well. My gut said to just leave him there and to save myself while I still had the chance. But I stood there. The slurping stopped and so did my heart. 

A low growl emanated from the room before Jerry’s blood curdling scream. That was enough to make me leave everything there. I didn’t even get in my car. Just sprinted to the nearest motel. I couldn’t sleep. How could I knowing my best friend died and I ran away.



I go into work to resign the next day when the news station informed me of Jerry’s “sudden family issues”back  in Ireland and he wont be coming back. I knew that Jerry’s body had been found in that dressing room. I knew what had happened the night before. I knew they were covering up for whatever is going on here. In that moment I changed my mind about resigning, I couldn’t let this happen to anymore interns or anymore late night hosts. 

Ten years later I think I am close to the answer that Jerry died trying to find. I have searched security footage that I stole from the guard while he is asleep, I saw what happened to each innocent victim. I watched the cleaning crew come in and clean up the mangled bodies, piece by piece over the grainy footage. 

Today I got a strange package with nothing other than a piece of paper with “You’re next” scribbled in some sort of clumpy red ink, and a bracelet Jerry and I had together. 

I can’t let them take me without avenging my best friend, but Monica is standing in the woods outside my house, dozens of sickly bodies emerge behind her. We make eye contact. She licks her lips."

I am 23 years old dreaming of making a career abroad, my\_qualifications: recently had my undergraduate degree in BBA (Bachelors of Business Administration) from a Tier 3 college. It's a 3 year degree originally, but took me an additional year to complete because I had backlogs, thus 4 years in total . 

My GPA is 5.8 (almost 53%). I don't have any internships or work experiences to show on my resume. After graduating a few months ago, I started thinking about switching my career from business/management to I.T. field and eventually, study abroad. 

I want to pursue Masters in CS so I have started teaching myself coding and other CS related topics using online resources.

Since my profile is very poor, I wanted to boost it and give myself a chance by scoring well in GRE and TOEFL/IELTS. Initially I planned on moving by Aug 2022, but later on came to know, as per my research, that no matter how much I try from now on, 

I'm not going to get admits. I have also found that universities do not accept 3 year degrees, let alone my study field.

I wanted to know if there are any other options to increase my chances of studying abroad and move by mid-2022 because age is a factor so probably in next 2 years I wanted to finish my degree. I understand that its impossible, still I wanted to give a try.

Any advices/suggestions are much appreciated.

qv5coh,4,2021-11-16,How do I even catch up lol,womaninthekitcjen,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/qv5coh/how_do_i_even_catch_up_lol/,"I’ll keep it short

I’m a 5th sem Mechatrpnics Systems engineering student. But currently taking courses from the 3rd semester (which is 75% of students I know). Unlike the, I haven’t even passed basic Intro maths and Statics from my first semester, nor any 2d semester course. 
I had very bad sleep apnea, and ran on 2-3h of terrible sleep generally. My AHI was 25 and for 3 years I did pretty much nothing except feeling like shit and playing video games and eating junk food.

I really hate blaming external factors but ever since I got my tonsils removed, adenoids and uvula reduced, my life took a 180 turn (2 weeks ago). It was so bad that I was even scared of sleeping sometimes cause I “forgot” to breathe and kept choking continuously. My sleep study revealed my brain was continuously deprived of oxygen and I chocked about 50times in my sleep (4hrs sleep, 50 apneas, 101 hypopneas).


Because of this life sucked, no one took me seriously when I said I had a problem, even my doctor. 

So that’s 5 semesters where I’m supposed to be at 80CP and preparing for my internship next semester but I’m here at 33CP.

I’m not desperate or sad or depressed, very optimistic actually, and always was even during the hard times. I could never follow a lecture because of the headaches and sleepiness. Now I feel fresh and focused all the time without even trying.

I’d tried all kids of drugs and supplements just cause my idiot of a doc didn’t give a shit about me.

Any tips to catch up? Thanks"

One means I'll work in CS the other means I'll work as a SysAdmin, this internship is 600 hours and those are my last 6 months of the degree so, likely I'll keep working with the company.

I'm currently living in Spain and is always said that CS is better paid than System Administrator, however, I think that SysAdmin better suits me, also I like it more and I feel I can be a very good one in the future. So the main problem here is the salary gap and the future projections (idc if I start earning less but I can earn more in the future, as a SysAdmin)"

I’m a high school senior and i have no experience at all in programming. I plan on majoring in CS and math in college. I wanted to do a lot of self study in programming so I can get really good. 

My overall goal is getting good enough so I can get a freshman internship.

Here is my full plan.

I can get a new Macbook Pro this summer. I plan on learning C or C++ as my first language. Give or take some weekends and some weekdays, I can dedicate my entire summer and all my free time towards learning programming. 

During the school year, I’m going to spend ALL of my free time continuing to learn. I’m gonna be joining some clubs and I’m gonna have a part time job too, but any free time I get will be put towards programming. No breaks at all. 

My deadline is may, which is right before the summer when I presumably get my internship.

With this plan in mind, how good can I get at programming from June 2022 to May 2023?"
qv7f5e,3,2021-11-16,Really fricking struggling with this whole life thing right about now,tayZa_89,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/qv7f5e/really_fricking_struggling_with_this_whole_life/,"So I'm currently waiting for my diagnosis appointment, it'll probably be some time in late February earliest. Despite this, im about 99% sure that I have ADHD. Its a very new concept for me, not even a month old, but man I dont think my issues could be down to anything else.

I'm struggling man. Some days it's okay, but some days are just awful. Im studying a university degree in psychology, a subject I love and want to have a career in, but my modules are boring, and just can't make myself do the work for them, there's no interest there. I recently broke my elbow in an accident, and so can't powerlift which I had been doing 3-4 times a week for two years non stop, so I'm losing my mind over that too. I keep finding symptoms and issues linked with my adhd that are frustrating and just suck, like picking and fiddling constantly, not being able to concentrate on work, emotional dysregulation etc. Before I didnt notice most of them very much, I just thought it was me and that I idk lost motivation that day or something, but now that I know (or am very very sure) its adhd they all seem to suck and bother me. 

I know nothing about me has changed ultimately, and if someone else was suffering like this I would tell them its all okay, its not their fault, and they can find ways to deal with it. But its a whole other ball game when its yourself isn't it.

I've never struggled so hard with academics, I've always been pretty okay. I think the reason why i could study so well for my A-levels though is that I was going through some life changing trauma and school was my only thing to throw myself into that didn't drive me insane. So maybe I've just hit that wall I was always gonna hit. 

The issue with that is I won't be able to get accomodations for studying/exams/deadlines from uni until after the official diagnosis. And thats months away. Im behind currently and csnt concentrate enough to get back to where I'm supposed to be. I've never been behind, it feels awful. I feel like I'm gonna end up submitting substandard work due to not being able to assign enough time and motivation to finish the stuff that needs to be done. I just feel like shit. I've always been a smart kid, seen as the relatively naturally intelligent one of the group, and now I feel like I just suck.

Meanwhile my significant other who I live with is in his final year, he's phenomenal at academics, reallllly gifted, and he's going places. He might be moving a little away next year to do an internship thing for his chosen job, which is amazing for him, and we'll definitely manage, but  im so scared that living without him is gonna be hell for me. He is (healthily) a massive part of my drive and motivation, he makes me wanna be the best I can be, and we are a bit of a power couple, but having lived with him for 2 years now I feel like not having that is gonna be a massive change for me and im scared im not gonna be able to do daily tasks as well, as I dont have him to keep me accountable.

Also, I am really struggling to keep friends. I've never struggled socially really, as in my ability to socialise and make friends, always been bubbly and open, and I'm not having trouble doing that really, when I'm with people I am bubbly and social, but I just have NO motivation to meet with them and hang out really. I dont like drinking really, and in uni that's everyone's best personality trait, so that makes it harder. 

I'm happy overall, I dont have depression thankfully, and im content with who I am and my life overall. But there are some aspects as said that im really not happy with and I just can't face them, I dont know how to make friends with these issues and sort them out gradually. I dont wanna face them. They suck.

On top of all that, despite having really strong signs of having adhd im suffering hard from my mind just telling me im lying and making it all up and I just am this way and its not adhd. That drives me insane too.

This was really long, thanks for reading if you got to the end :) I appreciate you"

I have been double majoring in CS and DS at UW-Madison until now and I have taken a fair amount of classes in both CS and DS, but my interests incline more towards data science. I have 2 CS electives, advanced math, and a software/hardware course left. I don't seem to find any interest in OS/Compilers etc. I wanted to take Software Engineering but it's not being offered in the Spring. I honestly feel more inclined towards data science, even based on my past internship experiences and the courses I took on campus. Also, the internship that I'll be doing this coming summer will also (most probably) deal with AI/ML. I don't if it sounds like the right decision but I'm thinking of taking more data science courses and planning to just end up with a minor in CS and a major in DS. Does it sound like a thoughtful plan or would it be a waste of money?"

I'm having a lot of trouble deciding between these 3. They all have really good intern =&gt; full time conversion, so I'm not worried about this. They are all in the summer and can't be moved to another term, and this would likely be my last internship before graduating so unless I continue the new grad search, I'll probably take a return from wherever I choose

**MongoDB**

pros:

* Guaranteed in person in NY
* Best *internship* experience
* High pay
* Can choose from multiple teams, lateral movement also really good for the future

*cons:*

* Least resume boosting
* Not the most interested in the product tbh

**Salesforce**

pros:

* The project/product I'm working on is going to be pretty new so I'll be able to work on any part of the project (backend, fe, big data, etc.). I'll be able to explore any domain I'd like which is really valuable
* Best culture IMO
* Great pay and benefits

cons:

* It's in data security which I have experience in, but i'm not the most interested in this field tbh
* Theyre aiming for in person, but who knows. It's in SF which is cool for an internship, but I think I wanna be in NY full time, and i'd return to the same team in SF

**Facebook**

pros

* it's a TPM position so I'll get to try it out before graduating (since it's potentially a position I want to end up in)
* Looks good on resume
* It's for the team and domain I want! I have a law + cs background, so super applicable to privacy
* In NY :)

cons

* Kinda want to do SWE for new grad, so not sure this is the wisest choice (then again I'll never get to try it)?
* aiming for in person, but not guaranteed like other internships i guess
* privacy @ facebook is this a red flag L O L
* It could end up being really project management heavy and not as technical, but I could probably talk to my mentor if anything so not really a con
*  Pay is the lowest which is fine for an internship, but TPMs just get paid less than SWE in general (for full time consideration)

any advice appreciated 🥺"

I applied to internships of many reputable finance firms. I’m thrilled to say I **wasted** a lot of my time; however I ended passing most (if not all) their most difficult phases of the internship process which were the numeric, judgement and reasoning tests. 

I just got congratulation emails from two different companies which further invited me to a **video interview**, therefore I was wondering if some of you have any advice on how to impress the interviewer along with some of the most common questions they ask so I can prepare better.

Thanks all! 

The internships programmes that I heard back from are “Finance Summer Internship” and “Actuarial &amp; Finance summer internship”; I don’t know which one is better. The other ones I’m waiting to hear back from are Analyst, credit risk, banking and asset management"

qvbz3k,5,2021-11-16,Unable to stand the pain any longer?,ballduck44,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/qvbz3k/unable_to_stand_the_pain_any_longer/,"Some background: I have severe back pain and this is my first 9 to 5 role. I was in internships before but it wasn't a typical 9 to 5 m-f. I've been with the same company for almost two years. We have been remote since February 2020. Recently we had been told to be in office 3 times a week, despite me rarely if ever needing to physically be in office. I believe they only want us in more because of a new building and in the past they were adamant on staying home if you're sick. Due to delta we still need to wear masks and limit occupancyin areas, so again I am confused why we would want more people in the building more often but I digress. 

I changed roles in October so am under a new manager.  I have chronic back pain that I need to go to pt and acupuncture appointments to help manage. I started pt in August when insurance allowed it to be 0 cost. I started acupuncture a couple of weeks ago because its finally 0 cost, but only until end of year. When interviewing for this new role I explained the back pain and the appointments,  one is after work hours (anywhere between 5-7) and the other I did not yet have the ability to go to but I did mention I'd be going to appointments when I can. The other appointments I have to go during the day(theyre only open 9 to 5 mf). Because of my chronic back pain I cannot sit stand walk etc too long or I get back pain. I do go to the gym on top of the appointments to do light strength training and cardio.

Because of the long hours in an uncomfortable office chair, my back hurts when I go into office. I have tried lumbar supports and found one that is okay to use in office, but it doesn't prevent the pain or alleviate it. The manager offered to get a different chair, but I explained to have to try different chairs and continue returning them when it most likely would still cause back pain is a hassle. I currently have a gaming chair at home with a cushion but its not the chair that prevents pain. 

Working from home causes little to no pain because I am able to sit how I want, dress comfortably,  change the temperature to whats comfortable, lay down if I need to, use a heating pad and get up and walk around as much as I want which can help alleviate the pain. I explained this to my new manager and they usually are okay with me leaving early if my back pain is severe. They asked I get a note from dr stating long hours of sitting causes me extreme pain and discomfort and to allow for me to continue working from home should my pain be severe. I got the note and brought it in this week. 

My upper manager wanted to speak about my hours. When I spoke with the upper manager, I explained the appointments and back pain situations again to which they said its fine by them if I leave early to make my appointment times and if I could make it in 2-3 days a week which I said yes I can do at least 2 days. 

They spoke to me about coming in due to them needing me in office last week ( I wasnt told about which days or at all) when I only went in one day because i was sick since Monday and had previously requested pto on that Friday. I don't believe this was told to my upper manager because she said my direct manager needed help for an upcoming event, but as I said I was sick with a fever and was told not to come into office. My coworker has same position as me and said they could help while I worked from home sick.

This week I worked a later half day and another 9-345 to then make my appointment for 5. The day I had to leave for this, I told my manager that I was leaving on my lunch to which they said they don't understand why I need 5 hours before my appointment (assuming I was taking my lunch at 12, which I did not say I was doing nor do I take my lunches at 12 anyway). I explained i was going to leave at 1 or 2 and ended up staying until 3:45, basically a full day. 

This week I also have an appt at 1245, they need me to come in that day in the morning and asked if I could come back after my appointment to which I said no (its a half hour drive home and another 15 to the appointment without counting me changing out of my work clothes) because I can finish the work at home. To this my manager said to make sure I come in two full days next week as I had agreed with the upper manager. 

I am super frustrated because I feel like I have to deal with the pain for a full day in fear that Ill have to come in even more days to make up for any full days I dont complete. Despite me having a note and being told it was okay to leave early to make appointments, I sense annoyance and attitude now. 

I want to leave the company. I don't have another job lined up but my position is high demand and finding another job that is completely remote shouldn't be too difficult for me. If anything I could get set up in a temp position somewhere else which is actually what I was doing before I got officially hired by the company. 

I'm not sure how to approach this, I just don't understand why I would need to come in if I have pain coming in. I get all my work done at home. I actually work too well, I usually am looking for more work to do and I feel like I'm just given busy work."

**Work Won't Love You Back** by *Sarah Jaffe*

&gt;In Work Won’t Love You Back, Sarah Jaffe, a preeminent voice on labor, inequality, and social movements, examines this “labor of love” myth — the idea that certain work is not really work, and therefore should be done out of passion instead of pay. Told through the lives and experiences of workers in various industries — from the unpaid intern, to the overworked teacher, to the nonprofit worker and even the professional athlete — Jaffe reveals how all of us have been tricked into buying into a new tyranny of work.

&gt;As Jaffe argues, understanding the trap of the labor of love will empower us to work less and demand what our work is worth. And once freed from those binds, we can finally figure out what actually gives us joy, pleasure, and satisfaction.

**Sleeping Giant: The Untapped Economic and Political Power of America's New Working Class** by *Tamara Draut*



&gt;REVISED AND UPDATED WITH A NEW PREFACE Today's working class is a sleeping giant. And as Tamara Draut makes abundantly clear, it is just now waking up to its untapped political power. Sleeping Giant is the first major examination of the new working class and the role it will play in our economic and political future. Blending moving individual narratives, historical background, and sophisticated analysis, Draut forcefully argues that this newly energized class is far along in the process of changing America for the better. Draut examines the legacy of exclusion based on race and gender that contributes to the invisibility of the new working class, despite their entwinement in everyone's day-to-day life. No longer confined to the assembly line, today's working class watches our children and cares for our parents. They park our cars, screen our luggage, clean our offices, and cook and serve our meals. They are us. With ""Fight for $15"" minimum-wage protests popping up throughout the country (and in some places winning) and economic inequality being recognized as one of the defining issues of our time, today's working class will soon become impossible to ignore and foolish to dismiss. Sleeping Giant is the first book to tell the story of this extraordinary transformation in full and inspiring detail.

**Why Women Have Better Sex Under Socialism: And Other Arguments for Economic Independence**  by *Kristen Ghodsee*

&gt;A spirited, deeply researched exploration of why capitalism is bad for women and how, when done right, socialism leads to economic independence, better labor conditions, better work-life balance and, yes, even better sex.

&gt;In a witty, irreverent op-ed piece that went viral, Kristen Ghodsee argued that women had better sex under socialism. The response was tremendous — clearly she articulated something many women had sensed for years: the problem is with capitalism, not with us.

**On the Clock: What Low-Wage Work Did to Me and How It Drives America Insane** by *Emily Guendelsberger*

&gt; ""Nickel and Dimed for the Amazon age,"" (Salon) the bitingly funny, eye-opening story of finding work in the automated and time-starved world of hourly low-wage labor
After the local newspaper where she worked as a reporter closed, Emily Guendelsberger took a pre-Christmas job at an Amazon fulfillment center outside Louisville, Kentucky. There, the vending machines were stocked with painkillers, and the staff turnover was dizzying. In the new year, she travelled to North Carolina to work at a call center, a place where even bathroom breaks were timed to the second. And finally, Guendelsberger was hired at a San Francisco McDonald's, narrowly escaping revenge-seeking customers who pelted her with condiments.

&gt;Across three jobs, and in three different parts of the country, Guendelsberger directly took part in the revolution changing the U.S. workplace. Offering an up-close portrait of America's actual ""essential workers,"" On the Clock examines the broken social safety net as well as an economy that has purposely had all the slack drained out and converted to profit. Until robots pack boxes, resolve billing issues, and make fast food, human beings supervised by AI will continue to get the job done. Guendelsberger shows us how workers went from being the most expensive element of production to the cheapest - and how low wage jobs have been remade to serve the ideals of efficiency, at the cost of humanity.

&gt;On the Clock explores the lengths that half of Americans will go to in order to make a living, offering not only a better understanding of the modern workplace, but also surprising solutions to make work more humane for millions of Americans.

**Pay differences (hourly):** EY is highest, then PwC paying $2 less, and last is Deloitte paying $3 less than PwC. I am not too worried about pay since it is just an internship but I believe these would reflect their full time offers so I am also trying to keep that in mind.

For context, I have no experience in consulting, and I haven't taken any cyber or cloud classes yet so I am not 100% sure on what each one does. I have been leaning more towards cloud since it seems like a broader and less technical field. I am a Management Information Systems student, so my technical skills are pretty lacking lol. Another reason why I liked PwC is that I would be in the NY office which sounds pretty fun since I've lived in Atlanta my whole life, although I have a feeling I could ask EY to switch my location to NY as well so I am not too worried about that. However, I know cybersecurity has a huge demand right now, and there are a lot of great career paths there as well.

What do you guys think?"

I’ve been a member of r/csMajors for a while and even though I majored in MIS I have really loved learning what you all are going through and how you all have overcome the obstacles you all face. This has led me to ask, which resources would you all recommend if I were to create an e-commerce website similar to Amazon. In MIS I never really learned how to code so I’d love to learn where to start. I appreciate all of your feedback and I wish everyone who is trying to get jobs and internships the best of luck!"

My **ACT** composite is 34. I took the **highest level of courses** my high school (which is one of the **top schools** in my country) can offer, with **grades of 94-98**. If it is relevant, I also had several perfect grades in CS.

Most notable **activities**:

* Internship in IEEE (I believe this is a famous organization?)
* Work experience, although unrelated to CS (5 years now)
* Leadership roles in two technology clubs
* Animator in an organization
* The rest are hobbies with notable outputs (Art and Literature)

**Awards**:

* Honors (School-level)
* 2 freeCodeCamp Certifications

**Essays** are quite solid and have been checked by about 5 other people, so that's that.

I know the low activities and awards will definitely hurt my admission chances, but I still want to know if I still have a chance at well...

* MIT
* Ivies
* Cornell
* Amherst
* CalTech
* NYU

And can I also ask for target school suggestions? Reach suggestions are also appreciated, thanks!"

I have had to learn a lot of command line to execute all these programs on the schools supercomputer which fueled my interest in comp sci. I recently have been applying to a lot of chemistry internships some of which have comp sci aspects. I started code academy to teach myself all of command line as well as python because those are the two main languages we use in the group. I want to teach myself more eventually but IDK what to do.

I want everyone's advice on what to do with my time. I am still interested in chemistry but I am leaning toward comp sci as a career mainly because I don't want to complete a PhD in my field. Should I continue working on my research in hopes of a paper? Should I apply to comp sci internships for this summer or just start applying when I know more (after I graduate)? any tips help thanks hehe"

I haven't taken the time yet to start on projects or explore other coding languages, but I have a lot of free time and want to dedicate some of it to building a resume.

This post was obviously inspired by u/momo2503 (go check out their post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/quomzp/lets_see_how_accurate_this_sub_is/)). I really liked the idea of the post, but I thought it would make more sense for a college freshman to do it so the class of 2022 can be more informed going into the admissions cycle.

I'm currently a freshman at \[university\], and I was always curious on how accurate this sub actually is. Since I never actually posted a chance me when I was a high school senior, let's see if you all can predict which colleges I got into! I'll post the results of my admission in a week or two, and I'll also talk about my admission file ([PART TWO HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/r0yxtn/lets_test_the_accuracy_of_this_sub_east_asian/))

**Demographics**: Male, East Asian (Chinese), US Citizen (Michigan), private college prep school (around 150 in class), no finaid

**Intended Major(s)**: Computer Science

**ACT/SAT/SAT II:** SAT 1590 (Math 800 EWR 790), ACT 36 (36 in all categories), 800 in SAT Math II and Chemistry subject tests

**UW/W GPA and Rank:** (4.0/4.0 unweighted, my school doesn't do weighted GPA). Ranked around top 2-3 in class.

**Coursework**: I took an all-honors course load, pretty much all the hardest courses my school has to offer.

AP Classes: Chinese, European History, Chemistry, US History, BC Calculus, Physics C Mechanics, Physics C E&amp;M, Computer Science A (all 5)

Took AP Spanish, AP Gov, and AP Statistics in senior year

**Awards:**

1. Qualifier for 2020 Regeneron ISEF (Cancelled due to COVID-19), 1st place at Michigan Science and Engineering Fair (11th grade)
2. 3rd Place at Michigan Science and Engineering Fair, 2nd place at Science and Engineering Fair of Metro Detroit (10th grade)
3. National Spanish Exam Gold Medal (9, 10, 11th grade)
4. National Merit Scholarship Semifinalist (11th grade)
5. Association of Chinese Americans Best All-Around Scholarship (12th grade)

**Extracurriculars:**

*Paid Work:*

Research Assistant at T20 university. Conducted research in monocular depth estimation with convolutional neural networks, collaborated with graduate researchers. I'm pretty sure I was the first high schooler to work in the AI labs at the university. (11th grade).

AI and Python Instructor, small company. This company was started by my friend's mom during quarantine and basically just consisted of online classes. I designed a course on deep learning that aimed to make the field more accessible to less experienced middle and high schoolers, had around 30 students. (11th-12th grade).

Machine Learning Internship, local university in state. Basically learned Machine Learning and conducted pretty basic independent research projects under professor's guidance (10th grade).

*Clubs:*

Independent researcher, Science and Research club. I did projects that were used to diagnose malaria and lung cancer, these were the projects I submitted for science fair. I also built a PC I used for deep learning, and presented a webinar introducing AI to more than 100 people. (10-12th grade).

Founder, Honors Woodwind Quintet. My school didn't have many chamber ensembles at the time, so I founded one with my friends and we performed for the local community. (11th-12th grade).

Varsity A team member, Quiz Bowl. Founded a Discord server with 200+ members from around the Midwest. Helped coordinate and organize two quiz bowl sets/tournaments for charity that were then played at the national level. My team won states and got 49th nationally. (9th-12th grade).

Principal French Horn, Honors Symphonic Orchestra. I was first chair in my school's symphony orchestra. (9th-12th grade).

News Section Editor, School Newspaper. Directed and organized layout meetings, edited staff articles, coordinated and mentored section writers. (11th-12th grade).

*Athletics*:

JV Cross Country for four years lmao (I did PR in almost every race one season though)

*Community Service:*

More than 200 hours logged, mostly worked at a local food rescue organization that took food that would have been thrown away and redistribute it to the hungry in the community. I also helped recruit new volunteers and won Presidential Volunteer Service Awards.

**Additional Info**:

Since I didn't really have much space to write about my stuff in the extracurricular section, I put ""see add'l info"" and in this section I elaborated much more on my projects. I summarized my research project at the university, and gave abstracts for my science fair projects and listed in detail the awards they won. For my science fair projects, I emphasized how they were needed to help people in disadvantaged communities who didn't have access to sufficient medical care.

**Essays/LORs/Other:**

Personal Statement: 8/10, I was pretty proud of this essay. I used an uncommon link to give a lot of different aspects of my personality and brought in my community service and my AI experience.

Other essays: 8/10, I spent quite a bit of time and effort on these and tried to make them original. My essays had a significant emphasis on my drive to use AI for social good, as well as my volunteer experience. I also had several quirky ones to make my application less one-dimensional.

Counselor LOR: 9/10, she really likes me and she was my advisor (kinda like a homeroom teacher) for 2 years.

AP Euro/AP Gov teacher LOR: 8/10, he really likes me as well, and I heard he's really good at writing recommendation letters. I did really well in his classes and we still stay in touch to this day.

AP Physics C teacher LOR: 7/10, I think he likes me? I did really well in his class and frequently participated.

**Other Recommendations:**

I got a recommendation from the professor who I did research with at the university. I'm honestly not sure how good it is, so I'm going to guess a 7/10.

**Schools:**

1. UMich Engineering (EA)
2. Caltech (EA)
3. MIT (EA)
4. Carnegie-Mellon CS (RD)
5. Stanford (RD)
6. Cornell (RD)
7. UPenn Engineering (RD)
8. Columbia (RD)
9. Yale (RD)
10. Princeton (RD)

My stats:

\- Markets Tech Software Dev with 2y and 3m experience straight from a Comp Sci BSc.

\- Realised coding is not for me so looking to switch.

\- Looking to explore roles in SnT and IB (and PE etc). I did some shadowing during COVID (friends in SnT and IB WFH) and I think it is worth giving a shot.

I have done some research and my question is two-fold so I can get a quick reality check because if I cant break in I can just focus on something else. But I am here to try and give it my best.

Q1. AFAIK, my chance is either apply to a Graduate Scheme / Free-floating Analyst position and hope they don't reject me due to having ""too much irrelevant experience"" (apart from stuff I picked up on my current job I only have those Virtual Experience programs from The Forage I can put to showcase interest). ***Is this a total dead-end and I have zero chance because of not being a fresh grad?***

Q2. Since I am a very structured person if I imagine SnT and IB as career branches of a tree and I have no relevant experience there is no way I can get an Associate and the only thing before that is grad schemes / filler analyst roles. ***So if Q1 is ""no chance"", is my best shot applying for an MBA and trying to get some internship?***

2nd year. Published paper first year. But I can’t bring myself to work more than one day of the week on my research and it’s just turned into a frustrating, hateful cycle. And now I constantly stress about whether I should drop out or not. Plus my PhD is in ME &amp; my research is in machine learning. Bc of my research + last internship, I realized I want my career to be in ML or CS related (nothing at all to do with mechanical engineering). So now that’s also weighing on me— the fact that if I wanted a job in these industries I wouldn’t be very competitive after grad school (bc I’m pretty much self studying programming and some of ML as I go). Plus it feels silly having a PhD in ME when I don’t even like ME anymore. No passion or interest for it anymore. 

I’m just lost on what to do because the topic, advisor, and lab are all great but I just can’t self- motivate myself anymore. Probably bc of anxiety I feel related to my future career &amp; how what I’m doing now doesn’t best align with it (especially compared to just getting an MS in CS).

qvkuc4,266,2021-11-16,Messed up my career by pivoting to DS. Wondering if it's too late to switch to MLE,ds9329,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/qvkuc4/messed_up_my_career_by_pivoting_to_ds_wondering/,"29M, 6YoE, living in Europe. Did a Bachelors in SWE, had a FAANG internship but bombed the conversion interviews (still can't forgive myself for missing that opportunity! Really wish I did more LC grind).

After that I spent one year as a SWE at a noname company, but quickly became bored. I still enjoyed the engineering aspect of it, so had this ""brilliant"" idea that I should just start specialising in something cool - and as a result got into ML, did a Masters in DS and started looking for positions with ""Data Science"" in the title.

This is where things really went wrong for my career. 5 years and 3 jobs later I have now *finally* realised that most DS roles are not supposed to be engineering positions in the first place, but are just glorified business intelligence / product analytics jobs. I am now a ""Senior DS"" at a well-known mid-sized company 1-2 tiers below FAANG pay-wise. 70% of my job these days is building dashboards. The remaining 30% are random ad-hocs / data pulls for product owners. I haven't written a single line of production code in the last year.

Here is what's really sad - what I was looking for all these years **did** exist on the market, but this role has always been called **MLE**, not **DS**! I have also realised that I should stop working at mid-sized companies, as 99% of these are simply not mature enough to have any meaningful ML applications. The [""trimodal nature""](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineering-salaries-in-the-netherlands-and-europe/) article has also been quite an eye-opener for me - never realised just how underpaid I was compared to FAANGs in Europe.

Basically it took me 6 years to finally pin down my ideal career path (an MLE at a large established firm), but I now have a bitter realisation that I have deviated from it way too much to be successful any time soon.

I can now see two options for myself:

1. Stay on the ""deviated"" DS path and grow more towards a ""business problem solver"" / analytics manager type of role. My manager actually thinks I am really good at talking to people and keeps delegating more and more of his team lead responsibilities to me. Ironically, talking to people is the part of my job I hate the most. I am now due to start managing a team next year, but frankly not looking forward to it at all - to me this will only mean more office politics and fewer opportunities for technical growth (also tbh it just doesn't look like I'm going to get a raise that would justify it).
2. Try and go back into an engineering role, ideally MLE or maybe DE. Quite a few of my peers from uni are now in mid-senior roles at FAANGs, and I am wondering if it would be wise to play catch up at this stage. While there is definitely a huge gap between me and them skill-wise (5 years of no prod experience must have been detrimental...), I still do have solid CS fundamentals, can write clean code and unit tests, can use tools like git and docker etc. Totally expecting to be heavily lowballed if I manage to get into a big company, but wondering if it would still be worth it, as it would at least bring me back on track.

Overall I feel pretty demoralised tbh, as whatever I choose to do next, I'm still going to have to pay a lot for all the career mistakes I've made so far. This is sad, as I actually used to be top-5 in my class, and overall people tend to think I'm smart, but I've sort of ruined my early career by making all these wrong decisions. I am also trying to incorporate reading more engineering books / grinding LC into my daily routine, but without much success so far as I feel pretty burnt out tbh.

Looking for advice on what I should do in my situation. Do people have any success stories about going from DS to a MLE role?"
qvkw20,1,2021-11-16,Cisco Intern Housing Advice,misterchu23,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qvkw20/cisco_intern_housing_advice/,"Hi! 

I recently got an internship offer from Cisco and can't decide which housing option to take.

Option A: $8000 bonus (tax will be applied)

Option B: Cisco paid housing through National Corporate Housing (4 roommates + 2 bedrooms)

Since rent in San Jose is expensive and I'm not even from there originally, I think Option B is my better option. I've also never had a tech internship before so I was wondering how hard it would be to actually find a place to live on my own. Advice would be very much appreciated !"

Most of us are just babies and it's okay if you don't graduate making 100k+ (obviously would be super sexy but your time will come as will mine). I joined this sub to connect with other cs majors but it can be hard watching everyone else get offers and have insane thick juicy resumes.

I currently work as a Software Engineer (first job after graduation) and have been doing development in Python/C++. Not a brand-name company. I've also been writing technical blog posts on the side (tutorials related to Linux and cloud computing technologies such as Docker).

I have a degree in Electrical Engineering but took some software-related courses and all my internships are in software engineering.

I like my job but the pay is low and I don't feel super challenged right now. I have recently been interested in distributed systems. Looking at Software Engineer job postings from DigitalOcean and it looks like the skills I would need include REST, gRPC, Kafka, SQL.

My plan to get there is to:

1. Complete a cool side project

2. Improve my resume/LinkedIn

3. Create a portfolio website 

4. Leetcode/ maybe read crack the coding interview

5. Start applying (and maybe network with people on LinkedIn)

Does anyone have advice on how I should get a job here? Does my plan make sense? I also haven't decided on a personal project so suggestions are welcomed.

Does having technical publications look good on a resume or should I focus on a side project? Any advice is appreciated!"

I'm an international student if that matters.

I am switching careers from a sale career mid level to programming. I am going to go to online school to get my first degree. I have two different options for completion and I want to know if the high ranking public school is worth the price? 

&amp;#x200B;

The first option is as I said a highly ranked public school. I would be going online so I don't believe that I am eligible for the internship opportunities and even if I was I live in a completely different state. This option would be roughly $12,000 more than option number two.

The second option is an online school. It's not a degree mill, they have a brick and mortar, but it's nothing to write home about. It is a okay school, instate so pretty affordable, and ultimately $12,000 cheaper for the degree.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that schools with phenomenal reputations values lie in the relationships built and the internship opportunities. With that being said, is the high ranking public education worth $12,000 or will it not open any additional doors or have a better education? Thank you in advance for any help or for sharing your experience!"

Mostly because I enjoy both aspects of these fields. 

I've been applying for summer 2022 internships, and I constantly get rejected. I have only ever worked retail before, and I don't have any technical experience. This is my first semester of college, so I haven't really learnt a whole lot of anything besides Calc 1 lol.

I'm currently doing this Python course from which I'd get a certificate of completion. Would this make any difference on my resume? I'm thinking of getting a MATLAB certification too, if that would make my resume look better.

My high school GPA wasn't the greatest at the end cause I slacked off a lot in all my classes, so perhaps that's another reason why I get rejected all the time.

Does anyone have any tips on how to get an internship or make my resume look attractive if I have no prior job experience in engineering, or no degree?

I spent couple months on UE4 engine and made some games to put on my resume. However, only one game studio reached out to me. I aimed to their associate gameplay engineer role but things didn't go well for me. 

I asked them if I can apply their intern instead because I do not have other choice. I had a 3 hour whiteboard interview with them today but I didn't manage to pass it. I asked the interviewer how can I improve and get into game industy, and they told me to focus on low level C++ and 3D math, instead of game engines. They also told me to try again after 6 months.

My concern is:

Unlike game projects, C++ and 3D math won't look good on resume. I mean I already wrote I am good at C++ and 3D math on my resume and it only got me 1 interview so far. Moreover, I also think making more games and put them on my resume won't make a difference.

I tried to apply internship but most of them are for student only. I know that I need to practive C++ and 3D math now but it is like a deadend.

Any suggestion? Thank you in advance."

CMU Prompt 2: Put a club that I was really interested in and elaborated on my university research internship

CMU Prompt 3: Elaborated on how my math teacher roasted me for Calc AB self study but I ended up pulling it off

Additional Information (On CommonApp):

Couldn't really pick my own courses at 9th grade because of my ELD status (basically your English is bad and school thinks you can't handle honor / ap courses)

School goes ""Integrated Math"" pipeline so it's impossible to take Calc BC as a junior unless you self study AB (which I did among 2 other friends out of the entire class of 2022)

I have offers from both companies but I am not sure which one I rather go to.

Some background: I am currently a junior at uni looking for a summer internship but also looking at a potential company for a full-time offer assuming I get a return offer.

Amazon:

* (+) FAANG company (More prestigious idk)
* (+) Higher pay ($56/hr vs $48/hr)
* (+) Get to go on-site and meet other interns and physically see co-workers
* (-) Heard a lot of terrible things about Amazon from this subreddit such as WLB

Dropbox:

* (+) Good WLB
* (-) Virtual First (Virtual for full time and interns)
* (-) Lower Pay

I am leaning more towards Dropbox mainly because I feel like Dropbox will be better in the long run especially if I get a full-time offer. Full-time pay is approximately the same according to levels. Let me know what yall think about the two.

I am very fortunate to have gotten two great SWE internship offers this summer, but I’m having a tough time making a decision and would love to hear any insights from the members of this community!

One of these offers is Amazon which is a great company to have on a resume. I’ve heard working at Amazon can get you an interview at most places for future jobs. It’s also a larger tech company and I’ve only had experience working for smaller ones. The downsides here are that I’ll be put on a random team and I’ve heard negative things about the working culture there.

The other offer is MongoDB. MongoDB seems to have a great work culture and the people I’ve talked to have all been awesome. I also get to pick the team that I work on. The internship seems really well structured as well. My main concern here is that Amazon is more well known and might open more doors for the future, especially considering I don’t go to a well known school.

Personally, I would lean towards MongoDB for a full-time role between the two, but if my goal is to learn a lot and get a good experience this summer and then apply for other competitive companies in SF/NYC/SEA again next year for a new grad role, which company should I go with? Does Amazon look much better on a resume than MongoDB, and does that outweigh the positives that I get from an internship with MongoDB?

Thanks so much, I know I can’t go wrong with either option but I really appreciate any help I can get in making this decision."

I’ve left a few comments on other threads about my circumstances for my job, but last night was an absolute breaking point for me.

 

I want to also preface I don’t expect the world on a silver platter. I expect a fair and equal system that has room for growth, evolution, or even just change. I’ll try and be as thorough as I can with my thoughts, but there’s so much (and a lot of it is not enjoyable) that I might miss some. I'll gladly answer any questions in case anything I put down isn't clear or could use some extra details.

 

I work in a local city prosecutor’s office. It’s the same office I had an internship during my undergrad degree. It was during the Spring 2020 semester, so obviously it got cut super short. I thought I did the right thing and decided to work at a local grocery store to supplement the money since my previous job at an escape room let me go. I did this for about 3 or 4 months. My now wife was babysitting and earning unemployment since she was let go from her job as well.

 

Here is where the first issue begins. She got all of her unemployment no problem whatsoever. My first bout of unemployment took about 2 months to get approved since I had quit a restaurant job about 2 months before. It was planned, cordial, and unsurprising. They told me they were reviewing that record since it seemed suspicious. I had then quit the grocery store since they removed hazard pay, with zero warning, along with not enforcing anything COVID. I admit I checked the wrong boxes for this claim, but it’s now been over 1 year since my claim was filed. I’ve only received 2 calls: 1 was last year soon after my claim to tell me my options checked were wrong. The other was about 5 months ago saying “we’ll check in with the company since they say you became available starting the day you quit.” Haven’t heard anything since. All this on top of me still not earning my backpay from taxes because I had unemployment on my forms. So tl;dr of this section- lots of government money being withheld for review even though I did the “right” thing that they wanted most of the time.

 

The next issue is a bit more current. I was lucky to keep in contact with my supervisor of my internship, and he talked with his boss and got me in at the local prosecutor’s office, where I am now. It was an admin assistant position and when they asked about law school, I said it was fairly down the line. My supervisor’s boss said “let’s see if we can shorten that time period” which made me eager since it seemed like they would try and raise me up. In the past year and some months I’ve been here, the closest I’ve done to anything “legal” that wasn’t a template was researching news articles and tweets related to some cases. That’s it. My previous supervisor has left, his supervisor has left, a lot of the attorneys I met and got to know have left, and even our “head” law clerk has left. We’ve merged with another nearby unit since we were horribly understaffed with all the vacancies. I appreciate the new supervisor I have and people from his unit, but I have been relegated from at most a secondary role to an extremely tertiary role.

 

Here’s where my next problem comes in. Even with working here for over a year at this point, I’ve gotten very little workplace experience. I get a project every other month, and everything else I do is mail, maybe a supply order, and general stuff that doesn’t really amount. I want to do more, but the divisions are strict with only law clerks doing legal research and data analysts doing analyses. If I really want to do more, I have to either beg another unit (which isn’t too feasible since we’re all sorts of disconnected from each other), spend a lot of time to get internally promoted, or go to law school. Those aren’t exactly feasible options especially since we’ve just moved and have a wedding soon. So I’ve been trying to find a new job for the past 4+ months. I’ve been using Codecademy for coding experience and even just applied to my alma matter for a certificate in Cybersecurity. Problem is, those experiences are either going to take time (and money) or have very little bearing on my job prospects. I have applied to over 200 jobs at this point (I looked at the counts within my emails) and gotten absolutely nothing. Yes I’ve been looking within my field (English BA degree, but no writing jobs want me, and no other admin positions want me even with my current experience) and even trying for some entry level IT. The only jobs I got interviews for were my old supervisor’s new firm, which was a super toxic position (I can post it if y’all really want) and turned down, as well as a recruiter who would basically exfil me with a private company they have equity with that I interview with tonight. Probably going to turn that down since their reviews are horrible and it’s just a purely remote admin position at the beck and call of the other company.

 

I had a complete breakdown into my wife’s arms last night after I went and started a whole argument with her over something as stupid as a chair. It makes me feel horrible how I keep doing this to her, and while she’s super kind and wants me to be okay, I can’t help but feel like there’s a count I’m adding to that’ll just break it all up. I’m trying to get an appointment with a therapist, but that’s obviously not a be-all-end-all kind of thing. I want a job that isn’t a war to go to everyday and leaves in a mental state that I am an absolute waste of oxygen and space. I’m hoping that can be at least a stepping stone to not hate waking up every single day I have to go in, and have a more at ease general mental state. I’ve had some of those classic dark thoughts as well as thoughts of devaluing myself. “What if I just work at another grocery store again?” “What if I just work for super local government construction because I’ll at least do something?” (That’s not a dig to construction workers, I just don’t have any real goals within construction that I would want to attain). I want to be mental stimulated, I want to contribute, I want to be a part of something that I appreciate, support, and am respected by. My wife has that with her job and her company, and I’m so happy for her because of that. I just want to be in that same boat, and not the one I’m in right now. I’m just… I’m at a breaking point, and while I can take these empty rejections, I’m just going through the motions right now because of how much it weighs on me. I want it to end, and I want to find something that can actually give me meaning."
qw2fbs,8,2021-11-17,Website Design - How do I get from 270 to Hero?,scott_sleepy,OSUOnlineCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSUOnlineCS/comments/qw2fbs/website_design_how_do_i_get_from_270_to_hero/,"Hi All,

I'm about to graduate from the program in a couple quarters, and so far my only web dev experience was:

1. CS 290
2. CS 340 (I decided to YOLO and build a bigger website than was required)

I have not used a web framework yet. The websites I made were purely manual HTML and CSS (with some JS in there). I just envisioned what a webpage might look like, and tried my best with HTML and CSS to pull it together.  (Disclaimer: The struggle bus was ridden). Pulled inspiration and CSS answers from Google when needed.

It was a painstakingly slow and arduous process. And my websites definitely looked more like a polished late 90s homebrew webpage. My goal was to have a website that looked modern-day professional, but I definitely fell short. Partly because of my own artistic limitations, and partly because I just couldn't create with manual HTML/CSS the look &amp; feel I wanted to. There has to be a better way.

&amp;#x200B;

**My questions for you all:**

* How does one make beautiful-looking websites?
* Is it really about being a wizard with manual HTML / CSS / JS, or are there frameworks / other tools out there that make this easier?
* Does pulling in Graphic Design talent help?
* What resources, frameworks, or &lt;other&gt; is out there that can help?
* What other talents do you need besides just the technical skills?

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I'm asking is because I'm in an internship right now where I may have to make a website. I'm confident in my ability to actually *make* a website, but struggling with the *how to make it look beautiful and professional* aspect. Part of that is my fear of having to wrangle CSS in ways I don't know how to make it look polished. I keep thinking that there has to be a better way.

Any insight or tips?"

qw2qxm,3,2021-11-17,TN Visa for Interns?,[deleted],uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/qw2qxm/tn_visa_for_interns/,"Hey! I recently got an offer from a big tech company in the USA for summer 2022. I'm a Canadian citizen and this will be my first US work term. I'm in CS if that matters.

It seems that they want me to get a TN Visa for this. However, I've read online that these require you to already have a degree. But I've also seen some conflicting information that says some interns have gotten a TN before. I know J-1 Visas are the usual standard for internships.

Does anyone have any experience getting a TN visa for a co-op in the USA? Were there any issues?"
qw31xa,7,2021-11-17,Am I better off delaying graduation to fit in more internships?,OllivanderAU,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/qw31xa/am_i_better_off_delaying_graduation_to_fit_in/,"A little context first. I’m a second degree CS bachelors student. I was previously in medicine, and have since withdrawn and am near completion of a computer science degree. My first degree was in finance and chemistry. I have one semester remaining of the actual CS classes I need to graduate. Because of my age (29 years old) and needing to work to afford a second bachelor’s, I haven’t been able to do an internship up to this point. My first internship will be this upcoming summer. Am I best off delaying graduation from August until December to fit in two potential internships to beef up my resume and gain skill sets and work experience that I might not have the opportunity to do otherwise? I feel as though it’s easier to land internships than it is full-time roles without having those internships on my resume. Also, the summer internship could be a spring board for a more prestigious internship in the Fall. I’m just trying to set myself up for the best path to success, and wanted to gauge opinions of those here on what you guys think. For reference, I go to a state school in the Southeast, so not a lot of prestige. Although I’m very driven and have applied to 200+ internships for the summer on my own. My school doesn’t really push internships, co-op, or things like that. Any help you guys provide would be much appreciated and go a long way to helping not only me but people in similar situations! Thanks in advance."

Frustrated and hopeless",Grouchy_Bench189,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qw42ss/applied_to_150_internships_ghosted_from_all_of/,"Hi all. I am a sophomore at an ivy league university studying CS. My GPA is around 3.7. I have some work experience (internship in freshman year at a small startup, active in many clubs around campus), so I am not sure why I am having this much trouble. I have not gotten a single interview yet. I have reached out to multiple recruiters, but I have not heard back from a single one of them. The only companies I have heard back from are the top tier ones: they sent me Coding assessments on hackerrank, but I flopped on most of them because I didn't leetcode over the summer. I am really at loss here. I would appreciate your advice on what to do."
qw4n3e,2,2021-11-17,I hate my ex so much but still love him what do I do?,axturo09,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/qw4n3e/i_hate_my_ex_so_much_but_still_love_him_what_do_i/,"I just got out of a two year relationship that ended up really bad. But I don’t know if I’m in the wrong. 

Me and my ex partner (C) met on Tinder around Jan 2020. At this point I had just gotten my heart broken by this man ( A). Me and A didn’t really date but we talked for about 2-3 months. Soon after me and A stoped talking thats when I met C. C and I didn’t really hit it off at first since he was a bad texter. Eventually after a couple days we stopped texting each other since I had lost interest. 

Late Feb 2020, me and (A) started talking after his and his short term BF had broken up. Actually I found out that A cut me off to please his BF at the time. At first the found was a little fresh but at this time I was strong enough to be casual friends since we did have a good connection. 

A few weeks into the initial March shutdown, I was going through my old texts and randomly texted C. C and I quickly started texting back and forward and eventually found a real connection. He was charming, very flirty and virtually obsessed with me. This was really unexpected but very comforting since we were stuck inside. Eventually we ended up talking everyday and then broke quarantine to meet up. Since then I had been infatuated by them. After a couple more dates, he finally asked to be his BF.  



At the time, me and A were developing a strong friendship. I never saw him more than a friend at this point but still had a bit of trauma since he was my first heartbreak. Since I was unknowingly falling in love with C I was able to get over my heartbreak. 

C didn’t knew that A had hurt me but, didn’t know we had rekindled our friendship and I internationally kept it from him because C would always get upset and insecure about A. Initially when me and C would talk about A I would demonize because I was still hurt but eventually was able to overcome it. 

C also opened up about his past relationships. He had been in two prior relationships that same year which was not a red flag to me since I had never been in a real relationship with anyone. I thought it was normal. I then found out that C had cheated on his last two partners with each other which is why he eventually just ended both relationships. Both partners never found out about each other. 

Weeks went by and me and C were really developing a strong relationship. Everything was going well. Me and C eventually told each other we were madly in love with each other and everything was a literal dream.  

Then early summer came and things were starting to get rocky. C had a COVID scare and was really anxious since back in Summer 2020, it would take up to 12 days to get your test results. He was really scared and there wasn’t much I could do but I did feel bad. At the time, I was going through a lot too. Me and my parents were having really nasty fights since we were stuck at home for months. I was virtually miserable. I would go to C for this type of support since I was able to open up about my family life which I had never really done. I could sense that C was feeling overwhelmed by this so I stopped. That same week, I returned to work. 

Three days back into work, I get this gut feeling that something is off. I feel that C was starting to pull away and that something was wrong. That same day I get a text from my friend and he sent me a screenshot of C on a hookup app. Instantly, my stomach felt into a pit. I had never felt this type of betrayal before and didn’t really know how to handle it. I instantly call C and confront him about it. C is in shock and is stunned that I found out. C claimed that he had downloaded this app just to cancel a subscription since it had renewed which really didn’t make any sense. I start spiraling and start raging on him. I call him and Evil person and start sobbing my heart out. I then told C I would never talk to him ever again.  I left work and took the train home. As I was taking the train home the impulse of going to his house sounded like a good idea. So I have my friend drive me to confront him. 

When confronting him, he was virtually speechless. He was just crying and apologetic the whole time. My whole point of the confrontation was to address why was he on there truly since his excuse over the phone didn’t make sense. After asking him multiple times he confessed he had downloaded it because he felt alone. He said that I had been pushing my problems to the front and not giving him the attention he needed so he went on there to get a quick fix of attention. At first, he said it was only window shopping. He told me that had not talked to anyone and was just seeing who was on there. When asked to show me the message log, he deletes the app in front of me. At this point, I knew he had talked to other people and was even more hurt. 

When I asked him to re download and to log in all the messages were deleted. I instantly start loosing my shit and stopped believing him. After two hours of arguing, I agreed to try and work it out only if he told me the entire truth. He then proceeded to tell me that I already had the full truth. He then drove me home and the next day he revealed that he was unsure if he wanted to continue the relationship since he had hurt me so much. This was soul crushing since I really loved him a lot but we agreed to take a break to think objectively. We didn’t talk for a week and during this week we only journaled every night expressing our feelings and concerns around this hurtle. 

As soon as we started a break I had gotten a really bad tooth infection and was sick for around two weeks. After a week, he finally decided to continue our relationship. After this, I still had a pit feeling in my stomach telling me something about his “truth” wasn’t really the truth. So I took it upon myself to find out. 

That same summer I was kicked out from home and C and his family were able to house me for three weeks while I picked myself up. During these three weeks I was able to look through his Instagram DM’s after had logged into his Instagram on my phone and didn’t log out. I only found one red flag which was a DM from this guy he had hooked up with during a trip he took earlier this year to Seattle. The texts were the same day he was on the app. In the texts C was being very flirty with this person telling him all sorts of stuff like “i hope we cross paths again”. I tried not to make it a big deal so I kept it to myself since C wasn’t the one who initiated the conversation. 

I also found out that True Depth of C’s past relationships. C had told one of his last partner that he loved him. C always told me that he had never told anyone he’s dated that he loved them but me. Turns out it was a lie. He had told his last partner he loved him. I didn’t make a big deal about it but I did talk to him about it. He explained he was sorry he lied but that he thought he had loved him truly but didn’t really know what love was. I understood his perspective and didn’t make it a bigger deal than it need to be. 

After I was able to relocate to a new place, C and I were basically living together. C would come over every weekend and we did this for months. I was happy and starting to gain trust for him again. We would have small fights but nothing major. The only thing that would really bother me is that C constantly talked about sexual frustration. He said he would miss his old lifestyle in hookup culture. It got to a point where it made me feel insecure in our relationship. In my head I thought, if he misses that so much why is he with me then? He would always assure me that he loved me more. This was enough up until C started insisting a threesome. 

The idea of a threesome was nowhere near my comfort zone at the time. I expressed this to C many times but he still kept pushing hard. Eventually I caved around March of 2021. At this point we had been together almost a year and I was willing to compromise. I felt like I had enough trust to go through with it so we found a third on the same hookup app he was caught using the last summer. We found a guy but it didn’t work since we were basically cat-fished. We moved on from this and try again at later time. 

By this time, I had developed a close friendship with A. He had become one of my best friends and I really appreciated our friendship. It wasn’t anything romantic at all but I felt the need to keep it from C. I had demonized A early on in our relationship and C would not been fond since C grew to hate A since he hurt me so much. It was hard keeping this from C, so I made a new identity for A. I called this fictional character Callie. I explained to C everything about Callie which was the friendships me and A had developed. I thought this was right so potentially I could undo the tension I had create between C and A. I thought if C just saw Callie as as one of my girlfriends it would break the connotation that he was my ex whatever.  Eventually it became hard to conceal this friendship so one day I just told C the full truth. 

He was betrayed and devastated. I virtually had been lying to him for a year of our relationship and he was in every right to feel that way. But I need him to understand that me and A were strictly fiends. To try and fix this, I cut off A cold turkey. This brought some peace to C but it eventually brought me down. I had cut off one of my best friends for C. I felt terrible and lonely. Although I had C, I didn’t just want to talk to just him all the time. I finally revealed after a month that I had been really sad and missing A. C was able to compromise and understand that A was only a friend. A and I were able to rekindle our friendship but C still felt distrustful about it. After a while he was able to trust the whole friendship more but it took a lot. 

Weeks after this, C were at good place again. C would come over every-weekend and spend time with me my ESA’s  I had adopted early January 2021. C and I would always order out food through Ubereats. I usually ordered on my phone but every now and then C would order it. I would always pick up the food outside since I lived in an apartment complex. One day I was picking up the food and C had given me his phone to go pick up the food. I don’t know why but I thought this was an opportunity to ease my suspension from last summer. But when I checked his Snapchat, I found a chat from the same days he was on the app. 

The messages were typical tinder small talk but I was instantly triggered. I was triggered because another part of the actual truth had just came out. I also found out he had texted his ex partner that he loved  him to the moon and back. All of this lead to me spiraling again and raging. When confronted about it he explained that the he had simply forgotten about the conversation with this random guy on Snapchat. He revealed that the guy probably added him back when he was on the hookup app but the conversation was so meaningless that he had forgotten. I didn’t Believe him at first but eventually did since he broke down completely begging me to believe him. In regards to the texts between the ex, he explained he just told him that because his ex had randomly texted him about him almost dying and that he just wanted to say that he loved C. C just replied “to the moon and back” to the “I love you” text. He explained that he just told him that to avoid saying I love you because that would’ve painted a false picture. I was able to understand but the same pain from last summer had emerged. 

Due to this I took a week break from C to see if it was worth trying anymore. After lots of thinking I thought I did because he didn’t give up on me when I betrayed him so I thought it would be fair to keep going since i thought it would be terrible to give up on someone who didn’t give up on me.  We were able to overcome this and make forward with a clean slate of honesty so I thought. 

This really backtracked all the trust I had given him and it felt like we were starting from square one again but I thought it was okay because I loved C. 

A month later, me and C agreed to try that there some we had put off because C was starting to have a lot of sexual frustration and so was I. C felt sexual frustration because we weren’t the most compatible this way. He was more of a bottom than a top and I was completely a bottom. Although C enjoyed topping me he always told me he missed bottoming. I tried but was unsuccessful since it was painful for me. We tried other things like toys and stuff but C always told me it never fully scratched his itch. This further made me insecure about my relationship. I thought that C was going to get to a point where he would get so sexually frustrated that he would just cheat on me. 

I felt sexually frustration then too because C and I stopped having regular sex. Within the span on 6 weeks we had only had sex twice and that was only because C would get performance anxiety and could never orgasm fully. C blamed it on him gaining weight and just felt insecure about it. He said he would have start having sex with me once he felt better about his body. He would still jerk off but refused to have sex with me for three weeks at a time. There were moments where we would have sex and he would finish but only twice in the span of six weeks. This didn’t seem right since we were only 19. Although he was on anti anxiety meds, he would still masturbarte and orgasm but was unable during sex which made me feel bad. I thought it was me. This eventually stopped after he lost a few pounds and were back to having consistent sex. Everything was okay but the projection of this sexual frustrations started up again and were worse than ever. He would project them and I would offer some solutions but none were enough for him. He told me that it just wasn’t the real thing. He would also thirst heavily on other men. He would stare at them and sometimes he would even get viably upset. There’s been a number of times where he had cried because he missed bottoming so much. 

One distinct time was when I showed C my doorman at my building complex. He was very much C’s type and C would openly fantasize about my doorman. C kept asking me to ask my doorman to be our third but I always shut this idea down. Eventually I finally agreed to have a second threesome as a compromise for his sexual frustrations. In the moment it felt like it was the right thing to do since everything else we tried didn’t work but this would be a healthy way of him getting what he wanted but also me getting pleasure from it too. We again, downloaded the hookup app and found someone that same night. We invited the guy over and was another fail. The guy could not get fully erect meaning he couldn’t penetrate C. C also afterwards felt very insecure. He had felt that the guy liked me more than him which made him feel extremely insecure. I assured him that he was equally included especially since I did this for him. During the threesome I let him be the one to try and get penetration first. I made sure he was getting more attention than me and I didn’t mind it since I thought this what he needed to alleviate some of his frustration for the betterment of our relationship. 

After this we agreed to never do it again. Up until this last summer. This last summer we went on a trip to Arizona with one of my friends. She had a killer mansion and it seemed like much needed break from life. So once we get there I was the one to bring up the idea of a Threesome for two reasons. 1. I was curious because I had never been with another man other than C and 2. I wanted C to finally get his itch scratched. Since we were on vacation it was also something I could just leave here so it seemed like an optimal opportunity. So one the last two days we were in Arizona, we found a guy who was Interested.  I wasn’t too sure about the guy since he wasn’t much my type but C was really into it so I went along with it. The conversation with the third consistent so I had just thought nothing was gonna happen. 

The same night, C, me and my friends were going to go out but C decided to stay in since he wasn’t feeling good. When I came back, C had texted the guy and had arranged the guy to come down to the place we were staying. I was drunk and saw how excited he was so said yes but I only agreed to oral and nothing more. When the guy got there and we started going at it together C is getting a little too touchy with our third so I stop to tell him to chill. Then, we start going again and finally C puts me on the spot asking to go further than what we agreed to. I instantly said no and wanted the whole thing to be over immediately because I had gotten uncomfortable. 

After the guy left, C was visibly upset. Although he claimed he wasn’t he was upset because once again he didn’t get his itch scratched. Weeks after we got home from this trip, he felt into a deep depression. He felt ugly, insecure and all around bad. He later admitted that it was due to our third failed attempt. He again had felt that the guy was more into him than me. This caused him to spiral downwards. And at this point I had finally connected all the dots. 

C associated hookups with his self worth. This was due to his unhealthy indulgence in hookup culture since he was 16. He wasn’t cognitive of this until I talked to him about it. He agreed that it was true. I urged him immediately to get help so he could start dealing with these feelings in a healthy way. He pushed this off because he thought sex therapy wasn’t necessary. But it clearly was since he relied on hookups for validation. Due to the failed threesomes, he had felt insecure about himself. I pushed and pushed him to really get professional help but eventually I stopped because he truly didn’t think he needed it. 

Fast forward to Mid October of this year. Things had been going okay but things had changed. I was living in a place where he was no longer allowed to come over so I came to him instead. He also took one of my ESA’s and I kept the other. We were like a family. We would talk about how we were going to move in together and all live together United as a family. Some context about C and I, we’re both third year students in undergrad. I am also an undocumented student who goes to a private school meaning I don’t get any financial aid. To support school this school year I attained three jobs. One job as a legal fellow, a retail job and one side hustle as a free lance graphic designer for this marketing company. C was taking a full course load and had an internship near where I lived so we would constantly see each other on weekends. 

One weekend after this birthday,  we had dinner and headed back to my place where I snuck him in. I was feeling spontaneous and playful that night so we agree to download the hookup app to see who was near out of curiosity. I saw it in a way as I see couples watching porn together. It’s supposed to be fun and lighthearted thing to do as a couple but it got really dark really quickly. When trying to make the account, his email said that it had already been registered. I instantly freak out and he assures that it was just simply from our last time we used the app which was in Arizona. I was hesitant to believe him due to all the lies he had told me before. He gets really offended that I would think he would had an account after all we had been through but to me it wouldn’t be surprising if he did. For some reason he was able to make an account through google but not though the regular email registration although they were the same email. This at the moment made sense but later on seemed very odd. We were able to forget about this and move onto having the fun on the app we intended to have. Also, when choosing pictures of ourselves I saw he had a screen recording in his secure folder of the guys nudes from Arizona. He had told me had had delayed them but once again he had lied and kept them. He told me he did because they were just “memories”. This eventually made me even more suspicious. 

Almost immediately, we spot my doorman from my last apartment complex. C instantly turns into a different person. He got the look in his eyes as if his sexual frustration had been triggered. He got instantly predatory and obsessed about him. This was due to that we were unsure if he was gay or not or even a top or bottom. At first I went along with it. Seeing him on there confined he was gay and in fact a top. This instantly trigger C’s sexual frustrations. C had been wanting to have sex with my doorman for months. He fantasized about him which was the projection I’ve been talking about.  He said things like this that really made me question his loyalty to our relationship. After he realized he was getting out of hand we decided to go to sleep and delete the app . 

The next day we spent it at his place with his family. His family and I had built such s strong connection and bond over the year of knowing each other. C’s parents considered me their third son. They were there and very supportive of me and my well-being. They were truly lovely people. Anyways back to the story, we spent the day there which was like any usual weekend but we decided to have sex that night. When we have sex he usually finishes before me because it’s hard to orgasm from just anal. I usually end up finishing myself off which I don’t mind but that night I minded. C finished and promised me to help me finish and instead fell asleep. I got really annoyed because It had been a while since he had helped me orgasm although I always help him. I start crying out of frustration and I also hadn’t really processed the night before too and I just eventually started spiraling. At the moment I had decided I had enough of everything. At the time, I felt he hadn’t really changed because yet again he was fast to fall back into the same place he was months ago. I had realize he was just really holding back rather than actually fundamentally changing as he promised he would. I essentially broke up with him that night but I almost immediately regret it since I had realized I was giving up. He didn’t give up on me and I promised him I wouldn’t give up in him so I didn’t. We ended up leaving in weird place where we didn’t know where we stood. He drove me to the train station so I could head to workS I told him I would take the day to make a decision and reconvine at night. I went to work and everything was going well. 

Until when I get home from work, I check his google photos. He had logged onto my computer once and never logged out. That meant I had access to his google account. Since his phone is an android and linked to his google account I could see his whole phone activity. I would check this sometimes to see if he was doing anything suspicious because he had given me reason to. A few months back I stopped lurking all alone but after the last 48hrs I needed some of that validation. When I open the google photos, it’s a set of high quality nudes. Nudes taken on a tripod. This instantly sent me to a downward spiral. I instantly confront him because 1. He hasn’t sent me any nudes in months. 2. These nudes seem very intentional. 3. In the nudes, he purposefully took off a bracelet I had given him where my name was engraved in. All of this plus the context of the last 48hrs send me into this rampage. I was convinced he had gone off the rails and was on that hook up app again or sending these to someone else. I instantly start accusing him of being a cheater and a liar. I go on for around 30 mins just completely dragging him. He ultimately denied it and the more he did the more it made me not trust him.  He had given me a very overwhelming amount of reason not to believe him in the moment. I hang up and call him back and at the moment he had made the choice to no longer continue dating me. The next day He said he needed a break for at least a week to think about what had just happened. I agreed but shortly I failed. I couldn’t give him his space because I realized I had built a codependent relationship. It felt awful not talking to him. 

That same night I called him and broke down apologizing for freaking out and making him go through all of that. But he still insisted on a break to think about everything. So I tried my best. Prior to this break, his mom had just gotten surgery the week before. That same week his mom had gotten hospitalized for a infection in her kidneys. This very same week his dog of 15 years was also in the vet on fluids. 

Through the week I was really just isolated from everything. I didn’t know how to cope with any of my emotions and I start freaking out.  I tried to call him but at this point he was ignoring me. Things got really dark for me. I had major panic attacks and was basically hysterical all week. It got so bad I had to call a suicide hotline multiple times for support. I was so desperate to stop feeling my feelings that I genuinely considered harming myself but didn’t in the hope that they would just be temporary. I didn’t know who I could turn to. I didn’t have anybody who supported me like he did. I felt so alone and isolated. I did everything to try and take my mind of things even call my father which I hadn’t talked to in almost a year. This how desperate I was to take my mind off things but this turned out to be another dark discovery. 

I tried calling my dad multiple times but he didn’t pick up. After a few days of calling I check on his social media and see that there’s a bunch of memorial post. I instantly was petrified. I didn’t know if my dad was alive and I had been ignoring him for months now. I felt awful and all I wanted to was go to C for support and comfort. This is when my hysteria and desperation started. I started calling and texting him non stop to stop ignoring me so he could support me but he was just saying I needed to respect his space. I didn’t disclose that my father was potentially dead because I didn’t know yet but I just needed to feel comfort from him. He shut me down after I was begging and begging. I felt so inhumane in these moments because he promised to be there for me no matter what. Even in the moments when his mom and dog were hospitalized I was there checking up on them and him to make sure he was okay and he couldn’t do the same for me.  I was so hurt and  destroyed from this. 

Finally, the end of the break is coming up. The night before the break was over I went to to this party where I got blacked out drunk. The next day I had to go to work so you could only imagine what that was like. At work I’m already feeling like shit but I pull through. On my break, I try to get a hold of him but he’s ignoring me. Then I see his location through Snapchat and see that he’s at his friends house next to this major college town. I immediately freak out because it’s Halloween. He’s in a major college town on Halloween night and he’s probably going to be out late. On top of the rest of my anxiety this sends me Into a major panic attack to a point where I fainted at work. I passed out for 30 seconds out of stress. I start calling him frantically and he finally agrees to talk to me later tonight. 

I went home and slept until late at night. He finally calls me and informs that he had to put his dog down since he was suffering really bad. Then he follows up by saying he was unable to continue being my partner but could be my friend. He said that he was done being in a relationship where his partner dose trust him. I instantly start begging him not leave because I really love him. I tell him that I am sorry about all the things I said to him and would get therapy to control my impulsive behavior and lack of trust. I tried to change his mind for 2 hours and nothing. He ended up hanging up on me and I cried so much all night. After I collected myself, I wrote him and his family a long letter thanking them for their love and support. In his letter I explained that I would be willing to be friends but I would be hard at first. 

The week following this I shut down completely. Im at disbelief that this is actually happening. I refused to accept this so I started fighting for us. I wasn’t going to let this end our relationship since to me it seemed very minuscule. But after many days of trying to change his mind and prove my devotion and love, he ultimately made it clear that his choice was final. I was destroyed completely and in utter disbelief. That same week I found out that my father had passed away three months ago.  I was being hit so hard emotionally. I really considered ending my life because of this. I felt so hopeless and loss but ultimately I pushed through. 

The week after that he sent me all my belongings through the mail. I then ask him to come pick up his stuff after work which he did. When he came to pick up his stuff, he refused to go up to my room to sort through them. This made me furious but I brought him down all his stuff. At this point I hadn’t seen him in the weeks and I was angry he broken up with me because 1. I put up with so many of his mistakes and ultimately the distrust in our relationship was caused by his actions. 2. He broke up with me over the phone. We go to his car to talk and to make my final push for our relationship but failed . 

In the car I broke down begging him to reconsider his choice and to allow me to grow since I had given him the space to grow. After many constant back and forward he asked me to leave his car. I refused because I was hysterical. Then the name “Jimmy” pops up on his phone and I further start loosing it. I ask him who Jimmy is and he starts telling me it’s a friend from high school. My brain refused to accept that it was an old friend. In my gut I knew it wasn’t true but I just went along with it. Eventually he started telling me to just get out and I just continued to refuse. Eventually he threatened to call the police which to me was a huge betrayal. He knew since I’m undocumented and in legal proceedings, any Police contact jeopardize my future. He eventually agreed to talk outside the car which I stupidly agreed to. He got out and signaled me to come. I followed him and as soon as I got out he ran back to his car and drove away. 

I was left crying in the street. I had never felt so  disrespected and thrown out in my entire life. I was honestly at the point holding on by thread.  We don’t speak for three days and on the third day I finally agree to be friends with him and let this all go. It had made clear that we were no longe ever going to be together again and I should start moving on.  That day he had been weirdly ignoring me which was not like him but I thought since we just gotten into this big fight it was normal. 

I impulsively download the hook up app to see if C was on there which he wasn’t but then i had the Idea to try and log in using his email. He always used the same password for everything and I had because we would share streaming services. When I log onto the app, I see he had been texting N. N is my mentor for my legal fellowship. We work very close together and have to meet weekly. We also have a great friendship too.  I call C hysterically confront  him about it and i accuse him of sleeping with him which he instantly accepted responsibility. I was livid.  I get off the phone with C and call N and N confirms they had sex the same day. N told me that C had been texting him for a week and half trying to meet up. And finally today N agreed to meet up with him and had sex wit him not knowing who he was. Also on his hook up app I saw he had been texting the same doorman he heavily fantasize about. I was full with rage. 

N and I had been working together for couple months now and C knew exactly who he was. Although N didn’t fully know who C was. N just knew him as my boyfriend and nothing more. I was filled with rage. All love I still had for C left my body and was filled with hate and RAGE. I had never felt this betrayed in my life. So what do I do? I call him and start raging in him and confront him about the whole thing. I start calling his mom and brother to tell them about the horrible thing their son had just done to me. And like a dumbass, C tells them first before I do.

C finally calls me back and I tell him the most terrible things I’ve told anyone ever. He had confirmed everything I internally thought about him but refused to believe. C thought that he didn’t need to explain himself since he was no longer my partner. But he had shown me after that his true person. C doesn’t want to change and I don’t think he ever will because as soon as he got the chance he took it and fell back into the self destructive habits that hurt so many already. I ended up blocking him and emailing his parents and friends a long letter exposing him for all the shitty things he did to me in our relationship. The next day I found out my mentor had quit his job. 

Now, I’m left with rage and I want to get revenge but idk if it’s the right thing to do. So here I am asking what do I do? Am I responsible for the failure of this very important relationship? Am I valid or am I just being crazy? Please let me know your thoughts below."

I graduated in May of 2020 with a finance degree and have been working my first full time position at my current PE firm as a staff accountant for a little over the past year now. Overall, I find the work to be unrewarding and I don’t see a future at the company. I’ve looked internally for positions that are more geared towards finance, however, I believe I’ve come to the conclusion that maybe the private equity space is not something I’m interested in, if I’m not on a sought after deal team. Considering my resume, that does not seem plausible at this point unless I went for my MBA, and even then could be a stretch. My past internship experience was a controller at another large bank. I feel my resume looks pretty good on paper with some big company names supporting me.  My limited finance experience has been working as a controller for an internship, as well as the way a PE firm operates. And in accounting, I have a year’s worth of fund accounting experience.

What I’m unsure about is what type of role I should look into next. Recently I’ve started to become more and more interested in the technology space. I’m pretty technologically inclined and feel like I can learn the different technologies fairly fast. I see technology such as blockchain, AI, cloud computing, machine learning, etc. as the future of business as many of these items will be implemented into existing businesses in the future if they haven’t already. I don’t have any software engineer skills, however I’m confident in my ability to learn them would it be required for a role. Would anyone have any recommendations for potential lines of work or skills that I should look into?

Some potential roles that I’ve thought about from a finance/accounting perspective has been an investment analyst, commercial or corporate banking, consulting, or real estate. I also haven’t crossed out the potential for something a little more sales/relationship based, as I’m fairly comfortable talking to people and if anything would allow me to grow professionally even more. Is there a cross over that I’m unaware of that would combine my finance major, accounting experience and interest in technology?


TL;DR. I’m a recent graduate with a finance major, accounting work experience, and with an interest in technology. Are there any paths for which my experience and interests would align?"

qw711d,2,2021-11-17,Taxes on an Internship in the Netherlands,idLe95,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/qw711d/taxes_on_an_internship_in_the_netherlands/,"Hi!

I have a question regarding how the tax system in the Netherlands works. Suppose you are an EU citizen from outside the Netherlands, and suppose you have a 3-months internship in the Netherlands for an IT company. The gross monthly salary is 3k€. This would extrapolate to a 36k€ annual salary. Using [https://thetax.nl](https://thetax.nl) , i find that this would result in 2398€/mo net. However, in the UK for example, your taxes are calculated based on the salary you accumulate for the whole year, which would mean just 12k. This being such a small yearly salary, it means your taxes would be incredibly low.

I have read on [https://mffa.nl/en/temporary-work-netherlands/](https://mffa.nl/en/temporary-work-netherlands/) that it might be the same for the Netherlands. More specifically, it mentions the wage tax and how you may receive a refund for ""overpaid"" tax.

&gt;[The wage tax](https://mffa.nl/wage-tax-netherlands/?lang=en)  is an advance tax payment for the income tax in The Netherlands. In  this way, it is prevented that taxpayers have to pay a single large  payment for income tax and social security contributions once a year.  The employer withholds the wage tax at the time the employee receives  salary. Most times the collected wage tax is sufficient, however there  are situations that too much wage tax is withhold by the employer. For  example employees entering the Netherlands during the middle of the year  or those employees working on temporarily basis in the Netherlands (see  here why?). In order to reclaim back the overpaid tax, a personal  income tax return must be filed.

Using [https://thetax.nl](https://thetax.nl) again, for an annual salary of 12k€, it results in a net income of \~[11400](https://thetax.nl/?year=2021&amp;startFrom=Year&amp;salary=12000&amp;allowance=0&amp;socialSecurity=1&amp;retired=0&amp;ruling=0&amp;rulingChoice=normal)€. So about 600€ of tax paid across 3 months, 200€/mo. This would mean the net month income becomes 2800€. I realize this may not be the actual salary you would receive, and you would need to write some sort of form asking the state to refund the overpaid tax.

However, I do not have anyone to confirm whether this is indeed how it works. So, I am reaching out to reddit. Did I understand the situation correctly? What would the actual net salary be?"

qw81a0,20,2021-11-17,I recently was forced to quit my job…,cubismxdream,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/qw81a0/i_recently_was_forced_to_quit_my_job/,"I’m (f, 28) been lurking on this sub-Reddit for a while now, but this is the first time I’m sharing my own experience.

Last year, I was hired during the pandemic to work reception for a local “tech” company in my town. Without giving too much away, this company is primarily based in memberships and start-up culture. I will admit, this was a step towards my future career goals, as I usually worked in non-profits previously. The culture at first was described to me as a “small team doing big things”, so my naïve thoughts were excited to get more hands-on experience and even an opportunity to move up if I worked hard.

Within my first week the first red flag showed up. As I was giddily explaining my new role to my partner, they asked if I had leave and how that process works? I was puzzled as I hadn’t really questioned too much about the integrity of this company. I replied that my supervisor, who was in charge of  onboarding me, explained the company didn’t have any employee portal and any leave was just an honor based system. They told me that doesn’t seem right, but I reassured him that I already asked and no reliable answer from my supervisor was ever given. I desperately needed insurance and was excited about my first “salary” job that I decided to blow through these first misgivings.

Flash forward to 8 months later during the summer, things were going well in my role. I received many compliments from the members in my community, and took on a rebranding for a hosted event every week for our community. The community honestly needed a lot of work, as it used to be a typical “bros club” and many women, and other minority groups didn’t feel welcomed years ago. But before I was hired, our company laid off half the staff and never hired back those positions. So as summer membership increased 100% from when I was first hired on, out team was starting to feel the burden of being so short staffed, especially me.

I suddenly was the only one battling the front lines every day. I was responsible for answering every incoming call by myself. (we had over 200 member check-ins a day, and over 1000 active members at the time) We also provided mail services (illegally, as we did not have a written mail contract for members to sign or were they filling out the proper form needed individually from the USPS) that I did everyday for 1-2 hours. I managed the facilities and restocking of each kitchenette on each floor we owned, which is 4 floors all together. On top of all that, I was the only one who seemed to know how to work the printer and had any desire to learn how to fix it each time anything went amiss, which was all the time. We didn’t have a CRM so tours of our facilities were always a disaster and I was always expected to be at my desk for these constant tours, whether scheduled or not.

Our city at the time was doing great with vaccinated numbers, and as a result our company decided to open up our facilities for events to be booked. Which is another role many of my coworkers were pressuring me to take on, even though I had come to learn all my other coworkers were being paid more than half my wage. I’m not one to stray from hard work, but it didn’t feel possible to take on another role, on top of how demanding the reception role already was, and without any pay increase either. I tried to enforce my boundaries and explained the role I was hired for was my top priority and didn’t want to compromise my hard work for that role by taking on more than I can chew, but it ultimately felt that my supervisor didn’t appreciate these boundaries and that I was letting my team down because of it. I also at the time was starting to feel the burn out and requested time off. 

Unfortunately, after coming back from my time off I learned I was exposed to a break-through case of Delta-19. I was forced at that point to stay home for 2 weeks. It was during this time my job posted a Marketing role for hire. I understood that I was off during covid leave and couldn’t be informed about any work happenings, but it felt awful not knowing this position was opening up. My work place knew I was previously a marketing intern and had an interest in moving up in the company, so to not be considered for a future role after working so hard in the last year hurt. Especially when there was already precedence of my former coworkers starting in the role I was in and within a few months moved up to another role. So I didn’t understand what was wrong with me? I talked to my COO about it, and he said the person they had in that role before wasn’t meeting the standards and going forward didn’t want someone who was only a marketing intern, or had a little bit of an experience for this role. He said he wanted someone who could build the department from the ground up, which wasn’t detailed at all in the initial job description they posted online while I was out. Still, I took that answer and tried to be open about the fact that perhaps I just didn’t have the skill set required to do that role yet. But it was not long after my return from my covid leave, that my supervisor brought me in for a chat about not being able to give me anymore time off for the rest of the year and the vacation I had already requested later that month, will still be honored, but I could tell she regretted approving it months ago. Mind you, the upcoming vacation was only my 2 week of vacation time for the year, and had only been out previously for illnesses or bereavement for my grandmother, which I only used 4 days spread out when she initially passed and two days for the funeral, even though I desperately needed more time off to mourn. I didn’t want to let my team down as my role specifically needed someone there at all times M-F. She also stressed that if I did take any more time off or call in due to illnesses that I would be let go, it was implied my COO was the one to make that call and that my supervisor was simply the messenger.

The combination of burn out, being still sick with a lingering cough for two months after covid and the lack of any future opportunities available to me despite how hard I was working led me to my downfall. I prematurely one day admitted to my manager that I wasn’t happy in my role anymore, as she kept putting me in a corner asking if something was wrong as my enthusiasm around my staff seemed to falter. It was after that, the madness spiraled. I reassured her that I hadn’t applied anywhere yet, and that it was just how I felt. But before I knew it, she told our COO about it, despite saying she had my back. The COO devised a plan for me and convinced me 4 weeks of notice was better than 2 weeks and would give me more time to find another opportunity. They sent an email out for me to sign that agreed 4 weeks from now would be my last day and I will be paid until that point. I wanted some time to talk about what had happened to an outside work source, but when I came in the next day without signing the email right away, my COO called me into a meeting with my supervisor to ask what the hold up was and that I clearly don’t want to be here anymore. I honestly felt so angry this was happening before I had a job opportunity lined up. I knew I wouldn’t ever be happy at this place anymore, but I really needed a job to pay the bills. I felt I dug myself into the worst hole possible and that because I was so meek about it that It was only myself to blame for this odd predicament I was in. I eventually gave in to my COO and decided it was best for my overall health to just leave. I’ve had many great job interviews, but so far nothing has been offered. I was told by recruiters that it really just came down to job experience by a year, and that I was a great candidate. 

Overall, I can’t help but feel discouraged as my savings I’ve been living off are starting to dwindle. Despite how stressful this may be, I don’t regret leaving. My mental and physical health have improved immensely. I just hope I can find a place to work that cares about their employees mental and physical health and will pay them accordingly.

Also thank you for reading this, I apologize for the length. I tried my best to condense everything that has happened to the best of my abilities."

On the inside, Jeff’s backyard shed was not at all how it looked on the outside. Outside was a standard blue-painted wooden Gambrel-style storage, still soaked from the Tacoma rain that was pouring even now. We raced over behind Jeff as he led us over to the partially cracked open shed door. Along with me were our other friends Kelly, Amy, and Miles, the five of us running through the rain as we stepped into random puddles of water hidden beneath the grass, some splashing onto my foot through my sneakers and getting soaked into my socks. This had better be damned worth it, whatever Jeff dragged us over here for.

When we got in, however, my frustration soon transcended into wonder. Inside contained an elaborate setup of two large monitors and a colorfully-lit, full-glass PC tower atop a large table, a loveseat, beanbags, trashcan, and a random fire extinguisher, for whatever reason. As a bonus, the floor was also carpeted (maybe not the best idea now due to the rain plus combined with our muddy sneakers). We scruffed our dirty shoes onto the mat left at the front of the door when we got inside the shed.

“This is a nice setup, bro,” Miles commented.

“Yeah,” I agreed.

“It’s only temporary,” Jeff replied. “Not a good idea to keep computers in an enclosed shed for very long.”

“I was about to say,” Amy jumped in. “Doesn’t it get really hot in here? Or really cold in the winter?”

“Sometimes, but you know how Washington is.”

“Humid,” I said.

“Exactly,” Jeff replied. “Which is why my uncle wants this moved by the fall. The humidity’s not great for the PCs. Or the bipolar weather.”

“Every state swears their weather’s bipolar,” Kelly laughed. “Unless it’s dry ass Arizona or Alaska, you know what you’re getting each year.”

“True. I think it’ll be fine. I told him that. I asked if I could get a dehumidifier, but he doesn’t wanna risk it.” Risk what, I wondered? “But anywho, you simpletons ready to have your minds blown?”

The rest of us exchanged looks best described as an amalgam of suspicion and thoughts of ‘might as well’. We didn’t get soaked for nothing. Jeff plopped into the rolling chair in front of the desk, immediately grabbing the wireless mouse by the keyboard and began clicking on an icon on his desktop titled ‘Neptune’. The shape of the icon was a circular blue shape, which contrasted against the family photo of him and his uncle in the background.

It was only the two of them his whole life. I never pried too much into his personal life, but from the conversations we’d had, it was apparent that other immediate family members weren’t present in his life. Never any mention of a mother, father, siblings, nothing. Even after graduation, he stayed behind with his uncle, who was chairman of a rising technology company called Medium Tech. Their slogan, “*The future of entertainment*.” They specialized in developing services for various forms of media entertainment, including film, television, radio, music services, etc. That being said, I couldn’t tell you at all what it was they specifically made.

“This shit right here is gonna rock your world,” Jeff said ecstatically. He was even grinning.

“Look, if this is some Bitcoin or that cryptocurrency trading shit, I’m not interested,” Kelly remarked.

“I am,” Miles scoffed.

“Hmm?” Kelly looked at him.

“If it makes me rich, then yeah.”

“Oh, it’s not Bitcoin,” Jeff spoke. “Or anything like that. It’s, in my opinion, way cooler than all of those things combined.” I arched my brow, and the others gave similar looks of amusement. “Okay, maybe not better than being rich, but it’s pretty damn close, I’d say.”

“What did you just click on?” Amy asked.

“It’s called Neptune,” Jeff answered. “It’s the name of the software the company my uncle works for is developing. It’s still only a prototype, but it’s a damn good one.”

“What is it?” I asked.

“Oh, you’ll see,” he teased. “I mean, really, it’s better for you to see for yourself because words just aren’t enough.”

A loading screen drew over the monitor soon after as the software began to boot itself up. Once it finished, a cute little two-note jingle chimed, and we were brought to a screen with two box-shaped icons and a circular icon alongside them, containing a plus sign in the center of the circle. The text underneath the boxes read ‘Jeff’ in one and ‘Christopher’ (Jeff’s uncle) in the other. Underneath the circular one read ‘Add new profile’.

“They’re making their own Netflix?” Kelly guessed. “Or Hulu, or something?”

Jeff chuckled. “Even better. Better than all of those streaming services combined.”

Kelly raised her eyebrows. “Okay,” she muttered under her breath.

Jeff clicked on his user profile, and hilariously, we were met with what seemed to indeed be a streaming service catalog. It appeared so, anyway. I don’t see how it wasn’t. Selections of movies and TV shows we all knew, and then some I’d only heard of or didn’t know at all. They were each lined up in columns where you had to scroll through the lists to take a look. On the side of them were texts indicating what I assumed were categories.

Action/Adventure, Comedy, Drama, Superheroes, Book Adaptations.

Those were just the few that we saw. I could tell that there was more off to the side.

“You sure your uncle and his company didn’t just ripoff Netflix?” Miles said.

Jeff shook his head, laughing again. “My uncle doesn’t develop the actual software, he’s just chairman of the board. The software engineers take care of the fun stuff.”

“And you?”

“Well, interning is… well, *interning*. You gotta start somewhere. Wish I started earlier when I was in high school, but what can you do? Still learn a whole lot, and it’s a paid internship, so I can’t complain.”

Miles nodded. “No you can’t,” he smiled.

“Seriously, though, what is it?” Amy questioned. “You said we’ll see when we see it but I still don’t know what we’re looking at.”

“It’s a jailbroken Netflix,” Miles kept joking.

“Ha-ha.”

“That sounds kinda dope, actually,” Kelly chimed in.

“Okay, Jeff,” I cut in to quiet everyone, “Show us what it is - or explain, at least.”

“Why thank you, Anthony,” Jeff responded with that same grin. He spun his chair to where he was now facing everyone.

“Folks, what do you notice about all of these movies and TV shows?” he said as he motioned his hand towards the screen behind him.

No one said anything and we simply stood there and shrugged.

“They’re discontinued, right?” Jeff answered for them. “They’ve all ended, there’s no more to the story, yeah? No more sequels, no more new episodes, none of that. Finale, and that’s it. But not anymore…”

Those same curious yet doubtful gazes returned on each one of our faces yet again by Jeff’s eccentric behavior.

“With Neptune, you can make more,” he continued. “More episodes, more seasons, more movies in a series. Hell, wanna make a prequel of your favorite movie just ‘cause? Have at it; you can do that, too. Ever fall in love with a song from your favorite singer or rapper that, for whatever reason, didn’t get a music video? Well, now you can make one. A video game you wanna see turned into a movie? Done. Everything you can imagine, just picture in your head, can all be made possible with only a few - or, I should say, several inputs of information.”

No one said a word still, utterly baffled at what the hell he was speaking to us. It took Kelly’s outburst of laughter to break the silence.

“That was, uh… pretty good,” said Kelly. “It was a great pitch, really.”

“Jeff, c’mon, if you just wanted to invite us over to watch something, just say that,” Amy said.

“Oh sure, take a pick,” Jeff offered. “Wanna watch season 8 of *Breaking Bad*? Season 7 of *The Fresh Prince*?”

Miles chimed in. “I’m pretty sure both of those shows ended well before they reached that number of seasons,” he stated. “*Breaking Bad* only ran for five seasons. I don’t know about *The Fresh Prince*.”

“Not in Neptune they didn’t,” Jeff proclaimed. “I made more episodes.”

Miles scoffed, not believing a single word out of Jeff’s mouth. To him, and really, to most of us, he sounded out of his mind.

“Wanna see the new *Diesel*?” Jeff continued. “*Diesel 5*?”

*Diesel* (not to be confused with the actor Vin Diesel) was an action film series that ran on for far too damn long. It involved the main action star, Ben Tank (yes, that was his name), who drove in his diesel Ford pickup along the southwestern interstate. He ends up having to protect this pretty young woman’s life from her captors, and so throughout the whole movie, it’s just him and this girl racing down the highway and playing a cat &amp; mouse game of other big trucks chasing them and trying to take out ole badass Ben. The first movie wasn’t terrible, to be honest. Then, as many series do once they start gaining more profit and reputation, the *Diesel* franchise jumped the shark and started going way overboard and ridiculous. I don’t know how the writers managed to keep coming up with more ideas and ways to have Ben Tank get caught up on the road in the same situations again and again. Just let it die already.

“There’s a *Diesel 5*?” I said.

“Not officially,” Jeff smiled. “Not anywhere else on anyone’s drive or stowed away in some big studio - at least, I don’t know if they do or at least are working on one. But they don’t have this one”

“They’re definitely working on one,” Miles rolled his eyes. “You know they are.” He, too, was over the drawn-out series.

“Sure, I’ll watch your bootleg, fan-made, B-rated *Diesel* ripoff,” Kelly snarkily agreed. “From whomever you got this. It might be so bad it’s good.”

Jeff just laughed again then exchanged looks of approval to the rest of us.

“It’s up to you guys,” he offered. “I got beers, drinks, popcorn, whatever you want to get comfortable.”

The rest of us then looked at each other.

“What do you guys think?” Kelly asked.

“I mean, you invited us over to hang out anyways, I figured,” Miles said to Jeff. “If we wanna do a movie marathon, then that’s all right with me.”

“Yeah, why not?” Amy agreed.

They then looked at me, the last one standing. Deep down, I really didn’t feel like watching it now. At least, not *Diesel*, in particular, and especially not whatever low-budget ripoff we were about to see. Anything else would’ve been fine.

“Sure,” I shrugged, sounding as neutral as I possibly could.

“All right, all right,” Jeff said in his best Matthew McConaughey impression. “Let’s do this.”

He then spun his chair back to the computer screen, where Jeff then scrolled a bit further down the list until he found it. The thumbnail was there. *Diesel: Overdrive* was the title displayed in a sleek, steel, slanted lettering like many other action movies I’d seen over the years. The poster had Ben Tank sitting in the driver’s seat of his pickup, tightly gripping the wheel with a sturdy mean face. It looked almost like one of the movie posters for *Drive*, the one with Ryan Gosling, except more intense. Bet it was photoshopped to look legit.

Jeff clicked on the thumbnail, followed by the list of brief movie details and plot breakdown, same as with any streaming service. Same actor, Timothy Johnson, as the star, except the director was different - bizarrely different. The same director had done all the previous films in the series, but oddly, this time it was someone else entirely. Someone so famous and in a league of his own that it was stupefying.

“Griffin Daniels did this one?” I skeptically asked.

“In my version, he did,” Jeff replied. “Remember, you can choose whatever director’s style of filmmaking you want. I figured why not choose the best and turn a cheesy blockbuster into a work of art?”

Miles shook his head, laughing. Griffin Daniels was one of the more prominent film directors out there, with his movies grossing more than a billion combined. He was up there with Spielberg, Nolan, Lucas, Cameron, and many of the other industry giants. That’s why seeing his name tied to a project of a lesser caliber to his standards was pretty hilarious. Now we knew it had to be a joke. It’s like if Martin Scorsese directed *The Room*. I’d actually pay to see that, now that I think about it. Probably be much better.

Jeff moused over the thumbnail and clicked ‘play.’ A black screen followed, and in the center of the screen appeared a blue loading icon, sort of like the swirling red circle on Netflix.

We watched as the opening logos commenced, accompanied by a mysterious yet exciting cinematic score in the background. On the bottom right-hand corner, a watermark of Neptune’s name and logo remained on-screen the entire time. The movie hadn’t even started yet, but I could already sense that this film was far different from the others in the series - if it were even real, that is.

“Zach Henderson did the soundtrack, too,” Jeff added. He was another major motion picture composer and producer.

“Okay,” Miles dismissively replied.

The rest of us pretty much held onto the same skepticism and doubt as we did from Jeff’s first attempt at selling us on the whole concept. But after seeing the opening sequence, and then several more scenes had passed, before we knew it, we each had our eyes glued and huddled around the limited space we had around the bright computer screen long enough to make it past the halfway mark. So much time went by, and I'd been so invested in the movie, I’d forgotten about questioning the absurdity of it all. I couldn’t believe it. Jeff didn’t lie. He couldn’t have. This was real. The actors, the scenes, soundtrack, editing. The way Timothy Johnson’s facial movements, voice, expressions, and the way his stunts were executed felt genuine, as though he himself signed and agreed to this. No, it wasn’t really him, as Jeff claims. But how was it not? It was a legit film - an actual worthy addition to the worn out *Diesel* franchise. I’ll be goddamned, but Jeff stayed true to his word, it was a solid work of art! It was nothing like any of the others before it. Surprisingly, it had depth to it, substance, a good plotline with stakes at hand, a good villain, character development - everything you’d want in *any* film regardless of its genre and general audience. It’s like whoever made this (or *whatever* made this) truly cared and put their heart into it.

“This is crazy,” I muttered out of nowhere, as everyone else was still lost in the story.

Amy then let out a delighted guffaw. “Honestly, though,” she agreed. “Jeff, seriously, how did you get this? And why is it so good? Like, who made this?”

“I told you,” Jeff shrugged. “Griffin Daniels.”

Amy smacked her mouth. “Seriously, c’mon. You can’t hold out on us like that.”

Jeff turned to face her. “Thank my uncle. And whoever coded the Neptune program.”

“You’re serious?” Amy exclaimed, now more enthralled. “This is really just all AI-generated?”

“Yep.”

“Like a CPU or something?” Miles asked.

“Well, the CPU is just the processor,” Jeff said. “It controls a *lot* of things like hardware in the computer and the execution of each individual-”

“In English, Jeff.”

“Basically, it’s the type of AI that’s based on limited memory and self-awareness, on top of reinforced learning.”

“That was… broken English, but I think I get it.”

“He basically means that it learns and makes better future decisions based on what it’s given, right?” I elaborated and asked for confirmation.

“You got it,” Jeff confirmed.

“‘Self-aware’?” Kelly said. “What do you mean by that? Like the Terminator or Ultron?”

“No, no, that’s an over-exaggerated Hollywood trope. The self-awareness of the Neptune software is only limited to what it’s programmed to do: make different types of mediums. It can’t go beyond that. The self-awareness component only adds to the authenticity of the movies or TV shows it creates. You ever try those AI-generated story creators? Ones where you put in a sample of text from either a book or whatever, and then the algorithm takes that and continues to make it up for you?”

“I’ve seen those before,” I commented. “Tried it for fun, too.”

“So you know how flawed it is? Adding random words that don’t fit the context at all?”

“Yeah…”

“Well, Neptune, as you can see, feels like a real person directed the project and put their heart and soul into it. Everything’s been properly edited and thoroughly reviewed before final cut.”

“But this is all still just AI?” Amy spoke. “A constantly-learning AI?”

“Exactly,” Jeff answered.

We were speechless and dumbfounded. Amy, like the rest of us, had to take a second to really register it all before asking the next big, exciting question that we were all thinking.

“Do you have more?” she asked with suspense.

Jeff, eyes glued onto the film, held that same ecstatic grin.

“My dear,” he said, “You can have your own profile and library of personal mediums tailored to your liking if you want. All of you.”

And now, a small grin of my own was starting to form over my face.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

After taking a couple of days of having Jeff help install the Neptune software onto each of our hard drives, including helping some of us build and setup our own PC towers along with GPUs (it takes a lot of processing power, as I’d imagine) I was overjoyed to begin creating my profile. The steps were pretty straightforward and simple enough. During the initial setup, I was given the option of two different user experiences: Confined Reality (CR) mode or Chaos mode.

CR mode sounded extremely complicated the first time Jeff explained it to us, and it took me a couple of times hearing it again before it clicked. Essentially, whatever medium (movie, TV show, music video, commercial, etc.) I choose to have Neptune generate for me will always be taken into consideration and used as a ‘learned memory’ for the AI. An example would be if I made a series of my own or sequel to a pre-existing movie, and the AI generates a script that calls for a major character death. Obviously, depending on the rules and elements of the story, of course, that character can’t then show up in the next film of that series. That would be a continuity error. In layman’s terms, if I decide to generate my own new episodes of *The Walking Dead*, for instance, instead of waiting for the new season, I can’t simply bring back characters who’ve already died earlier in the show. That would be breaking the rules of the confined reality established in the storyworld. Now, if I was creating a more fantasy-based story in a Marvel or some other franchise film, there’s more than enough ways to pull that off in that particular universe (they do it all the time, in fact).

But what if I wanted to say screw it and just have Neptune do whatever I tell it, without considering the principles of realistic possibilities and let loose? Well, that’s where Chaos mode comes into play. In Chaos mode, it doesn’t matter who died before or how the story has progressed thus far. Neptune makes it work. Now, that’s not to say that that decision doesn’t come with its own consequences; there’s still no guarantee that whatever it comes up with won’t make any sense at all or could’ve been better executed with previously taught knowledge taken into account. But, as we all observed with *Diesel: Overdrive*, the program gives its 100-percent into making the best possible medium it can. There’s no half-assing anything. If I want a Quentin Tarantino-style film to be generated based on whatever story I want, it’s not going to merely ‘imitate’ his artistic style. It’s going to make sure it creates the most authentic production with so much passion and heart that you’d believe Tarantino did it himself.

As downright phenomenal and exciting as this technology was, I, like the rest of us, also knew how creepy it sounded. The way it could easily replicate any single person’s style, based on the few or many loaded reels of information it’s given. That was the real doozy of it all. How easy it was. It was like sorcery. And the way it could simulate and create cinematic shots, locations, set designs, lighting, color grading, sound mixing - shit, even a whole damn soundtrack! It could do all of those things in a relatively short amount of time. Generating a standard 90-minute film takes only 30 minutes, even 45 at the most, depending on the budget and style of the production. Anything much longer like two-and-a-half hours takes about an hour at a time, sometimes a little longer. TV shows typically always take much longer to generate per season, especially hour-long episode formats.  But it’s crazy that I can take a year’s worth - or sometimes more than that - of man-hours that it takes to make a film and have it all put together and condensed onto the Neptune program for me to watch in the comfort of my room in a short amount of time.

I felt like a kid on Christmas morning. I was shaking from uncontrollable excitement. I didn’t even know where to start. All of the shows that I wish didn’t get canceled or movies I wish weren’t stuck in development hell… there were just so many. I could make more seasons of *Parks &amp; Recreation, A Different World, Spectacular Spider-Man, Firefly, Black Mirror, Mad Men*. I was listing things off in my mind in no particular order. For now, I took those specific examples and loaded them into the Cloud. The Cloud was where the user stores various mediums into Neptune, that way the program can start learning and taking from those exact styles for when I want to have more mediums generated from them.

That was one of the biggest downsides to it all. Waiting. The initiation process was the most time-consuming because the software still needed to learn. I couldn’t just tell it to replace all the prior James Bond films with only Daniel Craig as the lead character because, well, ‘technically’, it doesn’t know who James Bond even is yet, or Daniel Craig for that matter. That information has to be uploaded into the Cloud first by inputting the film’s ISAN number. In essence, it’s like a unique identifier for movies and similar forms of audiovisual media, like an ISBN for books. IMDB numbers worked as well and were much easier to find. I’d have my list of compiled mediums stored in the Cloud database where the AI uses them to learn and adapt and considers using them in reference to making future creations. So if I uploaded all of the James Bond films, or even just half of them, that’s more than enough for Neptune to go off of and create an authentic 007 storyline. Or, if I don’t want to change anything in the story, and only have Daniel Craig replace whichever actor is portraying Bond in a particular film, it can do that as well. It’s essentially a more advanced version of deepfake technology, which is no less uncanny, but mesmerizing nevertheless.

Other things that could be uploaded into the Cloud for AI-learning were pictures, video clips, GIFs, audio samples such as voice clips or readings, personally-made scripts or bodies of texts, and many more. However, with all of these things being readily available, the utmost important rule that Jeff even stressed to me was to not, by any means, upload personal information. That includes real people I knew in my everyday life that weren’t professional actors in the industry. In other words, I couldn’t have myself star in a medium or have my friends or family as an ensemble cast. That was the other big setback to the program. I thought it was pretty dumb, as a matter of fact.

There was a prompt that asked me which setting I wanted to choose before continuing. CR or Chaos. It was pre-selected for CR mode, which was the recommended setting. There was additional text that rambled on and on about something else I didn’t much care to read right now. I just wanted to jump in and get started. CR was fine with me for now.

I was patient, however. I let the program take its time to learn whatever I gave it. I listed off literally hundreds of mediums to store in the Cloud. Overall, this took just about the rest of the day to process. By the next day, it was good to use. Now the real fun could begin.

Over the next several days, I didn’t leave my apartment and hardly left my room, and if I did it was only to use the bathroom or to go eat something. I watched everything I could come up with. Marlon Brando as Rocky Balboa, Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson as *The Terminator*, simulated new episodes of *Spongebob Squarepants* in its old-fashioned season one artistic format, a movie adaptation of Stephen King’s *The Dark Tower* series (done right this time, might I add), *Jurassic Park 3* directed by Steven Spielberg and produced by Kathleen Kennedy again, the Star Wars prequels redone in the quality of the original trilogy, Nicholas Cage as *Mrs. Doubtfire*, Wesley Snipes as Black Panther, Emily Blunt if she originally got the role as Black Widow, Will Smith if he originally got the role of Neo in *The Matrix*, the film adaptation of *Harry Potter and the Cursed Child* directed by Chris Columbus.

Mixing up different combinations of genres and mediums, and pairing certain actors and celebs with one another to see how much chemistry they had and playing with the character dynamics was far better than any RPG or sandbox game I’d ever played. It was comparable to being like God himself. I didn’t even notice the watermark after a while and got used to it being there as a permanent stamp on the screen. Everything generated from Neptune’s software is already pre-coded to contain the watermark in the bottom right, which is basically to protect from copyright strikes and prevents from the reselling or distribution of Neptune-produced mediums. Neptune is only for personal use, and anything beyond that could result in legal consequences from major studio executives and estates.

Though, like with any new and entertaining piece of technology someone uses from the time they first use it, it’s bound to get old after a while unless additional content or features gets added to it. Of course, I still had hundreds upon thousands of possibilities to create, and I hadn’t even used a fraction of my profile’s allowable memory (things had to either be moved or deleted to save up space). But using the same actors and forms of media that were already made was starting to get slightly dull. Not exactly boring, just repetitive as a process. I wanted something more.

I remembered what Jeff said and the prompt text that popped up when I was creating my profile. Do not upload personal information by any means.

But why? What difference did it make? All of those people were real, the actors, directors, writers, producers, film crew; they were all real people, too, albeit more famous and richer than I could ever hope to be.

So I decided to say screw it and create my own sitcom, sort of like *Friends* and *iCarly*, starring me as the main character, of course, and the rest of the gang. I came up with potential titles, such as ‘The Anthony Show’, ‘Everybody Loves Anthony’, ‘I Love Anthony’, and many other cheap knockoff titles. But eventually, this one title stood out to me, as ridiculous as it sounded, and I eventually settled upon *Chaos TV!* Jeff, Miles, Amy, Kelly, and I would all be playing ourselves in various episodes of different sorts of misadventures and hilarious situations like any other American sitcom. The show even had its own opening and catchy theme song. The format was multicam and with the style of being shot in front of a live audience. And my God, the jokes were funny as hell. If this were anyone else’s show, I’d pay to see this. Which is funny, because it was just ourselves, except we had lines and an exact storyline to follow. My parents even guest-starred a couple of times, and Kelly smacking Miles in the back of the head at least once per episode became a running gag. It was quality television.

There was just one weird thing that didn’t exactly take away from the show, but was clearly the elephant in the room. It wasn’t just the five of us as the leading cast - me, Miles, Jeff, Kelly, and Amy - but a sixth person as well. Frank. That was his name. Residing in a comfy Seattle condo, six friends, Anthony, Jeff, Miles, Kelly, Amy, and Frank, get themselves into all sorts of trouble and wacky adventures while dealing with their own personal struggles of young adulthood and chasing their dreams. That was synopsis in a nutshell. But who the hell was Frank? I didn’t know a Frank...

Of course, Neptune could still make up and cast whatever it wanted to make for good storytelling, and I certainly trusted its process. However, I just found it unusual that given its premise, it would add a sixth person to our close friend group. It felt so out of place. I wanted to ask around and see if anyone knew who Frank was or if it was a mutual friend of ours, but then I’d be admitting to breaking the rule of using our real selves to be cast for my own entertainment. Jeff wouldn’t be too happy about that.

I opened my search engine in another tab and tried searching ‘chaos tv’ and ‘frank’ as the main keywords, but then stopped myself. I was an idiot. The show’s not real, I was reminded. *Chaos TV!* only existed because of Neptune.

I decided to continue watching, as Neptune already had five seasons of *Chaos TV!* lined up. Frank’s character stood out like a sore thumb, and that was not to say he was the true star of the show. On the contrary, he felt distant from the rest of us and didn’t have much charisma or chemistry to the rest of the cast. Sometimes his line delivery felt awkward or slightly uncomfortable. For example, if he were to be exchanging dialogue with one of us, especially Amy or Kelly, his words just sounded off, almost creepy, I dare say. I would also notice that at times when he wasn’t speaking a line, he would either heavily stare at the person currently speaking or simply stare off into space. Everyone else would at least be somewhat engaging with the other person or doing something to still feel like part of the scene… but not Frank. The infliction of his tone on certain lines didn’t land right all the time and made him seem a bit socially awkward. Even the side stories that involved him fell flat. I didn’t get his deal. What purpose did he serve? The subplots involving him weren’t even about *him*, really. He was always a supporting character to someone else’s predicament in a given episode, so I still didn’t know who he was even on-screen. Yet, he went everywhere we did in the show. I guess not every ensemble cast carries their own weight in a series. There’s always that one. There are some exceptions, yes, but it’s not unusual for it to happen.

Fortunately, after season one, Frank left the show, and it was just us five, as it should’ve been from the start. Thank goodness. Every other episode in the show after that started to feel much more relaxed and vibrant. Not that it wasn’t before, but Frank’s presence in the earlier episodes could really be distracting at times. Now the show was really starting to find its footing and it became even more hilarious. I’d give it a hundred Emmys if I could. Not to myself, though. Turns out I was a terrible actor. At least, I thought so. Though I was the lead, I certainly didn’t steal the show. That went to Kelly and Miles, and even Jeff and Amy had their moments where they held all the attention. I was just sort of there. Maybe it was awkward for me to watch and hearself myself on camera. But I quickly got over it and continued to enjoy watching everyone else carry out their roles throughout the show.

Then something else strange changed after season three. With no warning at all, Amy and Kelly were cut from the show, and were replaced with three other actresses, one of which looked familiar to me. They were different characters entirely named Jenna and Beatrice. Jeff, Miles, and I remained on the show, and again, it was just the five of us.

That was strange, I thought. What the hell happened to Amy and Kelly? I went ahead and tried seeing if I could re-generate the current episodes after season three to try adding them back to the show as permanent leads. When I prompted Neptune to start generating, however, an error occurred with the text prompt reading, “*Continuity Error. Please try generating another medium*.”

What the hell did that even mean? At no point in the show did Amy or Kelly’s characters need to get written off nor was it ever implied that they wouldn’t return. I skimmed through the rest of season four, not watching every episode in its entirety. I wanted to see if at any point they would show up again, whether they made a guest star appearance or something.

But there was nothing. Season four was over and when I moved on to season five and searched through all of its 22 episodes, I was met with the same outcome. Kelly and Amy were no longer in the show. In fact, there was never any other mention of them again. The way Jenna and Beatrice were introduced in season four was due to us three guys needing two extra roommates, essentially to replace the previous two girls. Oddly, when I went to rewatch the season four premiere episode, their names were still never mentioned. It was only implied that we had two roommates originally, but never their names or that we were all good friends. That was so strange. So strange, in fact, the show drastically declined in quality for me. None of it made sense at all. Why would the script severely change like that?

Then, as I skimmed over the timeline with my mouse, able to preview the scene and exact shot before jumping to it, I noticed at the very end of the episode, unlike the rest, after the credits was a line of text, perhaps a message, accompanied with what I could make out as two pictures of what I assumed were young women. I wasn’t sure if I was crazy or not, but it looked like Amy and Kelly.

I went ahead and clicked over to the closing credits, just as they were about to finish. I knew what would follow next was the very last message. Once the credits were done rolling, the screen went to black. I curiously waited to see what would show next, and I really wish I didn’t.

“Oh my God,” I muttered under my breath.

Across the screen were the words, “*In loving memory of Amy Nguyen and Kelly Watkins*,” with their pictures displayed underneath. The same pictures I uploaded of them when sending everyone’s personal information through the Cloud.

“Oh my God,” I repeated.

Panicked, I immediately called Amy first, then I’d call Kelly as well. Amy’s phone rang for much longer than I’d hoped, and I grew more and more anxious.

“Hello?” her voice finally answered from the other line.

I was so thrown off, though, relieved, I almost forgot to say anything. “Amy?” I said.

“Yeah, Anthony?”

“... Sorry, I must’ve butt-dialed you,” I improvised.

“Oh. No worries… you good?”

I was about to tell her, but then quickly hung up instead. I didn’t have to make that as awkward as I did, but I had to check on Kelly next. Her phone rang for far too long as well, except this time no one answered. Now I was very worried.

I called Miles, to which he shortly picked up the phone after only a couple of rings.

“Yes, Anthony?” Kelly answered on the other end, to my surprise.

I stammered, confused as hell. “Kelly?” I responded. “Uh…”

“Miles had to do ‘number two’, as disgusting as that sounds.”

“... Why are you with-”

“Did you need something?” she quickly cut me off.

I hesitated for a moment. “Never mind,” I said, then hung up the phone.

As weirded out as I was by what just happened, as I’m sure Amy and Kelly were nonetheless, I was at least glad they were both fine. But then I kept looking at the still image of them on the screen, their faces underneath those haunting words.

“*In loving memory…*”

The show may not have been real, but still… what could’ve prompted it to even say that? For my entertainment? What kind of sick form of entertainment was that? I didn’t ask for this. I would *never*. But now I knew that the only way I could even hope to maybe get to the bottom of this thing was to tell someone - that ‘someone’ being Jeff. He would know the answers, or at least enough to try troubleshooting the issue or come up with an explanation. Then he’d know I broke the rules. Shit. What else was I gonna do?

I could keep watching, I thought. It’d be sick, though. That’s what I felt. It would feel wrong to keep watching, even after the fact. Maybe if I kept telling myself that it wasn’t real, maybe that would take me out of it. At the very least, I could keep the show running in the background with me periodically checking here and there to see what else changed.

I ran the program to generate two more seasons. Season six took about three hours to generate. Once it was ready by the evening, I sat down and watched. The season premiere had barely begun, but I already watched in utter shock and terror at what I was now present on the screen. Jeff and Miles were now cut from the show, and I was the only remaining lead from the original cast. I couldn’t be sure, but considering the events that followed with Amy and Kelly’s departure from the show, whatever that cause might’ve been, I inevitably, instinctually knew Jeff and Miles followed the same fate as their co-stars…

My God, what the fuck was happening? Why was it doing this? Why was it making these bold decisions? I didn’t even watch all of the episodes, but just from skimming through the first few, Jeff and Miles didn’t return not once. Though it wasn’t real, I was truly starting to get scared now. My friends, my *actual* friends in the Neptune medium were dying off and I didn’t understand why.

When I tried to skip ahead to season seven, something went wrong. I got that same damn error as before. ‘*Continuity error*.’ How was that even possible? I didn’t change anything else that the AI didn’t already do itself. It didn’t let me make any more seasons past season six. I couldn’t believe it…

I couldn’t make more episodes of my own series - my own goddamn show - due to two simple words.

*Continuity error*.

I had to tell Jeff..."

I was never given any employee accounts/ids (I just borrowed the laptop/account of some previous employee), so I won't show up in any of their systems as previously employed there.
* For all of my work references, I put the number of the HR departments rather than people I knew.
* I did my freshman year of college at a different university than the one I graduated from. To save space on my resume, I put only put my alma mater. On the background check, I included both colleges.

Will any of these raise flags?"

Nearing the end of my first semester in CS and I am really enjoying it, it’s obviously more difficult and time consuming compared to business but I could not be more happy with my decision. 

I really just want some advice on what I should be doing in my free time to get ready for internships/Jobs as I plan on graduating spring of 2023. My programming skills are amateur at best and I want to be able to stand out more. 

Some questions I also have:

1. Is it worth it for me to go to job fairs with basically no experience other than school? 

2. How much experience is optimal to be able to get a job/internship after graduating? I would like to get an internship the summer after I graduate.

3. Is it bad that I feel as if I am horribly behind and “dumber” than my classmates? I know I basically just started my path and CS is not an easy major, I just feel like I’m out of my league sometime

4. How difficult is it to really find a job/internship? This community is frightening me with the horror stories on how hard it is to find work after graduation. I would hate to go through school and not being able to get a job. 

Thank you in advance for the help. Just a very scared student trying to figure out is new path and any advice/expertise would be a god send."

At the beginning, I started this degree because I always liked the idea of developing, knowing how every app, game, software and even websites works behind the scenes. Since then, I came to realize that there are more career paths than just developing. Acquaintances told me about cyber security/malware analysis/penetration testing and for a while now I really think that I might like it even more than strictly developing.

My question is - as a SE student, what steps I can do in order to find an internship in this area on my 2nd/3rd year? First of all, what are the roles I could do as a student/bachelor, and then how can I achieve that? What languages should I learn, what courses to take, etc.

Every bit of information will be so helpful, thank you guys!

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: an acquaintance of mine works at an international cyber company and he told me that SE students/bachelors can get into malware analyzing/malware reverse engineering, what do you think?"

Hey guys and gals.

I am a third year university student studying CS and I am in the process of searching for internships.

I have received am offer from a startup recently valued at the billion mark as a DevOps intern. I have also received an offer from Amazon as a Cloud Support Associate which I heard is basically customer service.

Would it be easier to become a DevOps engineer after working at Amazon at a smaller company?

Or am I better off working as a DevOps engineer at at startup and working my way up to bigger companies?

What are the pros and cons?

Thank you so much for your help! It's making me really anxious"

 not trying to jerk myself off, just trying to paint a picture of where I'm at. I've got a good grasp of c, c++, Java, and a bit of dart and I'm currently working on flutter. I know about data structures, can implement sorting algorithms. I'm good on the Linux commandline and now that I have a vm I'm learning a bit about cloud computing. My next project is to build an app where I can send files to my server.

I've got a few things on my GitHub but nothing that really says I know what's up. I've never contributed to anything either. My resume is basically non-existent which makes it hard to stand out looking for internships.

What should I do? How do I build up a solid resume?"

I'm a senior CS Major at a mid-tier state school in the US.  Since I started here I've made ok grades, haven't joined any CS related clubs, I haven't ever worked on personal projects outside of class time, and I've never done an internship.  

And last week I got a job offer from a well-paying international software engineering company.  

I feel like by reading through some of the posts here its easy to get imposter syndrome and start thinking that every other CS major is way more qualified, more dedicated to programming, and way more intelligent than you are.  I definitely felt that while I've followed this sub since I started as a CS major 4 years ago.  This simply is not true.  There are tons of us that do what we need to do to learn CS skills and nothing extra, and still turn out fine.  

So, go to that football game, stay out too late with friends, participate in student activities, and join clubs that aren't CS related.  As in everything, moderation is key, and a good balance of career related interests and other interests is important.  Just don't beat yourself up for taking a minute to forget about programming and enjoy other stuff.  You aren't crippling your future career, you're becoming an interesting person that has a wide array of interests.  It turns out employers like people like that."

I have no experience at all except some knowledge learned in college. Unfortunately i didn't intern anywhere or get myself familiar with the industry while in school. I graduated about 6 years ago with a Bachelors in IT and I have a MBA. 

From reading all the post, it sounds like securing an admin, analysts, or Infosec spot is as hard as a pilot spot in my industry. 

Obviously, an entry level job would be the only option. My knowledge in programming, networks, database etc. is very little, since I haven't practiced this stuff in a long time. Considering this.. would taking CompTia certs be a good start and also getting back into programming languages.

Any recommendations?

I know i would be taking a huge pay cut, but I'm ok with that. I would like a career that has a better work-life balance."
qwe895,0,2021-11-17,Junior Transitioning From Midwest To Bay Area Tech?,justanotherCSdude,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qwe895/junior_transitioning_from_midwest_to_bay_area_tech/,"So quick background: I grew up in Northern California and graduated with a B.S. in CS from a small state school in mid 2020 with an internship at a start up and a research project with a big lab under by belt. I was doing work for my family's company up until May of this year when I (foolishly) took an underpaid developer position in the suburban Midwest and have been wanting to claw my eyes out ever since... The company is reputable in the area and the work environment is nice but I find my self doing very little coding and the pay and location are driving me nuts.  


I want to move to the urban Bay Area as a developer. Badly. I'm just wondering what the best way to make that transition would be? Since I know everyone will say this: **yes, I have been applying to jobs out there.** The point of this question is trying to know what the best strategy for someone with my level of experience and situation is. Would it be worth quitting this job to go back to working with family again so I can be closer to the Bay? The down side would be I wouldn't be getting paid as much (since family) and the company is even more no-named and a lot smaller than this one, but I can live with my folks and I would be doing more relevant work since I'd actually be coding frequently again. I'm looking to be completely out of here within the next year as a time window.  


Thank you!"

Anxiety and depression are hitting all time highs. Have an exam coming up and I feel like I know nothing despite studying all week/weekend for it. I just feel like I'm in pure hell and am wasting my college experience, aka ""the best 4 years of your life"" lol. School makes me dread each day and hate my life more and more.

qwg4qg,3,2021-11-17,22M. Working 90+ hours a week but finding no job satisfaction. Wanting to leave after 10 days.,Background_Cherry152,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/qwg4qg/22m_working_90_hours_a_week_but_finding_no_job/,"I'm (22M) a lawyer in India. Prior to joining this workplace I was doing an unpaid internship for a year with a famous lawyer in the industry. I had crazy work hours, often ~12 hours a day (+2 hours of commute in total). But I was really happy working those hours because the learning was tremendous, my opinions mattered, and most importantly I wasn't disrespected ever. 

While I was working there I applied to law firms because my seniors at my previous work place told me it is very important to have good firm experience to learn organizational and client management skills. I got an interview at my current work place which went super well, there wasn't a single thing I couldn't answer. My job offer was rolled out within ~12 hours. I'm being paid half of what the industry leaders pay, which is understandable because this is a Tier 2/Tier 3 firm. I am very fortunate to have gotten a job, as currently in my country, jobs especially for lawyers are incredibly rare. A good portion of my batch mates are unemployed. 

It's been 10 days since I've started here. But the work load and speed at which work is to be churned out is incredibly taxing and it is making me mentally and physically ill. The earliest I've slept this week is 3AM and have proceeded to get up at 7AM. Even Saturday's and Sunday's are the same. So essentially I've had no holidays. Upon speaking to my Principal Associate, I was told that weekends are for catching up on work, which I disagree with. Weekends are for recreation and rest. 

I've had some incredible litigation experience at my internship, as I was working with some of the brightest minds in the city. When I'm given work here, and I see a lacuna in the work, I politely point it out but my suggestions are always taken with hostility, and I have to push for 10+ minutes to even have my side heard. My seniors are very unclear on fundamental aspects of law, and I shouldn't be the one having to defend my work because of their shortcomings. 

The work environment really makes me sad because I don't like being yelled at or spoken down to. 

I've spoken to my girlfriend who is also a professional and has been working full time since 19. She has gone through a lot of bad work places but she has always made it work. She tells me that I need to make people and places work for me, and I need to learn how to win people over to my side. And that I come across too strong and intimidating. She also says I'm very opinionated and stubborn. She says that I need to maneuver and make my place even in difficult places and that's where growth lies. And that if it's not difficult coworkers it's going to be a difficult judge. She says that I shouldn't run away when I'm inconvenienced or when things get difficult. When I said this place was killing my passion, she asked me if my passion was weak enough to be killed by a few people. I understand what she's saying and she makes good points.

I spoke to one of my seniors at my previous internship and told him that I'm unhappy and that I was always excited to get up for work with him. He has felt my absence too and is willing to pay me ~40% less than what I'm making here. But the work with him is what makes headlines on papers, and it's always on the edge of innovation. When I worked there I felt I was furthering law as an art. 

Working at a firm would guarantee a $100,000+ salary in 10 years.  Which is very good for india. Working at my previous job will make it incredibly uncertain. I could be making way less or way more. 

My question is whether I should quit this place and join my previous senior? Do I have the right reasons to quit? Will I never make it in life with this attitude, and in general? Should I tough it out and listen to my girlfriend's advice? Who has not only preached it but practiced it?

Note: Please do keep in mind that in India and more so in my profession, these working hours are kinda the norm. 

Note 2: My work hours at my current work place are insane 90+ hours and I'm working till 6AM on a Friday night to Saturday morning."

qwgsr5,29,2021-11-17,How was your first internship experience?,Bluehiperspace8,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/qwgsr5/how_was_your_first_internship_experience/,"Hey!

So I'm going to have my first internship next summer at either Microsoft or Facebook, still deciding.

My main goal is getting a return offer because I'm a Junior, so this is will be my only internship, and I'm an international student.

Do you guys think that having my first and only internship at huge companies like those could be too much? I'd like to do backend and while I have done some projects on backend at school, I'm sure that the code isn't industry level lol. At Facebook I know that they match preferences pretty good so I'll most likely do backend. At Microsoft they don't care, so it's going to be random what I do.

Basically I'm scared because I see all these people going to SWE internships at these places that already have 1 or 2 smaller internships under their belt and I'm going to be a newbie at this sort of experience. I know I'm going to learn a ton but I don't wanna be at risk of not securing a return offer because I had to do some extra learning that most of the other interns didn't.

How was the experience at your first internship? Was the learning curve too steep? Anyone who went into a Big N internship as a first experience?

Not sure it's just impostor syndrome kicking or if this should be a legitimate concern.

Thank you!"

They're pretty different from each other and I'd appreciate any advice on which one to take. This will be my last internship before graduating.

Offers:  
1. SWE intern for a startup in NYC. They've grown a lot in the past couple years.  
2. Data Science intern for an older tech company in the Bay area.

Career-wise I'd like to work more in data science/ML engineering. I've done a couple internships in data science. I don't experience in SWE (besides taking a class in it next semester and basic software development), but I'm interested in exploring it before I graduate. However, I'm worried that if I do SWE next summer and then look for data science/ML jobs in the fall it'll look bad or be a step back career-wise.

On the other hand, the tech company has name-brand recognition, but I didn't do any technical interviews for the position. The team I'd work for is really small, and I got the impression that they don't have many well defined projects. However, I'd be doing stuff that's more aligned with what I'd like to work in after graduating.

Thanks!"

I'm seeking some career advice and some guidance with my career path right now. I'll try to do my best to keep it short and sweet.

Situation:

\- I've graduated. I've been working on a platform solution for the past 3 years part-time as sole engineer for a problem that I (and many others) have experienced. 1st year was spent learning, 2nd year I made two MVPs, they flopped b/c my solutions were fundamentally flawed. This last go-around I learned my lessons - cultivated a user base, did my due diligence and conducted interviews to get product-user fit. I've identified and defined requirements, translated into product specs, have built and implemented architecture, frontend and backend features and am currently building the last features . I'm currently weeks away from general availability (GA) release.

&amp;#x200B;

My question:

I'd like to know what you think my best option is from a prospective team member and hiring manager's perspective:

\- Apply to SWE I-II positions after product release and acquiring size-able number of users

\- Doesn't matter the users, release does, apply after the release

\- Doesn't matter the users or release, okay to apply now


I am certainly open to taking advice.


My prep:

\- I've completed 230 Leet, have taken Distributed Systems courses over the past year and recently got involved in a Systems research lab.

\- I'm aiming for SWE I and SWE II because of YOE. I don't think I'd perform well if given Sr.   
or management responsibilities, at this point in my career. I'm applying for Frontend and Full-Stack roles because I can leverage my expertise and experience, though I'm really interested in Systems. Additionally, I have one year of experience at a well-known company and did good work there, and one internship at a startup.

\- I'm seeking job opportunities because I'm not looking to monetize my platform. I also feel that I have a good foundation skills-wise now. I'm looking to grow and be a part of a strong team at this point in my career.

\- I will definitely post the link to the site when I release.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for your time and your advice.

What would you suggest?"

qwl8n1,6,2021-11-18,May 2021 Grad trying to find way back,wowpinja234,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qwl8n1/may_2021_grad_trying_to_find_way_back/,"Hi everyone! Not really sure if this is the right place to post this, but I really wanted advice on how to move forward with my life in terms of my career. (First few paragraphs are about me and a little more insight to why I was feeling the way I'm feeling so feel free to skip to the last paragraph to see my questions)

So just some background for myself, I graduated in May 2021 with a degree in CS but COVID hit me really hard mentally. Several of my closest family members died and it really hit me hard. It really doesn't help that I'm one of those people that coasted through school and never went out of my way to try things out. (Yes this means I never went out of my way to look for internships) Yeah I made some projects just for fun, but it's just simple projects. For example, some projects made by just using Java's Swing GUI. I never once learned on what React, Docker or whatever these employers are looking for. I only really knew how to code in Python, Java, and a little of C.

Once I graduated, I did apply to about 20 places (Yeah, rookie numbers I know..) and have around 3 places actually calling me back. I was really fresh to how interviewing work so I passed the initial phone screening for all of them pretty much. I was moreso surprised about all the technical interviews that followed. Like I said before, I only really knew core concepts and probably the basics of coding in Python, Java and C. I even had a technical interview that I bombed and I'm pretty sure it was pretty easy as they only asked how to work with exceptions and what static was in Java (Stuff that I didn't do in my last year so I completely forgot). Then I found about this subreddit and I see people that have been Leetcoding (Would you guys believe that I never knew about Leetcode before coming here?) for months and here I am thinking that I can find a job with the basics.

So with all that paired up with what happened to my immediate family, I just took a break for a couple months. Weak I know, but I really needed this break as how hard COVID hit my family and the realization of how different the industry is from school really made me mental quite close to breaking.

So now we come to November, where I am feeling a lot better so I'm finally back to applying. I've started looking into Leetcode and embarassingly it takes me around 30 minutes to solve one Easy problem. I'm trying to review questions that I bombed that one time (how exceptions work and what static is). Obviously a 6 month break really rusts up my coding skill (Not like I had anything impressive) but I feel like I'm getting back to the gist about it. I'm also going to eventually start to try and develop my own website if that's within my skillset. (Never learned anything about CSS, Javascript, or HTML either....)

So here are my questions. Did I screw up by taking the 6 month break I did? Not like I regret it since I feel a lot better but will employers be asking what I did? Also, like I said before, I only really know how to do trivial code in Python, Java, and a little bit of C. Yeah, I completed some projects with them, but nothing too amazing. Probably the best thing I made was a mobile app on Android Studio if that even counts. But other than that, I feel like I know nothing. Even simple data structures and algorithm questions, I completely forgot but I have been reviewing them little by little. Will I really be okay or did I just mess up with how I handled the previous 2 years of my life and how I coasted through my degree."

What do I do? I can't just stop because I feel like I've wasted so many years for nothing then, I wanna finish this but I have no idea what to do, if I get a task at an internship I don't know how to do it and I'm scared that I'll fail."

I have tried on Glassdoors, LinkedIn, Internshala, and either I get no response or I am rejected due to lack of experience and knowledge. I am literally applying for an internship to fill those two holes. I have invested months in cybersecurity and my entire resume is built to land a job in cybersecurity.

Is there any way to rectify this? Should I keep holding on for a career in cybersecurity or should i start from scratch for another career line?

Thank you for the help everyone!,OutsideYam,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qwthbl/i_did_it_i_finally_found_a_dream_position_no/,"I feel this type of obligatory post for this subreddit, so here it is. A bit about myself, I returned to school for computer science in my 30's. I came from a healthcare background where I worked in the realm of physical therapy. I started school in 2018 and finished in 2021. Due to some circumstances, I could not get any internship experience, and I knew this was going to hinder me.

The process was tedious. There were 400 or so job applications. 200 LC questions, which I actually enjoyed and will continue to do them.  I worked on three different side projects. I received plenty bunch of ""We love your personality/enthusiasm, but we need someone with more experience.""  I eventually reached a point of stopping caring, or I was numb to the generic email rejection. When I achieved that mindset, things were much more freeing.

In the last few weeks, I casually entertained the hiring process with different companies and attended career fairs. In one career fair, I had some was quick banter with someone, and I was invited for an interview a few days later.  After that, I offered me an SRE position. I conditionally accepted it. They said it's fully remote, FT, full benefits, and unlimited PTO. There is room for me to move laterally and vertically.

They asked about my salary range, and I said I'd need to get back to them since I didn't research this topic much. After some research and discussion with other people in the field, I concluded on $80000 - $85000. They agreed.

A couple of days later, I got another call from a company that I interviewed with, and they offered me a $100000 full-stack role, but they have a hybrid working model. I asked them to give me a few days to decide.

With the help of this subreddit,  with the notion, ""It is okay to ask for more money. "" I decided that I would ask for a small salary bump from the original company. I asked them for $92500, to which they agreed.

Yes, I know this isn't FANG money, but I don't care. The position is entirely remote, with good benefits and good PTO. Furthermore, with no internship experience, I'd be a bloody fool to say no. As well, I confirmed this is more of a SWE engineering role that, DevOps, so I'll be writing code, which I'm excited for

The silly thing about this whole interview process for this company. . .I wasn't asked a single LC question."
qwtmht,1,2021-11-18,"Finance Major, Accounting Experience, Interested in Technology. Advice on next steps?",Huncho_Levitate,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/qwtmht/finance_major_accounting_experience_interested_in/,"Hi All,

I graduated in May of 2020 with a finance degree and have been working my first full time position at my current PE firm as a staff accountant for a little over the past year now. Overall, I find the work to be unrewarding and I don’t see a future at the company. I’ve looked internally for positions that are more geared towards finance, however, I believe I’ve come to the conclusion that maybe the private equity space is not something I’m interested in, if I’m not on a sought after deal team. Considering my resume, that does not seem plausible at this point unless I went for my MBA, and even then could be a stretch. My past internship experience was a controller at another large bank. I feel my resume looks pretty good on paper with some big company names supporting me.  My limited finance experience has been working as a controller for an internship, as well as the way a PE firm operates. And in accounting, I have a year’s worth of fund accounting experience.

What I’m unsure about is what type of role I should look into next. Recently I’ve started to become more and more interested in the technology space. I’m pretty technologically inclined and feel like I can learn the different technologies fairly fast. I see technology such as blockchain, AI, cloud computing, machine learning, etc. as the future of business as many of these items will be implemented into existing businesses in the future if they haven’t already. I don’t have any software engineer skills, however I’m confident in my ability to learn them would it be required for a role. Would anyone have any recommendations for potential lines of work or skills that I should look into?

Some potential roles that I’ve thought about from a finance/accounting perspective has been an investment analyst, commercial or corporate banking, consulting, or real estate. I also haven’t crossed out the potential for something a little more sales/relationship based, as I’m fairly comfortable talking to people and if anything would allow me to grow professionally even more. Is there a cross over that I’m unaware of that would combine my finance major, accounting experience and interest in technology?


TL;DR. I’m a recent graduate with a finance major, accounting work experience, and with an interest in technology. Are there any paths for which my experience and interests would align?"

qwtzqu,1,2021-11-18,Is it okay to cancel?,lomina1589,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/qwtzqu/is_it_okay_to_cancel/,"Hey guys, this might be a longwinded post but bear with me. I got into therapy about two years ago and it was very helpful in the beginning. I started just before COVID hit, so in combination with therapy I was able to get a bunch of alone time, which helped me focus on myself and I saw the positive effects in my life. Around the same time, I reconnected with some old friends and felt really amazing spending time with them, I got an internship and everything felt great. I still had struggles but overall I look at that as a positive time in my life. Now, fast forward almost two years later, I switched therapists about 6 months ago, and I actually feel more lost than before. I was able to set goals for myself but I also started focusing way too much externally, I was chasing relationships with people, trying to determine where I belong, rather than working on myself; to finish school, etc. The realization hit me recently when I realized I am on the brink of failing a class in my last year at university. I'm quite behind my age group due to switching around a bunch and the year long internship I had. A friend group I am in booked a trip in August to go away in December. Honestly, I wasn't sure if I wanted to go but I said yes to not be left out, to show a commitment to the friend group. I regret it now, I want to complete a certification I need for my future job.

I’m currently an intern at this company and received a full time job offer from them a couple weeks ago, but I don’t want to take it. I’ve gotten some really good offers elsewhere and I’m not in love with this company enough to stay. My internship has been hard on my mental health and this company pushes its employees too hard. Plus the offer I got from my current company was around $15K lower than all my other offers which was a bit insulting after all the overtime I have put in. 

Anyway, I met with my boss for our check-in and I finally told her I was ready to accept a job offer somewhere else. I said I don’t have anything against the company but it’s just not right for me right now. She responded to this by seemingly not hearing me and spending 15 minutes trying to convince me why I should stay. She even told me she would have the president of our department/area get in touch with me to convince me to stay. She said they could make a new position for me if necessary. She is just so incredibly persuasive and confrontational which stresses me out to no end. I was so close to bursting out in tears that entire meeting with her because she just wasn’t hearing me out and wouldn’t accept my decision. I feel lost as to what my next steps should be. I am firm in my decision to leave, but don’t know how to be more firm with my boss and boss’s boss. I also don’t want to ruin business relationships since I will be working for them for another few months. Please please help me navigate this. It’s been a huge source of stress for me the last few weeks."

I have absolutely no idea what I want to do in the future. After elimination (I find want to pursue a field in biology, chemistry, physics, economic, business and film) the only option I have left is pursuing computer science. But, I'm not really passionate about it but I don't mind doing it.

Now all of my friends have already started with their college application preparations such as doing internships, writing research papers, giving external examinations etc.

I feel that my friends underestimate themselves or show off how smart they are by saying that they relate to me but they clearly don't. One if my friends got a 1530/1600 on their SAT and another friend got 36/36 on their ACT. Along with that they are giving APs for like 3 subjects while balancing their IB.

I'm not doing anything. I don't know what to do. I have a very smart brother and he is working at Tesla now and I feel that he got it easy. He definitely worked really hard for it but what I mean is that he was kinda already smart. The effort I'm putting into working hard and getting a 42 in IB is a lot more than what he did. 

I feel so fucking lost and I just don't want to grow up. I don't want to go to college. I don't like that my friends are such all rounders. I know for a fact I'm going to get into a very ""poor college"" while my friends get into ivy league and all. 

That's kinda it ig."

qww94s,1,2021-11-18,Finding Part Time Remote Work,rtsmithers,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/qww94s/finding_part_time_remote_work/,"Background: I'm an engineering student at an accredited university who recently (today) found out my part time internship will be terminated because I have accepted a new internship for the summer of 2022. The company offered the part time / mostly remote internship because I had done so well over the summer. I was expecting to be able to work this internship through the end of the school year but they don't want to keep around an intern who won't be there for the next summer. This was surprising since my first internship also offered a remote internship for the school year after seeing my summer performance and didn't mind me taking on a new internship. They let me work over the school year all the way up until my next internship started. Regardless, in less than a month I'll be without a job until summer.

&amp;#x200B;

While I could find a local job / work at a college bar or something similar, I have really enjoyed my time working remotely. It offers plenty of flexibility which I need as an engineering student. My supervisors / the engineers I work with would give me a task and a deadline and I would find the time to get it done when it was convenient for me. Really a good deal especially when the pay beat most local jobs.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have advice for finding a part-time remote position that I could hold for the school year? Preferably I would start as soon as possible. I really don't care about it being relevant to engineering as I'm mostly just looking for paychecks until my new internship starts. Obviously something related to a technical field is preferred but I would be willing to work for any type of business / institution.

Need advice on:

* Where should I look for positions / what websites?
* How should I adjust my resume from engineering internship focused to my current situation?
* How should I present myself in an interview?
* Have you heard of any programs / jobs that would be a good fit?
* Many of these companies will be looking for long-term employees out of these jobs which I am obviously not. Any good work-around?"

qwwfb1,0,2021-11-18,Choosing between: Frontend Internship at Meta or SWE Internship at MongoDB?,AMetalMango,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qwwfb1/choosing_between_frontend_internship_at_meta_or/,"Hi there!

I have been super fortunate to have gotten two great internship offers for this upcoming summer.

I am curious to hear people's thoughts on which offer I should go with.

For the SWE internship at MongoDB, I can do back end, full stack, or front end. The location is in NYC. The company is medium-sized in terms of number of employees so I could connect with a lot of people at the company. I've also heard that the intern class ends up super tight knit which would be really nice. Since the company is smaller than Meta, I could also have a larger role with the work that I do.

For the internship at Meta/Facebook, I only have the choice of front end. I'm happy to do front end work but I'm wondering if that looks as good on a resume as backend/full stack. Meta is a larger company which I have never experienced before. I also go to a relatively unknown school so it would be great to have Meta on my resume. I also think the work that goes on there is really cool. The location is in Menlo Park, but I can try to change location to NYC.

Any insights on how I should make this decision would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!"

qwykus,9,2021-11-18,How do I work towards becoming a fund manager? (semi target),Liluzivertisthegoat,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/qwykus/how_do_i_work_towards_becoming_a_fund_manager/,"Hi, I’m 21 years old and currently on my last year of my Bachelor's programme in Business Administration and Economics (mid target) and I'm very conflicted what to do after my degree. I've always known that I wanted to work with stocks and I am very knowledgeable and passionate in that field. But how do I reach that goal?

It feels like the majority of fund managers (my dream job) went from the most target school from my country straight to an analyst role towards the public stock market. I've searched analyst roles recently and previously summer jobs in that role, but I feel like it's hard to get a job without previous experience in that field. Even internships and summer jobs seem to require previous experience (or that you want to that specific super target business school or your dad knows the CEO).

I don't have any work experience/internship of relevance. But I'm very engaged voluntarily in my university's finance commitee and also in my soccer team as a board member (economic subjects) so I guess I have that going for me. But it doesn't seem enough in relation to other that search similar jobs. I do have quite a good network but only in the economics field, pretty much no one works in finance. In my school the best most engaged students always seem to get big 4 audit jobs, but also most of them aren't really that into finance.

**I've thought about three different pathways:**

1.	Continue to search analyst jobs/internships towards the stock market (super hard competition, even in boutique). There's a realistic chance that I would still be searching in like May.
2.	Pursue a Master's degree in finance and try to get a part time finance job (I need to do a GMAT test to even qualify for a master's in the city where I'm from and planning to work in, so it would require a lot of effort and it's not guaranteed that I will even be accepted after that or get a part time finance job).
3.	Search analyst jobs/internships as an analyst in different finance fields to where I wanna work in the future, but fields that are relevant. I'm pretty interested in M&amp;A so maybe that's an option. I feel like there's not as hard of a competition in that field, but I'm not 100% sure.

As a long time lurker here I really appreciate all the posts. I know people on this sub have probably been in similar situations or know someone who have been in similar situations. I appreciate all help, input and information possible. Thanks in advance."

✓ Knowledge in Object Oriented Programming is mandatory

✓ Programming skills in Java or C# or Ruby or JavaScript or Python would be an added

advantage

✓ Additional knowledge in any Testing Tools (e.g. Selenium) would also be an added

I'm not going to lie, I am pretty comfortable with object-oriented stuff but we are currently learning Data Structures using Java in my programming fundamentals 3 class and I am not understanding it much at all. When I applied at the bottom it said to email the guy if I thought I met the requirements, so I emailed him along with a copy of my resume. About 3 hours later the guy emails me back and asks if I'm interested and if he can call me later. He calls me later and he pretty much offered me 50k with benefits. I was aware that this application was for n internship with a possible job opportunity but for him to call me and just offer me a job like that threw me off?

This Job fair thing was through my community college so I'm 90 percent sure it's not a scam. For the longest time, I've debated whether or not to go and transfer to a University because of debt (I'm going to have to get loans since I'm paying for my college) I eventually decided that the debt would be worth it in the end so I started applying to Universities like UTD and UT Austin. This job offer completely threw me off, I've always heard of people struggling to get job offers and internships so getting one this easy was a complete shock to me. I researched the company and they seem pretty legit, PM me if you want to know the name of the company because I'm not sure if I can give it out here.

I guess I'm wondering if you guys think 50k a year plus benefits is worth taking than going to University and being in debt. I also feel impostor syndrome hitting me hard right about now because I feel extremely underqualified considering I don't feel confident in my programming skills. I mean like I said OOP is fine but Data Structures is where I am not confident.

What should I pursue next?,Realistic-Bell-9815,AskProgramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/qx4hpr/theres_so_many_things_i_want_to_learn_what_should/,"I finally got an internship, so I think I no longer have to worry about padding my resume with ""industry relevant"" projects that are just a CRUD app showing that I know relevant technologies X and Y.  I can also finally take a break from the interview prep grind. Now I'm looking for fun stuff to do in my free time (besides resting and resuming my social life, obviously) that will make me a better programmer or reinforce core CS concepts. There's so much I want to learn right now!

Here are some ideas I have in mind:

* review and dive deeper into algorithm analysis and design; take all of Tim Roughgarden's courses. Maybe solve some algorithms puzzles if I feel like it, without the pressure of preparing for interviews.
* read [Software Foundations Volume 1: Logical Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/lf-current/index.html). It teaches functional programming, logic, proofs as programs with Coq and other stuff that sounds interesting. 
* read [Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment](https://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Programming-UNIX-Environment-3rd/dp/0321637739) front to back, do all the exercises
* learn about linear algebra by reading [Linear Algebra: Theory, Intuition, Code](https://www.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Theory-Intuition-Code-ebook/dp/B08W9MGDFW) and do all the exercises. I'm not great at math but I still like it, and this subject sounds very interesting.
* build a blog and publish notes about all the stuff I've learned; review all the courses I've passed. I find writing fun when I'm not required to do it.
* create my own little 2D bullet hell or platforming game
* watch the [MIT lectures](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_7WrbZTCODu1o_kfUMq88g/videos) on distributed systems, apply some of the concepts by following along with the project in [Distributed Services with Go](https://pragprog.com/titles/tjgo/distributed-services-with-go/)
* learn about parallel programming with [this free course](https://ppc.cs.aalto.fi)
* create my own software synthesizer or audio plugin (not sure if this requires a lot of DSP background knowledge)
* build an imageboard or textboard. I've wanted to do this for years but it sounds like a large project that might burn me out.

I want to do everything in this list eventually, but what should I do first for now? I know that fun is entirely subjective and I might as well throw some dice to choose what to do, but I'd like to know your opinions. Which of these sounds like the most intellectually enriching *and* fun activity to pursue?"

qx5272,238,2021-11-18,[Opinion/Rant/YSK] Being a Civil Engineer in India,rvnd_mau5,Indian_Academia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indian_Academia/comments/qx5272/opinionrantysk_being_a_civil_engineer_in_india/,"**Motivation**

I have seen a flurry of posts from school kids asking about comparisons of ""scopes"" of different branches. And among many of the branches mentioned, civil engineering.

What's more saddening than the lack of interest in the branch among the young, is the responses from civil engineering graduates who either have not become a civil engineer yet and are still in the job hunt phase or from those who ultimately ended up in the IT services sector because that's what their institution was offering in terms of ""placements"". Its a long drive from being an ""engineering graduate"" to becoming an ""actual engineer"" - a fact that most people today don't seem to appreciate any more.

The problem according to me is that people aren't questioning facts and opinions that are being peddled as laws of nature - that civil engineering is not a good career and you are better off doing something else. Most of them have no inkling about the industry, let alone the state of the job market - whether it was yesterday, today or tomorrow.

With that rant out of the way...

**Why does anyone (actually) a become civil engineer?**

There is no one persona which describes the ideal civil engineer. There are many reasons why people choose civil engineering

*Reason 1 : Many people choose civil engineering because they can get a government job (for the work-life balance, job security, and extra money)*.

If they don't choose it, then their parent make them study civil engineering because for the pre-liberalization era parents, a government job is essentially a once in a lifetime lottery. If you win that lottery, it makes life easier for your parents - (i) extra social status, (ii) higher (in case of groom) or lower (in case of bride) dowry requirements can be set without much debate, and (iii) finally an end to education-related expenditure (no further spending is required on professional courses or further coaching for government jobs)

There are many government departments, PSUs, and ministries which hire civil engineers. Starting from the public works department of your state to Indian Railways and ISRO &amp; even RBI and SEBI at the central government level.

For state government vacancies the posts are filled through respective state public service commissions &amp; for central government vacancies - (i) PSUs hire through GATE or a separate exam of their own, (ii) departments &amp; ministries hire through UPSC Engineering Services Examination for officer level posts &amp; specific selection boards (SSB &amp; RRB) for lower level posts

Civil engineering always had, has &amp; will have the highest number of vacancies in government institutions as compared to other engineering branches. This is why civil engineering as a career option is popular among pre-1991 parents. As long as the government continues to hire civil engineers, many parents will force their kids to study civil engineering. End of Story.

In case you are wondering why governments hire so many civil engineers, its because for every road, bridge, canal, dam, sewer, boundary wall, building, stadium that gets built in this country, the government funds almost all of it out of its own pockets, and government my friend, has very deep pockets (Google debt of NHAI if you have time to kill)

*Reason 2 : Many people also join civil engineering, because they have no clue what to do with life and gave more importance to being at a particular institution than to their choice of branch*

This includes people who are attracted to places of opportunity. For many getting into IIT/NIT/BITS was more important than actually becoming an engineer, because IIT/NIT/BITS are cool. And like many rats before them, the race was all that mattered to them.

For example, some of them join an IIT just for the sake of the IIT tag and then hope that by the end of their first year, they will successfully score a near perfect GPA and switch branches to their preferred one despite stiff competition. Most of them end up being stuck in the civil engineering department, because college after all is meant for enjoying &amp; not giving a damn about GPAs.

These enlightened souls then either get interested in ""start-ups"" or become part of the ""coding culture"" or in general get disenchanted with engineering and decide to ""Get an MBA"". There is nothing wrong with all these things, except that these special souls now become crusaders whose job is to cull any leftover demand &amp; interest for civil engineering among schoolkids.

So, ultimately this lot either - (i) ends up starting a small business and call it a ""start-up"", (ii) head towards whichever B-school will take them, (iii) get hired by any IT mass-recruiters who like them don't care about their branch, or (iv) actually ends up excelling in their passion - some become successful entrepreneurs at the helm of unicorns, or actors (Jeetu Bhaiyya !!!), or pilots (Flying Bull Beast whatever), or software engineers in FAANG and other acronyms I haven't bothered to look up. The final category is a tiny minority compared to the rest 3, but everybody likes to cite category 4 to tell you civil engineering sucks.

The logic goes something like this -

1. Software/Finance pays more
2. I can't make it into these jobs
3. Hence, I made the wrong choice - Every other branch other than CSE sucks and is s\*\*\*\^

\^This mentality is why we ended up with private universities that have 3000+ seats in CSE in a single batch

*Reason 3 : A tiny minority joins this branch because it actually loves the branch*

I personally love construction, I grew up around civil engineers from 4 different continents. Civil engineering was that truly global career where if you so desired could work in places like US, UK or Netherlands or any other developed country or work in rugged places like Uganda, Somalia, Chile, Azerbaijan, or Egypt or any other developing country (even Pakistan!!!).

And all these countries have governments with deep pockets. If their pockets aren't deep enough, the World Bank (or ADB, JICA for that matter) will happily lend you money. With that money you build infrastructure. Or at least pretend that you are building infrastructure.

I hated thermodynamics, so I chose civil engineering over mechanical engineering. Plus, growing up I saw more roads &amp; bridges being built in my state than factories &amp; heavy industrial plants. So the economy of my state &amp; personal circumstances primarily guided my career choice.

Few even go on get PhDs and join academia or work in research labs on obscure topics like intelligent transportation systems, urban economics, spatial econometrics, applying AI/ML to complex problems, making all sorts of concrete that can be used  - underground, underwater, on the Moon &amp; what not.

**Shut Up &amp; Tell Me Where Are The Jobs**

*The Big Daddy : Real Estate Sector*

In the first decade of the 21st century all the good paying jobs were in the real estate sector. These were the days of the boom in markets like Mumbai, Gurugram and Bengaluru. Heck, the real estate sector actually got so flush with cash that they even started giving a damn about construction deadlines and started hiring construction project managers to ensure homes &amp; offices were delivered on schedule. Home prices were high, but still affordable, you could buy a 2bhk home worth 4 times your annual income, because such properties were available.

This boom period ended after the Great Crash of 2008 when capital fled real estate markets and only people who weren't capable of speculating in more sophisticated manners remained invested in the real estate market. The real estate sector isn't willing to cut prices today, and speculators obviously are in no hurry to sell assets because a property can be kept locked for a century, or even more - it is not exactly perishable like a banana, rather its steel and concrete moulded to last a lifetime.

The real estate sector is the primary job provider to civil engineering graduates. So the health of the real estate sector in a particular state is reflected in the placement statistics of colleges in &amp; around that state. Sadly, the real estate sector is in the toilet for almost a decade now. Currently realtors aren't launching new projects with the same frequency as the boom period because they are already sitting with a huge stock of unsold inventory. 

Most new launches have been in the luxury bracket and in the commercial (offices) &amp; retail (malls) space. And for such large scale projects, you don't need as many civil engineers as you did before. 

These firms offer 4-7LPA for graduates and 6-10LPA to people with PG degrees in construction management. But overall the job market isn't as hot as it used to be. This is also because engineering colleges and institutions like NICMAR increased intake obscenely - leading to an oversupply &amp; simultaneous decrease in quality of intake (anyone who sits for the exam these days is offered an admission)

*The Actual Industry - Relevant Now More Than Ever*

The services sector has had a steady demand for civil engineers, but they now require a master's degree for most entry level roles - although in the early 2000s this wasn't the case. These firms offer 5-9LPA to people with masters degrees in any one of the many specializations of civil engineering. They hire design engineers who design bridges, roadways, highways, water treatment plants, dams, canals, etc. for clients (read, governments) across the world. 

These firms have even started developing bespoke software to cater to the needs of the clients, since the traditional software services firms have never bothered to enter such specialized markets. So civil engineering graduates who can code are also in demand.

The good thing about these firms is that they don't discriminate between institutions because they know all folks in India are equally unskilled. So, they hire for the same role you will find folks from some random college in Bengaluru to folks from IIT Roorkee or Kanpur or Bombay (considered the best for this branch). Heck, some senior engineers even have PhDs. 

So, in the current market if you want a job in civil engineering you better specialize further and get a masters degree and enter any of the design firms that operate in India - And almost 6 out of Top 15 design firms in the world have offices in multiple locations in India.

**If Its So Good Why Are Many Unemployed &amp; Why Is The Pay Low**

Well, here's the bad news first - Pay will always be low. It will certainly be lower than software/IT/banking etc. The average senior software engineer probably earns 1.5x-6x of an average senior civil engineer.

Now for the good news - Pay may maybe low, but this is a sector where experience is respected. The first thing to go on a job description for a civil engineering role is the mandatory minimum years of experience required. So, this is a profession where a senior civil engineer can be as old as 75!!! And until these old farts retire or drop dead, there wont be much growth for the people at the lower ends of the pyramid.

This is both good and bad. Its bad for the fresher who is looking for a job, but it very good for experienced civil engineers. They know that they cant be replaced by 2-3 young idiots with barely any experience. And that's where this branch is different from others. There aren't many senior software engineers who are in their 50s or 60s, but there are many such senior civil engineers. Civil engineering doesn't suffer from inherent ageism like the software sector does. Nobody forces you to get into management or get out.

Then there's the ultimate truth bomb - You wont get rich working for a civil engineering firm. You will get rich by starting your own civil engineering firm. And I get it, most of us don't want to go through the headache of running a business in India for earning a ""measly &amp; piddly"" income of 20-50LPA. You would rather work for a business which pays you that income annually - nicely ""packaged"" of course. But that is no reason to defame a branch which has done no harm to you &amp; a branch which you don't care about.

Civil engineers whom I know are small business owners with their own consultancies earn as high as 20-50LPA. That band is so wide, because this depends on which market are you operating in. Are you in the business of catering to realtors in Mumbai or Gurugram? Or are you in the business of providing design services to road &amp; bridge projects in a rich state like Karnataka? Or are you a contractor who is involved in construction of projects funded by GoI? A lot depends on the business you are in and the market that you are operating in.

Civil engineers who work for consultancies wont earn much because there is an upper limit to how many projects they can work on simultaneously. To earn more money you need scale, which you wont have until you start your own firm. The firm has no incentive to pay you a bulk of its margin when it knows that - (i) profit margins on government projects are razor thin and a significant chunk of it is lost in bribes &amp; kickbacks to government officials and politicians, (ii) it can replace senior engineers with retired government engineers who often are cheaper substitutes for senior civil engineers, but are in short supply &amp; (iii) it can fire pesky junior engineers in the firm at a whim because there is no dearth in supply of freshers who can be trained to suit their needs

**My Problem With Most Civil Engineering Graduates**

Sorry for restarting the rant.

Most civil engineering graduates end up wasting 4 years. If they end up in a good MTech program - they further ruin those 2 years by preparing for government exams instead of developing actual skills which are needed by the industry. Then they blame the branch. What makes matters worse is that students are responsible for place-com performance, with very little, but very often, no support from profs.

And when you have batch full of ""govt job aspirants"", the placement of the entire batch suffers. Even the good ones who have the requisite skills end up jobless. These ""aspirants"" instead of gaining skills end up giving as high as 6-7 attempts in a bid to score a government job. The problem is exacerbated by seniors who advise only to prepare for ESE/PSUs as the way to a job - which is the worst way to hunt for a job. Preparing for XYZ exam is not a career plan. It makes much more sense to have job in hand and then prepare simultaneously for government jobs - given the high competition and soaring costs of coaching - exacerbated by the multiple attempts one ends up giving.

The blame doesn't lie entirely on the students or their parents. Most of them are ignorant idiots who just want a government job or enroll in an engineering course because that's what the herd is doing. Not every parent or student has access to information on skills and job prospects of each and every branch. So lets stop blaming the victims.

Ideally, its the job of a professional body to ensure that only those young engineers who have the necessary skills &amp; competencies get to practice as a professional engineer (like CAs, for example). for example - In the US, you need to write the Fundamentals of Engineering exam (similar to GATE) to become an ""Engineer-in-Training"" (EIT) in civil engineering firms.

But the professional bodies for civil engineering in India are mostly run by government engineers who scratch each others' backs and keep giving each other stupid awards. Just compare the websites of ASCE/ICE and Institution of Engineers, India.

Such abdication of responsibility towards young engineers by the senior engineers is very disheartening. Ideally, only competent civil engineers should be able to practice. The ones who don't make the cut or those who engage in malpractices should be shown the door. There are no formal mechanisms in India for all of this.

Which is why, in my personal opinion, the civil engineering profession has ended up with so little public trust.

**Okay, But What Should I Do? (For currently in their BTech)**

Ideally you should have chosen a branch that you are interested in - for civil engineering you need to be good at math (we don't use vector calculus a lot) &amp; classical mechanics

*Focus on skills -* Go look at job postings of good firms on LinkedIn and see what skills are in demand - and then go acquire them. Learning random software and having a bouquet or word soup of stuff on your resume is not the same as upskilling - learn only those software relevant to a particular job role. People write AutoCAD and MS Excel in their resumes - I would like to tell you that it is considered a joke - at least in MNCs - because this is the 21st century and who the hell doesn't know how to use MS Excel or AutoCAD ?!?! (I taught my 9 year old cousin AutoCAD btw - he loves it - he thinks it is the MS Paint for grown-ups)

*Focus on networking -* the job market isn't a frozen beast, you need to be in touch with alumni and folks who work in the industry so that you can figure which way the job market is moving - there is no point in becoming a structural engineer if - (i) the real state sector is in the toilet &amp; (ii) there is an oversupply of folks with a master's degree in structural engineering

*Don't rely on ""placements"" -* The civil engineering profession has traditionally relied on young graduates joining firms as apprentices and then moving up the ladder. Unfortunately in India, this system is by and large, non-existent. The placement culture that we see in the software &amp; financial sectors is also absent in this branch except for a few global design firms. So intern at firms in all summer breaks. Nobody owes you a job. Placement culture is only a recent phenomenon &amp; frankly without mass recruiters there would have been no such ""culture"". And civil engineering firms aren't mass recruiters.

**PS (my\_qualifications) - BTech + ME in civil engineering -** I work at a global design firm and design highways (3 continents so far)

**PS2 -** Sorry for the lengthy post - I hate people who s\*\*\* on my branch without facts or evidence - *Senti ho jata hu thoda, bas*"

So 4 to 5 months back i started learning game dev i started with unity and C#, i collected free one and also bought a bunch of the course i liked and planned fire through ton of courses, i did at start but afterward i got internship and wasn't able to do the unity courses i was piling up.

Now i really want to dive back into game dev and for some reason i really want to learn unreal now. 

Earlier i planned to learn Unity and c# then learn c++ from scratch on its own (Not only for game  but i am also interested making other software with it ) then come to unreal.

This could be a werid question to ask what should i do ?

1.Go back to C# and unity and complete all the pending course (in which i am not very interested but could be helpful)

2.Learn C++ from scratch, then go to unreal (Which i am very interested in but its a long shot )

3. Learn basic of C++ then learn C++ further alongside Unreal (i am also interested in this one)"

I was hoping to get some insight into the CS industry. I'm not in this world at all, so I don't really know where to start.

My younger sister (21) has expressed interest in going into coding. She's done 2 years of a business degree at a state school, but found it wasn't for her. She's thinking of leaving school and doing one of those multi-month coding boot camps instead, as well as studying on her own.

1) is it frowned upon to not have a CS degree, or a degree at all?
2) what language(s) would be most desirable at this time, or is there a trusted resource to look this up?
3) is a coding boot camp enough to apply for internships, or would she need to demonstrate she's a student?
4) would you have any resources you recommend for further study or research?

She's not looking to go into a FAANG/MANGA company, and she did very average in college. 

Thank you so much for your time!!!"

AITA?,lookitsajackpot,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/qxl165/ending_a_4_years_of_a_working_relationship_aita/,"I’m a web developer. I spent 4+ years remotely working for a US based agency. I learned and grew a lot. But barely got a raise or better prices over projects.

I’ve landed that company some serious work (like clients that are some of the top universities of the US that I cannot disclose the name of due to the non-disclosure agreement).

The depressing part started when they assigned that client that I earned with hard work, to a new fucking intern.

And I noticed them also giving more projects to the other devs working for the company, and less work to me.

As a result, I met someone who pays me twice as much of a hourly rate and have since been exclusively working with him. I didn’t exactly wanted to turn my old bosses down and therefore didn’t tell them about this new client of mine. But something came out of my mouth while talking to one of my colleagues. The next thing you kno, it’s spread all over the team. My old bosses are congratulating me over the new position with my new client lol.

They’ve since removed me from their Slack channel. And said “We will add you back using the Slack connect tool” but that was almost a month ago lol. No one added me back. It seems like they’re holding grudges for working with this new client.

Sometimes I wonder if I should reach back out to my old bosses and tell them I’m still available for work. Because I prefer to be working with multiple clients now. Or do I stick to my new client and I’m just in denial? I did like working with my old bosses because I learned a lot. But they didn’t treat me fairly. They also started giving my clients to stupid interns.

That was it with my vent."

What habits did you all adopt in order to stay disciplined with school and what was a common problem with kids who switched majors or dropped out?

I never tried in high school or put in any effort and after working construction for a couple years after I realized how important school was.

Still, I would love to have the chance for a FB SWE role full-time, which I worry will be difficult for the next few years if I renege. I also feel like going from FB to TikTok is much easier than the other way around.

I keep running into issues when it comes to sub-address (unit, apt, suite #) data and I'm wondering how you handle it. There are many occasions where a plat will record with this sub-address information on it, we assign addresses accordingly, then at some point the developer puts something totally different on the building. For example they will call them 1,2,3 instead of A,B,C or call them Apartments as opposed to Units.

This is problematic for dispatch obviously if the data we serve them doesn't match what the citizens are using. The main problem is we have no building code whatsoever, so we don't have anyone doing site visits and auditing these things, nor do we require plans from the developer to build that we could match our address data up to.

For now I'm setting up a project to audit all of our current sub-addresses through site visits, contacting HOA's, etc. for an intern but this data has potential to get stale quickly as things build/change. Does anyone have any insight into this issue, and what sources for sub-address info do you use?"

Another idea is working more here for the value I get from them investing resources into me. i could start a startup but I'm having a hard time thinking how to market my skills considering I only know c++ at a fair level.

I worked in the Los Angeles office, covering for KIIS, ALT, REAL, MY, and KOST FM. I was furloughed in March of 2020 due to Covid, and terminated on my birthday at the end of September 2020, with a severance of about $575. Pandemic unemployment paid 3x the money I was making there.

On overnights, I would monitor each station via computer (just switch stations in the NexGen program) and ensure that the Top of the Hour sound element played as close to the hour as you could get it, within like 2 minutes, preferably, which was usually just one song inserted somewhere. I did not have full choice of song in most cases, as there was a specific list of songs we were permitted to insert, and that list changed every 3-6 months or so.

On weekends, before they did any restructuring, I worked mostly at KIIS, with occasional training at other stations. I would do similar finagling to ensure commercials and Top of the Hour played when they should, as well as doing contests, recording and playing back winners at designated slots. The weekends were the best, until they restructured. 

My trainer was the producer for JoJo on the Radio. JoJo Wright is a great dude, super friendly, and his wife makes [AWESOME cookies](https://www.instagram.com/denascookieshop/). His producer often worked full days, but technically wasn't a full time employee. At the time, no producers or board ops were full time - that changed later. Many producers and NO board ops are full time.

When JoJo's producer and I got to talking about wages, I informed her that I was making $14.25/hr, 25 cents over the minimum wage at the time (it was soon to change to my wage at the beginning of the following year). She, however, was making minimum wage of $14/hr. Mind you, this is Burbank, in one of the richest economies in the entire country (Hollywood is more there in Burbank than anywhere), and we were making money equivalent to a grocery store clerk or barista (no offense). 

While my collage career in ""communication"" hasn't been completed, hers had been. She had interned there (unpaid) for at least 6-12 months, worked in other large markets doing similar work, and evidently made similar money. She was NOT happy to learn that the person she had trained, who had literally NO experience, NO internships, etc. was actually making more money than her. After we both worked on Christmas of that year, and weren't paid any holiday pay, she hit up the Executive Administrative Programming Assistant - assistant to all Program Directors, and the person who basically runs the whole place - to then learn that producers don't get holiday pay, because they're part time. When that happened, she put in her 2 week notice not long after.

Now, she's working in a different part of the communication field, and hopefully getting better treatment by the employer. Talk to your coworkers, learn your worth, and move on if you have to.

I don't know of a better spot to post this so if you have any recommendations please let me know.

I am becoming worried about my ability to secure an internship for Summer 2022, preferably somewhere in the Tech Consulting or FSO world. For some context I am in my 3rd year at a creditable University. I have a 3.93 GPA, Economic Major, and will be getting a Masters in Business Analytics my 4th year here. I am also relatively involved on campus being a part of a professional fraternity (where I have a leadership position), and competing in business competitions. I have internship experience from last summer as an ""Analyst Intern"" for a smaller company where I was tasked with a multitude of projects (remote). I believe my cover letter is strongly written and portrays my abilities and are tailored made for each firm I apply for (not just Big 4). Yet I have never made it beyond the first part of the application process. Every time I apply I, almost always, immediately receive a ""Unfortunately"" email.... I have reached out to people who work at these companies via LinkedIn and have had informational interviews to help get my foot in the door but no success. I would like to argue I am an above average interviewee but I have not even been given the opportunity to pitch myself in person (or zoom) yet...

Safe to say I find this very concerning and confusing. I am seeing friends and other students with worse grades and less experience securing internships, yet I am left in the dust. If you have any tips or recommendations that can help me stand out among my peers I would greatly appreciate it.

I got a bachelors in physics in 2020, with some emphasis of computer science with both lower and upper division classes. My GPA was solid (above 3.5), and I have some personal projects, but no experience with internships or jobs in the field. I've been working a couple jobs unrelated to CS since I graduated. When I first graduated, I was trying to get a job or internship in software engineering but it was pretty hopeless - everyone ignored or rejected me, partly because that was right around the beginning of COVID lockdowns, and partly because I had zero job history. Now, a couple years later, I'm thinking about getting back in to it - working as a software engineer still really appeals to me. I also don't mind the thought of going back to school, so I figured investing in a masters degree before I get back into the workforce might pay off long term and help prove to employers that I'm competent in CS despite my degree being in physics. My question is, how much will it take for me to actually be competitive in my current state? I don't really care about prestige, just anything that will give me a reputable masters degree - so I'm fine with not being able to go to Harvard. Do I have any chance without professional or research experience in the field? Or would a good GRE and LORs be enough to get in to at least some mid-tier schools? Thanks in advance."

* Amazon (Return intern offer)

   * San Francisco, CA
   * Unknown, but backend dev
   *  $8635 / month + relocation (I think salary is a little less than MSFT's if adjusted to COL)

My thoughts:

* MSFT or Slack would help diversify my resume
* Would like to work in San Fran, but MSFT might add more value to my resume (I can try again for Slack internship the following year, and MSFT’s interviews were harder/more-luck based) . Also concerned about the future for Slack with its competitors like MS Teams

Essentially, my job functions mostly amount to delving skin-deep into badly configured SIEMs [with minimal network topologies], Antivirus Policies, prepping for SOC 2 Audit level documentation [God, can you say bored out of my mind?], and phishing tickets.

On top of which, I dunno if it's common to use ticketing systems in cybersecurity....but I have to log every minute of the day as it happens. Literally every minute. Feels like prison.

Now, I'm a noob. My degree [AAS] is mostly in programming: Python, C++, Java, TSQL, etc, but I happened to go to a Cybersecurity conference for college in 2019 and chased down a big name in global Cybersecurity for 2 years and through a pandemic to get an internship. This dude told me he robbed banks for a living, and I was sold.

Due to this internship I got, I was hired after 1 phone call by a midrange MSP who wanted to become an MSSP. 18 clients, and 50 employees to cover all of their Incident Response, Threat Hunting, Monitoring, Filtering, Networking, etc, etc. And we have 1 CISSP. A 2-man SOC /IR/TH/Compliance team.

The company is hiring a CISO and a CIO soon, so maybe that will change things.

In my internship, I had a blast. Mostly in Red Teaming labs, but I also enjoyed Linux and AWS.

Here, there is little structure, and I fulfill menial tasks to free up the CISSP. He says I'm helping him...But he can also barely speak English. Even when I learn stuff from him, it's often in mangled English which just confuses me.

At the same time, I need the money and feel like this is just a ridiculously lucky break, even though I feel dead inside while working.

I'm thinking about getting my CySa+ to make myself more valuable for a company jump, maybe trying a different company, maybe a real corporate role instead of an MSP pretending to be an MSSP. 

I want to give Cyber another shot, but I'm also planning on pursuing my bachelors in Software Development, then an MBA. Cybersecurity seems like just a perpetual losing battle of trying to find needles in needle stacks. I've felt the urge to want to *build* something, and I've also quite enjoyed connecting agents to cloud platforms and messing with servers. I seem to like Networking more, but it's not as valuable, right.

My real dream is just to be financially free to determine how I spend my own time, as selfish as that may sound. If I want to spend all day playing video games, I want to have purchased that right. The only way to do that is to stop trading time for money, but until I reach that point, I gotta do the double grind right. Study + 45 hours a week.

I could buy a house with my gf by April if I keep this job. Then work part time and bulldoze the B.S. and MBA. I guess I want someone to tell me to quit, haha....

Any advice?"

I am just wondering, what difficulty questions do people get for mid-tier companies for things like software engineering internships?

So far I have been getting leetcode mediums a lot, is this mostly the same for everyone? Thanks in advance."

I recently completed my Bachelor's Degree in Cybersecurity with **no internship** and **no certificate** at all. Currently I am trying to kickstart my Cybersecurity career by applying for Junior IT (mainly back-end) positions. Is this the right move?

Any advice would be appreciated.

qxx1g7,1,2021-11-19,How much will my degree matter with 5 years of work experience?,ThatFlashCat,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qxx1g7/how_much_will_my_degree_matter_with_5_years_of/,"I am 19 and in in my third semester of college and have had an internship in software development for the past 2.5 years. They have been very happy with my work and I expect to continue working there until I graduate, and possibly beyond. Let's say I stay with them until I graduate in 2024, which would be just over 5 years of work experience. 

How much is my degree likely to matter, considering I'll have experience from the start?

I imagine it matters more for some companies than others. At present, I am taking classes at a local community college so I will need to transfer to a four year, and am hoping for an online asynchronous program.

I've had some friends recommend Liberty University Online, but seeing that some don't seem to respect the school for a variety of reasons makes me leery of it (though it *is* accredited).

I've also run across such schools as [https://www.umgc.edu/index.cfm](https://www.umgc.edu/index.cfm) which are relatively inexpensive ($400-500 per credit) and offer an online CS program.

I realize this is focused on careers so I'll try not to get too sidetracked with college choices, though advice in this area would be appreciated.

The bottom line then, is, how much do employers care about degrees *if* their candidate has work experience and performs well on interview code tests?"

However since limited spots are available in the on campus version, I’m aware the MSCS is a lot more competitive. With my stats, should I even bother applying to the on campus?  
I went to a well known school. I got a 3.01 GPA with no upward trend in grades. My GRE scores were 96 percentile for verbal and 79th percentile for quantitative. I have three years experience as a data analyst and 1 short data science internship."

qxxu5b,4,2021-11-19,Deciding between two New Grad SWE offers -- TC or WLB?,nematodesArePeople,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qxxu5b/deciding_between_two_new_grad_swe_offers_tc_or_wlb/,"After lurking on CSCQ for a few years, I’m finally ready to share some content. I’m really grateful to be in this position, and would appreciate any advice or tips... what would you do?

I’m based in Toronto and have recently received two offers for New Grad SWE positions. I’m having a bit of trouble deciding between the two, but the biggest differences are **TC** and **WLB/WFH policies.** Currently leaning towards Offer B.


**Offer A:**
        
 - 110k Base Salary + 10k yearly bonus + 10% yearly performance bonus
 - 10k signing bonus
 - WFH policy is 2 days at home, 3 days in the office 
 - 15 Days PTO
 - Poor (?) work life balance. Overtime occasionally, on-call exists, working on weekends less common but still happens. (This is what I’ve gathered from Glassdoor, so I’m not really sure how accurate it is)
 - Offer is a rotational new grad program, where you spend 1 year on one team, 1 year another
 - Primarily work with React and NodeJS
 - Company of 500+
 - Tech is not the company’s primary focus 
 - Hiring in Toronto but US-based company


**Offer B:**

 - 100k base salary + 15% in stock annually
 - Permanent WFH policy permitted
 - 15 days PTO + 1 week break for Christmas holidays
 - Good work life balance (almost no one works overtime apart from management)
    - I know this because I have interned here in the past, and no one ever answers my questions after 5PM~
 - Primarly work with Java
 - Company of 5000+
 - Tech company (enterprise software is the main focus)
 - Hiring in Toronto but US-based company


Offer A sounds attractive due to its higher TC, however I am not sure if it is worth sacrifcing the WLB and generous WFH policy afforded by Offer B. I feel like in the long run, Offer A is better for career growth (due to its rotational nature, meaning I get a lot of different experience). Also, I feel like being ""forced"" to go the office will help me develop better relationships and lead to more opportunities. 

Offer B is definitely the more comfortable option, due to its good WLB and good WFH policy. I'll also get to rejoin my old team, which had a supportive culture and boss. However, I feel like I may stagnate a bit with Offer B.

I'm currently leaning towards Offer B because I'm tired of the CS grind from uni and internships and I think that Offer B will help me re-focus into other parts of my life. Is this the right career choice? I feel like I might regret taking Offer B in the future because I might not get to learn as much. What would you do?"

***TL;DR:
HOW DO YOU QUANTIFY THE VALUE OF JOB SATISFACTION / ENJOYMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE JOB SEARCH? HOW MUCH OF A SALARY ""CUT"" FROM YOUR MARKET VALUE WOULD YOU TAKE TO WORK AT A PLACE YOU TRULY ENJOYED WORKING EVERY DAY OR EVEN LOOKED FORWARD TO GOING IN TO THE NEXT DAY?***




I would love to hear your thoughts on this. 

I'm making $15/hr as an intern right now but will be graduating soon and was thinking about how to properly compare hypothetical job offers.

I really enjoy what I'm doing right now and I'm about 6 months in so I think that's long enough to qualify as being past the ""honeymoon"" phase. All of my coworkers, managers/bosses are great people and great colleagues. 

What got me thinking was the thought that I'd probably rather stay making $15/hr and really enjoy the 50% of my waking hours than earn $100,000 and be miserable for those waking hours. Honestly, I'm not even sure how high that salary would have to be for me to accept being miserable for that large a chunk of my life. 

What it probably comes down to is what $ amount would you accept sucking up a miserable life for a short amount of time (2-4yrs) that you felt would *really* put yourself ahead financially for life in that short time span.

But these large salary differences aren't what happens in reality. It's unlikely you will be made an offer that is so life-changing financially and one that you can't find another offer close to elsewhere since we are hired on experience level. 

So is a 50% bump ($50k vs $75k) worth daily unhappiness? 

100% ($50,000 vs $100,000)?

is a 20% bump ($50k vs $60k) worth working a job you don't necessarily hate but don't enjoy?

Would love to hear your thoughts!"

qxzxw9,2,2021-11-20,Probably about to fired after 7 years in the same company,gdlk777,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/qxzxw9/probably_about_to_fired_after_7_years_in_the_same/,"So yeah, a little bit more than 7 years ago I started my internship in one company for a very little money. As the company grew, so did my career - during all those years I moved from internship through junior digital marketing specialist, specialist, and then expert to manager (over 2 years ago).   


Over this time I had some opportunities to change the job for something different but as it turned out over time all of these options would most likely be worse than staying at the company. I've reached the level where I make a decent amount of money and getting the same salary anywhere else might not be so easy.  


Now, due to legal regulations to this market sector, most likely all the people will be fired as running the business in matter of month won't have any chances to be profitable, so everyone expects that the company will be closed.  


I know that changing job should be something completely normal but still I'm a little bit panicking just thinking this will happen. That was my first serious job and after this much time the situation is just hard for me. Well, maybe I wouldn't be so much scared if it was just me, but I have wife and 2 fantastic kids (3 and 1), so the vision of me not being able to provide for them is just horrible. We have a mortgage and live in Europe where interest rates are increasing due to inflation and so does our mortgage instalment. And this is all not too optimistic.  


As for my skills and value on the market I think I'm really good in digital marketing (have proven successes and heard this from multiple people) and considering the fact that current go-online trend for everything because of coronavirus, I think that maybe this shouldn't be so hard for me...what do you think? Am I just overthinking this?  


PS. After firing me, the company should pay me for 3-5 months salary because of legal regulations on the market. Considering that we have very little savings as we just finished building a house, this should be a time for me to find something new."

* Electrical Engineering student taking all SWE/DS module at a top 10 University.
* Next year ( August 2022) I will be applying for graduate jobs. 
* So far I have done an internship at a start up (Software developer) and a large bank (Data consultant).
* I want to work in Data science - more specifically with Machine learning technical side of things.

  
**What offers I have on the table**

* This year I can do a 6 month internship and next August I will be applying to full time graduate jobs.
* So far, I have an internship offer from a HealthTech start up where my Job title is data scientist and essentially it will be a Machine learning job developing and training a new ML model (at least that is what they told me).

  
I have **done interviews with** the following companies:

* JP Morgan (SWE) - Went very badly - mostly Medium LC questions that I had little foundational understanding of.
* Roku (SWE) - Didn't go very well as they asked OOP questions on things I have not done.
* P&amp;G (Data science) - Went ok could get an offer if I perform well next 2 rounds.

I have **upcoming interviews** with the following companies:

* ARM (SWE) - CPU/SOC SWE job
* Large Defence company (SWE) - I don't want to work for a company that makes weapons but gonna do interview for experience.
* KING (Data science) - company that makes games e.g candy crush  


Given my previous interviewing experience probably going to fail these two but its good experience I guess - I need to brush up on fundamentals.  


**What is my question?**  
**Q1 Essentially - Would taking an internship at a small company hurt/decrease my chances when I am applying to DS roles at big companies next year?** When I was interviewing they kept asking about my job at the bank which honestly was just making PowerPoints as opposed to the start up where I did the most work which is worrying.

**Q2:** Work with the small company seems to be very exciting - The DS guys there aren't from a CS background, some not even STEM - Pay is bad - Work experience/Learning wise seems great - Should I be worried/is this a good opportunity?"

I did an internship last year that involved a bit of full stack development, but of course, the code already had a solid foundation from professionals and didn't need any setup. I've also done a few websites on my own, but nothing to this extent.

I came across this opportunity in October. We met, and I, in complete beginner fashion, agreed to all of his requirements without really thinking about how much I didn't know (and how it would fit in with school). At first I was extremely skeptical about balancing it with school, but it seemed like a great learning opportunity. Without going into too much detail, it's a completely full stack glorified CRUD application that works with a lot of data from external APIS. We agreed that the hard deadline for this project would be December 20th. Apparently he **absolutely needs it by then**.

I have less than a month left before the deadline, and the more I learn, the more I realize I won't be able to finish in time. Even if I do manage to finish, the amount of shortcuts and features that I would have to cut would be enormous.

Thinking about this situation sucks. It's drawing up significantly more time than I first predicted, to the point where I'm getting paid less than minimum wage considering the lump sum payment we agreed upon (also a rookie mistake, I know). I'm tempted to ask for an extension considering the situation I'm in, but the hard deadline worries me., and I don't want to be the reason that their entire business idea is ruined. Has anyone else experienced this? What would you guys do in this situation?"

Warning- Long Post Ahead. Read at your own risk. Completely sfw. The op is not liable for any eye strain caused.

So as the title suggests, I am from India, born and brought up in Delhi. I am currently pursuing b.tech from a tier 3 college. Never had a knack for exams in general, but still performed above average in them and was(and still is) often counted among bright student or a student with lots of potential, even though I feel like an imposter listening to all that praise, because I know I didn't put much effort in clearing exams. I always had curiosity for science and technology and since the age of 10 when I got my first computer, I often browsed sights labeling scientific wonders and mysterious phenomenon of the world, and often tried to generate rational explanation for them with the bounds of my then knowledge. After growing up a little, I got interest in technology, especially consumer technology and wanted to start my own company that makes such consumer tech, like blackberry phone (believe it or not when people were getting crazy about iphones, I was crazy for blackberry and when lumia came I was crazy for it and even got myself a lumia 540. I always had this going against the trend mentality, even it ends up causing misfortune in the long run.) So, yeah I had a dream for making a company and Even created a logo, brand name and tagline for it. I was 12yrs old at that time. Some more growing up later, came 11th and 12th class and I chose PCMB, even though I didn't want to be a doctor. I got a lot of scorn for taking PCMB when mbbs was not in plans and for making my 1th and 12th difficult. Well as I wrote in the beginning I studied things for curiosity’s sake and never took exams seriously enough. I got 84.6 percent in 12th and was very happy because I scored highest in chemistry in which I never got much marks due to calculation mistakes in numericals. I got 92, even though in test papers I solved for preparation I never got above 50. So, after 12th my parents, especially my mother tried to coerce me to take medical, but as I stated earlier I didn't want to be a doctor at all. So, she got me admitted in fiitjee, to crack jee. Never got a knack for exams, so gave two attempts and flunked both with ranks akin to landline number. After giving two attempts, I was sitting at home not caring about the world at large and still in my go with the flow, do things at whim approach, when my home tutor called and asked about college scene. I replied in negative and he recommended to try for IP University. Again another exam another month of half hearted preparation, with surety in mind that another landline no. Is in destiny. When exam result came I somehow got 12001 rank, nothing to brag about, but enough to sit in counselling process. By this time my interest spread to industrial and manufacturing technology, and robotics. Now, I didn't know what will fulfil both of these curiosity and opted for b.tech in MECHANICAL AND AUTOMATION ENGINEERING. By combination of my rank and my Frankenstein choice of stream, I got a tier 3 college and hence started my college life, which ended after one and half semester due to riots and then pandemic. The lockdown sort of crushed aspiration and spirit and financial equilibrium of my home leading to very destructive scenarios. See, I come from a lower middle class moderately orthodox family, where domestic violence and verbal abuses was the norm and it's often caused by our unstable financial situation. My parents especially my mother had to sell every gold ornament to bring money for monthly expenditure. She never saw utility in wearing those and for her it's always was a financial asset. So, discord was the daily drama. Me and my sister was used to this and had are career planned in such a way so as to escape from home as soon as we become financially independent. Well, covid didn't took kindly to our plan and instead wreak havoc in all our lives by widening the fault lines of our home, by making the financial crunch unbearable. Long story short, my mother died due to covid and late treatment of it, due to unavailability of money and resources in the oxygen crunch delhi witnessed. She was just 47.

And before her death me and my mother had some pretty bad fight that lead to me punching her, which is wrong by every standard and something, I will be guilty of till the end of life.

My sister is 19 and she was devastated after hearing the news our mother's death. She still wake up crying at night remembering her. Me on the other hand never had a bond with my parents, for me they were nothing more than puppets of society dancing on its tune. So, I am completely alright neither sad nor its opposite. My father on the other hand now stays outside only and returns late at night. Nothing new here. So, in all there's not much changed, other than the fact that the house has become silent. We all three are now like unknown people trying to tolerate each other.

Many other things happened in this pandemic, which sort of made me suicidal. I am out of that phase now. If you want to know further click on the links below- Well, you are in treat to know why I didn't have bond with my parents, especially my mother.

So, my objective for writing this post is to ask for advice. See, I am kind of become indifferent to the world. I have stopped caring for anything as nothing is too important to care. My desire to start a company is all but vanished, having just little trinket here and there in my subconscious. I now want to earn just enough to have 1bhk flat, pay for electricity, water, groceries, high speed internet and could have restaurant dinning or pizza once a week. Nothing more, nothing less. I just now want to live peacefully while embracing epicureanism. I don't have any grand goals or ambition anymore. The problem is I am in 7th semester now and since 3rd semester till now, I didn't understood shit due to online mode. I was never able to learn anything of academic value from internet. Another factor is that I am a sort of slow learner and needs to like the teaching method of the teacher to be able to learn something. I need to be present in classroom to be able to learn something. An example of this limitation happened in first when I didn't understood one concept called k-maps and how to solve. I didn't understand the logic behind pair making in it and due to this left all questions regarding in all the exams of first semester. Cut to third semester, the topic was again the part of course and the teacher of the subject gave just a 15 minute explainer of what is k-map and how to solve it and I understood it immediately. She made the explanation so simple and explained the logic behind pair and quad making in such easy manner that I was able solve complex k-map related questions without any problems. Similar examples are littered all across my academic life and shows that I need that physical classroom and a connection with teacher to learn something. Unfortunately that wasn't available due to lockdown, because of which I didn't understood a thing.

I somehow was able to maintain my grades and have 8.2 cgpa till 6th semester. But skill wise I am just an empty tool box. I neither have workshop skill nor have technical skill nor have communication skill nor have any internship experience nor have any extra curricular achievement under my belt in my whole academic life till now. I tried to upskill myself by learning programming and autocad, from Coursera as our college partnered with it to provide free access to it's library of courses. Again that same issue arose, the need for classroom and connection with teacher, both of which are not an option in these online upskilling platform. I end up bricking my computer while learning programming and after that didn't try to learn anything online because it never worked and caused problem for other people in home who are depended on that single computer.

Now, placements are going on in campus and our college provided many venues of getting jobs. But most of the platforms our college partnered with mostly posts programming related jobs with no mention of mechanical jobs anywhere. And since I know nothing about programming, I don't feel like sitting in them. I am also inept in mechanical due to not able to learn anything during pandemic. Not able to learn autocad and other software due to learning issues caused by online medium and as such I feel like I won't be able to get any job.

I still want to enter in the field of robotics, mechatronics, industrial automation etc. But I don't have any relevant skill to enter any of these fields. As I mentioned earlier, I just want to earn enough to live modestly to be able to pay bills, have a 1bhk residence of my own in delhi, have outside dinning once a week and have job in these fields. That's it. Please provide advice regarding what can I do to achieve this mundane aspiration?

Please don't suggest govt jobs or upsc, because as I already mentioned I not too keen to give exams, especially if it's for being a servant of some nincompoop in kurta pajama. I am thinking of preparing for gate, but only after college gets over and if it would help me able to enter the above mentioned fields. Do provide your insight regarding this. I don't want to go abroad either for further studies or job. It's something I decided due to my chronic skin ailments that's been causing me problem for 10 years now and haven't been cured. My family is burdened with expense of the treatment of my ailment and I don't want to burden them further. Another reason is that my father is an idiot and doesn't know anything about education. My mother was the one who take care of our academics and now she's gone that responsibility is on me. I don't want my sister's academics to suffer and doe that I need to be here in her vicinity, so that my father's antic won't ruin it. So, please help this fellow engineer, If I could be called one."
qyevkt,2,2021-11-20,21yr old(going to be 22 coming feb) Indian male pursuing b.tech ranting and requesting recommendations and advice regarding what to do in future.,KINGYOMA,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/qyevkt/21yr_oldgoing_to_be_22_coming_feb_indian_male/," 

Warning- Long Post Ahead. Read at your own risk. Completely sfw. The op is not liable for any eye strain caused.

So as the title suggests, I am from India, born and brought up in Delhi. I am currently pursuing b.tech from a tier 3 college. Never had a knack for exams in general, but still performed above average in them and was(and still is) often counted among bright student or a student with lots of potential, even though I feel like an imposter listening to all that praise, because I know I didn't put much effort in clearing exams. I always had curiosity for science and technology and since the age of 10 when I got my first computer, I often browsed sights labeling scientific wonders and mysterious phenomenon of the world, and often tried to generate rational explanation for them with the bounds of my then knowledge. After growing up a little, I got interest in technology, especially consumer technology and wanted to start my own company that makes such consumer tech, like blackberry phone (believe it or not when people were getting crazy about iphones, I was crazy for blackberry and when lumia came I was crazy for it and even got myself a lumia 540. I always had this going against the trend mentality, even it ends up causing misfortune in the long run.) So, yeah I had a dream for making a company and Even created a logo, brand name and tagline for it. I was 12yrs old at that time. Some more growing up later, came 11th and 12th class and I chose PCMB, even though I didn't want to be a doctor. I got a lot of scorn for taking PCMB when mbbs was not in plans and for making my 1th and 12th difficult. Well as I wrote in the beginning I studied things for curiosity’s sake and never took exams seriously enough. I got 84.6 percent in 12th and was very happy because I scored highest in chemistry in which I never got much marks due to calculation mistakes in numericals. I got 92, even though in test papers I solved for preparation I never got above 50. So, after 12th my parents, especially my mother tried to coerce me to take medical, but as I stated earlier I didn't want to be a doctor at all. So, she got me admitted in fiitjee, to crack jee. Never got a knack for exams, so gave two attempts and flunked both with ranks akin to landline number. After giving two attempts, I was sitting at home not caring about the world at large and still in my go with the flow, do things at whim approach, when my home tutor called and asked about college scene. I replied in negative and he recommended to try for IP University. Again another exam another month of half hearted preparation, with surety in mind that another landline no. Is in destiny. When exam result came I somehow got 12001 rank, nothing to brag about, but enough to sit in counselling process. By this time my interest spread to industrial and manufacturing technology, and robotics. Now, I didn't know what will fulfil both of these curiosity and opted for b.tech in MECHANICAL AND AUTOMATION ENGINEERING. By combination of my rank and my Frankenstein choice of stream, I got a tier 3 college and hence started my college life, which ended after one and half semester due to riots and then pandemic. The lockdown sort of crushed aspiration and spirit and financial equilibrium of my home leading to very destructive scenarios. See, I come from a lower middle class moderately orthodox family, where domestic violence and verbal abuses was the norm and it's often caused by our unstable financial situation. My parents especially my mother had to sell every gold ornament to bring money for monthly expenditure. She never saw utility in wearing those and for her it's always was a financial asset. So, discord was the daily drama. Me and my sister was used to this and had are career planned in such a way so as to escape from home as soon as we become financially independent. Well, covid didn't took kindly to our plan and instead wreak havoc in all our lives by widening the fault lines of our home, by making the financial crunch unbearable. Long story short, my mother died due to covid and late treatment of it, due to unavailability of money and resources in the oxygen crunch delhi witnessed. She was just 47.

And before her death me and my mother had some pretty bad fight that lead to me punching her, which is wrong by every standard and something, I will be guilty of till the end of life.

My sister is 19 and she was devastated after hearing the news our mother's death. She still wake up crying at night remembering her. Me on the other hand never had a bond with my parents, for me they were nothing more than puppets of society dancing on its tune. So, I am completely alright neither sad nor its opposite. My father on the other hand now stays outside only and returns late at night. Nothing new here. So, in all there's not much changed, other than the fact that the house has become silent. We all three are now like unknown people trying to tolerate each other.

Many other things happened in this pandemic, which sort of made me suicidal. I am out of that phase now. If you want to know further click on the links below- Well, you are in treat to know why I didn't have bond with my parents, especially my mother.

I am an undergrad student in the robotics field (engineering + software)

What should I choose between them if I get offers from both NASA JPL and a rapidly growing startup company? 

I know JPL is the place where many smart people come and where I can learn a lot from the project that I am not able to do in other places. Also, I think I can learn much more in the startup if the company has great leaders and teams. I can see the company expanding their business and hiring more people right now and getting much investment.  I'd say both are great places to me.

my current worry is this. One of the positions from JPL that I applied for was what I've really wanted to join for a few more years. however; I heard that JPL is slow in the hiring process and I would end up hearing the response from them like next year January, or February, or later. What should I do if I get an offer from the startup while waiting for the JPL's interview? Should I ask if they can give me more time? (I think this not possible) Should I tell them politely I'd like to switch my internship to another organization later (when I get accepted from JPL)? 

thanks."

I am going to have an OCI interview next monday and wonder how's the process will be like?

I heard it is 

1. phone interview (behavirol)
2. techincal interview 
3. two back to back techincal interview

Should I expect them to ask LC style questions or other stuff such as OOP related questions?

Also, I applied to oracle oci for just normal swe intern and sophomore for both and not sure which interview I got. Do they have a different process??

I could not find a lot of information of it so I would appreciate if you guys can share any info for me :)

Current salary is $70k CAD, up from $45k CAD at my previous place (I unfortunately didn't think to ask for more back then).

Quite a few times they have both praised me on my work, and made it very clear that I am due for a raise by the year end (and possibly a promotion). I originally started out doing backend work but then transitioned to mobile after some time so a title change is also due. The question I have is, what should I be asking for? I'm kind of shy and don't really feel comfortable talking about money, any advice? Don't want to seem greedy, but I don't want to undervalue myself either.

qylzhd,7,2021-11-20,Story and question regarding N+,AlexChedis,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/qylzhd/story_and_question_regarding_n/," 

My cautionary tale: I am a 6 year IT professional that went to trade school for Cisco Network systems in high school(Currently 24). Unfortunately due to my young ignorance I did NOT pursue my CYSA, CCNA, and Network+ training during those two years of my life. I was top of my class, finished my bi-yearly course work in just a couple months. Went to intern for my school and learned the network cable tech life; rewiring the entire school in a single summer. I learned how to terminate MMF, and all the beauty of rewiring a network panel.

However, due to me not chasing the certs or going to college this caused me to pay for it big time now as I have hit the wall in my career. I have worked for 4 companies. Starting at $13 an hour (service desk Tech) and moving my way up into leadership and jumping ship to another company for more money. I am current at $25 an hour being a PowerShell engineer - Dell Tech for a company that just informed me that in January my position will be eliminated due to budget obligations to our parent company. 15 people are being termed like this.

I found this news out Yesterday. I was shattered as I never have been terminated against my will before. Which sent a shock through my system and kick started that drive to never be in this position again.

Not to worry; I Have contacted various recruiting companies and applied to various positions I will most likely have a new job within a couple weeks. Good thing my area's IT demand is plasma hot!

But Something told me to go bigger and get out from the thumb of corporate tyranny!

Last Night: I opened the free practice exams for network+ ; out of 75 questions I scored 63/75(84%) which I feel is great but I also feel like not much was ""covered"" by looking at my old 900 page network+ textbook. Seems to me that they just grabbed sequential questions from the requirements and lined them up back to back(things like putting POP3 and IMAP in 4 questions back to back).

So I popped open Udemy where I bought the entire Comptia training suite for a friend to get into IT ( which they never even attempted ugh) and popped it on 1.5x speed for Jason Dion and cracked through most of it in a single day. I retook the test and scored a 93% on his practice exam.

Luckily I retain a massive amount of info if provided just due to my experience grinding through an entire domain structure in a week at my first company.

Advise request:

I am requesting advise now that you basically know my entire back store for the last 8 years of my life. I am seeking to get my Network+ cert in December and getting a role as a Network Analyst somewhere. Given my story what would the chances of me getting my cert be since I haven't gotten a single one in my life. This is my only concern is failing on the first attempt due to unexpected questions/labs. I feel that I was ready from the start just needed to brush up on my ports and acronyms. Any advise would be great thanks!"

Context: HS junior, planning to apply for CS major; college list not fixed yet. I have two ideas for the Common App essay:

* Writing about sailing (a hobby for \~3 years)
   * My parents think this is good (and very very good). They think this is a topic that can show my ""preserverence, hardworking, dedication"" and whatsoever.
   * I personally do not have a passion in this. I do sailing from time to time, but in no way super enthusiastic. I'm not into sports.
   * I currently have a draft on this; I wrote how I overcame the fear of drowning (and being in the water in general) through sailing, which I'm presume matches the theme of ""overcoming hardship"".
   * Anonymous peer-reviews mostly say it is OK and I did a good job in putting emotions into it. But certain emotions are actually exaggerated and I'm kind of uncomfortable about that.
* Writing about me being trans and my passion of softwares and programming (both of which has a looong span of \~6 yrs), and the connections between them
   * By no means do I intend to make my essay some kind of politically-correct nonsense. We all know that is an incredibly bad idea.
   * With that said, being trans is an integral part of my living experience with certain touching moments.
   * And (not sure if by coincidence) that was intertwined with my passion in tech:
      * My ""transness"" made me isolated in middle school and that gave me the chance to spend lots of time with computers and programming;
      * Coping with depressive moods often by learning about programming and other CS theories;
      * It is a stark contrast when I got my first internship in tech and my new colleagues really *don't misgender me,* compared to when I was misgendered at school all the time.
   * But this series of events and depictions of mental statuses are way harder to word than simply writing about sailing.
      * If I write too much about tech, the essay becomes very dry and boring;
      * If I write too much about my mood, the essay becomes some kind of sad rant;
      * If I did not manage to link the events well, the essay will feel scattered and mushy without a clear timeline.
   * My parents are mildly (?) transphobic and they certainly won't like me to write on this topic. If I intend they won't refuse; but they won't give any good words to it.

I'm still in junior year by now so there should be enough time for me to consider and switch between topics. But still I'd like to see your takes and suggestions on this: should I choose a topic I'm not particularly interested in (and not very related to the major), but easier to write a good (with some definition of ""good"") essay about; or a topic I'm really passionate about and relevant to the major, but harder to compose overall?"

I’m currently going to a state school. I was suppose to graduate next semester (spr 2022). I am a triple major in CS, Data Science, and Health Science. I am now scheduled for fall 2023.

However, I made some choices over the summer. Reasons why I am graduating late: 

- I originally came in as a bio major. Took me until sophomore year to switch.

- Complete a CS degree (only need to finish 9 more classes for a BA) Lots of my CS classes were cross-listed with my DS courses. Also unsure of which tech field I want to get into.

- Scholarship will be able to cover my 5th year. I currently have no student loans. I want to keep it this way. I originally wanted to finish my undergrad then go to grad school for masters in CS, but realized it’s not financially smart &amp; I’d still have to take the same intro classes. 

- More time to do internships

I’m grateful to be in a position where I am. But I’m still unsure if I’ve made the right choice. Been feeling kinda insecure and all these Linkedin posts about how my connections are getting full time jobs before they graduate. It’s so hard not to compare yourself to others. Plus I’ll be 24 when I finish.

I mean my question is: 
- Did you graduate late too? 
- How did this effect your job search?"

It gave me so much motivation and allowed me to focus, but it made my social skills very bad and I had very bad social anxiety for an entire year. I don’t know why. So, I stopped taking the medication in June and decided to deal with life without medication. Well, all of my life plans have changed. I went from being an A+ student down to a C+ student this year. I haven’t studied at all. I hate what I’m studying all of a sudden, and I’m just trying to finish my degree. I don’t want to be a doctor anymore. I wanted to do research on a topic I was very passionate on this year when I was on vyvanse, and now I don’t. I wanted an internship next year, but now I don’t care. I’ve been spending money recklessly. My credit score has gone down. I don’t know what to do anymore.

EDIT: thank-you everybody for the responses! I spent the time going through many of the comments, and it encouraged me to go talk to my family doctor. My family doctor gave me a prescription for Strattera as this was a drug I have not tried. If I don’t see results or experience the same side effects, I will go back on Vyvanse and pair it with another anti-anxiety medication. In addition, I will book an appointment with my former ADHD coach. Your responses were very helpful and allowed me to alleviate some of the stress I’ve been experiencing."

Hence I’m here asking for advice on education routes that I can take after O’s that’ll open the most doors for me in the future. Any and all advice is welcomed and appreciated, thank you!

For the record, I’m leaning towards taking the JC route, because I feel that taking the poly route when I don‘t know for sure what I want to do is really risk. However, I very strongly feel that the poly route would suit me better because I hate the academic grind and I despise memorising lots of content :”””” I’m better suited for consistent hands-on work doing projects and all than consistent mugging for tests because I’m a huge procrastinator when it comes to studying. Plus, poly also provides internship opportunities and work experience, which is important for me because I’m not intending on getting a job this holiday.

Here are some details:

\- My current subject combination is English, normal Chinese, pure Physics and Pure Chemistry, A and E Math, Pure History and SSLit. Grades are okay, can maintain L1R5 &lt; 10 for internal exams in an also okay school

\- Dislike physics but am doing fine for it (B3-A1 depending), have a preference for English, Chemistry, A and E Math

\- If I were to go to JC, I’d definitely take H2 Chem and H2 Math, but am unsure of the other 2 subjects. I was considering computing, but my ideal school doesn’t offer it :””””( (I have zero experience and knowledge in coding or programming, but it does interest me, any advice?)

Seniors who were in the same position as me, any advice with respect to the JC vs Poly debate for someone in my position? JC is the better route for me since I‘ve no idea what I want to do, but I feel that I’ll be miserable in JC HAHA :&lt; Additionally, do y’all have any recommendations for JC subject combis that’ll open the most doors for me in terms of career paths? I apologise for the long and kinda convoluted post, again, any advice is welcomed and appreciated, thank you!"

I spent an internship this past summer doing a job that was pretty much half and half, developing a web app and doing some Systems Analyst work in the backend. I feel that I didn't _hate_ the backend work, but I definitely enjoyed the front-end more.

This Systems Analyst job has much better benefits, pay, and location, but is it still worth it if I'm not passionate about it? I also feel like if I start off in Systems Analyst and don't like it, it will be much harder to find work in a Software Engineering position later on.

Any thoughts or advice would be much appreciated"

Found this randomly and thought it was pretty interesting to see how things have changed since 5 years ago

Some notable changes:

\- 7 question debugging OA -&gt; 2 part technical + work sim OA

\- salary $6k -&gt;$8.5k (!!), a 40% increase in 5 years! (cumulative inflation since 2016 was 15%)

\- \~2,000 -&gt; 10,000 interns (2021 class size)

Some things stay the same too it seems:

&gt;Thank you! Just looking at the front page I'd swear more than half this sub are prospective Amazon interns.

Wonder how things will continue to change in the SWE/intern landscape as even more time passes!"

Thanks so much!"

Then I suddenly got responses from Facebook and Google asking for interviews, fast-forward a few weeks, I am in the late stages of interviews with them, which is obviously exciting, but it's very nerve-racking because I literally have zero backup plans because nobody, even small companies, asked to interview me.

This makes no sense to me, it's like having Harvard and MIT tell you that you are very close to getting in, but then you can't get into any state schools, anybody has experience with this? Does anybody know why this might happen? Any tips?"

This is my first job ever, and I feel like it takes me 10x as long as anyone else to do even basic tasks. I know nothing about even basic points of work like having a clean commit history. I've not worked much with this language and especially not this tech stack before, even though it's not at all obscure. 

It's been 3 weeks since I started, and I still literally write once every hour to my ""mentor"" on slack, asking for help or clarification. I feel like I'm drowning. Is this normal? What can I do to not be so helpless all the time?"

It’s not that I don’t have persons who care about me around me it’s just that nobody understands me.

A bit of background:

I am 26 years old and finished my master’s degree in Business Administration. Since I’ve been 18 years old I’ve been doing summer jobs and during the academic year, I dedicated myself to studying.

After finishing my masterer’s degree I did an internship at a well-known energy drink company. After finishing my internship I wanted to start my own business offering marketing services to different clients.

Even though I managed to get a few of them it wasn’t enough to pay all my bills. All my friends are getting jobs at companies. At this point also I started to look for a job but can’t get one.

It really started to affect my psychological health and don’t know what to do… what is the right thing to do… how to tackle this… I feel hopeless and it really starting to affect my mental health a lot.

If you know how an entrepreneur mindseted person should tackle all this struggle or if you have any advice on how to get through this let me know &lt;3

Hope not a lot of people is struggling like this but if you are please know you are not the only one :)

P.s. I am still pushing hard and if you are in need of any marketing service slide in DM and we will see if we are the right fit:)"

    * Salary: $9350 per month pre tax (NYC total income tax will be like 33% lmao)

    * Rent Stipend: $2425 per month after tax

    * Location: NYC




**I was not in US during interview process but this is the timeline in eastern time:**

Friday, July 16, 2:16AM - submitted application

Thursday, July 22, 4:09PM - got invited to 2 part OA (not 3 parts with debugging)

Monday, July 26, 5:42 AM - finished part 1 and part 2 of OA 

Friday, July 30, 2:52 AM - final interview scheduling invite

Wednesday, August 4, 2:19 PM - Another final interview scheduling invite lol

Thursday, August 5, 2:28 PM - final interview time confirmation

Monday, August 9, 4:00 PM - final interview

Wednesday, August 11, 3:00 PM - portal update to new location

Thursday, August 12, 2:38 PM - offer letter!


**Detailed explanation of interview process and prep:**

* Part 1 of OA was hacker rank coding assessment. I got full test cases for first problem, and half the test cases for second problem. In part 2 work simulation, I tried to answer every question using leadership principles. For example they repeatedly asked would I push the deadline to fully finish a project or would I finish the core parts by deadline. I always answered finish it by deadline because Amazon has notorious culture of tight deadlines.

* I got invited to schedule the interview on 7/30 and I selected the 8/2 monday and 8/3 tuesday timeslots. They didn't even confirm my interview selection and did not reply to me at all. After 8/3 passed, they finally got back to me on 8/4 wednesday and asked me to select new timeslots! 

* 2 years ago I made it to final round of amazon as well and I crammed like 50 most frequent Amazon questions on leetcode. They asked me an objected oriented design question which is so different from a normal leetcode algorithm question, I bombed it lol. Apparently the question they asked me was 70th most frequent amazon tagged question on leetcode so I almost got to it during my cram session 💀

* This year for prep I didn't do any Amazon tagged questions because I am also preparing for interviews with other companies. Past 3 months I did around 150 leetcode problems (mostly medium and some hard) in a depth first manner. Meaning I would do 10 two pointer questions, then 10 bfs questions, then 10 topological sort questions, etc. You want your brain to understand each pattern well and only focus on mastering that one pattern. Don't move back and forth between 20 different problem types. As bruce lee said, ""I fear a man who practiced one punch 100 times more than a man who practiced 100 different punches once. "" 

* My tip for doing leetcode: After doing a problem delete the whole code and code it again. Write down what mistake you made and what key thing you learned for each problem in a notebook. When you do a new leetcode problem, code it again from scratch the next day and one week from that day. Reviewing is probably more important than doing a new problem. 

* My tip for behavioral: Come up with 1-2 example per leadership principle and in your answer use STAR format. Also drop in some leadership principle words without making it obvious for example say ""I wanted to **satisfy the customer**"" or ""I took **ownership** of the project."" 

**My tips for coding interview:**

1. First ask questions to clarify everything like is there a null input, negative numbers, are we returning the length of an array or the actual array?, etc. 

2. Write down on the board or screen how you would do an example manually using pseudocode or plain english. 

3. Optimize pseudocode and explain time and space complexity.

4. Only at the very end, code your solution and test it using examples.


**Most important coding interview tip: Communicate!! During the entire coding question round, talk slowly and clearly. Never be silent for more than few seconds. Let the interviewer know everything you are thinking. Even if you are writing ""x = x+1"" say it out loud and explain why you are adding 1 to x.**"

qz6nhe,2,2021-11-21,.NET developer graduate program VS a master in Data Science.,jako3417,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/qz6nhe/net_developer_graduate_program_vs_a_master_in/,"I am graduating with a bachelors degree in Business administration and IT, in January 2022. My plan was to start a masters in Data Science summer 2022, as it is a field I have a great interest in. I've already taken electives in Data analysis and Data science, besides doing an internship for half a year. Here I was working with Data analysis for approximately half of the internship period. Then the following happened:

Approximately two months ago I got recommended this .NET developer graduate program. Instead of hiring candidates solely by their resume, applicants have to go through a process which is based on a C# multiple choice test followed by a case, and then at last an ordinary job interview.

Even though I had already laid plans for my future carrier, I couldn't see the harm in not applying for the program, as the more doors you have open the better, right?

So I applied for this program, and got through both the multiple choice test and the programming case, and to be fair, I was a little surprised that I passed the case. The next step is the interview, which is on Friday, and if I pass this I am eligible for doing the graduate program. The program contains a three months C# course which is paid, and I would get 2.430$ a month. This would be followed by a one year trial period in a company, where I would be paid 4.555$ a month. After the one year trial, I would be hired on a ""real"" contract by the company (This is not certain, as the company is not obligated to hire graduates, but I've been told that in like 95% of the cases they do), which means my salary would most likely increase. All though this sounds interesting, and I think the salary is descent, it just leave me with a lot of doubts.

Should I take this offer (If they let me through in the interview), or should I follow my initial plan which would be the Masters in Data science. A field that I have already some experience in, and something that i find more interesting. Another thing is that my starting salary would be higher with a masters However taking the masters would mean I would firstly graduate in the summer of 2024. Two years where I would get paid and get experience as a .NET developer, if i go that route. It should be said however, that I live in Denmark (I am Danish), and therefore university education is free. So I wouldn't get myself into more student debt, by taking a masters. This is a tough one, what do you guys think?"

Last year I was looking for internships in 6^(th) grade and wanted to intern at Google. A lot of people told me that it was too late to get an internship in 6^(th) grade and I should have started earlier. I was very discouraged. However, someone told me to apply to Amazon. I applied to Amazon and was asked a few questions such as print ""hello world"" and what is a computer. After those two questions, I was given the internship! Even though Amazon is less prestigious than Google, I am excited to start my journey there and one day work for the big Google."

After 11 days I got a rejection, So I am very sad losing it and every day I wonder why i got rejected although I saw posts say that they didn't pass all test cases.

qz85cu,2,2021-11-21,"Hi everyone, cancer survivor trying to get back into the engineering field. Details in post.",Arcee26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/qz85cu/hi_everyone_cancer_survivor_trying_to_get_back/,"Hi everyone, this is my first post here and thanks in advance for reading. I'd like to provide some more info about myself to explain my question better, and apologize for the length of my post.

I'm 31F, and had two bouts of Stage IV cancer in 2012 and 2014. Amidst that, I was able to get my Industrial Engineering degree and graduate in 2016, even though it took me extra time (I started college right out of high school in 2009). However, as soon as I graduated, my body had had enough. It had taken a beating and I'd been working an internship, followed by a couple of jobs, all while trying to get my degree, and to be honest I physically and emotionally couldn't take the stress of a job where I was criticized by things out of my control (I have a feeding tube from cancer treatment which I will have for life, and my speech wasn't as smooth but it has gotten much better), since it happened at every job I had and even at my internship. So, I made the tough decision to apply for disability and I was accepted. 

Over this time that I was on disability, I've relearned how to eat by mouth (although still get most of my nourishment via feeding tube), I found my significant other who is extremely supportive and currently solely taking care of our family (we have a two year old miracle son, since I was told I wouldn't be able to have kids, and a little miracle baby girl on the way) on a crappy income while he tries to go back to school for Computer Science. Meanwhile, here I am with an Industrial Engineering degree collecting dust on a shelf!

I really want to get back to working. Working from home, working at an office, doing both, I honestly couldn't care less as long as I am back to doing what I went to school and have a passion for. I am totally fine with entry level, especially since I don't have much experience under my belt as far as actual IE goes. In the past couple of years, I have tried to apply to IE jobs nearby, or even in other cities (we don't mind moving if we have to), but always came up with denial after denial, even after landing interviews, and to tell the truth, it kind of tanked my hopes of finding a job in my field. 

But I want to try again. I want to provide for my family and give my other half the opportunity to focus on school and do what he enjoys and has a passion for. He even told me he doesn't mind being a stay at home dad, but first I need to know my options:  
\-Has it been too long since I got my degree? Am I pretty much SOL?

I've considered going back to school for my masters, but I'd only try and do that if there's pretty much no way anyone would be willing to give me a chance to prove myself despite the break in my resume. I'll take any advice, opinions, and help - I would like an outsider's point of view on my situation. 

Thanks everyone!"

I didn’t put in my effort in actually practicing to code everyday since my freshman year. I am in my last sophomore year, Now I am relearning the concepts and coding with the help of my brother( before I was practicing  here and there since 2020)

I realize that I don’t really have much drive for coding, I am still learning in case I change my mind. 

In the meantime, in case I learned everything and what do an entry level job aside from programming or tasks involving heavy programming, what are some other jobs ( computer science related or not) that will be realistic for me to do entry level in the DMV area once I complete some internships and graduate ?"

I got recently diagnosed with ADHD and I am navigating how much I am willing to disclose in more official settings.   
I am curious whether you choose to disclose your ADHD when they ask for 'disabilities' on applications. What are your positive and negative experiences with disclosing your ADHD in official professional settings? Have you ever asked for accommodations?   


I know that there is the Disabilities Act companies are abiding by but I am curious to hear from people in big tech and finance whether this is also the case in practice. Do you feel it has harmed your chances to get a job or internship or that you were treated differently?

* 10	Careers in History and Geography. Courses offered and opportunities to work.
* 11	How to figure out what one wants from their career?Like I see a lot of students who want to do Engg or Medical and stuff and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that provided YOU are interested in the subject! I am a PCMB student and although I'm going to appear for JEE and probably NEET too next year I don't think my heart lies in either of those streams. And the thought of spending the rest of my life doing something I am not even interested in the first place, really disturbs me. But, again at this point I'm not sure what I actually want to do in life. So, yeah maybe I'm the only one but it would be of great great help if I could find a detailed article about this.
* 12	Everything you need to know to apply to foreign schools and how to estimate your chance of getting into one.
* 13	Why are JRFs forced to do a PhD?Is it just because the university wants save funds as it is cheaper to have a PhD candidate than a JRF? Or are there other motivations?

* 38	Scope of BDS course and books, instruments required in it.
* 39	BDS vs BAMS course, which one is better?
* 40	humanities courses in delhi university? Their scope? Course over college? How to maximize the experience?
* 41	CAT and general MBA advice. Like is MBA right for you, when is the right time to pursue it, what should be the expectations, what are the pros and cons.
* 42	Using various digital platforms and softwares to aid learning by visualization, active learning,using other blended learning techniques etc , especially for science students.For ex- There's desmos a graphing calculator and similarly geogebra for 3D calculator, geometry etc, these softwares can enhance student's math learning experience.Similarly there's molview for chemical compounds and bonding visualization which can enhance chemistry learning experience.Likewise there would be many such services/softwares and we should also make a list of them to help students learn better!

I'm 20 and in school, but I feel like I get stonewalled everywhere I go. I taught myself Linux, bash and Python (started a GitHub repo where I post the code I wrote to track my progress), started doing bug bounties to learn about security (found some cool stuff, but I'm far from being an expert), and got my Security+. Whenever I put my resume in (either for internships or part time support jobs) that I either need more expensive, should consider healthcare IT, or I just don't hear back at all. I feel like I'm doing what I can to educate myself, but I'm able to get my foot in the door. My question is to you guys: 

If you were a hiring manager, would being self-taught be a deterrent? And does putting my EMS experience down  on my resume make me a weaker candidate? Thanks!"
qzclzn,1,2021-11-21,How do I improve myself?,AP145,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/qzclzn/how_do_i_improve_myself/,"I have always considered myself to be a average or below average student. Even when I got good grades, I always figured it was because the material was too easy. The last time in which I could easily get good grades without effort was 7th grade. This statement alone should be proof of how stupid I am, because most people can get A's in high school itself without even trying. My parents were always pushing me to do STEM even though I honestly showed no ability in it at all.

When I went to university I entered as a computer science major, because it was the only thing in STEM that I felt I could have some ability in. Now, I find the concepts very interesting and I do well on exams, quizzes, anything ""theoretical"". The problem is that I am a slow, terrible programmer. Not only that, I seem to have an addiction to procrastination and distraction. Every semester I make a goal to not keep things for the last minute, and yet it always happens. It's almost as if I have no control over what I am doing. Since projects are such a huge part of CS courses, I don't do very well in them, grade wise. I have even had to repeat some classes due to failing them the first time.

All this means that I am not even sure if I will be able to graduate. I have never applied for an internship, which is basically a must for CS, because I will get rejected from every single one due to my terrible GPA. Now, the obvious solution to anybody reading this right now would be to change my major. The problem is that I am already in my third year of university, so it is too late for me to change my major. So now I am stuck. If only I started programming when I was small, then maybe I would have enough time to learn how to program properly and wouldn't be such a loser right now. 

I don't really see anything good happening in my life. As I mentioned earlier I have terrible grades and am always the dumbest person in the classroom. I have no social life, which obviously means I have no dating life. Not that anyone would want to date a loser like me. I am not athletic, artistic, or comedic in any way, shape, or form. I have never been a part of extracurricular clubs in university, because I have been too busy trying not to fail out of university. Is there any way I can succeed despite all my obvious and seemingly unfixable deficiencies?"
qzeiwd,43,2021-11-22,Mens ex machina,Lhomme_Baguette,HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/qzeiwd/mens_ex_machina/,"&gt; This is a sequel/continuation to [this story](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/qyn7fn/some_wounds_even_time_cannot_heal/), which I wrote the other day. Had a couple ideas knocking around for what actually happened to John, since I felt the first one flowed better with it left vague. Other things of note, John's inner dialogue is in italics, and the indented block quotes are anything that's from a perspective other than John's.

The first thing that went through John's head was: *Why is it so bright*? The optics were only supposed to give off around a hundred lumens; enough to leave a person blinking spots away in a dim room, but this... this felt like it was a thousand times brighter. The second thing he noticed was a sensation like falling upwards. Like the pit of his stomach had dropped but somehow gone the wrong way. Then the silence hit him. He realized that he couldn't even hear his own heartbeat, something that should be audible even if he were somehow in a vacuum but still alive.

*What was going on? Where was he?*

He wasn't sure how long he spent like that, but he started to become more and more aware of an entirely alien feeling in the back of his mind. It could almost be described as a mix of pins and needles mixed with TV static but more... blue.

*That makes no sense... How on earth could a feeling be blue?*

After an eternity, or maybe just an instant, John's vision began to return. But there was something wrong with it. It was almost like he was looking at an old CRT monitor too close. As he began trying to get his bearings, he realized that he couldn't feel, well... couldn't feel anything come to think of it.

*Something went wrong, that much is clear. But my math said if I was off by even a single Planck length then the anti-time field would convert everything within a dozen meters or so back into the primordial soup it once was, back at the dawn of the universe. So why can I think still?*

*Well, if the old adage ""I think therefore I am"" holds any meaning at all, then perhaps I'm not quite dead yet.*

Suddenly the image he wasn't seeing with his eyes shifted, and with the change in perspective he realized he was looking at a hallway. But it was off still. He was looking down from above, as though he were laid upside-down with his back flat on the ceiling.

*Am I looking through a camera?*

A man in overalls with a mop and bucket slowly began coming into view, dutifully mopping with the efficiency of a man who had done so a thousand times before. Not rushing, nor lagging; as though he knew down to the second how long this was going to take to do right and wasn't going to let himself miss a single spot.

*Only one man I know mops a floor like that... So at least I'm still in the lab. But why on earth am I seeing things through this camera? What have I done?*

It wasn't too long before John noticed some feeling beginning to return to him. Except return wasn't the right word exactly, as the sensation was foreign to him. The closest he could think of was the way it felt to hold a mouse, and the more he thought of it, the more it felt right. So he did the only thing he could think of: he clicked.

The sound of a mouse rang through his mind and the view shifted. Suddenly he was watching a middle-aged man in a lab coat lean over a table with something resembling a fish tank on it. A second later it hit him...

*Holy shit...* ***Is that me?***

&gt; In an IT room at the other end of the campus, a printer whirred to life and spat out a system crash log. Coulton the IT guy barely stirred. It was the new super computer; blasted thing wasn't even fully online yet and it was already spitting out errors like wild these past few days. He figured he'd get to it in the morning, right after his midnight coffee break and a quick nap. If he had bothered to read it, he would have noted a massive processing spike had left the base operating system with no resources to work with. By the time he got up, the system had already rebooted itself, and Coulton was more interested in the malfunctioning coffee machine than he was in reading the latest of a dozen crash reports that weren't really his job beyond handing them off to someone on the appropriate project once a week or so.

The image jumped, unbidden, to a different hallway than before, and he became aware that in the corner of his vision he could see a text readout displaying ""Camera_01"" as well as a timestamp. But according to the date, it was a week before his experiment had supposedly happened. He also felt a little less fuzzy than he had a moment ago, as though there were more of him here than before in spite of his apparent lack of a body.

*Either that date is wrong, or I'm actually before the experiment... Could it have worked partially and sent something of me back in time? I was working with anti-time after all, that would be a plausible explanation if it is actually the correct date. Still doesn't explain why I can't feel my body though... or why I seem to only be able to see through these cameras. I wonder if I can move them at all?*

Changing from one camera to the next had been like clicking a mouse in his mind, so John tried the first thing that came naturally. He tried thinking about moving a mouse laterally, but was met with no success.

*Maybe instead of thinking about doing it, I just need to remember what it felt like when using an actual mouse?*

The hallway he was looking at moved leftwards at a dizzying speed. In the past, he would've gotten motion sick, but apparently disorientation was going to be more abstract from now on. He wasn't able to see properly given how fast the imagery was changing, but he wasn't sick at least. He tried moving his 'mouse' the opposite way just a little, and the rotating image slowed down to a more tolerable pace. 

*There's Wallace again, but this is the complete other end of the building; Wallace never rushes, but somehow he's moved from one end of the building to the other in a few seconds... Did I pass out? Maybe it was when my view changed suddenly? I don't think I clicked, and afterwards I know I ended up on camera number one...*

After a while, boredom set in, and John tried amusing himself by clicking through the cameras available to him and seeing the whole facility from his novel perspective. He was given a moment of pause when he saw the four heads of the new super-computer project huddled around a printout looking highly concerned. Suddenly, as though aware he was being watched, the one he vaguely recalled was Henry Danielson turned and looked at the camera uncomfortably.

&gt; Henry had been feeling the hairs on his neck prickle all day. There was no consistent pattern, but it was like someone was watching him, off and on. He and his colleagues were poring over some of the latest crash reports from the new system, trying to figure out why the processing had been spiking at random, when he felt it yet again. The system was a series of distributed processing nodes, a single node going down shouldn't have been able to drag down the entire system but yet... The last eighty or so reports were all a cascade of errors that started with a single node spiking, overheating, and shutting down to save the hardware. When the first node would go offline, two more would try to pick up it's last instructions, only to meet the same critical error and repeat the process exponentially until the whole system had to reboot. Unfortunately, he was forced to read the instructions in assembly, as the system needed every bit of efficiency it was able to get; juggling both the computations to be done and the software that was responsible for node allocation was no easy feat. He decided one of the security staff had to be messing with him once more; every time he looked at a camera he seemed to catch it rotating away from him as though it were watching him moments before and was trying to avoid being caught. He was going to have to have a chat with Jeff again...

John decided to check in on his office again. He kept trying to find out how close he was to the experiment, but every time he caught a glimpse of himself, the camera would shift away. Now that he could see it, the timestamp was jumping forward by around 3 hours. Come to think about it, it took Wallace around 3 hours to do a single floor of the main hallway...

*Am I passing out whenever I see myself in a camera? I ought to try to figure out why. Every time I pass out I lose 3 hours, and that's 3 hours closer to the experiment. Would be nice to at least have a working theory of what happened by then. Let's see, I'll need a hypothesis first... I'm reasonably sure at this point I'm somehow in the past, watching my research campus through the security cameras. I can't feel my body, might not even have one, and every time I see the past version of me I seem to pass out and miss around 3 hours. Given the nature of anti-time, it's entirely possible the information that makes up my consciousness somehow got sent back in time. And given how the only things I can do at the moment are strongly reminiscent of movements on a computer, it would be reasonable to assume that that information somehow got stuck in one somewhere. Since I clearly have access to the campus security cameras, I must be connected to that system, but there's no way that the dinky little computer that runs the security server could ever hold so much data.*

&gt; ""It's spiking again! Something's different this time though; it's hovering around 75% and holding steady.""

&gt; ""It might be enough push it over, but try setting the system logger to output every single instruction as text to the printer. Might be worth a try to see what exactly it's trying to work out when it crashes.""

&gt; The printer started whirring. It only got through around two pages of logs before the system hit a memory full exception and crashed. But the printer queue was stored in the printer itself, and it was able to continue printing a decent amount of of the pre-crash instructions.

&gt; ""Well, it's a start. Dave, do us a favor and run to the store for some more of the good coffee, it looks like we're going to be up for a while. Oh, and grab a new brewer while you're at it, this old one's about had it. Get the nicest one they got and I'll put it down as this year's Christmas gift to the office so I can use that money to pay you back.""

The camera shifted once again.

*Blast it... if I really am in a computer then I must be in one with barely enough resources to keep me going. If I think too hard I crash, is that it? Not good for a guy like me, I get so lost in thought sometimes I could stare at the ceiling and miss hours. I'll have to keep tabs on it. Oh, duh... I bet I'm stuck in that new super computer they're working on. It's probably the only thing in this building with the kind of disk space required for this sort of thing anyways. I'm certainly not controlling the hardware directly, so there must be some kind of OS layer running here with me. Maybe I can snoop around and find some system logs?*

He changed cameras to the office where the super computer team was working. It felt mildly appropriate, given they were functionally on the same project now. He moved his mental mouse in a circle, the way he used to wake up his computer when it was asleep. If the team had been in the actual hardware room, they might have noticed the interface monitor flicker to life. He was greeted with a second view to the right of his camera view, not unlike using a dual monitor setup, the fancy kind he had never bothered with despite having more than enough grant money to spare for it. He figured his own login wasn't the best to use, given he wasn't supposed to be working on this project. He might be head researcher, but his non-computer self didn't need to be asked questions that he didn't have the answers to yet. Better to login with the root account, the one that all of the super computer team knew the password to. That way it'd look like one of them was checking the logs for the hundredth time, hopefully none of them would ever realize they weren't in the room at the time.

&gt; It was 0523 in the morning and not one of the team had slept yet. This crash seemed different than the others, and maybe, possibly, that was going to be what it took to figure out what exactly was going on. The others all seemed to involve a node running so hard it overheated and triggered the safety mechanisms to pass the instructions on and shutdown to cool off. Of course, what those exact instructions were, the team didn't know, though most likely they were recursive in nature. That would explain why trying to distribute the load was speeding up the crash instead of slowing or stopping it. It was an unfortunate necessity of the system's design, and was fundamentally unfixable, so they needed to figure out what started this exponential recursion and stop it from happening somehow.

&gt; ""Huh... Hey Henry, check this bit out. If I didn't know any better, I'd say the system had been backdoored somehow. But that's impossible, it's not connected to the internet.""

&gt; ""What makes you say that?""

&gt; ""Well, it looks like the only times the root account has been inactive almost perfectly coincide with the downtime from the crashes. It's like the system has been using itself...""

&gt; ""Give it here... And lay off the coffee, you're starting to sound nuts.""

&gt; Henry's frown deepened the longer he looked at these access logs. They weren't even the logs Dave was supposed to be going over. At some point he'd gone back down and printed out the login records. It sounded nuts, but it definitely looked as though Dave might be on to something. The root account had a login time that napkin math put at around 63%, and the total system uptime wasn't far ahead at 66%. It did seriously look as though the system had some kind of program on it that was launching at boot and immediately logging in as root.

&gt; ""Hey Dave... Run down to the interface monitor and see if it'll let you log in with root. If root is already logged in it ought to give you an error.""

&gt; Dave reappeared twenty minutes later, pale as a ghost and trembling as he held his phone out to the team. He had taken a picture of the error the system gave him when he tried to log in.

John had been too busy with what he was doing to notice that the team member who just left the office had turned right, towards the hardware room instead of towards the bathroom. Fortunately he had managed to tap into the motion sensors during his earlier explorations, so he had a split second's warning to log off the interface monitor before the door opened. But he was still faced with the unpleasant fact he had just discovered: the interface connected to the main super computer like a client to a server. He wasn't just running on the super computer, he was permanently logged in as root. As soon as the intern, whose name he fortunately remembered was Dave, tried to log in to the main system, his cover was going to be blown. He wasn't particularly trying to remain hidden, but becoming a lab rat wasn't exactly on his bucket list. He needed to somehow convince Dave that he was conscious beyond a reasonable doubt, so that they wouldn't just try hard-wiping the system's drives to get rid of him like they would a virus. 

He remembered back when he'd first met Dave, he accidentally waltzed in on the interview when he'd gone to ask Henry if he knew who had used the vacuum chamber last. The interview itself was over, and Henry was trying to get a feel for Dave; unlike a lot of research internships, this one was nearly guaranteed to turn into a permanent position if Dave worked out. Henry was in the middle of talking to Dave about what kinds of movies he liked when John had strolled in, forgetting to knock as usual. Dave had been too busy geeking out to notice John come in at first. His love of that particular movie would hopefully be enough to make sure he put it together, John's digital life most likely depended on it. So with what amounted to a smirk, he changed the error message for the ""user already logged in"" error. He just hoped it wouldn't work too well...

&gt; ""I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that."""

I'm an Indian student from a lower tier - 2 university with a bachelors in computer science. I'm very interested in pursuing masters in the same field.

CGPA : 8.45

Research Publications : 2 (scopus indexed journal ranked Q2)

Internship experience (throughout bachelors) : 12 months

Full time experience : 14 months (ongoing) at an MNC as an SDE

GRE : 331 (Quants : 166, Verbal : 165)

Toefl : 111

\-------------------

Here are my list of universities :

Ambitious :

1. UBC ( Canada )
2. UNC Chapel Hill
3. Univ of Wisconsin Madison

Moderate :

1. McGill ( Canada )
2. UMass
3. ASU

Safe :

1. MSU
2. Stony Brook

I know my CGPA is very average to get into those top tier universities and it was a single semester that messed up the overall when I had a severe health issue and I couldn't perform to the best of my abilities. The people at Govt universities wouldn't sympathize at any cost. All the other 7 sems have consistency in terms of grade points.

I think I've worked well on my SOP and I've got 3 strong LORs ( 1 each from the director and senior manager at my company and 1 from my univ professor under whom I did my research.

Kindly give me your honest opinions. The deadlines are ever so close. Thank you!"

They’re a powerful company and I am just one person. 

Back in 2016, I was an intern for this company while I was in college. I was in the last few weeks of my internship when a full time worker began sexually harassing me at work. I was twenty, had moved across the country for this job, and didn’t know what to do. So I just laughed it off. 

Come July 4th, 2016. Where I worked, this was one of the busiest days of the year. We are talking tens of thousands of people on property. I worked as a janitor so I had called out on the radio to see if anyone had extra cleaning supplies. The guy who had been sexually harassing me said that he did and to meet him in the supply closet. So I did. 

He threatened me and forced me to perform sexual acts on him once we were in the closet. I was scared. I didn’t know what to do. It happened and that’s all the details I will give. 

After that, I went back into the public area and vomited out of shock. I was immediately sent home. I then missed a few days of work because I was so depressed. When I finally went back, I was called to my boss’ office. I thought I was about to be fired so I confessed everything. An investigation began. 

I was asked questions like “why didn’t you scream?”  And the the question that haunts me:

“We’re you raped?”  


I said no. I didn’t fully understand what constitutes as rape. I thought assault was the right word. Now I know, I was raped. 

After this I was placed on administrative leave. I understood while the investigation took place. I lived in housing provided by the company at the time so I just stayed home and waited. 

Finally the meeting took place. I was fired for inappropriate workplace conduct. They said I consented to what happened to me. I had eleven days left until I went back home. I asked if I could stay in the housing for the last bit and they just gave me the number of a homeless shelter an said good luck. 

I was devastated. I wanted a future with this company. My dream job became a nightmare I couldn’t wake up from. 

I’ve since tried to repeal it and nothing. I even tried to get it amended that I was raped. Just for my own sanity. Radio silence. 

I’m putting this out here for two reasons. 1) the company deserves to be know for what it really is. 2) if there are other victims to know that you’re not alone. 

I don’t expect anything big to come from this but for my own sanity I needed to put it out there. Thanks for taking the time to read my story."

Hello everyone!

I know these might be a common question, but I have a unique scenario, so I needed some really solid advice. 

I am an Indian international student studying in a top 5 university in Canada. I major in Psychology and minor in Computer Science, presently in my fourth year.   
I began my degree in 2018 with BSc. Computer Science program. But due to mental health problems and family emergencies, I did very badly academically. I failed 4 courses in my first year and was put in a program called Fresh Start where I had to meet a GPA requirement for an academic year (Fall/Winter) and get back in my program. Originally, the Fresh Start was supposed to be from 2019-20, and I would have likely gotten back in 2020 Fall. However, due to the pandemic, my university decided to do a pass/fail in the Winter 2020 semester. Since there were no grades for the Winter semester, the university has postponed my evaluation for 2020-21. During this time, I had to isolate, stay alone in Canada away from my family, unable to travel back to India because of restrictions, and eventually, my mental health declined rapidly. Like a cherry on top, I had contracted COVID-19 as well. Eventually, I hit the rock bottom. I got completely burnt out and attempted suicide several times. I withdrew from the Winter semester entirely. 

I applied to the Arts faculty as a backup and got an admission despite my abysmal grades and performance. I also absolutely love Psychology and absolutely hate Computer Science. The only reason I chose a CS minor is that it will get me jobs. As an international student, I want to immigrate to Canada and get a Permanent Residence. Doing a CS job will make it easier as it is a Level 0 profession. Also, there is a lot of pressure to do a CS job as many are making a bank and I feel like I'll fall behind in life. Also, I feel Psychology majors and Psychologists get a lot of hate and ridicule. 

Now, I have several questions regarding job search and about the industry:

1. I am taking 5 years to complete my degree instead of the traditional 4. Does that negatively affect my resume?
2. Do I absolutely need an internship? I have many courses to complete so I might spend the summer studying. There would be no time to do an internship, or I would have to extend my degree even more. 
3. What can I do to compensate for a lack of internship? 
4. Do I need to submit my transcript? As of now, my grades are the worst. But I can definitely promise an upward trend, as I am at a much better stage mentally and doing courses I absolutely love. But those courses might not get jobs are they are in Psychology. Although, the statistics emphasis can be very useful.
5. I don't like coding much, but I like building algorithms a little bit. I am considering Data Science and Cyber Security. Are these programming-heavy fields?
6. Most stories I hear about corporate jobs, especially in CS are about burnout. How bad is it? I am recovering from burnout, and I really cannot do that again. I can take a good amount of work, but I hear horror stories of horrible bosses wanting you to take more than you can/want. How true is this? Especially in the Canadian environment. 

Note: I request mods to tell me if there are any changes that you require. I need the advice and am desperate for it."

But those courses might not get jobs are they are in Psychology. Although, the statistics emphasis can be very useful.
5. I don't like coding much, but I like building algorithms a little bit. I am considering Data Science and Cyber Security. Are these programming-heavy fields?
6. Most stories I hear about corporate jobs, especially in CS are about burnout. How bad is it? I am recovering from burnout, and I really cannot do that again. I can take a good amount of work, but I hear horror stories of horrible bosses wanting you to take more than you can/want. How true is this? Especially in the Canadian environment.

Note: I request mods to tell me if there are any changes that you require. I need the advice and am desperate for it."
qzmrys,199,2021-11-22,Before you post - read this.,apfejes,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/qzmrys/before_you_post_read_this/,"Before you post to this subreddit, we strongly encourage you to [check out the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/wiki/index).

Questions like, ""**How do I become a bioinformatician?**"", ""**what programming language should I learn**?"" and ""**Do I need a PhD**?"" are all answered there - along with many more relevant questions.  If your question duplicates something in the FAQ, it will be removed.

If you still have a question, please check if it is one of the following.  If it is, please don't post it.

# What laptop should I buy?

Actually, it doesn't matter.  Most people use their laptop to develop code, and any heavy lifting will be done on a server or on the cloud.  Please talk to your peers in your lab about how they develop and run code, as they likely already have a solid workflow.

# What courses should I take?

We can't answer this for you - no one knows what skills you'll need in the future, and we can't tell you where your career will go.    There's no such thing as ""taking the wrong course"" - you're just learning a skill you may or may not put to use, and only you can control the twists and turns your path will follow.

# Am I competitive for a given academic program?

There is no way we can tell you that - the only way to find out is to apply.  So... go apply.  If we say Yes, there's still no way to know if you'll get in.  If we say no, then you might not apply and you'll miss out on some great advisor thinking your skill set is the perfect fit for their lab.   Stop asking, and try to get in!  (good luck with your application, btw.)

# Can I intern with you?

I have, myself, hired an intern from reddit - but it wasn't because they posted that they were looking for a position.  It was because they responded to a post where I announced I was looking for an intern.  This subreddit isn't the place to advertise yourself.  There are literally hundreds of students looking for internships for every open position, and they just clog up the community.

# Please rank grad schools/universities for me!

Hey, we get it - you want us to tell you where you'll get the best education.  However, that's not how it works.  Grad school depends more on who your supervisor is than the name of the university.  While that may not be how it goes for an MBA, it definitely is for Bioinformatics.  We really can't tell you which university is better, because there's no ""better"".  Pick the lab in which you want to study and where you'll get the best support.

If you're an undergrad, then it really isn't a bid deal which university you pick.  Bioinformatics usually requires a masters or PhD to be successful in the field.  See both [the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/wiki/index), as well as what is written above.

# How do I get a job in Bioinformatics?

If you're asking this, you haven't yet checked out our three part series in the side bar:

* [part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/7ozqau/hiring_for_bioinformatics_part_1/)
* [part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/7pglon/hiring_for_bioinformatics_part_2/)
* [part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/7pxkqi/hiring_for_bioinformatics_part_3/)

# What should I do?

Actually, these questions are generally ok - but only if you give enough information to make it worthwhile.   No one is in your shoes, and no one can help you if you haven't given enough background to explain your situation.  Posts without sufficient background information in them will be removed.

# Help Me!

If you're looking for help, make sure your title reflects the question you're asking for help on.  You won't get the right people looking, and the only person who clicks on random posts with un-related topic are the mods... so that we can remove them."

When compared to other people I don't seem to be impressive."
qzoo5n,1,2021-11-22,Do you think it's time I move on from my company?,Crazypete3,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qzoo5n/do_you_think_its_time_i_move_on_from_my_company/,"For the past few months I have felt like things have been very stale. My skillset doesn't seem to be improving anymore and I am doing the same things for each ticket/feature I implement. I do learn things here and there but I feel like I'm not improving like I use too(used too or use too? idk). It could be because lack of ambition, I'm always exhausted when I go to work and feel lazy or distracted a lot lately. It could be because I'm not in a challenging work environment anymore, which sounds annoying because I hate the stress of a learning curve but maybe that's what I need inside, it's made me feel better. I still feel like an ant compared to my senior coworkers, so there are still bountiful of knowledge I could still learn.

People have told me for my skillset my pay is on the lower end, and I kind of always imagined getting out of school itself I'd be a lot higher. Right not my base pay is around 59k. I have a bachelors in computer science and minor in mathematics (nobody gives a shit about minors lol). I have a year and 3 months worth of internship, and 2 years this upcoming February of full time experience. I work in the .Net area mostly on web applications for different industries. I've used both React(internship) and Angular(current). I live in an medium COL area so I'm making just enough to live comfortable while swatting away debt collectors here and there and not saving for retirement. 

Maybe it's not just work, I feel like lately my life has been wake up, go to work, play videos, hug my wife, go to bed. Maybe I need more than just a job change but a life change, I don't know. I always imagined when I'd get out of school I'd go work a Google or somewhere science cutting edge/AI thing or maybe the FBI/CIA and make a difference. I still love the field of software dev and I'm still young and no kids, so I have potential to make drastic changes. I don't know. I feel like I'm just writing this post to myself convincing that I should truly look for greener meadows despite them not always existing.

What do you think?"
qzp39l,0,2021-11-22,All in Hindsight,cozypetrichor,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/qzp39l/all_in_hindsight/,"Anyone who is planning on running Windows for university, full-stop, just don't.

I'm not saying go for MacOS, because Apple is unethical as all hell, but Windows is a nightmare.

Back when I was a freshman, I made the mistake of upgrading my late 2009 iMac for a Surface Book 2. Don't do that. Just don't. Especially, stay away from Microsoft's Surface line.

This thing is having driver problems like nuts, and I can't fix them in admin with the machine on. Having to power on and off isn't so bad, except when I have about 50 tabs open per browser that I don't want to lose. Additionally, trying to install Ruby? A nightmare.

I can't risk booting Manjaro on it because the hardware's funky as hell. I could technically get a new computer, but that's just expensive and wasteful, so I'll keep using it until I cannot anymore. Ruby install on the macbook my internship is allowing me to borrow is enough for now, but that ends soon.

Do yourself a favor, and don't go for the Surface line."

qzpqip,3,2021-11-22,Go into the trades or a top university? What would you do in my situation...,WorldlinessCrazy2324,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/qzpqip/go_into_the_trades_or_a_top_university_what_would/,"So I am a 17 year old in my senior year of high school and am faced with a dilemma about what to do after graduation...

a) Go into the trades (probably plumbing)

b) Attend a fairly prestigious university in Canada majoring in computer science

Now I know that for most people the obvious choice would be B, but I'm not most people.

My goal in life is entrepreneurship, it is what I will feel the happiest doing. And it gets me towards my life goals of wealth and impact that no job can do.

My thoughts on the differences between these two pathways is that if I go into the trades I'd be in the workforce next year, and that would mean that I would have the funds and time after work to work towards my vision. Whereas if I chose computer science, I'd be busy with schoolwork, internships, etc.

What this means for me is that with the trades I would be able to go through the school of hard knocks, start experiencing failure, learning from my mistakes right after school. Rather than having to wait until graduation and some time after it while I pay off my debt.

And for those of you that might say university will be worth it ""for the experience,"" I'm not too interested in that, and would rather make the sacrifices today so that I don't have to sacrifice in the future.

Another benefit of going the trades route vs. the university route is I'd stay hungry, and it'd help me burn the boats. Because if I go into CS and work hard I'd be well on my way to a cushy developer job with added responsibilities as times goes on making it harder to jump ship.

Would love to hear your thoughts on it, and what you may do in my position. The reason I am posting this here is because I want to hear my fellow entrepreneurs thoughts. If I asked this anywhere else, I'd get laughed down for even considering this and be encouraged to go into university so that I can have a backup plan. Cheers!"

Any tips?,cramersCoke,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qzrm8z/looking_to_shift_focus_to_data_engineering_any/,"Hey everyone, I have been working over a year now as a Full-Time employee and I have about two years of internship experience as well. I currently work for a Consulting firm, so I am able to dive into various Tech-related projects as I please, especially early in my career. 

The reason why I decided to learn to code and pursue tech was to become a full-stack dev. But, the work I have been given at my internship &amp; current role, has been pretty focused on Data Engineering. The team I am on is currently doing a major Cloud migration for an Client. 

We have some Devs on the project who are skilled in Spark &amp; know SQL really well. I’m sort of a jack-of-all trades kind of programmer, as I know many languages and frameworks at a high-level. I easily adapt to the work I am in. I’m starting to find a lot of value in the Data Engineering space, with building data pipelines, ETLs, data cleaning, batch processing etc. 

I have noticed, with so many passionate devs seeking to be full-stack engineers, I am ponder if shifting my focus to Data Engineering will be a good route to take. If so, any good learning materials you’d recommend to get a good head start? I have just started reading one of the O’Reilly Spark books. 

Also, any Data Engineers here willing to offer some advice? I don’t want to give up on being a great full-stack dev one day, but I’d like another route to take if it doesn’t work out as I hope."

My dream job would be using GIS in an analyst role to support urban planning, land use planning, or transit planning. I don’t mind if it is either for a private or public entity.

I have experience as a GIS intern with a city plus GIS technician role with a county’s tax assessor’s office.

I’m being offered entry level roles in planning for other counties. Those roles involve minimal GIS work (more customer service and document quality control, etc). Meanwhile, there are other GIS tech roles for other agencies (DOT for example) that interest me.

Would it make sense to take the planning roles just to get planning experience, even though I wouldn’t be doing any sort of analysis work? Should I hold out for GIS tech roles that are within the agencies I’m more interested in?

Thanks in advance!"

I thought I'd feel very satisfied, but right now I just feel drained and infuriated about my experience. I was diagnosed with ADHD in my 4th year of Uni, by that point I failed 9 classes. I can't help but think maybe things would have turned out differently If I knew earlier, maybe my final GPA would be higher then a 2.5, I wouldn't have been too overwhelmed to join more extra-curriculars. If I learnt to handle my RSD earlier I could have got an internship, or connected more with my professors. 

Right now I'm full of regret, I'm proud that I made it this far but I still feel so conflicted. I'm scared of how my future is going to play out."

Any suggestions?,ng3884,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/qzv4ef/i_am_struggling_to_find_a_way_to_start_my_own/,"Video games have been a part of my life ever since  i was a kid, i was never good at outdoor sports, i got bullied a lot outside, so just like anyother kid i got on the computer desk, actually my dad was the one who introduced me to it, i am quit happy he did. 
I was 15 when i thought that i need to start my own studio. Once i was done with my 12th,  i tried to find institutes which could teach me about game development and gaming industry, eventually i found one which was a 3 year program BSc in animation and gaming, I told a couple of my friends about it, they liked the idea but they went for engineering anyway, i thought maybe ill ask them to me join once i learn about everything and setup everything.
Before getting the admission i saw the syllabus of the course they were offering, it was simply everything about every department in gaming, which was exactly what i wanted to know. 
After almost a year there was a game developers confirence coming up in our city, our college sent us there as volunteers to gain some work experience but also to explore what others are doing. I freaking loved it! I was expecting that ill get to go or maybe ill know how and where these types of events happen, but still i was just happy to be there, talking to people from all over india and also a lot of people from around the globe, everyone, had a simple and same goal, they want to entertain people and make others smile, that thing continued for a couple of days.Then i came back to my college stuff. 
I realized that if i want to build my own stuff i need to start noting down everything i have seen and hear and pick out the things or ways which will be usefull for me. and i did started doing that, i went to more conferences talked to a lot of random straingers, asking them how or why or since when are you or ur organization has been building games which also kinda helped me to build my communication skills and a little bit of confidence.
I also started making my own  games to learn and show them to people when i go to these events.
My college 2nd year started, i wanted to earn very desperately, so i tried to find some freelance work for 3D modeling or graphic designing. didn't find any for a very long time and then i finally found a couple of them but i wasn't able to complete them on time so didn't got paid for it, didn't lose hope, still tried to find more stuff and finally found one. My first earing was ₹550 😄. 
Then there was some projects that came to our college, one of them was from Central Raiway, i asked to be a part of it alone with a couple of my classmates. It was a 3D modeling project, we completed it in like 2 months. 
Then i did an intership for 2 months at a startup gaming studio which he had build in his own house. 
Everywhere i went i tried to collect information which could be useful for me, i tried to put myself in different situations to see if this could be something that would  workout for me. 
I completed my internship and i knew i had to complete a game and upload it on Playstore. I did make one its ""ChalkBlock"" submitted it as my minor project for second year, its kinda buggy but it is what it is 😅.
Now i knew making a game is a big deal but getting a audience is another thing. so i start to do marketing for my own stuff. I printed out barcode for my game and posted it on the college notice board, i told my friends, posted the links on social media and after a month got 100+ downloads. PS i didn't had money to invest in ads.
I continued making games but it takes a lot of time i didn't wanted to be jobless after i am done with college so i started to find jobs as soon as my 3rd year started,  took me more than half a year and a couple dozen rejection to land a job as a Game Tester. I took a NOC from college and joined the office. 
Continued making games, continued to fail with it 99/100 times, managed to balance my office and college life, passed my degree with 8.9 pointer, i also got a merit certificate frim my college which was a first for me because i have always been a below avarage kid.
After i was done with my college i got an opportunity to go teach some engineering students about game development. it was a 3 day event, but i think i managed to get those kids interested about game development.
I started a Instagram page where i post funny gaming clips from my own gaming sessions. i started it so that i can promote my games on it whenever I publish it.
insta id ""seeyouonit"" it has like 2.5k followers rightnow.
Now, last month i turned 24 i am still at the same place as a Game Tester. I recently published another game on itchio Its ""Blazing-lambert"". I have always tried to keep myself focused on my goal and tried to make the most out of bad situations. I really dont want to loose hope, but i feel kinda tired. I know ill figure out something sooner or later, i just dont wanna get to old, i don't know, it sometimes feels like i am losing the game."
qzviid,2,2021-11-22,"Finance Major, Accounting Experience, Interested in Technology. Advice on next steps?",Huncho_Levitate,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/qzviid/finance_major_accounting_experience_interested_in/,"Hi All,

I graduated in May of 2020 with a finance degree and have been working my first full time position at my current PE firm as a staff accountant for a little over the past year now. Overall, I find the work to be unrewarding and I don’t see a future at the company. I’ve looked internally for positions that are more geared towards finance, however, I believe I’ve come to the conclusion that maybe the private equity space is not something I’m interested in, if I’m not on a sought after deal team. Considering my resume, that does not seem plausible at this point unless I went for my MBA, and even then could be a stretch. My past internship experience was a controller at another large bank. I feel my resume looks pretty good on paper with some big company names supporting me.  My limited finance experience has been working as a controller for an internship, as well as the way a PE firm operates. And in accounting, I have a year’s worth of fund accounting experience.

What I’m unsure about is what type of role I should look into next. Recently I’ve started to become more and more interested in the technology space. I’m pretty technologically inclined and feel like I can learn the different technologies fairly fast. I see technology such as blockchain, AI, cloud computing, machine learning, etc. as the future of business as many of these items will be implemented into existing businesses in the future if they haven’t already. I don’t have any software engineer skills, however I’m confident in my ability to learn them would it be required for a role. Would anyone have any recommendations for potential lines of work or skills that I should look into?

Some potential roles that I’ve thought about from a finance/accounting perspective has been an investment analyst, commercial or corporate banking, consulting, or real estate. I also haven’t crossed out the potential for something a little more sales/relationship based, as I’m fairly comfortable talking to people and if anything would allow me to grow professionally even more. Is there a cross over that I’m unaware of that would combine my finance major, accounting experience and interest in technology?


TL;DR. I’m a recent graduate with a finance major, accounting work experience, and with an interest in technology. Are there any paths for which my experience and interests would align?"
qzvne9,0,2021-11-22,How to automate reading E-mails,pubGGWP,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/qzvne9/how_to_automate_reading_emails/," I'm working on automating a proces for a company I'm intern at. I don't get any help at all so was hoping for some help.    


**The context:** Customers want to send huge image files  to our servers. They do this with outlook, and send a E-mail that contians a share link(WeTransfer/Sharepoint). From this link we download the images. This process takes a long time and when the image files arrive we have to manually download, extract, and order them. We want to automate this process because it takes a lot of time and frustration for us, and customers.    


My solution is an application that can automatically: Use Outlook API to read out the link from an e-mail. Use Wetransfer API and Sharepoint API to automatically download the contents of a share link. Sort the files in a clear folder structure on our servers.   Does this sound like a logical approach to this problem? Are there any better ways to do this?"

Post Facebook I got Nuro (Final) and Rippling(Offer) interviews and excited to be at Rippling this fall :)

\---  
Yo its the guy who reversed a string for Reuters and accidentally got Bloomberg new grad phone reporting back again.

Some Disclaimers and Background:

* Started taking this stuff seriously March 2020 (Didnt know the diff between an array and arraylist at the time)
   * I saw [levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi) \+ people getting top internships online without perfect grades which was a shock at the time and thought I could do the same
   * Decided to ditch online class and hs studying overall to learn web dev first(March 2020) + projects and started diving into dsa(Aug 2020) and actual technical prep applying my knowledge(April 2021) at the dismay of my mom
* I applied as a sophomore(by credits) on the resume. This probably was a big influence imho and the only thing my ap credits actually were useful for. + had 1 previous swe internship at random startup I got at a hackathon
* I have touched no grass since March 2020 to October 2021 ish grinding projects and leetcode
* I'll be making a separate post on how to go from nothing (couldn't do 2 sum optimally at first \[[My first attempt at optimal](https://imgur.com/a/jp8fpKE)\], reverse a linked list, invert a binary tree, etc) to getting comfortable with mediums over time in a seperate post after I recover from failing 2 midterms and making up work LOL

&amp;#x200B;

Leetcode Count: 207 (50/135/22) + \~100 grokking (mostly lc easy/mediums with a sprinkle of hards)

* 120 of these were soley Meta the rest were blind and a few other company tagged

Apps: 250 sent, 70 rejections, \~30 interviews (didnt track OA's), 8 offers

Ok on to the wins and my perception on em:

&amp;#x200B;

**Spring 2022:**

Random AI Startup: 20/hr, remote

* Was told to practice data structures and algorithms so I grinded through most of the entire blind 75 list skipping bit manipulation and string DP.
* Ended up getting 3 React problems for the final and made sure to emphasize communication a lot as this was my 1st technical ever.

**Fall 2022:**

Hubspot: 45/hr, 2k bonus, 60/month internet, remote

* Somehow got the OA, didnt deserve to pass the phone interview (I know people more socially competent and grass touchers than me that somehow didnt pass)
* Overall did well on both leetcode + frontend but forgot that console.log was a function on the interviewer's ""bonus question"" so I ended up on an iffy end.
* This was supposed to be for Spring but headcount filled up so I moved it to Fall to relax in the Spring

**Summer 2022:**

Meta: \~52/hr + free housing, food, trasnporation, benefits MPK

* Grinded leetcode tagged every day for phone, final, and followup 40, 90, 120 total respectively and failed 2 midterms for this
* Somehow only got mediums every interview but I did the most common tagged hards since I always expected the worst
* Still in shock about this one

Datavant: \~53/hr remote

* Found the company, applied and did their OA and surprisingly smooth process of a phone technical and a final afterwards
* My first major offer imho as I never expected to go this high at all compared to 20/hr
* Feel bad for declining but they only offered summer

Gap: 50.50/hr remote

* One of the finals which I personally thought I did bad on since my problem only passed 3/50 cases on Hackerrank  but the engineer said they would have done the same thing also
* I bounced back on their whiteboarding problem and their behavioral somehow tho so thats nice

Oracle: 46/hr + 5k housing iirc (declined offer w/o recieving the letter)

* I was expecting mediums and hards ended up getting easies and mediums lol? Really chill overall

Charles Schwab: 34/hr Austin

* Surprised that there were no technicals. Just a recruiter call and a behavioral with the team specific lead that went well overall.

Thomson Reuters: 26/hr Eagan

* Reversed that string for an offer 😎

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'll share my losses as nobody's perfect:

**Spring 2022**

Rockset

* Somehow passed their phone interview doing a medium from scratch so was hyped
* Asked a leetcode hard 1st final round and got a brute force and planned out a potential optimized solution but unable to code it up due to time.
* Got a leetcode medium 2nd round and did a lot better there but ended up getting a rejection the next day sadly.
   * I didnt really mind it since this was easily my hardest interview out of all of em and made a lot of good progress overall. Just gotta get comfy with hards for next season

**Fall 2022**

Sentry:

* Passed that mess of an OA and got to technical (My first actual leetcode technical)
* Did well overall on the technical but stumbled a bit at the end for a followup. (had 5 minutes left and pressure got to me)
* Cried in the bathroom when i got my first technical rejection(This was before I got any offer)

**Summer 2022**

Khan Academy

* Passed their product demo technical + went to their coding technical and one of my best interview performances to date (my bar not theirs) and all the inteviewers test cases they pasted worked
   * finished 20m early so asked a followup which I also solved
* I'm still genuinely confused how I got the rejection but just moved on and bounced back with the help of my friends

Bloomberg

* Asked a non tagged question and solved it + explained really well but went \~10 minutes overtime
* Engineer wouldnt give me anytime to think lol. Just kept shoving edge case after edge case into my throat and I fixed them and ran them through my code
   * Never had the chance to think abt any cases since he just kept on giving me one after another LMAO
* We'll get the principal engineer posting next time 😈

Wipfli/Uline/GE/Mutual of Omaha/MealMe/Collins Aerospace/Oshkosh

* All rejected/ghosted after initial behavioral phone

This is my first time posting on Reddit and I'm hoping the great people of Reddit can give me some words of wisdom and hope that I am not a completely lost cause in finding an industry job. The short of it is:

\- I graduated with my PhD in Informatics recently (August 2021). I also have a M.S. in Informatics and B.A. in Criminology.

\- I have done a summer internship during my PhD at a well known online payments processor. This is the extent of my industry experience.

\- I want to find an information security job (most likely in Trust &amp; Safety since I am on the soft side of security/not an engineer or coder by any means).

\- I have applied since April of this year and have only experienced rejection and two interviews that went nowhere (recruiters thought I had skills that I didn't have so I didn't move further along in the process).

\- Although my background may be better suited for an academic job, I would like to move into industry for a change of pace.

I am trying to be hopeful and optimistic but with so much rejection, I am worried that I will just continue to be an unemployed person into the new year which is not what I want. I am hoping people on Reddit can give me some words of wisdom to tell me what I'm doing wrong especially when I hear from others how good the job market is right now for industry jobs. Thank you!"

Another amazon post on this sub lol sorry first one got deleted 

I just got the interview request for SDE amazon intern in Canada and I filled out my availability. So yeah like everyone else, I really want to do well on this. My interview is in 9 days and the way ive been studying is by doing the Blind 50 list (a shorter version of the blind 75). I’ve only gotten past some of the array questions and then a few dynamic programming questions but those are so confusing that I end up just memorizing solutions. 

I’m posting because I’m looking for the best advice to go about this. I’ve been told by many that I definitely need to know graphs/trees in and out cause they love asking those questions and that's one of the subjects I’m pretty blank on. I’ve taken DS&amp;A but that was last year and I just have the most basic of knowledge. The next 3 days I’m planning on learning everything about graphs and DST and BST and going through the questions provided for graphs from the blind 75. Right after that I’m going straight into tree questions as well. The blind 75 has graphs and trees as separate but the blind 50 has them together. 

Next I’m going to just keep going through the list. I’m skipping any questions from the following categories but if anyone thinks thats a mistake please let me know. Skipping binary, interval, and heap questions from the blind 75. Are heaps and stacks commonly asked in these interviews? I haven’t seen them too much from other peoples post so to my knowledge it seems like a waste of time but please let me know if i'm wrong. As well, I’m somewhat comfortable with linked lists but I also haven’t seen it asked too much so I’m not sure if thats something I should prioritize. 

Now I do have another option of going through top amazon questions sorted by frequency in leetcode premium or through some of the amazon questions that other reddit threads have posted such as the links below. I would really love some advice on whether I should stick to understanding/memorizing the blind 50/75 questions or just going straight to the amazon questions and pray I get something similar. I only typed memorize in case I truly just can't wrap my head around a problem and decide I can’t spend too much time on it. 

I’m definitely going to take a lot of time to go over the LP principles and make stories for all of them. Without being pessimistic, I think my best chance is being able to talk through a solution, somewhat likely not being able to actually solve it, but doing great on behavioral and explaining what I do understand about a possible solution. I know its not the best view to go in with but I think it's just the truth because there's just so much to learn. 

Last thing on my mind is for my OA 1, I got all the test cases for Q1 but 0 test cases for Q2. I still had a lot of code written there but I just couldn’t get the right output. Is this something I need to go back and think about how to solve? I’ve only seen people applying for the new grad or SDE1 having to go back and fix their OA solutions or explain them and my intern interview is only 45m so I’m assuming I don’t have to. If i do though, of course I want to be prepared. 

I’d love to hear any advice/tips/tricks or anything I can do differently and I’m devoting the next 8 days to preparing for this interview. Long post just have a lot on my mind. Really appreciate any responses. :)

I have around 60 college credits (general electives) from dual enrollment and a community college classes which will allow me to complete a b.a. in CS in 2 years. I am still a senior in highschool. I am not the biggest fan of coding and can only code basics of python. I tried to do CS50 on edX sophmore year of highschool but I gave up on it, while my brother in 8th grade finished it. All of my freinds that are older, are always talking about the pros of CS such as job oppurtunuties and many of them don't like coding. One of them is a SE in a big company and the other is still in school, but doing well w/ internships. I know i'm going to get crucified for this but my main goals are money and good work-life balance. To be honest I have not been drawn to computers like my brother and dad who are computer geeks, but I don't hate them either. I am also looking to get into grad school while working my first job. I would like to be making 100k out of college too. I am willing to put in the work and grind out these next 2-3 years.

Will doing a CS degree in 2 years hinder me?

Is it feasible to get a job in top tech after 2 years of college?

Can I get a job as a product manager or in cybersecurity fairly easily with CS?

Any other advice/critques help?

My end goal in life is to have a huge tech company that somehow changes the way medicine is practiced, while maintaing a good back up career for myself."
r012ol,7,2021-11-22,Dream to provide has come true! Finally moving up in this ever changing world.,bored_hobo,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/r012ol/dream_to_provide_has_come_true_finally_moving_up/,"I have held a single IT job from the beginning. 10 years going strong at the same company. Most people probably would have jumped ship for new and exciting things but I stuck it out because of the people I had on my team. Started off as help desk intern and worked my way to systems administrator about 5 years in. Since than we have tackled a lot of infrastructure upgrades and such but still wasn't able to provide fully for my growing family. 

Fast forward to today when I got a call from my dream employer. Great insurance, excellent retirement and PTO. Profit sharing, the works. This job starts full time at home and moves to the office in about a year (thanks COVID). I'm getting a 40% increase in pay and my drive to the office (once it starts) will be an hour less per day. I finally feel like I have proven what I can do. 

Kinda nervous. Going from a small team of 5 and 200 servers to a team in charge of 15000 servers. I'm excited for the challenge and can't wait to continue to learn and grow. I always told myself I was going to make over $100k before I am 40 and it looks like with some hard work in the next couple years I can achieve my goal!

I have read a lot of things on this sub that helped me with negotiations and perspective. Thank you all."

r01x8w,4,2021-11-22,Can't even get a technical interview. Should I even bother applying for more internships as a freshman or just prepare more projects in preparation for next semester?,[deleted],csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/r01x8w/cant_even_get_a_technical_interview_should_i_even/,"So I've decided that even though I'm a freshman, I've technically programming for 10 years and feel very confident in my fundamentals so why not apply for some internships. People say its possible. When I say I have been programming for 10 years, I mean pretty lightly most of it. I never really did any projects in those 10 years since I was not even sure I wanted to become a programmer at the time. So I just sort of learned  a ton of shit and did a ton of throwaway shit with it I thought was cool but not really portfolio worthy. I got a job teaching compsci at a local startup that taught kids how to code, and was always at the top of my programming classes in school (and still am in college) but have nothing to show for it, which I totally fucking regret now.

Anyways, even though my only project is not even finished yet, I figured I'd apply for internships and blow them away when it came to technicals. Because I know I can do that. Leetcode has been a breeze for me, can do basically any medium and easy thrown at me pretty optimally and even most hards. The issue is I can't even get to that step and it's been pretty frustrating. I've applied to 20 internships so far (3 targeted towards freshmen/sophomores), and out of the few that even responded they just straight up rejected me. Didn't even bother sending a technical, just said I wasn't a good candidate.

It's super frustrating cause on their end, I get it. I'm a community college student with 0 projects and just a tutoring job and a IT job at my local library. They have no reason to believe I'm a good candidate. But on my end, I know for sure I can crush their technicals and probably be a big help to them, especially for the freshman positions. I know my lack of working on a real project probably limits my knowledge of actually implementing the stuff I know, but my life the past 3 weeks has been working on my project, learning new tools, and grinding leetcode. I know whatever they throw at me I can catch onto quick, but I can't even get a chance to demonstrate that to them. So I've started wondering if it's worth it to keep on applying to internships or just take a break and focus on my projects, maybe wait until February to see if any positions are still open or even until my sophomore year.

TLDR: I'm a freshman compsci student at a community college that has 0 projects in my portfolio, but I did have a position at a local tutoring type center and as IT at my local library. I've applied for about 20 internships so far and cannot even score a technical interview. Is it even worth it to keep applying to internships or should I take a break to focus on developing my portfolio?"
r01y3x,73,2021-11-22,"Typical personal growth story - but it does get better, I promise",wrathofmann,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/r01y3x/typical_personal_growth_story_but_it_does_get/,"Flashback to 2 years ago, I just earned my Sec+, 2 semesters from my BAS in IT, and landed my first gig in Help Desk at an MSP.  I was making 18/hour and miserable, absolutely miserable.  I was transitioning out of the military, making a decent livable wage while I was in, and thought I had more going for myself than employers saw in me. 

 I played the game, switched from MSP to an Internal Help Desk role, though it didn't feel like it.  I went from supporting 15 companies with thousands of employees, to 1 large insurance organization with 25k people.  I churned tickets day in and day out, RDP'ing into client's workstations, resetting passwords, and regurgitating pre-written SOP's with 50 critiques on the 25 tickets I've accomplished the day before.  What was it for, why the struggle, why was I struggling so much?  I've been deployed multiple times, been in high stress situations, but something about an irritated customer constantly on the cusp of verbally berating me that irked me.  Sure, there are policies in place to protect us from this sort of thing, but let's be honest.  IT does not make a business money, the agents do.  Or so I was constantly reminded of.

Times were dark, I started drinking heavily, barely finished school.  It didn't help I was studying and working full time.  I barely had it in me to finish, it was nothing like I studied.  Internships were not in my favor either.

Finally a minor breakthrough, an application support role opened up.  It still had a Help Desk feel, but I was on site, and only supporting about 100 users.  I wasn't stuck with a headset with a better use as a noose.  I excelled finally, people remembered my name, and I became a site lead.  2 months into what was supposed to be a 6 month gig turned into the entire IT section being laid off.  The Project Manager overfilled the manning requirement and blew the budget.

So what now, I have a spotty track record with one decent gig that had no weight on a resume, and with a contracting agency that did nothing to help me.  Sure, it's not completely their fault, but I still felt betrayed.  1 day of unemployment becomes a week, becomes a month, and finally 2 months.  Why did I go to school, why did I separate from the service, why did I even try anymore.  Nothing was worth it.

Almost as soon as the 2nd month of being unemployed hit, I get the magic phone call.  ""Hey, I like your resume and your background - how soon can you start?"".  Like with most other recruiters at this point I didn't take them seriously.  I explained my background and what I was up against, the current path that was unfolding.  Almost immediately after that call I received the invitation to apply and an acceptance letter.  No way I thought, this can't be real.  I thought I was being played, but this also wasn't a small name organization.  I filled the paperwork out and started working almost immediately.

Fast forward 6 months I'm still with this company supporting IT components used in airfield operations.  I'm literally blending one of my old career fields with my current IT one.  No headset, no constant headaches of MSP's and customers throwing temper tantrums, and as an added perk I doubled my salary.

I'm a bit of a generalized technician with some SysAdmin roles.  I write SOP's, work on the network infrastructure (physical and logical), manage Servers from backups to restorations and beyond.  I've traveled to offsite locations to set up remote communications and Aircraft Landing Systems, I work on Meteorological hardware and software.  Most of all though, what I am is happy.

Sure, I'm not making six figures, but I'm finally able to learn my career without the constant breathing down my neck.  The threats of being sent back to training or being let go.  I feel like a critical member to the team.  Managers trust I will do a good job, and have been praised for it.

Long story short, yes you can make it too even if it feels worlds away."

I interned with a different company last summer that I could no longer work for because it was no longer remote. A few days ago I was given an internship offer 2 dollars below the hourly rate that my last company gave me.

I have an upcoming interview with a more prestigious company that would probably pay me very well if I got the position. But the first company is only giving me a week to accept the offer and I will not have my interview by then. I have no other official offers at this time. Obviously the role isn't appealing to me but I'm anxious to not have secured any kind of internship for the summer. It seems like there will be many steps to accepting the offer, like signing documents and a drug test, so I'm thinking about signing the initial offer by the deadline and dragging out the other steps until I figure out what's going on with other companies. I want to know what people think about accepting an offer and going back on it later. Is the worst that can happen that I would be blacklisted by the company? Because that doesn't bother me much.

Almost 2 years ago, I made a post on here panicking that my dreams of being a software engineer were shattered because I failed to declare the CS major at berkeley. I was extremely depressed and even borderline suicidal during this time in my life; it was truly rock bottom for months and I was the lowest I had ever been in my life. 

Im happy to report that since then, I was able to land a software engineering internship at a decently large company, and have just now signed a new grad SWE offer at a very large tech company (many would categorize it as FAANG/Big-N) in the bay area.  

I honestly don't believe that being a DS major has had any significant or noticeable handicap on my ability to recruit for SWE roles, and I experienced pretty decent response/OA rates, especially after my first internship and once I became a junior.   

I'm not writing this to brag or flex or look for any sort of validation.   

I'm writing this for the many students who are probably going through the same thing that sophomore year me went through: a long stretch of stressful, uncertain, depressing, and agonizing thoughts of self-perceived failure as they become traumatized by the idea that they won't be able to declare the CS major.  

There absolutely still is a future for you in SWE and in the tech industry in general; 3 classes do not determine your ability to shine as a productive and valued software engineer. 

As long as you follow the traditional advice that's been regurgitated a million times all over the place (grind leetcode, do projects, get internships, etc.), you will be absolutely fine as a DS major. 

If I can ease the anxiety, fear, and depression of even one Berkeley student reading this post, then I will consider it a success."
r05rr7,105,2021-11-23,Whither net neutrality? On the urgent need to implement the TRAI’s recommendations on net neutrality,InternetFreedomIn,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/r05rr7/whither_net_neutrality_on_the_urgent_need_to/," 

[ IFF needs your support, now more than ever. Details at the end of this post. ](https://preview.redd.it/t2qjvaw95a181.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fdbdd4f0727557e1f67893b633f8af3618f13f2b)

### tl;dr

The fight for net neutrality is not over, yet. In September 2020, TRAI forwarded a set of recommendations to the Department of Telecommunications(DoT) regarding the enforcement of net neutrality principles by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and telecom networks, which included the establishment of an independent Multi-Stakeholder Body (MSB) to play an advisory and a regulatory role over the ISPs, by overseeing the Traffic Management Practices (TMP) by the ISPs. More than a year and several representations later, these recommendations have still not been implemented. We wrote to the Minister for Telecommunications, Ashwini Vaishnaw to highlight the lack of implementation of TRAI’s recommendations by the DoT despite our repeated efforts.

### Background

The battle for net neutrality was hard-won through the [**#SaveTheInternet.in campaign**](https://savetheinternet.in/). Through it, the public petitioned the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), a regulatory body which was instrumental in making rules and recommendations, to protect the open internet. As a result, TRAI released the [**Net Neutrality rules**](https://trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/Regulation_Data_Service.pdf), which prevent ISPs from choosing to charge you additionally or slow down your access to your favourite websites because their owners do not pay such ISPs extra money. In short, this was a massive win for internet users and the open internet.

Despite this, there have been various net neutrality violations reported by our community through a reporting form available on our [**SaveTheInternet.in**](https://savetheinternet.in/report/) platform. We have also filed [**complaints**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15yATovJgY8tEXp5Z6C_AWKkjDhsPhBeU/view) with the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) and TRAI on reported net neutrality violations by licensed internet access providers across the country.  This has brought to light a concerning pattern of internet access providers discriminating against certain types of internet traffic in derogation of their licensing obligations. For example, in March 2020, IFF received multiple complaints of “[**www.bbc.co.uk**](http://www.bbc.uk/)” being blocked by internet providers in Bengaluru, and the website “[**www.getbootstrap.com**](https://www.getbootstrap.com/)” being blocked in Hyderabad. These crowd sourced reports make it evident that net neutrality violations exist in India.

While Indian authorities incorporated net neutrality within legal and licensing systems, the actual implementation of the framework remains largely non-existent. To remedy this, the TRAI commenced a [**consultation** ](https://main.trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/CP_02012020_0.pdf)on the scope of reasonable traffic management practices and a proposed Multi Stakeholder Body (MSB) for net neutrality on January 2, 2020. The process is meant to define acceptable instances where your internet provider is allowed to block, slow down (throttle) or prioritise certain types of internet traffic. If not carefully crafted, it can lead to wide exceptions and inadvertently leave the net neutrality principle impotent.

We have previously shared:

* [**comments**](https://internetfreedom.in/on-valentines-we-send-a-love-letter-for-net-neutrality-to-trai-savetheinternet/), [**counter comments**](https://internetfreedom.in/your-internet-provider-views-net-neutrality-as-an-inconvenience-dont-worry-iffs-got-your-back-2/), and a [**supplementary submission**](https://internetfreedom.in/iff-writes-to-trai-reminding-them-that-users-must-be-at-the-centre-of-net-neutrality-savetheinternet/) on TRAI's public consultation on traffic management practices (TMPs) and a MSB for net neutrality;
* [**recommendations**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DMqy35xw2_1rY5pD00MHDqKzF5yc1TYP/view) to the DoT regarding steps to operationalise the TRAI’s recommendations in ‘Traffic Management Practices and Multi Stakeholder Body for Net Neutrality’;
* a [**representation**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NLVNHMiyYj2cezPyexf8VUmWHaV3TRsl/view) dated August 24, 2021 regarding the lack of implementation of the TRAI’s recommendations.

## Why do the TRAI recommendations matter ?

As per TRAI’s recommendations, the creation of a MSB is essential to safeguard citizens’ rights to access to the internet and it requires further support from DoT for its meaningful implementation. Managing the TMPs and updating them continually requires a framework, regulated by a functionally independent MSB, which would have agility and would be able to react fast and evolve with the changes in time, technology, services and other factors, without falling prey to industry capture. The MSB will also be responsible for enforcing standards for technical and operational procedures for monitoring and enforcement of Net Neutrality. Further, an inclusive MSB will effectively raise institutional capacity within the state to catch and punish net neutrality violations.

The need for a strong and independent MSB is further illustrated by the repeated instances of licensees discriminating against certain types of internet content and blocking it with impunity. These instances conform with observations from a [**larger study published by the Centre for Internet and Society**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08590) on January 17th, 2020, wherein they found that the website blocklists of licensed internet service providers (ISPs) across India are widely inconsistent with one another, suggesting that a larger pattern wherein internet providers are either a) not complying with blocking orders or b) arbitrarily blocking websites without legal orders. Any blocks which occur without legal orders are a clear violation of Net Neutrality principles now codified within the User Agreement License terms. In order to strictly enforce net neutrality, a strong and independent MSB is of crucial importance.

### Net neutrality and market concentration

The benefits of Net Neutrality are far reaching. Net neutrality acts as a necessary safeguard in telecom markets that have become increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few players. Dominant market players are less likely to maintain Net Neutrality in the absence of a strong regulatory body to enforce net neutrality.

As per [**TRAI’s Telecom Subscription Data**](https://www.trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/PR_No.45of2021_0.pdf) as on August 31st, 2021, 95.53% of the all-India market share for broadband services is captured by 3 service providers - Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd (447.57 million), Bharti Airtel (205.96 million), Vodafone Idea (123.53 million). The telecom sector is already showing signs of further stress, as [**even existing players such as Vodafone Idea are unable to raise funds**](https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/telecom-diary-sos-for-vodafone-idea-as-it-struggles-to-raise-funds-bsnls-4g-rollout-delayed-again/87818683). Indeed, Vodafone Idea itself posted further, though significantly reduced, [**losses in Q1 of FY 2021-22**](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/info-tech/vodafone-idea-reports-7319-crore-loss-in-q1/article35915881.ece), in addition to existing debts which it is unable to repay.

Meanwhile, Bharti Airtel, the second large operator by market share, has had to raise tariffs in recent times due to declining average-revenue-per-user, which, as per [**TRAI data**](https://www.trai.gov.in/release-publication/reports/performance-indicators-reports) has fallen to Rs. 9.8 per GB in  Apr-Jun 2021 from Rs. 11.23 in Jan-Mar 2020. In addition to this, BSNL faces [**further delays in the rollout of its 4G network**](https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/bsnl-4g-rollout-likely-to-get-delayed/2370496/) (at a time when other service providers are preparing to provide 5G services). The [**recent asset monetisation of BSNL assets**](https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/government-puts-on-sale-mtnl-bsnl-assets-worth-about-rs-1100-crore/87820084) also engenders fears about BSNL being sold. This is an issue because while the larger operators may be able to deal with lower revenues in the short to medium term, smaller players may not have the financial capacity to digest the same.

Taken in conjunction, the ’ill health’ of the 3rd and 4th largest players in the sector raises the spectre of duopoly control over the Indian telecom sector, a situation which may lead to the irregular implementation of net neutrality.

## COVID-19 related expenditure curbs no longer stand in the way

Earlier this year, DoT had [**exhibited hesitancy**](https://www.medianama.com/2021/07/223-indian-government-rethinks-net-neutrality-covid-19/) towards instituting a MSB . We had learnt, in response to an Right to Information request filed with them, that DoT has [**requested**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11H00_4LeeDZJWq2OcIWA-ibVoGJGsnte/view?usp=sharing) TRAI to reconsider their recommendations, and had cited COVID-19 related budgetary concerns and other feasibility concerns related to the implementation of MSB, among reasons for lack of establishment of an MSB.

However, these constraints no longer apply as the Ministry of Finance on September 24th, 2021 has [**removed**](https://dea.gov.in/sites/default/files/Cash%20Management%20Guidelines-24-9-21.pdf) the expenditure curbs that were [**imposed**](https://dea.gov.in/sites/default/files/Cash%20Management%20Guidelines-24-9-21.pdf) on various Ministries/Departments, including the DoT, for the July-September quarter.

Thus, we have requested Minister of Communications Ashwini Vaishnaw to operationalize the TRAI’s recommendations at the earliest, especially by establishing the multistakeholder body as recommended by TRAI. The recommendations from TRAI come at an opportune time to avert the massive damages caused by internet shutdowns upon the fundamental rights as well as the economic opportunities of the citizens. It now remains up to DoT to take this fight to its logical conclusion and act on the recommendations decisively in order to assist in public advocacy for vital information.

&amp;#x200B;

I am ""undocumented"" in the United States by way of visa overstay. Throughout high school and up til now, I was never able to work anywhere that required work authorization (so, basically everywhere). My father still has work authorization through some convoluted process before our visas expires, so he's basically been the sole provider for our family. My mother has a chronic illness and is in need of an organ transplant, which we can't get because of our shitty state provided poverty insurance and we need another to supplement it.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, yeah. I did not have the most privileged childhood. Our utilities would get disconnected every now and then. My school had exactly zero STEM opportunities, and I had to learn coding on this atrocious laptop from the late 90s (in the late 2000s). It was bad. There was no way we could afford college, but I grinded in high school, got a perfect ACT, and got a full ride based on merit to a T5 CS school. That was wonderful. A weight off our shoulders.

&amp;#x200B;

However, my parents were getting older by that point. I didn't see how my dad was going to keep working. Every year I would ask about our legal status, and every year he'd say ""you'll get it next year."" I should have responded to his temerity with doubt, but of course as a naive teenager I held out some foolish sense of hope that it would actually come.

&amp;#x200B;

Newsflash, it's now my final year in university and it never did. By all means, I believe I did make the most of what I have. I maintained a 3.9 major GPA. I could not do any internships in my years at college, despite FAANG recruiters reaching out to me, which was quite sad. The only things I could do were unpaid, so I found a research position at my school and grinded away in that like I did in high school. I produced a few papers that were accepted in the likes of AAAI and ICML.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, last summer, a glimmer of hope appeared. DACA had been reinstated! I quickly filed an application with the help of my school's undocumented center (to which I owe a great deal of commendation to, as they guided me through navigating university with my status). It was the first time my family felt hope in a long time.

&amp;#x200B;

I did my biometrics, and everything was looking good. Then, a week later…the ruling on Texas’ challenge to DACA. All applications stopped. Silence. Nothing to say, really. Just silence.

&amp;#x200B;

It was our last hope as our immigration petition filed at the beginning of the last decade will be adjudicated in 2025, far too long, and my father will be far too old by then to work. This was a huge blow. It was such a strange feeling, going back for my fourth and final year of my undergraduate experience, and trying to make the best of it and have fun after the isolation of the pandemic.

&amp;#x200B;

With every party I go to, or every friend I get boba with, this eventuality hangs over my head, like a dark cumulonimbus: I have no viable path after graduation.

&amp;#x200B;

And so, in the thick of recruiting season, I still apply to jobs. Foolishly, of course. I have to indicate that I am not authorized, and that I will need sponsorship. Which is technically the case, except I can't really be sponsored since I'm out of status. Nonetheless, I do it because I don't know what else to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I pass Microsoft's resume screen for their new grad SWE. Then their phone screen. Then they invite me to their final rounds. I grind Leetcode for two weeks straight. In the back of my head, a constant resound: ""Why?"" I know nothing will result from this process. But yet, I do it. Again, foolish hope that \*somehow\* they'll be able to hire me. I know it's not going to end well.

&amp;#x200B;

After many sleep deprived nights grinding Leetcode, I do well in the final round interviews. Maybe more than ""well"", as you'll see in the email I got from the recruiter.

Hello \[me\]

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to follow up with you as I've been able to confirm results from your interviews with us - unfortunately Microsoft will not be moving forward with an offer at this time due to your current out of status status while living in the United States. I realize this final outcome may be disappointing but know that you reached a stage of the campus recruiting process that an extremely small portion of applicants achieve.

&amp;#x200B;

Understandably, we are often asked to provide guidance from interviews, but unfortunately, we are unable to share specific feedback. However, we can tell you that we received exemplary feedback from all your interviewers.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for taking the time to interview with us. We really appreciate your interest in Microsoft and if that interest continues, we welcome you to re-apply within a year. If you have any questions about next steps with Microsoft otherwise, please reach out to your designated recruiter.

&amp;#x200B;

It was a pleasure hosting you at Microsoft and I hope that you enjoyed your time.

&amp;#x200B;

Best of luck to you moving forward!

I guess it's cool that I basically passed the final round? I guess I did pass the resume screen, phone screen, and final round at one of the most prestigious tech companies in the world. And I knew there was no way I was getting an offer. But still, I feel…empty? Not necessarily sad, or disappointed. Just empty. Knowing that I did do all of that, and it's just this fucking thing that is out of my control. I didn't ask to be brought here before I could form sentences and be subjected to these conditions. But now, I'm dealing with the consequences of it.

&amp;#x200B;

I also looked at PhD programs. Same deal. Research assistantships or Teaching assistantships require work authorization, which is part of the funding for the degree. This was the same answer from all T20 CS PhD programs. The undoc center and I spent a good three days talking to all of them and confirming this.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess it's just that it was abstract before. Like, oh, I \*know\* I can't get a job. But now, it's real. Material. I got through all the rounds, and my status stopped me from going further. I \*see\* I can't get a job.

&amp;#x200B;

My friends have asked me to hang out with them, but I don't feel like being social at all right now. I've told them as much. It feels like all the things I knew were going to be issues from the past few years are coming to a head. Oh well. That bottle of Ciroc in the fridge is tempting."

Here is the ninety-ninth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.
* How do I find computer engineering jobs?
   * If you have no idea what you want, I would suggest just searching a job board (indeed, google, linkedin, etc.) for computer engineering jobs. If you know of a company you would want to work for (e.g., AMD), you can go directly to their website and look at their open positions. You can also use the information you learn from that job board (job titles, requirements, skills, etc.) to refine your searches on other job boards.

All the best,

\--Nick

r0dkmm,2,2021-11-23,Where should I go from here?,Justaskingquestion11,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/r0dkmm/where_should_i_go_from_here/,"Hey guys, apologize for the throwaway account and the long post, but just bare will me.

Currently, I’m about to be entering my final semester of College (I’m a none CS/engineering major, but did end up taking quite a bit of CS classes, If you excuse the electives they have to take them they probably only took 1 more core class than I did). Im also married and will be moving in May across the country (my wife got into medical school in the new location), so I don’t have the option to stay and finish up a CS BS here. However I did get into a CS masters program in the new City we’ll be moving too (a big city near Chicago) that I’m hoping will help make up for the lack of BS in CS.

I’ve had 2 tech internships, 1 as a DBA intern for 3 months that ended because of Covid, the other I’m currently working near full time now where I do software adjacent work ranging from setting up servers, patch testing, lite frontend development with proprietary software, etc. I’ve been here for almost 5 months now. I’ve also worked as an undergraduate researcher for 6 months where I helped designed hardware and software for use in the lab.

I have used Python, Java, C, C#, HTML, CSS, MySQL, and JS all at various points in the past and I’m quite familiar with most of their syntax even if I wouldn’t say I’m super confident in each of those languages/technologies. I’m also familiar with DS/Algorithms, OOP, etc from my CS coursework. I’m currently trying to learn .NET to increase my chances at employment, but I don’t have a ton of free time between classes and working nearly 8 hours a day.

Now on to my issue. I don’t make a lot at my current internship (around 16$ an hour), which wasn’t a huge issue before as my City isn’t a super high cost of living. I do feel like I’m significantly under paid though (I would be fine with 20$ an hour at the moment). And I know I won’t be staying at this company after graduation because I’m moving. Now this company past this is great and it could be argued I could have negotiated better, but I’m stuck at what to do. I move in 6 months and my wife and I need more money for savings. I think I might be able to get a full time job offer now, but I’m not certain. I’m not sure if I should ask for a raise or if that would anger my company (I really can’t risk being jobless for a month or 2 right now).

I’m not even super picky about a full time salary right now 65-70k in a full time remote job would be perfectly acceptable to me at the moment, but I’m not sure if I have the experience to land one of those based on being in school still and not having a CS degree.

So my question is what should I do in this situation?"
r0dn0k,314,2021-11-23,I want to quit.,tempaccount45629,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/r0dn0k/i_want_to_quit/,"Hey, I joined as an engineer at a firm a year ago as a new grad, I had a senior with me on the team when I joined so I had a mentor and someone I could bounce ideas with. Since we were the only two devs on the apps that our team owns, we would also handle support and production issues. I would try to figure it out and then bounce it off the senior before replying/solving. After a few months the senior has left and now I’m basically just a junior with a few more months of experience than a typical intern pretty much owning these production trading apps through which millions of $ is traded through daily. It’s terrifying and I don’t think I’m up to it at all even though I haven’t received a complaint yet, only heard good things. I however cannot control the incredible pressure I put on myself and I’m getting huge anxiety and panic attacks and even have nightmares leading to insomnia. I feel like I am not experienced enough and at this stage of my life I definitely need a senior engineer at least for the career development part as a mentor. 

I was looking at other options for me right now and I started applying to roles a few weeks ago, I have one offer from a large tech giant (not faang) but the salary is a bit lower, I don’t mind the salary however I dont think the name is worth having on the CV anywhere near my current role. I also have a few virtual on-sites coming up with 2 FAANG companies and one unicorn. I feel like I can definitely get one of them but the anxiety from my current job is preventing me from preparing for it, I really want to prepare for the FAANG role but all I can think about are potential production issues. 

Would it be that bad for me to leave before I get an offer?"

Lucas here again with the second third of Franklin’s journal. Shoutout to all of the eagle-eyed readers who caught transcription errors in the first upload. That’s on me and the team--and by team I mean two interns from the local community college, myself, and my dog. Sir Henry Franklin’s handwriting is atrocious and the events of his time trapped in the village further...deteriorated both his physical and mental state. So bear with us as we work through the final part of his journal later this week.

The following passages detail Franklin’s first encounter with entities that we are referring to as the “Tunguska Terrors.” If you have a better suggestion we’re open to feedback here at *Horror in History*. One small warning before you read the next entries: the following contains descriptions of unholy abominations and violence. Please remove any small children or pets from the room before reading. Good luck and Godspeed. For your consideration, part two of three of Franklin’s journal...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***July 4th? 5th?***

I have not had much motivation to keep this journal current for the last few days. The hours have been too eventful, too dangerous. Now, though, at this late hour barricaded inside of the church with the remaining villagers, I have both the time and the presence of mind to record the evil that has fallen upon us.

After the morning of the Event, the village elders gathered together at the church. I was allowed to attend though not permitted to take place in either discussion nor any voting. This was fine by me. Reports were taken and given by a few prominent members of the community as the rest of his huddled in the pews. Some kind souls passed out water and hard bread.

The scale of the calamity became apparent over the course of the morning. A handful of homesteads, those located on the absolute edge of the village, were simply gone. Several villagers, likewise, could not be accounted for. Among them was a young boy named Alexei.

A group of men volunteered to set out from the village for the closest settlement for help. The rest of us were to take stock of any supplies we had and to make what repairs we could to the buildings to keep out the elements as best we could. It was already unseasonably cold that morning and growing colder by the hour.

I learned much about the villagers there in the church. The priest was a young man--Anatory--a transplant from the south. The big bald man with half a beard was named Luka, the innkeeper was Yuri, the crying woman and mother of Alexei was named Anya, and the blind lady was called Old Aunt.

I pitched in with the repair teams, carrying ruined timbers, hammering nails, and counting grain, livestock, and potatoes. The mood was dour but determined. Yuri even led our team in a song, his big belly warbling with each note, his voice surprisingly beautiful. We worked hard that day, a fine work that left my shoulders sore. Not all of the villagers appeared happy with my help, though. The suspicious looks were there, the whispers. I could hardly blame them. The morning after I arrived at their village a cataclysm tore it apart.

Still, it was a fine enough day for the most part. Then, a little after nightfall when many of us were back in the remains of the tavern, a man came running into town. He was part of the expedition that left earlier in the day to contact the nearest village. The man was covered in blood, his face torn half off, one arm ending in a red mess at the elbow.

We lay him down near the hearth. He told us his group got lost in the fog. It began to snow. And in that snow, monsters came. Beast-things that walked like men. They fell upon the villagers and left limbs and guts on the ground.

The village healer, a woman named Mischa, took the wounded man back to her home. Anya was already there, asleep with a strong sedative. The rest of us who were there in the tavern stoked the fires a bit higher. Then we secured the doors and windows as much as we could. Monsters in the mist. And there we were in a building with no roof.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It snowed the next morning. I woke up when a cold flake landed on my cheek. The clouds were dark above us with those green edges. And there was something new. A blood-red star shined alone in the sky, the only light hard enough to break through the clouds. I sat up from my bedroll on the tavern floor. Another flake landed in my open mouth.

The taste was immediate and disgusting. It was like spoiled meat if it was frozen, crystalized. I spat it out. The snow fell harder, a white dusting already forming on the floorboards. Others were waking up around me. Then we were all awake once the shrieking began. We ran outside and…

Devils. I can think of no other way to describe them. Twisted forms with uneven limbs crawled over houses and limped through the streets. They were like broken dolls all stretched with sharp ends. I heard the crack of gun fire and saw Yuri level his rifle at one of the creatures. The monsters were grabbing villagers and wrapping them in long arms before dragging them back into the mist. The snow was a blizzard now.

One of the devils came skittering down the street right towards me. On reflex, I drew my revolver and fired. Then again. I fanned the hammer American-style and emptied the firearm. As the creature came close, I saw that it had all of the features of a human, only disordered. The last shot found the monster’s eye. It turned away but seemed more annoyed than mortally wounded. More gunshots rang out. The creatures kept coming.

I saw one demon drop from a roof to land on a small boy. Without time to reload, I holstered my revolver and drew my knife. The boy was crying. I’ll never forget how blue his eyes were, how wide as the creature pulled one of his arms from the socket. I stabbed at the back of the devil but it was like attacking an oak. The blade barely permeated and I was swatted away. The boy reached for me with his one remaining arm as the monster pulled it back into the fog.

“The church,” someone shouted. “Get to the church.”

I remember little of the mad dash. The snow was everywhere. The *devils* were everywhere. I was one of the last in before they slammed the heavy wooden door and dropped the bar. “It worked,” he giggled. “It worked. It worked. *It worked*.”

“What have you done, Grigori?” Mischa demanded.

The tall man only continued to laugh, doubled over in his pew. Those close to him drew back. I placed a hand on the handle of my revolver.

“I opened the door,” Grigori muttered. “I’ll finally be with my love again.”

“You’re mad,” Yuri whispered. “What have you brought on us?”

The mystic stood, still laughing, and opened one of the shuttered windows. He climbed out like a spider. I ran to close the shutter before anything else came in.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

We did not have much in the way of supplies. Yuri organized a party to sally out into the town to grab as many provisions as possible. I volunteered. Yuri was ready to leave immediately but I convinced him to wait.

“We should go when the snow stops,” I said.

“What does the weather matter, Englishman?”

“Henry. Please call me Henry. And recall what the wounded man said when he came back yesterday. He was attacked when the snow began. And here, in the village, the creatures first arrived with the snow.

“It could be a coincidence,” said Luka.

“Or it might not,” said Mischa.

We waited. The snow stopped around midday. There were nine of us that went out to forage armed with whatever rifles and axes we had on hand. It was still gray outside, a wash of cloud and fog though no more falling snow. A dusting lay on the ground, ice cracking under my boots as we hurried across the street. Every eye was open for the return of the creatures but it seemed my theory held water. No snow, no devils.

I caught sight of Grigori in the window of the tavern. It seemed that he’d taken that space for himself. Even at a distance, I could see he’d begun carving those strange, sickening markings into the walls of the building. Maybe it would keep him safe from the monsters. Maybe it would draw them in. What honest man can tell?

We split into three groups and moved house-to-house, taking whatever supplies seemed worthwhile. I doubt we were at it for more than an hour before I noticed a snowflake drifting down outside the window.

“Time to go,” I called out, drawing my revolver. “We need to-”

A scream split the quiet. Then another. Then we were running. I saw shadows climbing on the walls on houses across the street. One creature was plucking a man’s limbs off like a sadistic child taking apart a butterfly. I fired off a shot and struck the man in his chest. I figured that was the most I could help him. It was chaos, smoke and violence and falling snow. My group made it back to the church and stood on either side of the door, guns drawn, waiting. The devils were everywhere but there was little sign of the other six.

All told, we brought back a week or two of food, twice that in water, some cartridges and kindling and oil. It cost us six lives, including Yuri.

I am currently a 5th year student and finishing my last classes in summer 2022 after some difficulties due to life. I transferred schools and had a bunch of hurdles but I am almost done. When i went to go talk to my advisor, they said that the old one had left. So i thought it was fine. But what I didnt know is that my old advisor gave me the wrong information. He didnt tell me the system was wrong and since i transferred i would need 3 extra classes. Now i am struggling to add on as many courses as possible and take summer classes to try and finish asap. I am asking if theres anyway i could still apply for jobs and if one were to accept me, that i could finish school and work there at the same time for my last few credits. I really want to start working as ive already had internship experience and i really need the money. I don't know what jobs will say or require but is there anyway i can do this. I literally would be going for one extra semester with 3 classes or less maybe all due to my ex advisor. I am really saddened and angry because I really needed the money from work . I was going to do another internship again possibly, but then i don't think i could keep up with my classes again in the summer. My previous internship was for a good tech company as well. That helped pay for my classes and help me out tremendously as well. If  anyone has any help or insight I would greatly appreciate it.

I'm currently dealing with a lot of anger at myself for not knowing better and trusting the advisor who left. I asked if i could possibly walk for graduation at least and still finish the last 3 classes but they will get back to me. Once again if anyone has any information into hiring or such that would be amazing. Or even any ways i can use my skills to make money in cloud engineering roles."

This semester was going good until I fumbled horribly on the midterm designed by a different professor who didn’t provide extra credit and as well as some of the pop quizzes too that were meant to buffer my grade.

As of now, If I crank things out really hard on the final, I can see myself kicking my grade in the Bs but if the exam is as high costs as the midterm, then a C as a final grade is a real possibility. 

Now I’m aware that that’s still passing but for internships next year I would really like to involve myself in HDL for these positions and maybe as a career path as a whole. I’ve also gotten a few interviews already and I hope I can land one before this all passes, but if I don’t will this look like a stain when pursuing internships?"

**Academics**

* GPA (UW/W): 3.3UW/4.06W (destroyed gpa freshman and sophomore year)
* Rank (or percentile): don't have it
* \# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: I'm in an early college program so I did like 40 credits of pretty difficult classes my junior year, mostly science. I'm graduating in the winter bc I hate nursing and all my credits are done.
* Senior Year Course Load: Just nursing classes then nothing second semester. Probably gonna get an internship.

**Standardized Testing**
Test optional, nursing school is really busy

**Extracurriculars/Activities**

No particular order since none are more impressive than others lol.
1.  Babysitting full time-usually from 9am to 4pm during summers, after school during the school year for 2-4 kids
2. IAC Entrepreneurship program- we did mock startups, hackathons, etc
3. Tutor- I tutored young kids (so like 11 and under)

**Interviews**

Tulane interview: Went SUPER well, we ended up both being from the same area and liking Harry Potter so we had a good conversation. He felt I would be a good fit at Tulane. Maybe a 30 minute talk? 

Syracuse interview: Went just like Tulane except she was an AO and not alumni, very friendly and chill conversation. Asked some repetitive questions, she said at the beginning the interview would probably be 15-20 minutes and it went for like 20-25 so yeah.

**Essays**

I think my main essay was really strong, reflected on how doing early college and taking rigorous coursework inspired my love for science and learning in general.

Supplementals: Spent ages on these, almost all of them hit the word count.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD

Tulane ED1- spring semester acceptance so no longer binding (yay?)

Pace EA- Literally just got in after I made this post, probably won't go over Tulane since it was mainly my back up safety but still nice to have it. Also got 114k combined off the tuition for four years! 28.5k per year.

Binghamton EA- OMG got in! wasn't expecting that since i'm so below their average :)) I got the Dean's scholarship for 7k a year

Syracuse RD- Accepted

UMiami EA- deferred-&gt;rejected

USC- rejected with TTP

Colorado Boulder EA- Accepted to ecology and evolutionary biology

Vermont EA- Accepted health sciences 64k presidential scholarship

UMD EA- rejected :( my first no

Miami Oxford EA- Accepted with 21k renewable scholarship!

Penn State EA- Accepted main campus! health sciences

Ohio State EA- deferred-&gt;accepted 

Pitt- Prediction: Accepted to Dietrich for microbiology

Fordham- deferred -&gt; waitlist

**Additional Information:**

Anyways, I just wanted to share how I think I got into Tulane at all, even if it was spring semester. If you're like me, you're probably looking at r/collegeresults trying to chance yourself for your dream school. So I am here to help you get into Tulane. The reason they let me in for spring was because they didn't want my gpa to drag down the averages but they knew I was a good fit. First, live and breath demonstrated interest. I did early decision. You still have a good shot EA, but 0% chance RD so don't do it. Tulane will reject anyone who they think will pick another school over Tulane. I probably attended like 20 virtual tours, emailed the AOs frequently, and did the interview. If you don't do the Why Tulane essay you will be an auto reject, it isn't really optional. TALK ABOUT COMMUNITY SERVICE. Tulane loves community service. I talked abt it in my Why Tulane essay, talked about it at the interview, and put it in my activities section. Tulane wants a good fit over academic ability, obviously to an extent. You need to find a way to stand out. I stood out because I did early college, on track to graduate early, blah blah. Find something. If you have my gpa, don't get discouraged about not getting fall semester. There's tons of people with less built applications than me who may have gotten lucky and gotten in for the fall. But, I can pretty much guarantee at least spring semester admission if you follow these steps. Good luck!"

I recently graduated with a degree in applied math and a minor in cs.  I went to a small school that had no focus on engineering.  I felt that the internship coordinator had next to no time or resources to work with.  The extent of the coordinating that I received was a lesson on how to Google ""computer science internship.""  I applied to these for two years and never got an internship and now I'm almost 7 months out with no job in sight.

Anyways, that was my experience, but I was wondering how the internship coordinator at your university did things.  When you spoke with him or her, what type of guidance did you receive, and do you feel that your coordinator made it significantly easier to land an internship?

I'd like for myself and others to know about this because I made the choice to go to a small school on a full ride to graduate with no debt.  Looking back, I feel that I would have received a better education in computer science and had more experience if I had just bitten the bullet and went into some debt."

Since my school schedule is flexible next year I have room to take either fall or winter semester off for an internship. If there is a possibility that I could do both that would be the best-case scenario for me. I just don't want to give the impression to either company that they are my backup plan/second option.

I love the product, the team is great, I enjoy the work, and I've been verbally offered a full time position post-graduation.  With that in mind, I was looking for some advice on a couple paths that I could take.

A) I continue classes/part-time through the summer and fall, and am able to graduate in December 2022.  I am confident that I would be able to convert to full time from my current position and know that the compensation is fairly competitive.  The only issue is that they are based in a location that I'm not very fond of at all, and I'm not sure I'd be able to swing a full time remote position from them.  There are current remote employees but they are all senior engineers.  I would also apply to other new grad positions but those aren't guaranteed.

B) I continue with my current degree plan which includes several more internships.  This would delay my graduation to August 2023 at the earliest and December 2023 at the latest.  I am not sure that I would be able to maintain the relationship I currently have with the team throughout several more internships, but I would also feel more comfortable in my career prospects with more diverse experience and networking opportunities - meaning I would would be more likely to be able to get a position in a location that I like.  This would also probably be more relaxed/lighter work load.

I'm not really sure what to do.  I enjoy professional life (more so than academia), so the idea of starting my career early is very appealing to me.  On the other hand, I don't want to pigeonhole myself into one position, and extending my graduation would allow me to try out completely new opportunities.  It would also give me more time to grow as an engineer before being thrown into the rat race.

Some important points:

* My living expenses are partly subsidized until I graduate and I will be debt-free either way.
* The company is based in a MCOL area, whereas I go to school in a HCOL area.  That said, their new grad pay is on par with new grad salaries where I live.
* Intern pay is quite low compared to other intern positions that I would get.
* My only other experience is as a Software Consultant for a Big 4 consultancy firm.

I know this is a very nuanced and personal situation, but I would appreciate some perspective if anyone has been in a similar position!"

I started out as an intern, then a level 1 help desk, then worked my way into a level 2 desktop support role, moved on to Sr. Desktop Support, and now I am a systems field technician.  

I am for the most part happy where I am right now.  I don't feel a need to really advance my career, and would be happy just being a ""jack of all trades"" PC technician.  I feel I am a good technician who can fit into any company - I have a good work ethic, can talk the lingo, am comfortable with ticketing systems and SLA's, am organized, and have good communication skills.

However, the problem is I feel I need to advance my career, but I've been kind of stuck in a rut the past couple of years.  I have plenty of time and resources through my current workplace to obtain certifications and study, and there is some career advancement growth available for the right positions.  But, honestly, I am not sure what I have a passion for or what I should be doing outside of my field tech role.

I definitely want more responsibility, I want to be able to sit in meetings, help make decisions, order things, come up with policies and best procedures, create documentation - I have a knack for that.  But as far as technical skills - I want to learn things, but not specialize, if that makes sense?  It's like for the past several years I have been trying to steer my focus towards networking.  I have my Network+ certificate and have been working on CCNA, but It just feels kind of... frustrating and not something I am picking up on.  It has never been something I enjoyed yet seems to logically be the thing I should be going into since I deal with physical network equipment all the time.  Is it normal to not click with Networking as a hardware tech?

I really like IT security, I'd like to try learning Python and Linux - but I'm not sure how far I am willing to go with those topics, or if there is any career advancement for having just a base knowledge.  One thing that really bummed me out about having my Network+ cert is that even in my current company, the base requirements for a level 1 network technician is well beyond just a Network+ - and I feel it would be the same with any other certification, that it would be nice to have for me personally for fun, but not good enough to bump my career.  I guess I am hesitant to, for lack of a better analogy, plant and water a bunch of seeds that will never grow.

Then there's also the feeling of being isolated in my career.  Work from home has really been a suckerpunch to interacting with others in my department or building, not being able to talk to other technicians or bounce ideas off of them or get a feel for what they do on a regular basis.  I'm missing that hands-on knowledge or competition or enthusiasm that others can have to rub off on me.  I would love to learn by doing, but most of my doing is by myself or remote via teams messages or emails, not in-person.

Anyway, sorry, just wanted to ramble and vent a bit.  Any encouragement or advice would be appreciated.  Thanks."

I go to a prestigious school (MIT, Caltech, Harvard), have prestigious internships (Jane Street, Google Brain, Citadel), live in a prestigious city (NYC, Dubai), wear prestigious clothes, have a prestigious haircut and use prestigious words.

My life has essentially been optimized for prestige. The issue is, I'm dating a girl that's not very prestigious. She goes to a less prestigious school (Berkeley, Waterloo, CMU), has had less prestigious internships (Facebook, HRT, Google \[not google Brain\]) and lives in a less prestigious city (Bay Area).

I'm seriously not sure what to do here. I truly do love her but it seriously hurts my reputation being around someone so unprestigious. Any advice on finding someone in my caliber of prestige?"

Does getting a FAANG internship remove the advantage of going to a top school?"

I would love to hear any insights and advice you would have.

For some background, I am currently a tax staff at my firm for almost a year now. I did a few internships and experienced the past 4 deadlines here as a staff.

Now, I am searching for other opportunities because I am looking to move out of my city.

I am super excited for these 2 offers, but I’m having a hard time weighing in on these decisions.

PWC has offered a salary of $69k for an ENTRY level position. I’ve read a few other posts and see that this is a pretty common compensation for the area and role, and I hear a lot about the perks of great exit opportunities here. I have always been curious about working in a big 4 and PWC has always been on my mind since college.

On the other hand, Andersen is currently offering me an EXPERIENCED staff position with a starting salary that is 12.5% higher than PWC. I loved the interview process and really enjoyed meeting everyone in this firm. The thing is that people say there’s not that “brand name” to the firm. 

I hear a lot of people talk about the plethora opportunities the big 4 offers. This is why I am in such a dilemma.

Please share with me if you have any thoughts!"

I started after college. I was making 47,000 being a network operations technician ( for the biggest isp in my state), but really more than that… I started looking around after realizing the work I was doing was crap. (Overworked and underpaid and so stressful) I was doing network design, engineering upgrades, maintenances, installs and approximately had oversight on a minimum of 3-4 projects at a time… So i started looking around for new jobs, after hating my life/job for last 4 months. 

I’m starting my new job as a information technology analyst (fancy it support role/jr admin) with the expectation of moving up to 6figures after six months. (I’m not really sure how It happened)"

r0u0cu,1,2021-11-23,Help finding a career,stalebread16,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/r0u0cu/help_finding_a_career/,"I graduated last June and I have had trouble finding a  job. It's been incredibly disheartening. I'm a very green engineer , and  have interviewed at last count , at 10 different companies ranging from CT to FL. I've been told by one employer that they haven't event hired one position I applied to because they arnt even trying to hire interns at this point because the supply chain issue is affecting their industry so much . Most places I've applied to I just don't get an answer  back, I would even take a rejection email. In general I've only learned that HR departments generally suck and some are just plain unprofessional, but that's another story. I'm planning on taking and passing the upcoming F.E exam.  I guess my question is , is this normal for a recent graduate ?"
r0ueoa,1,2021-11-23,Realistic Evaluation about this sub and the job situation,strangefeeling1200,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/r0ueoa/realistic_evaluation_about_this_sub_and_the_job/,"Hey everyone, I have a comment to make about this sub. First of all, I really like this sub, it gives an insight into unknown world of the job, especially as a student and I don't want to say anything bad against the sub itself. But what wonders me (and also stresses me out) is, that there are sometimes huge differences in the experiences of the people. On the one hand, there are the FAANG people, who are trying to get into the most competitive companies. Ok, so far so good. On the other hand, there are CS grads who are unemployed for years or people who can't find an internship for years, while there are people coming out of 3 month bootcamp basically finding instantly a job. I know it is also luck based, but how can there be such huge differences? I am asking, because there are people being without a job for years or people being unable to land an internship eventhough they seem to implement every advice people give them about their resumee and how to apply (recruiters, LinkedIn, etc...) is stressing me out, because this could also happen to me, when I start to apply for an internship in a year from now. So what do you think leads to such different point of views, where some people with less formal education or experience have seemingly no trouble finding a job, while others are having huge amount of trouble and are having years (!) of unemployment? Is it because they apply to the wrong companies and aren't including the small ones, or is it mostly based on connections to the industry? Or is that just biased by the fact, that there are many students in this sub (I guess that's the case, isn't it?) or that many people that have trouble finding jobs/internship are sharing their experiences here, while others with less problems are not aware of this subreddit and thus you should take the peoples experience with a grain of salt. What are your expierences with fellow students, are there having similar problems? I am also asking this, because I don't really know anyone in this industry and most of my peers in university doesn't seem to be bothered by all these things at all, i.e. they just think everything will be super easy and recruiters will come to their door and begging them to start working for them...

Maybe you can share your experience/opinion about this."
r0um3x,2,2021-11-23,Question about my current stage of my cs degree,pleasehelpmity,AskComputerScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/r0um3x/question_about_my_current_stage_of_my_cs_degree/,"Currently, I am a junior in CS and I feel like I still don't know a lot. Like through certain projects, I feel like I get stuck and really don't understand certain topics in class. Being that it's conceptually hard to understand makes me feel like I haven't learned anything in my 3 years of majoring in CS. I haven't had any experience with any internship and most of my friends and classmates have had some. It only makes me feel worst and right now I'm planning on applying and leet coding during winter break. To hopefully prepare so that I can get an offer for an internship. Right now with no experience, it makes me wonder whether I'll be even ready to get out to the work field. I've considered master but I'm not sure whether that's a good reason to do a master. I have a 3.8 GPA attending a decent college and was wondering what should I be doing at my stage? Am I worried too much because I tend to compare myself to others a lot? or is this something I should be worried about? I feel like I'm very behind compared to the people I read on Reddit and my classmates.

r0uu6g,2,2021-11-23,Advice wanted for someone who is in early in their career and would like to transition into DevOps,Lowdog541,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/r0uu6g/advice_wanted_for_someone_who_is_in_early_in/,"I'm really sorry if I come off as a braggart, I'm just trying to be as candid as possible about my experience, thanks in advance.

**Background:** 

I’m currently in my early twenties working as a cloud services intern at a well established software company that provides SaaS and IaaS making $25/hr, I’m almost to 8 months with the company and I graduate with my Computer information technology degree with a focus on programming spring 2023. The internship was originally just for the summer but they decided to offer to have me stay on working whatever hours I could manage with school (30 hours a week)

Our tech stack is Citrix on Windows Server, using vSphere to manage VMs that we still have in our data centers and we’re currently migrating customers over to Azure.

**Day to day in current role:** 

I’m typically providing environmental access, changing passwords, creating accounts, clearing disk space, building VMs (a lot of pre made scripts only thing I really do is provision the servers according to the BOM so cpu, disk, etc), a lot of trouble shooting random issues that come up, emailing with customers on issues, run a few powershell commands(rarely), running citrix health checks, publishing out apps to citrix, and troubleshooting the some random issues that occurs in citrix. I make extensive use of our documentation and I think this has been a real game changer in terms of how quickly I got up to speed so I would say I'm pretty good at finding solutions.

**Performance/Education:** 

If it matters I've closed almost 600 tickets and received a lot of praise from colleagues, I've been told I have really good soft skills. As for my career desires I don't necessarily want to be in this sort of position forever. I would really like to venture out into DevOps/SRE type work, I program in Python in my free time and have taken intro to Python and DS&amp;amp;Algos in Python and I'm fairly comfortable in the Linux terminal and most of the time I can find a solution for any kind of issue I have. We get pluralsight as a benefit so I've been using it to learn a bit more python, finished a course on Flask and I'm currently working on a Anible tutorial, would like to learn Jenkins and Terraform as well but only so much time in a day. Next semester I'll be learning Java Android development, VB.NET, and a system analysis and design, and advances database administration. I also hold AWS CCP and SAA.

**Why DevOps?:** 

I like to code but I don't necessarily want to be pigeonholed into coming up with new features all the time I'm much more interested in the actual operations of it all and I feel like things like CI/CD, testing/monitoring, IaC, and automation are more my speed. I've watched a lot of videos on devops, listened to the devops handbook audiobook and I have been thinking about breaking into DevOps for a couple of years now. The salaries are nice, and definitely a motivator, but there are ton of other jobs in tech I could strive for to make the same, so the pay is honestly a non-factor for me since I am set on working in tech regardless.

In terms of leaving my current position, I'm extremely hesitant to make any moves, the culture is absolutely amazing and I honestly don't have a single complaint about the place I work, not to mention it's fully remote, and the job isn't very stressful for me. I was thinking of applying for a devops/sre internship position within the company but the last I checked they have already filled the roles. I'm just wondering, what kind of options am I looking at here with my experience, should I stick it out in this role until I graduate or apply around and see what I can get to bite? Any other thoughts or advice would be great appreciated.


EDIT: Meant to put I graduate Spring 2023"

I have never done a technical interview before and I didn’t practice leetcode what so ever. I have already accepted an offer for an internship for the summer. Part of me says do the interview and take it as a learning experience but at the same time I know for a fact I will be crushed for 45min and for the first time I’m scared to do an interview.
r0vemt,1,2021-11-23,What next?,ImportantAmoeba6511,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/r0vemt/what_next/,"Some quick background info without being too specific. I'm mid 30s and posted here like 3 years ago after getting a job at &lt;Jeff Bezos Company&gt; and it fueling my suicidal thoughts. I was given some really good ideas like joining the military to get out of my past, still current situation which I did. I went to basic and received a honorable discharge for a pre-existing condition that I was not aware of and no it wasn't mental health related suprisingly. I also learned that I might be a undiagnosed high functioning autist as well with untreated mental health issues but I don't have the money to get diagnosed (USA). 

Anways, after that I decided to give college another try and managed to graduate last year with $60k in debt and an internship that didn't lead to any job offers. Since graduating I've applied nationwide and at minimum I try to get 60-70 applications in per week mostly for junior level web developer roles (front, back, full-stack, js, etc.). I've talked about this IRL to people I know who say ""you're applying to jobs that you're not experienced enough to even get"" the people are saying that because I don't have a bachelors degree, however I only apply to positions which say ""college degree preferred, associates degree, etc."" never jobs that state a higher education that I have. I've also been applying to entry-level customer service, help desk positions, etc. Also, I always list my salary to come out to $12.50 an hour/40hr per week so it's not like I'm wanting Jeff Bezos salary, I just want enough money to work there for a year, use all their available resources, training, etc. and then move on to something better without any notice.

Yeah, so another thing about my job search. I keep detailed records of every job I apply to and my interactions with the potentinal employer. I have really great fun updating it at the end of the week and viewing the data. Anyways I have a ~3% interview rate with 97% completely ignoring my job application which is pretty underwhelming but I haven't given up yet. Also, no I won't work retail, fast food, etc. I think I have really bad social anxiety and feel my life force draining interacting with people which is why I'm looking for computer related jobs. 

I've also been watching Bo Burnham alot lately and he says something like ""If I could kill myself and wake up in 18 weeks I would"" which is pretty much my same thinking. I'm not sure if I would actually go through with it unless I really hit rock bottom. Anyways, kind of strange asking other sucical people but does anyone have advice for me besides kys?

India has got many top domestic firms ranging from PayTm to Ola but do we all know about those who started these amazing companies? Let us have a look at the top 10 entrepreneurs Indiahas:



Top 10 Entrepreneurs of India


Vijay Shekhar Sharma


Top 10 Entrepreneurs in India



Born in Harduaganj near Aligarh, Vijay passed his 12th standard at the age of 14, 2 years ahead than the average age of 16. He kept working on his poor English, but never let it come on his way. While studying in the Delhi College of Engineering, he along with his friend started a company- XS corps. This was a good start, but financial setbacks ended this journey soon. Vijay’s perseverance helped him think of One97 and PayTm, which, according to the early investors, was a risky gamble in India. But Vijay's positive mindset made him a rockstar entrepreneur and Paytm is like a friend to us.



Ritesh Agarwal


Top 10 Entrepreneurs of India



Ritesh was born in a business family in Odisha, but that didn’t make his success any more comfortable. His first love was coding, which he began doing at the age of 8. In 2011, Ritesh moved to Delhi with the aim of getting things started on his own. A blessing in disguise came for him when he could not clear the SAT examination. Failure is the best teacher, and it was the same with Ritesh, he started focussing all his attention on entrepreneurship. The next idea that struck his mind was Oravel Stays- meant for bed and break. He later went on to rename this as OYO rooms, and the rest is history.



Deep Kalra


Indian Entrepreneurs Success Stories



Deep Kalra, had a great life with a regular job and financial stability. Did he leave all that to begin something on his own, why? For satisfaction, for he didn’t want to waste the talent he possessed. He knew that the Internet in India was evolving at a quick pace; he also knew that he needs to be cautious while taking any big decisions since the internet customers were still getting matured. This is why when he started to Make My Trip, he catered to only the  US to India travel plans. Then came the dot com bubble and destroyed all his hard work. Now, no one was willing to invest and then came the role of perseverance. In 2005, after taking some brave decisions, he launched Make My Trip for the Indian market, and we all know what happened later.



Indra Nooyi


Successful Entrepreneurs in India



You cannot ignore her ever. In this world of male dominance, she has made her way out of the challenges. Born in present-day Chennai, her family was a conservative one, but she was an ambitious girl. After her MBA, she joined Johnsons and Johnsons as a product manager and did what all she could for the company. She wanted to do more and hence, went to the Yale Management School to get a Master’s degree in Public and Private Management. She later worked at Boston Consulting Group and Motorola before getting into PepsiCo and became its CEO in 2006. Fighting her way out of gender stereotypes, she did what many could never even imagine.



Falguni Nayar


successful indian entrepreneurs biography



Proving people, who thought she was crazy, wrong Falguni has had her taste of success. An IIM, Ahmedabad alumni, Falguni Nayar, was earlier the Managing director at Kotak Mahindra Capital Company. She had a well-settled life, but her dreams wanted her to be somewhere else. After leaving the job at Kotak, Falguni came up with the idea of a multi-brand retail beauty e-commerce store- Nykaa. She realized that this segment was not at all tapped in the Indian market. Resources were limited, people were questioning her idea, but she kept working hard in her own space. This continued struggle towards success has made Nykaa a brand of its own, a brand that people trust.



Trishneet Arora


Top 10 Entrepreneurs of India 2018



He failed in the 8th standard and dropped out of school. Most probably, many journeys end here only, but Trishneet Arora was different. From his childhood, he loved gadgets and computers; it was like his passion. He chased his dreams and now has a company of his own- TAC. He describes himself as an ethical hacker who finds flaws in systems and helps the owners in fixing them. Trishneet has many big names in his client list, ranging from the Govt. Of India to Reliance industries. His journey is one of passion and hard work combined with grit and determination. He was taught by failures but was supported by his family throughout.



Srikanth Bolla


success story great women personalities of India



If you think you have read of the most inspiring and challenging story, wait and read this. Srikanth was born blind, faced rejection from the society, the administration, and the educational institutions, but dare he stood back and stopped trying. His family was indulged in agriculture, and financial distress only supplemented their problems. First, no school wanted to have him in, second, no IIT or IIM allowed him to study there. He finally graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology(MIT), US. Srikanth got many job offers there, but he decided to become an entrepreneur to be a job provider to people like him. He started Bollant Industries Ltd. for eco-friendly disposable products and packaging solutions. Problems made him learn and fight against all the odds; now he is one of the best entrepreneurs India has.

Later he went on to start Quikr for buyers and sellers. The website has a unique feature of transacting offline, and this worked the best. Dealing with failures and making the most out of them has been a habit of Pranay.



Byju Raveendran


Youngest Entrepreneur in India 2018



Completed schooling, became an engineer and landed a job in an IT firm. During a vacation in 2003, he helped some of his friends with the CAT exam preparations. And guess what one of them he taught secured 100 percentile in the prestigious exam. After that he went back to the job and again when he came back to India some years later, he taught some CAT aspirants, and the results were inspiring. He finally gave up on his job and began to focus on his teaching skills. Then came the idea of smart learning that changed the education perception in India- Byju’s.


Bhavish Aggarwal


successful young entrepreneurs in India



He was born in Ludhiana and was always attracted towards entrepreneurship. Bhavish completed his Bachelors in Technology from IIT Bombay and soon got into Microsoft Research India as an intern and later got the profile of Assistant Researcher. He began with OLA when he refused a rented car driver to pay a hefty amount. The driver left Bhavish en route in the middle of the road at night. He decided to do something, keeping that bad experience in mind. He researched and made plans accordingly. The taxi business in India was very limited and wasn’t too customer friendly. This is what he capitalized upon and did what was desired- started OLA."

r0zpps,0,2021-11-24,Why You Shouldn't Go to UofT for Undergrad,uoft-uoftrash,UofT,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/r0zpps/why_you_shouldnt_go_to_uoft_for_undergrad/,"TLDR: UofT is not worth attending for undergrad, arguable for graduate studies. 

**Cost:** 

Toronto is one of the most expensive cities in the world. The tuition at UofT is also higher compared to other schools in Canada, especially for derregulated programs. (16k UofT, 11k McGill, 9k, UBC). Not even going to talk about international costs. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Quality of Education:**

Professors don't care about you. Professors are hired to do research, not teach classes. The average high school teacher is a better educator than the average Professor considering that high school teachers are actually required to learn skills to efficiently teach. Furthermore, classes can have up to hundreds of students. The Professor is not going to care about you, don't even think about asking for a letter of recommendation. Furthermore, the marking is all done by incompetent TAs whose standards vary greatly. 

The student faculty ratio at UofT is **35.6:1.** That is actually disgusting. Compare that to top American schools like Harvard or Stanford with 5:1, or even other Canadian schools like UBC 10:1, McGill 14:1, UWaterloo 31:1. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Campus:** 

Only going to talk about the downtown campus. Firstly, the campus is really small. Since UofT is right in downtown Toronto, the institution can't expand horizontally so they expand vertically instead. This results in ugly construction everywhere all the time. Not to mention the homeless people around campus all the time. **Toronto winter**, enough said.

Now you argue, being downtown Toronto is so fun and there's so much stuff to do all the time! Well, consider yourself lucky if you have time to go out consistently given classes. Furthermore, since Toronto is so expensive, half the campus commutes, making it harder to make friends. Since you're a reddit user, you've probably seen all the depressing lonely posts on this subreddit. It's pretty anecdotal evidence, but still important to consider.

Don't think that the clubbing scene will be a good alternative either. Toronto clubs are focused on getting overpriced bottle service to flex on social media, not fun. Similarly, the party scene is dead because no one can afford a house to host, can't really turn up in an apartment.

&amp;#x200B;

***Prestige***

Prestige - inspiring respect and admiration; having high status

UofT is not prestigious. UofT has a 43% acceptance rate. Similarly, anyone can relatively easily apply to the Scarborough and Mississauga campuses and get the same UofT degree as someone going to the more ""prestigious"" downtown campus. Furthermore, having UofT on your resume does not instanly make you more employable than any ""less prestigious"" school. The co-op program at UofT is trash, paying $3600 for an outdated 16 month PEY internship. Furthermore, the graduate employment rate after 2 years at UofT is 92.9%, considerably worse than the average of Ontario universities 95.2%. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Please let me know what your thoughts on this are. Current students would you still attend UofT if you could go back in time?

If you are still considering attending UofT, please leave a comment with or DM me with your reasons."

For my university I'm doing an internship where I have to do research to formulate a solution to the current problems around  machine learning/artificial intelligence calculation power.

Now on the internet I can find plenty of resources regarding AWS/Azure to make this but one of the main things I have to pay attention too is the costs of setting a system up and finding out which one suits my university the best. For this I was considering a local solution and a cloud solution as viable options. but I have found trouble finding the correct resources that can point me into the right direction regarding local solutions. Most treads/posts/blogs I have found so far are 4-5 years old and while the info could be helpful I'd much rather have the chance to see a more updated opinion or information.  


So my main question would be to hear everyone's opinion about different solutions regarding Machine learning calculation power that is cloud based or locally.  


Thanks in advance for the replies."

r14uhr,250,2021-11-24,Graduated as a second career nurse at 28. I can’t do this. But I don’t know what my next steps should be.,ajc_129,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/r14uhr/graduated_as_a_second_career_nurse_at_28_i_cant/,"So like the title says, I graduated nursing school and became a licensed nurse about a month and a half ago. I’ve been working in a RN role for almost 3 months now (started as a extern my last month of school), and I think I’m basically done.

Nursing is kind of awful. I’ve seen codes/cardiac arrests and traumas. I’ve seen other horrible things, like abuse. And then there’s COVID. I hate COVID so much. I’ve seen COVID patient after COVID patient suffocate, decline, get intubated, and die, and I just can’t take it anymore. And I hate exposing myself to COVID day in and day out. I don’t feel safe, and my mental state has been very low the past few months. I’ve never been suicidal before, but I feel like I’m inching close to it. This is not a sustainable career for me, and I need out.

This is my second failed career attempt. I graduated college with my international studies/German/Russian degree in 2016. Then I did a 6 month internship in PR and nonprofit management with a regional nonprofit. After that, I worked at an Apple store for about 8 months until I went back to grad school. I took coursework in political science research methods and statistical/data analysis. This was when I decided to go back to nursing school in 2018, and that’s how I got to where I am today.

I just don’t know what to do from here. I feel like I do have some good experience, but I don’t know what I’d be good at or what I should be doing. Nursing not working out for me feels very defeating, especially after I went back to school for it.

Being an ENFP, I know I want to do something where I interact with people. I like technology and data. I also like roles where I’m advising people, or educating or motivating people. I also thought about starting my own business, but I don’t really know what kind of business I’d start. Does anyone have any suggestions for a way forward form here, or any suggestion for ways to find a path that would better suit me?"

1  Full Stack Intern - 2 month
1  Front End Developer - 1 year 5 months (international client)

All these internships have been completed during my degree period.
 
Area:

Computer Vision

Schools I'm considering:
Georgia Institute of Technology
University of Texas at Austin
University of Southern California
University of Florida
University of Central Florida


Univ. of California - Santa Cruz or Univ. of California - Santa Barbara?
The former seems highly competitive compared to the later while there's two research labs which interests me. The latter is geographically well connected to sillicon valley and does have one lab which would meet my interests. What do you think I should pick?

Apart from these universities, if you feel my application would fit other schools better, would appreciate the suggestions"

Been applying for spring 2022 co-ops to take semester off, then graduate in may as everyone else.

I have just accepted a summer internship role(process engineer, high pay, big robotics company). This made me cancel a 2nd round interview for a spring co-op position(project engineer at a smaller pharmaceutical, still large company) because it would’ve been a 6 month co-op and my internship starts in may. 

Did I mess up by withdrawing from the co-op? I just found out that they offer 5 months co-ops and I’m bummed out that I could’ve been able to do both. 

How much more valuable is a co-op vs summer internship in terms of post grad jobs? I plan on applying after my internship ends in August.

I am graduating early so that’s the good part imo. The co-op company also wasn’t guaranteed to give me the job so I’ll never know honestly.

This would be the first internship on my resume. Let me know any advice is helpful thanks for reading"

Got an SWE offer from a non-tech midwestern company for 66k salary and 75k total comp. I'm grateful to have a job offer as I've seen a lot of posts from people struggling to find one, but I have lots of questions about what to do:

1. Am I killing my career early by taking this job? The company is decently big in NA, but they're not known for tech so would I be at a disadvantage when applying to more technical companies later on? Also I see a lot of postings for fresh grads, so would I actually be at a disadvantage by having like a year of experience at this non-prestigious job compared to a fresh grad who won't have a company like that on their resume?
2. I'm going to try to apply to other companies before starting this job, but if I don't get another offer before starting how fast can I switch? Let's say a couple months into this job I get a much better offer, would it look bad on my resume if I switched so quickly?
3. Also on the topic of applications, I haven't leetcoded since getting my last internship so it'll probably take me a month or two to get up to speed before I'm comfortable doing coding questions on interviews. Should I be applying anyway during this time? The reason I'm asking this is because I don't know how soon I can reapply to the same company if I fail their coding interview while I'm still rusty. I don't want to lock myself out of opportunities before I'm ready to interview again, but I would also be losing time that I could have spent sending out applications.
4. Finally, I'm worried about the salary, it's low for a SWE right? Browsing this sub has made me a bit depressed lately when I'm seeing all these fresh grads making double or triple what I'll be getting. I know people jump companies to get higher salary in this field, how fast could I expect to progress to what a typical SWE makes if my starting point is kinda low?

A rumor started to spread not to long ago that the new hire in question was making $10,000 more then I do. As you would expect, this makes me upset. During a one on one with my manager, they assure me that no one in my position is making that much. I was skeptical, as management in my company have been known to lie to employees about compensation.

Today I learned that the new hire had told an experienced coworker their pay, and it was $10,000 more then what I currently make. The experienced coworker has brought this issue up to HR, but was told the same thing as I was and that  we are not allowed to discuss our salaries.

While I don’t deny that I’ve had learning experiences and have been mentored, I still work without pay. Surely a bachelor’s qualifies someone for an undignified minimum wage even if we are being properly educated? For those who play the “o well you’re just a student card,” do I stop learning all there is to know about the human body once I get my license? Lol.

I’m still there every full workday, my clinical instructor can double his productivity by double/triple booking time slots because I cover them anyway, and the icing on the cake is that even though I double the productivity of one clinician, I see NONE of the monetary benefits. Not even any perks of a free lunch or anything. An unpaid internship requires that you operate in the negative whilst your boss makes 2x his or her normal amount under the guise of an education.

My classmates and I were talking and holy hell these clinical experiences would be more tolerable making even minimum wage. Where TF do schools and clinics think I get the money for transportation? PPE? Food? Because they sure as hell don’t provide them… a lot of clinical placements don’t even provide you with parking. I figure if I’m giving you free f*king labor, I at least deserve to park my car and not have to walk through standstill traffic on my way to the clinic. We also don’t get a say on negotiating working conditions, so compromise is out the door. This is mandated by our school program.

And yes, we have to work on Black Friday even when there is no security in the building….

Overall I’m just burnt out and I’m not even out of school yet. I just hate how the American healthcare education system asks healthcare providers to care about others while burning is out before we even get licensed. No wonder more people are shifting to private practice to pay the bills because I can no longer pour from my empty cup which has been that way for quite some time now. 

Thank you for your thoughts and explanations!"

I went into IT right after high school and finished it but didn’t like when it comes to work and now I’m currently finishing last year of Architectural Engineering Technology and have the same feeling towards work as I did my internships. 

I recently turned 25 years old, and I’ve been into investing since Q2 of year 2020. I surrounded myself with people who have the right mindset towards life, business, money, etc… and has also changed my mindset. I’ve always wanted to start my own business but never really took action towards my ideas because I still have to learn the business/market I’m going into as I’ll have no experience, and I feel like I wasted 7 years of my life when I could’ve started earlier and took more risks towards starting a business. But now I’m 25 and feel that I have to make sure the business I’m starting will work out because I’ll be 30 in 5 years, and so I don’t have time to waste, and my risk taking would be lower then.

I only have 3 courses left in school and no work so I have lots of time. All I’m doing is researching and researching making sure this is the “one” before I actually start (I wrote down a “business plan”, planned out how I’ll scale, venture out into other businesses, the steps I need etc…) which is turning into procrastination and time wasting. I’m somewhat stressed because of this and feel lost. Yes, I have student debt / other debt but an excellent credit score. I don’t pay my debt off all out-write and instead I invest my money.

I have so many questions but I think these are the ones I need for now: 

How do I start, any advice, guidance, what I need to do, and any business ideas/ventures are welcome. I’m open to criticism and ideas. I’ll greatly appreciate it."

I am hoping people can provide insight and advice as to which companies are best, as I don't know enough about work/life balance and culture.

I'm currently leaning towards Citadel/CitSec, because they are offering a significant signing bonus and compensation, but I have also heard they have a very high turnover rate. Also, if anyone has experience working here I'd also like to know which side is better to work for, Citadel or Citadel Securities, because I ended up getting offers from both.

On the other end of the spectrum, I'm leaning away from Goldman Sachs because I have heard they treat their interns and employees somewhat poorly (long work hours), and they don't pay as handsomely either.

All of the companies are providing either corporate housing or a housing stipend, so relocation isn't really an issue.

Unfortunately I can't fit everything in one poll, so I'm going to exclude Goldman Sachs as it is my least-desired choice.

I do have a couple specific questions:  

1. should I add anything to my resume to fill the 1.5 year gap? or just leave it to be brought up in the interview?  
  

2. should I remove the help desk internship from my resume since its now overshadowed by other experience, or leave it since it shows how long overall I've been in the field?  
  
3. Rather than get another high level desktop support job, I'd love to get into the engineering side a bit more. My latest experience is in a senior desktop support role where my job was 50:50 working 4-5 escalated tickets/day as well as working on various projects, one off solutions, and automation using PowerShell. My favorite part of my last job was coming up with solutions and then adding automation with PowerShell. Many times I saved the day with these skills. Any idea what positions may utilize these skills more and what are the chances of me making that leap with the above experience?    
  
&gt;!e.g. My last company used to put symbols in active directory usernames, this ended up causing various issues in 2020 so we had a project to remediate this. I ended up collaborating with engineers and our active directory team. I created a PowerShell script that would update the usernames in AD as well as modify the registry and user folders on their computer to match up. I also utilized domain junctions to point their old user folder to their new one to minimize future issues with using a renamed user folder.!&lt;

This being said, I wanted to know if it makes sense to try and pursue these options. For some context, I am a third-year student who has already secured a summer 2022 internship position; I'm also feeling pretty burnt-out/unmotivated to do school. I'd much rather do another internship right now if I can and get some more paid experience, and I'm also pretty far ahead in terms of classes so taking a semester off wouldn't put me behind at all.

Now, I've brought this idea to an older mentor who is in industry, and she VERY strongly advised me to just graduate as soon as possible. Her reasoning is that it's extremely difficult to go back to school after you leave for a bit, and given that I'm an out of state student at a state school this means that all of the out of state tuition would be spent for nothing. She thinks it would be much better to just graduate as soon as I can so I don't have to pay for out of state tuition for all four years. Personally, I feel like this doesn't make sense because I'd be committed to going back after a gap semester, and none of the people I know who took gaps had issues with returning to school. In fact, pretty much everyone I know had great things to say about their gap semesters/years, and the general consensus is that it has only made them appreciate their college experiences even more. I like this idea a lot more than simply rushing to get my diploma ASAP; college is short, and I have the rest of my life to grind. However, my mentor is pretty adamant that this is not the way to go and that I am being really naive. Am I in the wrong here? Desperately need some more perspectives on this."

2. Programming Languages
3. Databases
4. Calc 1

Here is my background:

I dropped out of university 9-10 months ago and decided to get my degree online and work towards a career in Infosec. I ran through A+ and Net+ study materials to pick up IT concepts and then finally got my Security+ 6 months ago. I started a degree program online and began to look for work. I didn't have much luck at this point and my resume was very plain. I was near broke and was working part time DoorDash to stay a float and pay rent and still have time to study. I relapsed into depression in drugs and was very discouraged for a few weeks before I snapped out of it and decided to go harder. I got a loan and used it to live and was doing classes and Udemy courses for around 12 hours a day to expand my skillset. 

After the Sec+ I ran through CCNA study material, CCNP study material, about 200 hours of python videos, finished all of the rooms on TryHackMe, went through a data structures and algorithms course to improve my coding and problem solving, and went through RHCSA material to master the Linux command line, and acquired multiple other skills from online courses.

Yesterday I got a summer internship with a Fortune 500 Tech company paying me $35 an hour in a low cost of living area, (and plans to bring me on afterward if all goes well!) which is more than my parents make combined. I don't say this to brag but it is more than I ever expected when first dropping out of University. I also just wanted to share this to let everyone know that hard work, determination, passion, and focus goes A LONG WAY in this field. Sometimes it is what you know, and the What You Know will allow you to make an impression. 

&amp;#x200B;

I thought some of you who are just getting your security+ may appreciate knowing where your journey may take you.

Security+ is not the end, it is the tip of the iceberg, but I still credit it for giving me awareness to the various topics of infosec. It allowed me to explore the various niches of the industry and learn what I liked best. Certs aren't the end all be all, don't lock yourself in a box. Do some projects, take some other courses that explore topics deeper.

r1gdfe,5,2021-11-24,What should I do so that I can get an internship related to computer architecture?,Rit2Strong,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/r1gdfe/what_should_i_do_so_that_i_can_get_an_internship/,"I'm currently a sophomore computer engineering student interested in computer architecture. While I know positions involving computer architecture require at least a bachelor/master degree, I was wondering what I can do so that the likelihood of me landing an architecture internship position is higher. If it's very difficult for me to land an architecture internship, what else should I apply for?

I have done a course called NAND2Tetris last year, which teaches you how computers work by making you build one in a custom made HDL, so I know the fundamentals of how a computer works. Next semester, I'm taking my computer organization class as well as a Verilog based lab class. I'm also thinking of doing a project where I build a RISC-V cpu on an FPGA this coming summer alongside an internship that I have lined up. Next Fall, I'm planning on doing architecture research at my university, although that probably won't help with getting internships as I'll be applying around the same time I start the research.

I'm thinking of applying to companies like NVIDIA, Rivos, Apple, Intel, AMD, and other big chip design companies. I know that these companies typically only hire graduates for their architecture internships, so I was wondering if there are any companies that I should apply for that are smaller and less well-know, but still do interesting chip design/architecture work. If getting an architecture internship position is too hard for someone in my shoes, what other related position should I apply for? I was thinking something FPGA related, I was wondering what else I could apply for. Is design verification something that an intern at my level can do?"
r1gdxm,0,2021-11-24,What kinds of high school internships can I get as a Python Developer?,Xmexy,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/r1gdxm/what_kinds_of_high_school_internships_can_i_get/,"I'm currently a sophomore in high school. I'm interested in astrophysics and data science but realized I probably don't have enough time to dive deep enough into the math side of data science considering from what I've heard an internship position would require good backgrounds in statistics, calculus, and on top of that a majority of data science/machine learning intern positions are for college students. So for the time being I'm throwing out the idea of data science until I get to college where I can focus on it more. However, I still want to get some sort of professional experience before heading off to college, preferably in the summer before senior year. I have around 5 months of experience with Python, I know all the basics and some advanced concepts as well (web scraping, polymorphism, file manipulation, decs/gens, etc). With that being said, I was wondering what specific internships I could get with Python as a high school student in my junior year (besides anything to do with DS, ML, DL or DA) and how much experience I would need for an internship in such a category. If possible, direct examples to internship pages would also be a nice addition but I'm fine with looking within those categories myself too."
r1gz20,0,2021-11-24,[Profile Review]: Applying to 2+2/Deferred Programs with Unique Experiences but Low GPA,rip_my_recruiting,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/r1gz20/profile_review_applying_to_22deferred_programs/,"**Background**

* UCLA/UMich, Major: Computer Science
* Senior applying to 2+2/MBA programs (MSCS + MBA might be nice but mainly targeting just the MBA)
* *Work Experience*:
   * Technical/product co-founder of startup that has raised 70k in angel investing from a well known company's CEO and another angel investor -&gt; targeting YCombinator/pre-seed funding to work on this full-time
   * 2x SWE Internships at Amazon, 1 SWE Internship at YCombinator startup
   * Will work as a SWE intern at unicorn next semester, and have offer to do a SWE internship at top autonomous vehicles unicorn after graduation (not Waymo)
* *Extracurriculars*:
   * 3rd author of conference paper at top conference at intersection of AI/Human-computer-interaction with 5-10 citations
   * Other research experience: (8 months for school lab mentioned above), 1.5 years at another school lab (no publication), research with university hospital using AI/ML for symptom diagnosis
   * 2 entrepreneurial engineering fellowships for VC firms (1 VC is pretty well known but it's not Kleiner Perkins/Bessemer), 1 product/growth fellowship for series A startup backed by top VC firms
   * School's product management org - Pro-bono product consultant to a student-backed startup that got into YCombinator after me and my team consulted (not saying it’s because of us, just timeline). I honestly didn't have a massive impact, but I feel this might be worth including?
   * President of academic org
   * 4 VP positions of academic/entrepreneurial orgs that I can speak deeply to each of them for why I participated
   * Was Instructor/curriculum writer for CS non-profit helping underprivileged students
   * 2 failed startups I was the founder of (not sure if I should include)
* *Race/Nationality*: Asian, citizen of western country outside US
* *Sex*: Male

**Stats**

* *GMAT Score*: Haven't taken so I know my estimate is not that helpful, conservatively anticipating 325+ GRE score based on my SAT scores but 330+ seems possible too.
* *Undergrad GPA*: 3.324/4.0; I am aiming for 3.4+(maybe will get just below 3.5); will provide context that it is due to a combination of grief of unexpected deaths of parent and childhood caregiver (grandparent)

**MBA Info**

* *Goal of MBA:* Fall back option as I pursue entrepreneurship via being a founder/early stage startups (heard HBS likes this? unsure for other schools). The MBA will allow me to strengthen my business understanding if I choose to further pursue startups during the deferral period and if not, I will combine the business knowledge with my strong technical skills to go into big tech as a product manager.
* *Target Schools*:
   * Any M7, Haas, not sure if others are worth it since SWE salaries for mid-level and senior will be 300k/400k by the time I would be doing my MBA

Any feedback is strongly appreciated. Do I have any shot of M7 or H/S/W? I am wondering if I should maybe wait a couple years to offset my GPA with stronger work experience but I also want to just apply to some of these programs now for the fallback option like I mentioned."

I go to a small school and do XC/Track (d3, but that still eats up a lot of time), work very part-time but plan on increasing that, and I’m one club that requires minimal time commitment. I am a STEM major. Recently, I’ve been going on LinkedIn and getting super, well, jealous honestly. My GPA is “only” about a 3.4. I’ve found out from LinkedIn that so many of my classmates in my major have really high GPAs and are in a long list of extracurriculars with board positions. I just can’t do that. I get tired easily honestly. Also so many of them have internships lined up. Do I really need to be in a bunch of clubs? I just don’t have the interest. To be clear I’m not talking about eschewing professional societies. But I don’t see myself joining or sustaining participation in Greek life, service clubs, or clubs like film club.

r1iupo,8,2021-11-24,Front end or data science which one has a better entry level job search market?,Cibfbfin,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/r1iupo/front_end_or_data_science_which_one_has_a_better/,"I work at an old semiconductor company/legacy tech company as a tool owner. I’m a year out of college (engineering degree) and this years basically taught me that computer science is something I really like. I basically limited it down to two options.  

A. Software engineering focusing on front end. 

B. Data science/analytics. 

I want to know which field have more demand for entry level folks and which one is better for my experiences?


For option A I learned JavaScript Css and HTML. I’m working on my portfolio right now and making a couple responsive websites. I seem to be pretty decent at this. But I heard the entry level jobs market is BRUTAL. 

Option B I learned Python in college and have used it in internships when I interned at a car company. I did 10 year corrosion studies where I basically helped proved we may or may not have met a warranty goal. Took a lot of data cleaning (the pure raw data was rough and had a lot of false positives needed to be taken out). From there I use Python and PowerBi to make a large presentation that was used for a corrosion report that the VP saw. Issue is that I never had the data analytics or science title and this was an internship and job ago. 

Basically I’m wondering which route makes sense. I like both are interesting to me. I’m just wondering which is more realistic of a switch? I heard data science jobs generally need PhD or masters to get. I can start backup on Python if data science makes sense. 

I’m not against more schooling. I was looking into the OMSCS program at Georgia tech and I meet a lot of their requirements. I would be fine going down that path since it lets me keep working through getting the degree. 


Tldr: I work in semiconductors and want to switch to either SWE focusing on front end or data science. I’ve learned front end skills and working on my portfolio but also did a pretty decent data science projects for one of my internships and can pick up from there and do some basic machine learning projects after I brush up a bit. Just trying to get you guys/gals input to make sure I know which route to be confident on."

I have been practicing coding nearly daily with personal projects and Leetcode style algorithm questions and refactored my resume and cover letter numerous times but to no avail.

Throughout college it had been impossible to get a SDE type of internship (with one coding assessment response) anywhere for me so I spent my summers working as help desk support at a small construction company.

I have 3 weeks left, and I still can barely do anything on my own. I feel dumb and useless and another senior developer always has to spend like an hour or two every other day helping me and guiding me through how to do stuff. I feel so guilty asking questions everyday for stuff I should already know - they probably regret hiring me and I feel bad for hyping my skills up during the interview to the point where I was probably lying and taking this position from some more capable student who didn't get the internship. 

Other interns on my team aren't struggling like me and are capable of learning and doing things themselves, meanwhile I'm misusing pointers and references and structs even though I already learned about these things in college and had projects using these on my resume. My mentor has been nothing but kind and patient, but I cant help feeling like I irritate him and am wasting his time when he could be doing his own work. I feel guilty for getting paid because I'm definitely a net negative on the company. 

I get it if I felt like this for the first month of working here, but I'm literally about to leave in December and I still can't do anything without getting a lot of help. I don't even think the tasks are hard either, they're just simple bug fixes I should already know how to do

I applied to Amazon and Optiver without any referrals and I luckily managed to get a reply back within a week. I have my OA link for Amazon coming in in about a week and I have a week to do my Optiver OA. I feel like the main reason I got replies back were the fact that I did an internship with LendingTree and also that I do a lot of freelance web dev work. Most of my coding expertise lies in full-stack dev not dsa or complex leet code problems. I have been trying my best to practice medium leet codes recently and I did get a practice test to do for my Amazon OA, I was given a bubble sort problem and a regex problem. My Optiver OA from what the email said is regarding parsing data with xml but that is all I know. Before this the most knowledge I have on programming is some data structures as i'm taking it currently.

I just would like to get the bare minimum for my Amazon OA as I know even getting a reply back from FAANG is very rare, and I don't want to let this go to waste. I don't know what they mostly ask on these or how to prepare, same for me Optiver one. Any help for preparation is appreciated, I plan on calling off work for 2 weeks so I can study as much as I can; I just don't feel like it's possible to learn all this material in 2-4 weeks.

The one constant thing in my life has been my future job, I even lined up how I was gonna go to collage, get a job as an intern, save enough money to build my own veterinary clinic. Even my sexuality and religion has changed, but that one thing had been my anchor. Through the major and minor fights I had always that to remind me that my future wouldn’t change.

Terms of Sale:

Refund Policy: No refunds will be issued under any circumstances once a code has been sent unless the code does not work as advertised. Buyer mistake(s) do not constitute grounds for a refund. If you already own a title, a refund will not be provided after the code has been sent.

Code Redemption: You may not use any code on any site other than those associated with your purchase. Doing so will result in me requesting that you pay the listed price for the second use of the code, and refusal to do so will result in a report to the mods of this subreddit. Any points or other bonuses associated with a code are not included with your purchase unless specified in the post.

""Should Port/Upgrade To 4K"" Codes: I make no guarantees regarding 4K ports/upgrades. If a code that should port/upgrade to 4K does not do so, I will direct you to the relevant support team. I can, in most cases, provide any photo(s) of the code insert and/or Blu-ray upon request if needed for a support team. I will only provide a refund if I cannot produce them upon request.

Payment/Fees: I accept only USD through Venmo and PayPal Friends &amp; Family (F&amp;F), preferred in that order. I do not cover any fee(s) associated with any purchase(s). When paying through PayPal, do not use Goods &amp; Services (G&amp;S). Paying through PayPal with G&amp;S or funds not from your PayPal wallet/linked bank account (i.e. credit/debit/pre-paid card, etc.) will result in a fee of $0.30 + 2.9%. G&amp;S will charge a $0.49 + 2.89% fee. If a fee is incurred, a refund would result in PayPal keeping some or all of your fee, which I will not reimburse, so please be careful.

Contact: If there is more than a half hour between our newest message and the one before it, don't expect a quick response. I respond to messages as soon as I am aware of them.

Dual Redeems/Splits: I can check any code upon request and provide a for-sure answer as to whether or not it is a dual redeem. Otherwise, assume all codes are dual redeems/splits."

I applied to 100 applications and I’ve only gotten 1 technical interview with a Faang company that didn’t work out. I’ve received coding assessments and I didn’t do too well in them especially with code signal. Also, there was this one other company that gave me a coding assessment which I passed all test cases and I felt like I explained my solution well, yet still managed to get rejected .

What am I doing wrong here ? I’m a junior and I have multiple projects along with 1 technical internship and 3 non technical internships on my resume. Idk what it is I’m doing wrong when companies don’t give you feedback post interview"

r1sybl,6,2021-11-25,Final profile review,yellow_flash2,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/r1sybl/final_profile_review/,"So this is the last time I am gonna try for a profile review before submitting my applications. This is mostly to calm my nerves or prepare for the worst more than anything else. Thank you for your time. I felt like shit looking at some profiles here for stanford MSCS so I want to get a realistic view or opinion. My CGPA is pretty low for a student from a tier 2 uni. I also got a couple of D grades in some subjects, so shitting bricks here lol.

UG: Tier 2 Private college in India

CGPA: 8.06 / 10 --  My minor was in computational mathematics and in most math subjects I got B, A, A+. Rising trend in the last 3 semesters. Did well in first 2 semesters math courses (B, A grades). Basically fucked up some CS courses but did really well in math courses.

&amp;#x200B;

Publications:

1. student abstract at AAAI (CORE rank A\*) -- second author (Top 10% in abstracts selected for spotlight presentation, invited to NYC)
2. full paper at International Semantic  Web Conference (CORE rank A ) -- co-first author (Flagship conf for semantic web)
3. NeurIPS 2020 workshop paper on uncertainty quantification and Bayesian NN -- second author (out of 3)
4. A benchmarking paper that got accepted in west coast NLP 2021 conference. 5 (/6)th author (not that impactful)
5. First author workshop paper on generative models for molecules submitted, results due.

NOTE: I think the papers are of good quality but they are not full papers, that's what I am worried about. I have one full paper that is good quality and good conference. Not sure if this can compensate for the average GPA

Work/research  exp:

Disclaimer: English is not my first language.   


I am currently doing an internship at an IT Company and we have a very curios case of witchery.   


It all started with a Client telling us that their Computer started refusing to shut down.   
At first I suspected that there might be a problem with the fast startup option so I turned that off. Problem persisted.   
Then I disabled the network adapter abilitie to wake up and turn on the computer.   
Problem persisted.   
Then I edited the registry from ""PowerDownAfterShutdown"" to Value 1.   
Problem persisted.   
Then I used the hard shut down cmd. Again, the Computer decided to start again.  
   
Curiously I noticed that the Computer would immedeatly start running after I plugged in the power cord because the only way to have this device stay offline was unplugging the power cord.   


After having a ""lovely"" conversation with the DELL customer Support and describing them what I tried as well as the issue with the computer immedeatly turning on after plugging in the power cord they told me to reinstall Win10. So I did just that. The Problem however persisted.   
Then Dell sent out a technician to replace the Mainboard. The Problem persisted tho.   
We had an old spare power adapter lying around so we switched power adapters and still the problem persisted. Finally we changed the cable connecting the mainboard to the power button but the problem still persisted. I even checked wether or not the front casing was somehow pressing the power button. We swapped CPU as well as Ram Stick and still the problem persists. What the hell is going on here? 

The most mind boggling thing is, yesterday afternoon the computer, for the first time, shut down properly, despite the Power Cord still plugged in. But this morning.. it refused to shut down again. My colleagues and I are at our wits end here.   
Obviously we could just demand Dell to replace the entire Computer, we do still have the warranty,   
But this thing got me on edge and I really want to know what the hell is going on.   


The Specs:   
OptiPlex 3060 Dell   
OS: Win10 Enterprise 64x / Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS   
Mainboard: Cougar MT 17539-1  
Bios: Dell 1.15.0  
8GB Ram AMD Dimm Synchron 2666 MHz  
CPU: Intel i3-8100 3,6GHz 4 Cores  


Please let me know if you had a similar case or have any kind of clue what the hell is going on here. 

Help me r/techsupport you are my only hope."

I go to a normal school , have normal internships (FICO ,HP, Cisco), live in a normal city (Oklahoma), wear normal clothes, have a normal haircut, and use normal words.

My life has essentially been optimized for normal . The issue is, I'm friends with people that are either very arrogant or incredibly humble.   
One inappropriately flaunts his prestigious school (MIT, Caltech, Harvard) during parties, has gotten kicked out of several internships (Jane Street, Google Brain, Citadel) because of his arrogance, and lives in an arrogant city (NYC, Dubai).  
The other goes to a humble school (Berkeley, Waterloo, CMU), has humble internships (Facebook, HRT, Google \[not google Brain\]), lives in a humble city (Bay Area), wears humbling clothes, has a humble haircut, and uses humble words. 

I'm seriously not sure what to do here. I like them but they seriously don't pass the vibe check. Any advice on finding someone in my caliber of normalcy?"

My friend (26M, lives in India) was hired by distant relatives to work in their German company as a programmer. He works about 3-4 hours a day and was considered as an (unpaid) intern for the first 6 months, then he was paid 200 euros per month. 

He accepted it because he was an undergrad and the tech they're working on is pretty advanced so it would look good on his resume. 

He moved to London on scholarship for his masters and now the 200 euros per month is not enough for his expenses. 

My question is does he have any legal standing in asking for a raise, or is it hopeless and he should just find another better-paying job?"
r1zq5z,7,2021-11-25,No recommendation letter from my postdoc advisor,Lost-Astronomer-65,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/r1zq5z/no_recommendation_letter_from_my_postdoc_advisor/,"I am in STEM and will be applying to faculty (US) positions this cycle. However, I do not want to get a letter of recommendation from my post-doc advisor and I am afraid that this will be a red flag...

The reason is that he was extremely discriminatory towards female students in the group, after which we contacted the department's diversity office (3 female students in total). The department took this very seriously and told us they would talk to him. A short time later, the students were transferred to other groups and the professor moved to another university (I am not sure whether his departure is related to our case).

During my postdoc, my advisor was always threatening people with negative letters of recommendation (e.g., ""if you go to this internship instead of working at the lab during summer, I will write you a negative letter of recommendation""). And after we talked to the department, he made some comments suggesting that he knows I was one of the people involved in the case (and honestly, it's impossible that he does not know, because the department wanted specific examples from us so they could talk to him and correct his behavior with concrete examples).

So I feel like he will want to get even, and given his past of threatening others with negative letters, I am sure he will do the same to me. On the other hand, if I do not get a letter of recommendation from him, what would the schools I apply to think of me?

I talked to the diversity office, and the head of the department decided to write me a letter of reference instead. But I am afraid it will be a standard reference letter and will not make much difference since I have not worked with him.

What should I do? I do not think I can explain this situation in my applications as it would sound weird, but I feel that without a letter from my postdoc advisor I have no chance as people will wonder why.

On the other hand, I do not think I can ask the department head to explain this situation in his letter as it would sound strange as well...

Is there anything I can do or should I just submit my application without his letter and hope that the people reviewing my applications will not notice that I do not have a letter from him?"
r201v3,97,2021-11-25,I’ve never been better,duck_princess,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/r201v3/ive_never_been_better/,"I know that there’s a lot of posts like this on here but I’d like to share a bit of my story. 
Two and a half years ago I was on the verge of dropping out because computer science was overwhelming and I felt like I was behind everyone else and couldn’t possibly reach their level. I barely passed the most important CS exam of my first year with 52 points (needed 51 to pass).
I didn’t drop out but I was still super stressed about my exams. After every exam season, I’d be sick for like a week because of how much I pushed myself and because of the amount of stress during those months. 
Last year I decided that finishing school is just simply not worth losing my health and the best years of my life and I decided to just relax a bit and believe in myself and my abilities. If I fail a class, it’s not because I’m stupid, it’s because I didn’t manage my time well or underestimated its complexity or maybe it was just too hard. 
I applied for some internships because a friend made me do it, not expecting much from it.  
Fast forward to right now: I just got a returning summer internship offer at Google, I’m doing a spring internship at Microsoft and I’ve got an interview with a Facebook team in a week. I took a gap year last year to fix my mental health and learn to be kinder to myself. 
If I hadn’t stopped being so strict and borderline abusive to myself, I would have never gotten any of these opportunities. Please be nice to yourself. It’s ok to fail and it’s ok to be overwhelmed."

I've seen other posts where people said that after 1-2 weeks, if you haven't heard back, you should email the recruiter.

However, the issue is that I submitted my applications directly via their website, so I've got nobody to contact. 

Also, for both companies I applied at a ""normal"" internship position and a first year-specitic position, so I think I am qualified for most of these positions.

I have no idea what to do: I haven't been rejected, but it's been practically two damn months!! And even if I get contacted, there's still the interviews, during which I might very well be rejected, as an introvert, speaking to strangers, especially for a reason like this is really not my forte"

I'm very tired of it, living. 

I know I'm given so many resources but the guilt and the worrying doesnt stop ever. 

Maybe I am happy but I think I dislike being happy. I do laugh but I think that's not relaxed. I'm always uncomfortable or overly conscious. I also fall into delusions and fantasies no matter how hard I try not to.
I do get guilt and flashbacks of particular cringe but that punishment hardly gives any satisfaction or relief in its passing.

I have so failed as a person to be good at any aspect. And the worst is I'm still doing nothing.

I did nothing of use in school. Studies mediocre, interests or hobbies none. I haven't helped my mentally struggling mother for a long long time, nor do I think I have the strength to. I never had any close reliable relations, save my sibling who I've burdened so much already so far living. I have no friends, I didn't want any or was unable to keep them. I've never achieved anything like a lemon race or even being good at playing catch. I

I'm a waste of resources I wish I simply wasnt there it feels shameful. I try to take up less resources monetary or otherwise but that often contradicts with doing things properly so I relent (and oftentimes end up relishing them).


College seemed to be working for me. Even now I was in peace technically. Yet I'm not resilient, I've not grown but shrunk in character. College is about to end and I'm not going out banging.

Some 2 years back I joined college, after doing terribly at school despite all support. In college i could obsessively study and do chores it felt like it was almost ok by being so busy. I was stressed a bit but it felt ok. I was scoring well academically.
But then corona happened and i came back, to be honest i was slipping a bit before then watching too much tv. I made no friends but those I spoke to in college.
 Now I've lost track of time here at home. It seems online classes or college dont engage me anymore. I'm very behind my peers speaking of experience (I have done but 1 internship, theirs I know courtesy of LinkedIn). I'm wasting my time so much and I'm not enjoying myself either. Despite knowing this I'm not doing anything. 

I have nothing behind me to hold, I'm doing nothing worthwhile, and the future despite a worrying has seeming nothing. All due to my own pathetic existence.

On paper, I have pretty a decent experience and grades, but I do struggle with your typical leetcode questions. 

I just got an offer as a Systems Engineer Intern at a pretty big company, decent pay, housing offered and only after a single interview (also partially why I'm on the fence). They seem pretty eager to have me on but want me to decide soon (gave me less than a week to decide, they like to have everyone by November). But what I'm moreso worried is I don't know if I'm exactly interested in systems, it sounds like there'll be a good amount of dev-ops work, a bit of scripting, maybe some experience with embedded systems. They did mention this could transition full time and being a big company, there's a chance I could always go to another sector I'm more interested in, but right now I know that I love something more software focused, more specifically full-stack dev.

I still have interviews coming up with companies I'm more interested in, but should I decline in hopes I'll get something better or should I simply just take it and see how it goes? This is all new to me so any wise advice would help out 😅"
r22t8d,30,2021-11-25,I realized I was antiwork before even knowing about this sub,tildivorcedouspart,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/r22t8d/i_realized_i_was_antiwork_before_even_knowing/,"I’m your average millennial who started my young adult “professional” life trying as hard as I could to claw my way into stability. My first salaried job post-college, in 2012, paid $28k, which was barely enough to cover basics in the city I lived in at the time (Denver). I tried to negotiate for a higher starting salary and the woman who would become my boss told me I was lucky to be getting the offer I got. I spent two years with that company and at one point, after having beers with my colleagues, realized that the pay differences between us was staggering. The environment was toxic and I left not long after that was revealed. 

After I quit, I went to work for a small startup that promised big growth. Was laid off within two months, and denied unemployment benefits because I hadn’t been with the new employers long enough.

Ended up picking up an hourly job with a sub shop for a few months. Some other shit was happening in my life that was causing big time anxiety and insomnia, so I had to call in a few times. Was told I needed a doctors note to be able to miss my shifts. 

Got hired a few months later as a temp/contract-to-hire worker at a place that promised to bring me &amp; a few others on to salary after a 3-month probation period. Not long after, the company went on a hiring freeze with no specific end date. I had no benefits, no PTO, no healthcare. I demanded a raise via the agency I was contracted through. Got it, and was put on salary about a year in. 

It was at this time I decided I wanted a career that was fulfilling and meaningful. Applied to graduate school to become a mental health therapist. Got a better job with a company that provided flexibility, but a shitty high school environment and cliquey departments. Was pressured into a questionable interaction with a male coworker who was drunk; was subsequently pushed out of the “inner circle” and took a completely hands off approach to the team. I came in, did my work, and went home. Didn’t felt like I could take it to HR or mgmt because the dude was a favorite and he was drunk/i was sober. 

Eventually graduated after 1000+ hours of unpaid internship and thousands of dollars spent on loans. 

My first job as a therapist paid decently, but required on-call shifts and hours on being on the road, going to peoples houses and putting extra wear on my own car. 

Then covid hit. Everything went online and made the job 100x harder. Mgmt told us to act as though everything was normal. No changes to work hours, we’d just be doing it from home instead. Nearly burnt out of the industry, but ended up quitting that job and moving cross country to be with my partner in June 2020. 

First job i got in my new state was another in-home therapist job. Paid mileage reimbursement at under the federal standard rate. expected us to drive between four different counties to under-served populations. We didn’t have access to PTO for the first year.  Mgmt didn’t listen to therapists when we said we were burnt out and drowning. They brought us baskets with candy and markers, and had us talk about why we love what we do. They had me work from home after I contracted covid on the job, while I was sick. They required all employees to participate in annual fundraising for the company. There were many times when, after a client family canceled sessions with me because they couldn’t handle the burden of it, I was told to reschedule for friday afternoon or even the weekend if i had to. I didn’t. Basically refused. I quit after 3 months. 

After that, i started with a group practice. I was so excited. But the promises the owner made were mostly smoke and mirrors. I earned a flat rate of $30/client session, and I ended up making only slightly more than my very first job out of undergrad, but i was a contractor so there were no benefits, no PTO, no protection against clients not showing up, so i’d have to eat the cost. I brought the issue up several times with the owner, and explained that it was negatively impacting my work with clients because i was so stressed, and he told me things would be better once i got my independent license and a wait list—that i’d have to just wait until then. 

last friday was my last day with that group. when i put in my verbal notice, the owner immediately started asking me to encourage past colleagues to apply. he told me i wasn’t supposed to offer my patients continuity of care by telling them where i’d be practicing after i left. i thanked him for the opportunity and sad i was grateful for his help, and his response was, “i hope you’re grateful.”

literally fuck all that noise. i’ve got my independent license and am now my own boss. I charge a rate that allows me to live comfortably, that allows me to pay bills and save for PTO, vacations, etc. I work when I want. My niche area of practice is working with helping professionals who are experiencing burnout. 

seriously. i’d consider myself lucky and my experiences have, at times, been shitty, life-draining, and even soul-crushing. i’ve finally decided to be my own boss after a decade working for other’s dreams. i don’t know that i could ever go back."

I really love coding and have been coding since my senior year in high school. I am a junior in college now and am beginning my search for internships, but personally I feel like my situation is pretty bleak. I see all my friends around my getting these crazy FAANG internships and offers and putting in a massive amount of time coding like crazy, spending hours and hours writing code that isn't even for school assignments. It seems like everyone is pulling ahead of me, I feel so behind. Like I said, I recently started applying to internships. I got 3 coding challenges so far, I have done 1 for Twitter but I completely bombed it.

&amp;#x200B;

I see everyone on this subreddit talking about having spent all summer doing LeetCode and I only just discovered what it is. I feel very underprepared, especially because my CS classes up to this point have been mainly intro classes. I had the misfortune of not being able to get into the CS major at UCSD (I got in as undeclared), and had to transfer out to CC and now I am at CSULB. But my time as UCSD was spent doing Java intro courses, and at CC was spent doing C++ intro courses. The only non intro courses I have taken for real programming is data structures and some algorithms, so I really have no big projects that I can put on my resume to impress employers.

&amp;#x200B;

I have so many questions and am having a hard time finding answers. Has everyone already gotten their internship offers? Is it too late now for me? Is there even a possibility that I could get a FAANG offer? How long do I have until all the internships are gone? Have I started too late to catch up? And what do I do to move forward from here? Should I be preparing for coding challenges by practicing on LeetCode? Should I be creating a project that I can put on my resume? Or should I just keep applying to internships and hope one sticks? Please, if someone can offer me some peace of mind or slap me with a hard truth, I just want a way to move forward and know what's going on."

r23nfj,1181,2021-11-25,I got a 600k offer!,[deleted],csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/r23nfj/i_got_a_600k_offer/,"It may not be as great as the people who get million dollar new grad offers from unicorns but I come from humble roots (Amazon intern at a T25). I remember the days I had to struggle not being able to UberX and being forced to wait an extra 10 minutes only to be driven in a Honda to school. Or eating from 5 Guys instead of 5 Michelin star restaurants. I also started CS somewhat late (15 years old). 

I worked hard to get an offer at a trading firm, but I was sad to find out it was only 350k. That night I cried myself to sleep alone on my bed, and decided it was time to stop playing Genshin over the weekends and start coding ASIC HFT bots. I spent two months locked in my room without going outside (as opposed to leaving it unlocked) learning how to read machine code and compile it in my head. On interview day with the company I coded an LLVM on the spot. I can’t say the company name but it does rhyme with HenTech.

This community has helped me along the way, making me realize what I could accomplish."
r23u3q,0,2021-11-25,Clarifying Questions,JBeast22,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/r23u3q/clarifying_questions/,"Are clarifying questions always recommended to do? How would you come up with any if the problem they give you seems pretty straight forward or if you recognize the question. There must be a line between a clarifying question and a stupid question. I have a  meta swe intern interview coming up and don’t want to give a bad impression if I recognize a problem and want to just jump into explaining the brute force algorithm -&gt; optimal solution. Also, if I see an unfamiliar problem, is it weird to take a min or two to just process the question in my head before starting to talk?"
r24vsl,990,2021-11-25,[Meta] There is a lot of blind leading the blind here. Be skeptical of answers here sometimes and do your due diligence.,Stock-Flatworm-364,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/r24vsl/meta_there_is_a_lot_of_blind_leading_the_blind/,"First and foremost, I just want to say that this is an  indispensable resource for many — me included. There is a wealth of information and I’ve secured amazing internships and have learned so much through because of this community. However, I see many questions with answers that are just flat out wrong. Typically, these wrong answers are downvoted, but I’ve seen some bad top voted answers that are on popular posts. And it seems like it’s more frequent now a days. 

For example, I saw a question that was asked what math do I need to know for Introduction to Algorithms by CLRS. This person stated that he had a weak background and wanted to do ensure he had the proper math background before he read it. The top comment was a list that extremely wrong and very misleading. It wanted OP to learn calculus before basic trigonometry and had linear algebra before algebra 1. It was very absurd, but stated so matter of fact AND was the top comment. OP and other commenters were thanking this comment and it was painful. 

That’s just one example, but when directing someone’s future and studies, there should be a certain amount of responsibility when answering questions. I don’t know how to solve this problem. Perhaps having a flair that specifies the ethos of the person responding. And if you are not sure or if it’s an opinion, preface your answer with that. 

Take answers with a grain of salt and do your due diligence."

I'm a senior ME student with a minor in CS. I really liked my controls courses, and my senior design project is very robotics-forward-- I'm not afraid of an electron or two. I really like the software stuff too (hence the minor).

'Tis the season for applying to grad schools and jobs. I would love any insight or perspective on programs or career paths that might be a good fit or worth looking into. As per the title, I'm considering applying to some Master's programs in Controls, and some in Embedded systems (even though that is more EE-adjacent). I'm also considering saying ""I'm too cool for school"" and trying to just graduate and get a job somewhere doing something along these lines (my internship experience wasn't very similar, so I'm very worried about trying to do this). I have fairly good grades.

Thanks in advance!!"

Current CGPA: 7.61 B.Tech Electronics and Communication Engineering Tier 3 college

I'm still doing my final year of undergrad.

Research Experience: None

Industrial internships: 2: 1 in Internet of Things (2 months), the other in Robotics(3 months).

Projects: 5. 3 of them related to the degree I am applying to. The other 2 related to programming

GRE:322(Q-165,V-157)

TOEFL: 109

I have a pretty good SOP, and 3 LORs that's from professors who know me well

Colleges I am thinking about:

ASU

Ohio State

Stony Brook

Purdue

UT Dallas

UCSB

Do you think I stand a chance? Or should I get more research/work experience?"
r25z69,0,2021-11-25,Do I have a shot?,manbeltran,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/r25z69/do_i_have_a_shot/,"Long story short, I dropped out of undergrad (PoliSci) but I want to pursue CS now.

I was doing undergrad and studying Political Science but basically started doing so bad that I decided to stop going because it wasn't worth my time. I was having a ton of issues with my family which resulted in a ton of anxiety, inability to focus, and general lack of interest in school. I also realized that I hate political science and I had absolutely no interest in pursuing a career in politics. I wasn't even going to class. I stopped attending university and decided to take some time off to get my life back on track.

&amp;#x200B;

For the past 6 months I've developed a huge interest in pursuing a career in CS but I feel like I'm so far behind the competition, how could I ever be competetive?

&amp;#x200B;

I've gone through some online resources to learn the basics and completed 1 month of a fullstack development bootcamp. It's time to decide whether or not I will continue with the entire extended program which is 9 months, and as much as I want to I can't help but feel that I will not learn enough to get my career started.

Can I still be considered for internships?

Will employers look down on me for not completing a 4 year CS degree?

What the hell do I do to ensure I'm as competitive as someone with a 4 year CS degree?"

r27bgf,11,2021-11-25,"Just quit from a firm that is most of my colleagues' ""dream job""",LaserShotgun,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/r27bgf/just_quit_from_a_firm_that_is_most_of_my/,"Quick backstory, I'm 19 and in law school, I managed to land an internship on a small-ish company, then one of the biggest corporate law firms in the country contacted me so I could become their intern. You guys see where this is going.

The supervisor that contacted me said they had an urgent need for an intern (red flag #1), so I would have to start on the other week (they contacted me on a wednesday and wanted me to start monday), so I quit my pretty decent homeoffice job at the previous company and went there. They were really fucked because the previous intern was about to quit, so they wanted me there before they even signed my contract (red flag #2) so I could learn the ins-n-outs of the job. Aight, I went there, learned the ropes and formally started on the other week. From day 1, the other interns said that staying up to 10-11pm was normal. What. The. Fuck.

For reference, my country has a very strict law regarding internships. Max 6hrs/day, the employee has to provide some sort of food if they hire you for 6hrs, when you're in exam week at your uni you are legally permitted to only work 3hrs per day, amongst other things.

So not only were the interns, who were also huge dickheads, being GROSSLY overworked, they had to pay for their own food because the firm didn't give us anything, the salary, which the supervisor said was above average, is literally minimum wage (it scales semestrally tbf), they don't cover your transport fees and **we were limited to two coffees per day, up until 5pm**. Yes, you read that right. They also made some fucked vacation decisions on their employees behalf but not really worth mentioning.

So, I'm missing class, the coworkers lack class consciousness and feel prideful for being overworked, my parents are pissed that I'm missing my classes, they barely pay me, the bosses are very rude, the office literally doesn't have windows. So today I texted my supervisor to say that *unfortunately* I'm quitting. I shit you not, the instant I texted her she *calls me* and fucking apologizes for her rude behavior recently and basically begs me to come in for the rest of the month, because here's a funny thing about big law firms: they take on *way* more cases than they can handle. So if I just stop showing up, a sector of the firm basically implodes. I agreed and will be coming over until next Tuesday, then I'll find a better job, which won't be hard because I burn myself out academically so my CV looks amazing.

The best part of all this? The other interns tried to make me feel regretful over leaving. One girl went as far as saying ""actually, you leaving is probably better for 'the team', people line up to have a shot at this job"" to which I replied ""eh, I'm not really worried about finding a better place to work at, my curriculum ain't half bad; I'll miss you guys though!"" And I got to watch her *seething*. Totally worth it."

Initially, I wanted to do IB but overtime, I’ve realized it really isn’t for me. I’ve found that I have a knack for programming and heavy probability based math through my coursework and want to break into Quantitative Finance as a result. My question is: how do I go forward?

I have experience as a intern scout in VC, a “Quant” at a student run crypto fund, and as a research intern at an IB. My GPA is fairly strong for my school and we do have master programs for “Financial Engineering”.

I’m able to use numerous programming languages, have knowledge about different quant strategy types, and am fairly skilled with probability models (Got an A in a course that was an abridged version of a PhD course).

Should I graduate and try to work for a little before getting a masters? Is it even possible with my credentials to land quant work out of undergrad? Would the financial engineering masters degree help or should I go for a standard math/cs major? Lastly, which quant roles would I be suited for based on my background and what are the differences in compensation?

Thanks in advanced!"

I've never had to apparent shop before and I'm having trouble finding one bedrooms that I can lease for less than 12 months and are from companies with good reviews.  I've been looking on apartments.com but a ton of the places that come up ate managed by a company that only does 12 month leases even though the listings on apartments.com all say 6-12 month leases.  

My advisor suggested looking at the local college's website and seeing what housing they recommended and so I did that and found some places that had reasonable prices but they're all for 2+ bedrooms and since I'm going by myself they'd assign me roommates themselves, which is risky, because I could end up matched with people I don't get along with at all.  Plus, apparently the college in the area is known as a party school and that is SO not my thing, so I don't want get matched up with students who might want to have parties in the apartment regularly.  Plus, since those places aim to rent to college students, they may not want to rent to me all the way through August.  The one place I called so far said they could only do through the end of July.  

Any advice?  I'm feeling really stressed and overwhelmed as I really don't know how to go about this process.  The company recruiter who reached out to me and made the offer after my interview with a manager was no help.  I think part of it is that a lot of people are out of the office for the holiday weekend, but they want me to start on January 4th if possible, so I really need to find something ASAP."

I didn't really have any close relationships with any of the professors that have taught me so I thought that those professors would probably end up writing fairly generic rec letters that wouldn't say much beyond that I did well in their class while I worked pretty closely with all the recommenders I'm currently asking and am confident that I can receive some fairly good recommendations from them that speak well to both my research ability as well as competence in the field of CS. I'm now wondering if it's even worth applying to those schools that recommend having a professor who taught you write you a rec letter as it's probably a bit too late for me to ask my professors for letters.

Yet somehow, I can't stop thinking about the possibility of getting a job at a better company, with even higher pay. I know it's a somewhat okay thing to want, but considering I was jobless and desperate a few months ago, why cant I just be satisfied and happy with what I have? For more than a couple of hours after getting the job I guess. 

This is probably a very common thing among this field, and seeing people getting jobs that pay a fuck ton doesn't help the feeling either. Anyway kind of a vent-ish post, but if anyone who's struggled with this has some words of wisdom, please share away! I just feel somewhat ungrateful being dissatisfied with anything I get. I'm sure even if I got a job at say, Facebook, getting paid like 200k+ fresh of undergrad, I'd still find some way to want what someone else has.

I have 2.5 years of experience as a Software Engineer, currently working at a FAANG in Canada. I have a Bachelors degree in CS, but I’m interested in the idea of studying full time and getting a Masters in the USA mostly to meet new people, explore a different country, and learn more about advanced topics in CS in an academic setting among other reasons. I know that I’d be missing out on a lot of money as a result. Though I know that working full time while studying for your Masters is a path many take, I’m a bit turned off by the idea of potentially burning out.

So I do have some questions - is it possible to intern at companies during summers as a Masters student despite already having 2.5+ years of experience? I’d like to make money and work short stints at companies without having to fully commit for the long term between school years.

If I were to work full time while studying, is it possible to take a really long time completing a Masters degree, say 3 or more or years potentially without it negatively affecting my resume?

Any other input is appreciated. Thanks everyone!"

I never knew where life would take me so mostly i was all over the place I tried to do what i liked.

As a result I finished a bachelor's degree in computer science and during that time took interest in internships for companies that worked in web design, programming and banking /insurance companies. 

But after i finished my bachelor's degree i started my master's degree in computer science. I was about to get a job on a junior position in software engineering at BGL group in UK but my parents didn't let me.

While at my master degree i worked for Honeywell as a data analyst (i was processing invoices,  ordering materials for projects,  making sure that i liaison with the project managers and our finances go well in UK, Ireland and Netherlands).

When i started i was offered a job in programming with python but i refused it because i already started at Honeywell and i considered it much more important as it would be nice in CV to say that i worked for a multinational corporation. 

Then after 2 years i decided to move to UK and i did successfully but i moved during lockdown and there were no jobs available. As a result i manged to find a job as a recovery support worker and it's been amazing so far as i only make sure the people are getting their medicines and i spend time with them going out and doing constructive stuff together. 

However now the jobs are finally back on indeed and start to rise up like mushrooms after rain. But there are so many people applying that it doesn't give me any chance to get selected (we talk about hundreds of applicants for one position).

I try to find a job as junior developer.  Sometimes i get to the interviews but no further than that. Sometimes i am being given tests and problems to solve and i ace them, some times i find them so difficult that i can't type a word of it.

I also love to build computers and i tried to startup my own business with no success due to chip shortage and lack of promotion.

So now I don't know where to go in order to grow as i am being a bit discouraged after so many failed attempts at finding a job in programming.

I was thinking that maybe i could try some cisco courses but i am not sure to be honest. As i couldn't find any at the universities, i was told there aren't enough students interested in them so they just cancelled those.

I was also thinking to join a school to study for medical assistant position. I would love that since i already work with people, even if i am not a doctor i could help more people if i would work in a hospital. 

I don't know what to do next. The way i see it i can try more with programming (but it pays less at first than my current job, and even if it gets better later its soo much more stressful). I can try to do a cisco course online while working here or i could try to pursue a career as medical assistant as i would love to help more than a couple of people. 

What do you think?"

Compensation: Apple (7K per month + 1K stipend or housing), Facebook (8K per month + housing), Trading firm (13K per month + 12K signing, so 25K first month + housing) - these are for internships

Any advice? (Also reach out if you want advice recruiting and getting interviews, I know some great hacks to prepare and get recruiters attention)

Edit: adding more info so people stop blowing up my DMs; stopped focusing on leetcodes (did around 10 questions) focused on principles of interviews (about 40 questions covering all strategies) and updated linkedin with interesting live projects (had two companies and got funding, started biomedical tech company); created targeted ads on Facebook (now meta) with my resume and info; reached out to alumni and recruiters then reached out; also only applied to around 6 companies"
r2nqv2,5,2021-11-26,i want to die,Im_Yamabushi,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/r2nqv2/i_want_to_die/,"hey..hum...i'm 19 years old, guy. So, i will go straight to the point. i have serious problems of depression, anxiety, insecurity, insomnia, my self-steem is almost nonexistent, antisocial and all of that stuff. i went to a lot of psychologists and psychiatrists for years, and none of them could resolve my depression. i have medicines to sleep and so, but in all my life i never felt happy, only the days that i was only a child when i didn't understand life. i have a pretty bad relationships with my parents, the story is very very long so i will not talk about everything that happened.

On my school times, that was the WORST period of my entire life: bully, rejected, my parents pressing me all the time and all about that. I tried to commit suicide 4 times almost in the same year, i didn't go to hospital, but i harmed myself but i could hide it. I don't trust people, everyone that i knew harmed me, and i was stupid enough to trust them in the past.

I feel like i'm cursed, everything turns to difficult my life and make me sad. I got into a point that i'm an apathic person with no hope, looking like a zombie and just saying whatever, and when things get in the wrong way, i just say ""yeah...i knew it"". Nothing can make me feel happy anymore, i just do my hobbies that is playing videogames, and even that can't make me happy yet, because my computer is not the best one, and i want to play games that need better specs. i'm an intern now, so i got my money, but it isn't enough and to buy a decent computer, i need to work for ages without spending a single money. i live in Brazil, so i think that you know a little how is life here.

In terms of relationship, i'm starting to give up on that thing, because all my relationships got so fucking bad, i was changed to other stupid guy, people lied to me, people said horrible things to me and everything its bad. In this year, i dated a girl for 6 months, and it was perfect, i thought that i found the ""special one"", we had so much in common and we were a good couple. but then she came to me and said that she were not feeling well and wanted time to recover herself, but as i already knew, she broked up with me, and some time later she was with another person. we are still friends, but you know...my heart isn't the same anymore, i'm not the same anymore. i sufferred my whole entire life, and please don't come into this post and say ""well, at least you're not with cancer dying on a bed"" this will only make me feel worst, everyone has their problems.

And the worst: i can't be myself in front of the others and this always make me sad. my parents got some strictful rules of behaviour when i was young, and they also compared me with other boys at my age, and that of course brought some consequences to me. when i'm near people, it's like i put a mask on, and i start to act like other person. i always get myself laughing with people and then i realize things and i get really really sad. i'm putting very effort to break these chains, but i'm not making it.

Well...i guess it's only i can say, i already said a lot of things, very very summarized but i said. i got to a point that i just want to lay on bed, close my eyes, and never wake up. i don't have any hope, things just don't work, everytime that i'm close to get a dream becomes reality, something happens and i fall again. so yeah, i just want to die and leave this stupid life that never gets better..."

With that said, I am probably going to be making a career/field switch and begin a 2 year accelerated software engineering program in 2023 if I can’t land an internship as someone self-taught by then. 

I’ve constantly heard about age bias being a thing, but I’ve never really understood why. In fact, it’s almost counter intuitive to me. So I’m curious if the more experienced people in software engineering have seen this to be true when they hire, and if so, why do you think that is?"

r2uakh,6,2021-11-26,PwC - Business Development &amp; Research internship. Any good?,metiano,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/r2uakh/pwc_business_development_research_internship_any/,"Hi guys. I’ve applied for a 6 months internship role at PwC and I’ve secured a role this coming January 2022. The role is Business Development &amp; Research where we essentially support in managing day-to-day firm-wide research requests utilizing economic research tools like Bloomberg, Factiva, Emerging Market ISI, Capital IQ, Experian, etc and also identify market opportunities in the public sector. Essentially, we’ll do a lot of economic research.

This is an Internal Firm Services where we need to provide strategic support to other departments mainly advisory.

Based on the job description, we’ll also need to provide research and analytical support in determining business opportunities in relation to topics such as ESG, sustainability and digital.

So I’m wondering, will this internship be a good stepping stone for me to enter Investment Banking role such as Equity Research at other firms once I graduated? With all the aforementioned potential tasks that I will undertake and utilizing tools such as Bloomberg, will this be a good exposure for me?

I’ve applied other role such as Deals Advisory, FDD but it’s fully occupied hence the only role that relates to economic research is the Business Development Research role.

I’ve also undertook a few internship (voluntary whilst studying) in Audit at other big 4. This upcoming internship at PwC (mandatory internship as per uni) will be my last internship before I graduate and I have an interest upon starting my first full time career in the capital markets domain.

It’d be great if anyone could shed some light on this. 

Thank you :)"

I'm currently a first year at college and was planning on double majoring in math and computer science. I managed to find a swe internship for the summer and am pretty excited about it! As I'm looking at classes to take next year, I'm realizing that I'd much rather take classes in pure math and cs theory as opposed to programming-heavy classes.

Since I have an internship, how much does having ""computer science"" on my resume really matter as I apply for more tech internships, and finally a full time job? I guess I'm asking if just a straight up math major can become a swe as long as they have internships? Admittedly, the company I got the internship at isn't exactly FAANG level as far as prestige goes, so I'm a bit doubtful.

Anyways, thoughts?"

I would say I am only a beginner at java, as I will soon be finishing up my intro to software design class, and its the first class CS majors take at my school. 

I got a variety of tips on things to do, like work on side projects, or pick up other languages. My next semester courses will mainly cover more advanced java topics, and briefly on python. After that I will be taking Computer Organization, which goes over C and Linux, and Data Structures &amp; Algorithms. 

Many of my peers now are applying for internships, getting involved with research, or with CS-related clubs and activities. I am slightly behind on the CS track as I transferred from community college to my University this semester (originally focused on finishing up my gen Eds), and was too late on joining any extra-curriculars this semester.

 I cant help but feel my experience is lacking, so I resolved to get involved with CS research with a Professor, and more clubs at my school this Spring. There is also a CS career fair in the spring that I want to prepare for as well so that I can maximize my chances at landing a summer internship.

However, I still have winter break, and I really want to make the best use of this time. Theres so many different things I could start on thats its overwhelming. Should I just start learning more languages? If so, which ones? Should I keep working on java by doing a java side project or two? What would be an appropriate side project for my skill level?  I have a good understanding of everything we went over in class (Maps, sets, Lists, arrays, OOP, Input/Output, control structures, testing, etc)"

r2yuh4,4,2021-11-26,Career Advice (First internship @ Amazon),SupSat,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/r2yuh4/career_advice_first_internship_amazon/,"Hello there!

Some background before I get started:

* 2nd Year CS Major
* No prior experience
* Amazon Internship Offer
   * Year round role
   * More hands on experience than a typical internship because of the length/ duration of it
* Money received from internships is a factor, but far from the most important thing to me
* State School

So, I know it is early (and I haven't even formally accepted my offer yet, though I plan on it lol), but was seeking some advice from some of you guys that are more experienced. Do you think I should look to find a new internship/ role next year (asking strictly as a career choice for better leverage when I graduate, not assuming other factors) or is this all I really need for a successful future.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you all in advance!"
r30ahg,0,2021-11-26,Tech Stack for Entry Career - Java/Spring Boot or NodeJS/Express?,chris2945,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/r30ahg/tech_stack_for_entry_career_javaspring_boot_or/,"Hello,

I'm currently a CS student in Junior year gearing up for an internship before I step up into the real world. I have some small frontend projects set up for mobile app and website dev in either React Native/JS or native iOS/android as well as HTML/CSS/JS but have been looking to expand my skillset a bit to put some more side projects out there and stepping into more full-stack. 

I've played around a bit with NodeJS/Express and am not entirely a fan due to the inconsistent syntax/typing system that is used in javascript (most of my frontend experience other than React is working with OO and strongly typed languages like Swift and Java) and feel like I'd be totally more comfortable if I picked up SpringBoot/Hibernate.

From what I understand, the job market for more established businesses is oriented towards Java, however I know that Express seems to be in demand as well. My question is this - for just stepping into this realm of 'full stack', would it benefit me from a career-search standpoint to continue with NodeJS/Express or switch gears and learn Springboot?"

As a child I had been diagnosed with dyslexia and, since then, I have been indirectly branded as stupid-- segregated from my peers and taken into remedial classes for maths and literacy. It's been a huge defect on my life, has led me to being bullied and caused me an endless pit of self loathing that I had no way of coping or vanquishing. I managed to get into University and, since then, I made it my mission to be intelligent, be seen as a bright pupil and form myself into an ideal. I worked ruthlessly to get the best grades I could muster, even if it meant hours and hours in the library, burning myself out and anxiously trying to perfect the best essay I could write, trying my best to improve each time. My grades would swing heavily from Cs to HDs and, along with that, my moods would swing in response. I made it over the finishing line and got into Honours but the work accelerated and became even more difficult to stay on top of it. I was eager to be like my friends and attain Firsts, which everyone thought I could but I suffered from nervous exhaustion and I had to drop out (chronic fatigue, panic attacks, self harm). I was offered to take a Masters course at my university instead, and I was relieved that I didn't have to commit to a thesis. But the postgraduate coursework in my field is extensive and laborious and I don't know if I can still hate myself enough to keep going. In short, I've tried really hard to be gentle with myself, and in turn, it makes me lazy with my commitment to work. So I am trying to enjoy my life with other commitments (my internship, singing lessons, art gallery guiding and my job) but when it comes to essays, I can't force myself to do it anymore. It's making me really worry that I can't hate myself enough to be productive. I am bitterly jealous of others who can do multiple things at once, live completely independently, and succeed without much trouble. I live in a cycle of anxiety and procrastination which ends in numerous extensions for my work, which doesn't really assist the problem. I don't know what to do anymore. I really think I have ADHD on top of everything else-- I've made strong improvements to my trauma recovery and for the most part, I feel a million times better but I still cannot be perfect. I am unmedicated and I think seeing a psychiatrist would help. I don't want to jeopardise my studies anymore than I have. Anyway, I just need some help, some support with my work. I don't think forcing myself to be productive is working anymore- there is some part of me that is resisting it now because it's so, so, so painful, provoking every thought of my defectiveness I have instilled in me."

I have a significant student loan which I am planning to slowly pay off in a few years with my possible stipend (or job money). So, the loan is also a factor to think about.

She is convinced that she has the rights to it and I was wondering what the law states on this issue.

About 2 years ago I was hit by a car who ran away and my car was totaled. This car was my asset that was under my name. I sold my car to my insurance (I am still under my parents' car insurance) for $3,500 which went directly towards paying for the first half of my new car. I was working with my attorneys to settle this case and they were able to get me $11,000, which I was going to use to pay for my tuition and new car. My mother took $5,000 which I did not agree to but I did not argue because I knew she needed the money. She used it to pay off my credit card expenses which is linked to her account, so it is her money under my name. We have a verbal agreement that I use this card to pay for medical expenses as well as half the cost of rent for four months when I had my internship. We cosigned on the vehicle and she has been making small monthly payments to continue to pay for it until I am done with graduate school and I can pick up the payments again myself."

How is this handled at other companies? The local college focuses on STEM so I won't have an issue finding anyone. But how do you ensure they can't go in and mess anything up accidently or purposely? Accidents happen and I wouldn't give them admin but start off with basic IT support and then go from there? I also don't want them to be sitting their not gaining any new knowledge either.

Also, I understand that some will say go ahead and hire another employee. Yes thats what will probably happen but I'm wanting to give someone the chance to beef up their resume.

I identify as gay (not sure if colleges have an affirmative-action mindset for LGBT students too)

I have a resume to attach to the common app

**Intended Major:** Civil Engineering (Structural Engineering track), Grades 7-12 Math Education as a backup if civil engineering doesn't work out

**Parents:** Dad has law degree, Mom has master's degree, neither have ever attended or worked for any of my listed schools

**SAT Score:** 1450 (690 Reading and 760 Math)

**GPA:** 4.0 weighted (converted from 96 on a 0-100 scale; I have seen students with a 105 weighted GPA at my school)

**Lots of AP's under my belt:** AP World History (scored a 3), AP US History (scored a 3), AP Chemistry (scored a 4), AP Calculus BC (in progress), AP Physics C: Mechanics (in progress), AP Computer Science A (in progress), self-study AP Spanish Language and Culture (in progress)

**Dual-enrollment classes I took/am currently taking (my school has a deal with a nearby CUNY college):** Pre-Calculus, Calculus I and Analytical Geometry, Spanish I, Spanish II, Political Science (in progress), Literary Traditions in the U.S. (in progress), Understanding Literature (spring 2022)

**Other elective classes that I take/have taken:** Music Appreciation, Orchestra (three years in a row, I play the violin), Creative Writing, Introduction to Science Research, Service (basically a period where you act as a teacher's aid for a particular class)

**Volunteering/Internships:** In summer 2021 I did an internship with a senior center, where Monday-Thursday from 10 to 4 I and other teens would do activities with older adults, such as cooking, poetry writing, improvisation classes, trivia games, discussions, and tv/radio show re-enactments. The purpose of this internship was to foster intergenerational connections, dispel some common stereotypes about older people, and give these older adults a chance to socialize, given that many of them at this center live alone and are low-income.

Throughout this fall (2021), I have been doing another part-time virtual internship with the same senior center. This one is an improvisation class, and it runs once a week on Tuesdays from 4:30 to 5:45.

**Clubs I participate/have participated in:** Key Club (over 40 hours of community service!), Drama Club, GSA (Gender-Sexuality Alliance, a club for LGBT students and allies to discuss LGBT issues), Model UN, Photography Club

**Awards:** Inducted into my school's honor society (requirements are a GPA of 93+ and no disciplinary record)

**Other extracurriculars:** Weekly private violin lessons, violin practice at home, kickboxing classes at Tiger Schulman's (up until March 2020, stopped due to pandemic), riding my bike and trying to increase my stamina each time, mentoring/tutoring younger students (Big Buddy-Little Buddy program), learning how to cook family recipes for me to continue to use once I move out

In July 2020 I took a three-week introduction to Civil Engineering course offered by the Cooper Union, where I was introduced to the basics of the civil engineering profession and urban planning, as well as also taught the basics of Microsoft Excel and AutoCAD. It culminated in a 5-minute group presentation where we made a mock engineering project proposal (such as extension of a subway line or building a new bridge) that outlined the problem, our proposed solution, AutoCAD renderings of our solution, and the expected timeline and costs.

Edit: Also please chance me for scholarships if possible, thank you!

r3ml42,3,2021-11-27,A Last Goodbye,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/r3ml42/a_last_goodbye/,"First, I want to clarify that English is not my native language and that I've taken the decision to take my own life in a place I know I won't bother anyone in the next couple of days.

&amp;#x200B;

I am 23M and I was on 4th year of computer science at college outside the US. I was really good at coding, but never stood out in any specific area or language. For the last couple of years I struggled to find a decent job, even though my friends, who I always gave the answers to or who always gave the bare minimum effort at what they did at college, got high paying jobs or even internships at high level enterprises. In addition, I never got to accomplish anything by myself, because my parents always gave me everything I wanted or needed, which may seem good at first, but it never gave me a reason to work and earn money, because I knew my parents will cover my necessities. Now that I want to get a job and accomplish things for myself, I always fail to get the job because of work experience or lack of experience.

&amp;#x200B;

I also never got to experience what it felt like to be in a relationship with a woman, even though I always wanted to and worked hard on myself to be attractive to them, like most of the coaches and experts say we men should. Now I've come to the conclusion that my chances of being with a woman are basically gone, since I have no job, I'm shorter than 5'4 (since women apparently want 6'00 men) and I have no social skills. In fact, the only woman that I ever loved, and whom I wanted to spend the rest of my life with, decided to get engaged with someone I know will be an a\*\*hole to her.

&amp;#x200B;

For these reasons I've decided to take my own life, and because I want to pass out with the good memories I have with my family and friends, rather than spending another minute on this planet worrying about my future and my well-being. Thank you reddit for giving me the opportunity to share my story and for giving me the opportunity that one day, my family can read and understand what gave me the motivation to end my own life.

&amp;#x200B;

Father, mother, sister, I'm sorry. Your loving son/brother, always."

After a short time applying for internships and getting some interviews - now a take home assignment is getting to me. 

For context, I am a freshman who have done some react projects in the past and yet for this one I’m struggling really hard as to what I should be doing, as majority of my time has been spent in tutorial hell and not what I personally want to create. 

The take home assignment seem to be sent as a rolling application type of thing, so in a way, it’s more to do with chances, just like how I did it with Google Kickstart competition. The objective is simple enough - create a social media application using a backend API and some front end framework. I am not going to discuss the company nor whose backend API I will be using, as I fear that might be a bit of a dox, which I refuse to do. 

I guess my question is - is it ok to not do it immediately, but to do it after a head start and planning on what I can do ? Is it ok to use outside resources a lot (I’ve used react documentations as well as other framework documentations before to create my applications) ? Is it ok to be completely stumped as to what I should and can be doing ? 

I wish to succeed within this internship, and I’d like some advices from past and former members who have done this before."

Got the offer and still planning to go ahead and follow through with it.

Questions:

1. CPA is still a good idea to get, yes? Offer letter highlights prep course reimbursement and CPA bonus, so I'm assuming so. CFA though? Probably not?
2. Working on Excel skills and using keyboard only. Any specific skills needed for FDD?
3. Audit got a comp update and some other advisory lines in the same office did as well. Campus hire audit is now making nearly the same comp as my offer letter outlines. Email recruiter? Can't hurt right?
4. General tips?

Ive been with them for 8 months and am on a contract

In june i applied for a high school post for the same job title and in the interview i went in too broadly with my answers and ended up not getting the job, while i understand the resoning behind me nor getting chosen i still felt hurt in my self-esteem.

Fast foward to last week another post opened up in another high school for a post and i applied and went in for the interview, i went in details for most of it (im basically explaning to them my job as it is what i already do) but i felt bad about 2 particuliar questions:

First one was what is your career path like and i explained stuff i did in school and in my intern where i learned independence and time management.. i just feel like that wasnt enough.


Second one was really simple, a user calls you because their keyboard doesnt work. My instinct was saying ti remplace it id it really doesnt work but failed to explain the process of troubleshooting but since it wasnt specified what type of keyboard i also when the route of (if this is a laptop keyboard we usually switch the key that isnt inputting on the spot or change the whole laptop keyboard if its really broken)


Aside from that there was a question about a commercial printer not working where i said i would check physical components first as in is it powered on or off/ is the network cable in and working and then ask if this problem is also present with some coworkers or just them to isolate the issue.

I think i handled the other questions not mentioned like projector which i handle pretty well but i cant help but feel like i should of added more

If this ended up being given to an external candidate(internal candidate in priority) it would take a heavy hit on my esteem as in i dont know how to do my job and i can be bested by someone who never worked here.

I think i may be over exagerating myself but its a worry that is eating at me.

I want to make sure my current path is going to be enough to get into my dream schools.

So, here’s the schools: NC State, Carnegie Mellon University, and MIT. All 3, I would be going for mechanical engineering.

And here’s what I have so far:

- I’m in an engineering academy at my school, by the time I apply I will have taken 5 engineering classes and be getting ready for internships provided through the program

- Presumably around a 1550 on SAT based off practice tests (taking it in March)

- I took part in Duke TIP (Talent Identification Program) before it was dismantled during a certain virus

- Have been doing Science Olympiad since 5th grade, no breaks, not even during a certain virus. Up to 11 medals, including 4 first place and 2 second place

- Joined TSA (Technology Student Association) this year, plan to do it for the next couple years

- Plan to join the National Technology Honors Society once I’m eligible as a junior

- Straight A’s with 4.5 weighted GPA (academic is 4, honors is 4.5, AP is 5)

- Took AP World History: Modern (5 on exam), and am currently taking AP Gov. One of my engineering classes was weighted as AP but I don’t think it was an actual AP (didn’t have an exam). I also plan to take AP Calc AB and AP Physics next year

- I plan to run for leadership positions in both Science Olympiad and TSA next year!"

I am new to this community and I am curious if I would be a good candidate to eventually become a digital nomad. Hopefully I am posting in the correct place and people here are able to point me in the right direction.

I am a graduate in Civil Engineering but I did not enjoy my degree. So after college I pursued a career in Construction Estimating. After more than a year of construction estimating experience working at a Fortune 500 company, I find little enjoyment in this work as well. I feel really dumb for picking a degree that I did not enjoy and not realizing it until I started doing internships and my post grad work. Since the start of the pandemic the dream of working for a big corporate company went away and I really want to change to a job with more creativity and freedom and 100% remote work.

In saying all this I know I want to switch fields but I am not sure where. I enjoy coding and manipulating data and I am open to learning all sorts of new skills. The main priority is to have more freedom and be able to travel and visit family for extended periods of time hence wanting to pursue remote work.

**Some skills that I have that could be useful:**

* Took a couple of C programming classes in college up to Data Structures. Enjoyed the classes and excelled in them.
* I have experience writing simple codes at work in Python and Excel VBA for various projects.
* I have created Powerbi reports using data from SQL servers. Not proficient in SQL language but know enough to access some data.
* I am currently enrolled in the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course to gain some skills to transition out of construction estimating.

**Questions to the community:**

* Where should I get started?
* What skills do you guys recommend to become a self-sufficient digital nomad? Any certificates that I could pursue?
* How long will it take me to gain the appropriate skills to become a digital nomad?"

I'm seeking advice on my current situation. I’m a College dropout that lives in NYC. I dropped out because I really had zero interest in the Irrelevant major I was doing. I left in the middle of my first semester in college, I didn't even finish my first semester I really couldn't take it anymore. I had the feeling I was wasting my time but the real question was wasting my time it for what? So I left college, that left me pondering my identity. As the son of immigrants, going to school was always the most important thing. It was always “go to school so you can be someone great”... give me a fucking break. School isn't the only thing that defines a man ,it’s his experiences . Anyways, a few months later the pandemic hit and I got tired of doing nothing and procrastinating. It was not me at all. So I joined a nonprofit that gave free tech training for young adults. I went into the IT field. It was alright I learned A LOT about IT in class and on my own. The cool thing about it was that they gave us job placement which was great. So a few weeks past by and the placement manager sends me an email about how he has a huge opportunity for me. I was delighted. He mentioned he had an internship role at a distinguished hedge fund and that he chose me because of how great my soft skills were at my age (20). So I took the internship and did great. A few extensions later and my manager asked if I wanted to come on full time. I said Yes and he said we’ll bring you on board at the end of the internship. So now that we have the context out of the way I ask you good folks this. I want to go back to college and get a degree in computer science degree BUT I also want to keep my job while I do my classes. Living in NYC I need that job to survive, I can't quit it. I was thinking of getting a Online degree which I am completely open to. Also, the reason for wanting a CS degree is because I enjoy solving problems and have been practicing my coding which I find fun. I know CS is a world within itself with topics that are 1 inch tall and a 1000 yards wide, but a *smooth sea never made a skilled sailor.*

Thanks."

Need advice,raymonadi,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/r42f8t/how_do_you_deal_with_your_working_life_is_it/,"I'm 22M and recently started interning at a social media agency. Before I start I should mention that I work in India (and this place is notoriously known for its poor work ethics) and that I graduated from college this year.

The 'student' to 'working adult' transition is definitely hitting me hard. I have to actively work 6 days a week and for 9 hours everyday. I'm losing touch with a lot of friends because after working for 6 days, I find it hard to  find the energy to go out again on Saturday and socialise- Im already facing the consequences in terms of my friends getting upset that I haven't spent time with them (which is true). 

The internship doesn't pay a lot but considering that most internships in India don't even pay, I consider myself lucky that this one does. 

This is probably the third Sunday I've worked through a chunk of my day and I see no end (I've only worked 2 months here). I don't plan to stick to this specific job forever but my question is- is this how it's going to be everywhere, especially at my age? I don't even understand if my job is genuinely asking for too much from me or if it's meant to be hard for all new beginners. I feel very overwhelmed at the moment and the existential crisis I'm going through at the moment is running on a whole different level. 

Regarding me liking my job, I've never known what my true passion is. I've done multiple internships before, all in different fields of marketing and the current job is the most enjoyable. I won't say I 'love' my job but I don't dislike it either (quite important since I disliked my other internships). The only reason I'm adding this piece of info is because some might say that if you love your job you won't feel any burden. 

Constructive criticism would be appreciated. I know redditors can be brutally honest and I would like a little bit of kindness advice right now."

I feel like I am at the lowest point of my life even though I am still fairly young.,iamfuckingdone2,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/r44600/i_hate_me_i_feel_like_i_am_at_the_lowest_point_of/,"Hi. I do not know if this is the most suitable sub for this, but if you read it all, I want to tell you that I am venting about MYSELF.

First of all I am 21 years old. And somewhere there are many people who probably has said the same thing with me and people had read it over and over but I feel like this is something I can not even fully tell to my closest friend let alone family members.

 I have been living all my life with a toxic family. My mom and dad never were happy with each other once, at least as long as I was alive. I never felt like my dad actually loves me, on the other side I can tell my mom really loves me, but I can tell that my love for her really degraded by time and I feel really bad about it.

Growing up has been really stressful but my childhood has also had very nice moment and I somehow ended up building really good and healthy friendships to this moment but of course there were some bad ones or ones that just did not work out.

Now fast forward to the present, we are very bad economically and we are in loans and debts or whatever, mom is working and trying to keep up, while dad is just wandering around spilling lies and bullshit and spending money on god knows where. I do not necessarily think that he is a bad person, I just think that he just never gave a single shit.

As it comes to me, I halfassed-ly finished high school, but due to the family shit and monetary issues never went to university. But I thought through time I would just find temporarily find a job while self learning on what I like and wanna do or attend different courses or internships or whatever idk.

Problem is, I do not have time to think of what I wanna do if I can't make it through the present. I really really want to help my family, with all my soul but I am really struggling to do so.

I have major overthinking problems and what I am about to say may be fucking anxiety or depression or everything or I do not even know what.

I tried going on different interviews and jobs and I did not even feel once anxious or stressed about going there and working. That is until I actually experienced trying to work.

It starts off easily and a little bit scary but it gets okay, till you make some mistakes here and there. Just doing something wrong makes me feel like utter shit. I am terrified of making mistakes, and when I do I want to crumble and die in moment.

I quit different jobs after a week or something and it is only getting worse. Everytime I start working somewhere the idea of having to go there every day demolishes me. 
I am a little bit lazy, but that is not the problem, I can go there in time no matter how far it is, but then remembering that I have to go in work and something goes wrong I feel very bad and I just want to be everywhere else except there. But making mistakes are not the only thing.

I can't comprehend how people go to job every day, having to work 9 hours a day, dealing with bullshit, people, stress, or whatever there is just so they can get some rest on a Sunday or whenever they have the chance given by their employer or whatever. They are literally selling their time, because you are going to get your paycheck just to use it on something that will make you feel some kind of happiness.

Though I do respect those people, and think that they are strong as hell for being able to do that and make it look like it is not a big deal, even though its hell itself.
Just doing the same thing over and over again, dealing with waking up early, feeling sick etc.. like HOW DO YOU EVEN DO IT?!

I feel like I am a little bit antisocial, but I have never had a problem talking with people I don't know or that are older than me, in public or wherever it can be, whether it goes good or bad. But in jobs that I have to interact with people everything goes on my mind.. What if I do not know something? What if they complain? What If I do something wrong? What now? I do not really care what people outside of my friends group think about me in general, but I do get scared of how I look in an employee position.

I feel like have locked myself in a shell and can not crack it, or actually I do not want to crack it, I don't have the will to do so, being scared from different things what I can fuck up or the way people will react to it.

In my head everything is going to shit, I literally feel like I have never felt before. Never this bad. I can not talk to anyone about this in this much detail, because in the end they will just ask me TO GROW AND MAN UP, and that JUST DO NOT THINK THAT MUCH ABOUT IT. 

I have tried. I have never been able to clear my mind from everything. Every night I try to sleep thoughts just keep coming to my head, making it very hard for me to sleep. Tried listening to some rain or sleep sounds to also help with my tinnitus, but it just does not work, my brain automatically cuts everything else coming from the outside of it.

Hanging out with friends and doing other things has become on me going autopilot at this point. I have fun with them, laugh, debate, spend time and everything happy people in a friendship would do. But its feels genuine only at the time it happens.

It feels like it was not me who was doing all that, like it was a cutscene, a show that I just happened to witness, a dream that you quickly saw and forgot about half of it, if not all of it. Though the memories are still there, happy and sad moments, that I would not want to forget, memories of people and their personalities, like they are all packed and boxed nicely in a corner of my head, but I am not allowed to touch them.

I feel like an useless piece of shit everytime I see my family. I feel like I am not allowed to have fun anymore. I even eat guilt, with the idea of me not deserving to have that. I am contributing nothing to anyone. Worthless.

I do not want to kill myself, because I do not have the balls to do so, and I do not want drama and make people sad about it. I just wake up everyday with the desire of just having to dissappear, to have never existed, never been born.

I have long lost the motivation to do anything. And I am starting to feel far long gone. I hate myself for becoming like this. Now I am in a bar while is raining writing a long ass fucking post on reddit, because I want to tell this to someone who will not tell me that I am crazy, just understand me, not tell me to just brush it off, but to just say: 
It's okay, I get you.

This post was really long, and I probably have done a lot of grammatical mistakes, said something very confusing, or even made it unreadable for some of you and I am sorry about that.

Even if no one reads it I just wanted to leave this somewhere :(."

Other interns on my team aren't struggling like me and are capable of learning and doing things themselves, meanwhile I'm misusing pointers and references and structs even though I already learned about these things in college and had projects using these on my resume. My mentor has been nothing but kind and patient, but I cant help feeling like I irritate him and am wasting his time when he could be doing his own work. I feel guilty for getting paid because I'm definitely a net negative on the company. 

I get it if I felt like this for the first month of working here, but I'm literally about to leave in December and I still can't do anything without getting a lot of help. I don't even think the tasks are hard either, they're just simple bug fixes I should already know how to do

I'm not really sure what this post is for, just had no one to rant to. Really just feeling guilty and I probably shouldn't even be in computer science"

I saw someone on this subreddit talk about being a ""generalist"" and it seemed to be in a negative context. I understand that once you work at a few companies, you're likely to have your own tech stack that you've intentionally or unintentionally specialized in. But how important is that for students looking for their first job? Should I focus all my extracurricular study on a couple popular languages and frameworks? Or should I try to have at least some knowledge of many things to cast a wider net, so to speak? 

For context, I have no internships or professional experience in the industry. I do a fair amount of study on my own however. I've completed one Python personal project that I'm proud of and I'm learning some JavaScript since my program's coverage of it was abysmal."
r45r7s,3,2021-11-28,24 year old Real Estate Investor/Bartender returning to School for CS... guidance needed,GoldenMonkey34,TransferToTop25,https://www.reddit.com/r/TransferToTop25/comments/r45r7s/24_year_old_real_estate_investorbartender/,"Hi y'all! Just discovered this sub a few days ago, and I must say that I'm absolutely floored a resource like this exists. As a 24 year old going back to school for the first time in 3 years it really gives me confidence that transferring to schools like these are absolutely possible if you out in the hard work and discipline, and gets me super excited to be going back! With that being said it does raise a couple questions to my specific situation that I'm having a little difficulty finding answers to, so I was hoping by explaining it a bit better and laying out my game plan, I could get some feedback on my concerns

I'll make my summary as quick as possible. Barely graduated high school, like ""my Math teacher had to add 4 points on to my final grade to I wouldn't fail"" sort of barely passing. I went to a community college about 45 minutes away right of high school, living in dorms there so i could get the ""college experience"", and was completely unprepared with terrible study habits. I flunked out that first semester, withdrawing from 3 classes and failing the other 2. Decided to take the following semester off to work full time and get my shit together. Worked out great, went back to school at a more local community college (I live in the Albany, NY area) and got my associates in Business Administration with a 3.54 GPA, all while working 40 hours a week. 

Then attempted to transfer into the UAlbany business program which requires a 3.25 GPA to get in, thought I had it in the bag with my good GPA, but instead they took my basically 0.0 GPA from my first go round and combined it with my 3.54 so I didn't get in. I switched my major to Econ since it had lower requirements and figured I could transfer into the Biz program after getting a minor in Econ and getting good grades. That first semester at UAlbany ended being a mess since I took mostly advance econ classes since all the intro econ classes were already taken, and I was definitely not prepared from them. It also left me a bad taste for Econ and I didn't enjoy it. I decided half way through the semester I wasn't coming back in the Spring and needed some time off to think, so I finished off as best I could and ended up with 2.48 GPA for that semester. 

After leaving UAlbany I got heavily interested in Real Estate and bought my first duplex 6 months later. During my whole time in college I bartended and continued to do that after the fact, and continued buying properties while saving money from doing that. So here I am 3 years later, I have 4 rental properties that have done pretty well. I want to continue down this path, but I'm starting to get burned out from bartending and want to do something else instead. I can't imagine doing this for another 10 or so years until I have enough rental properties where I can do that full time. I've been looking heavily into becoming a software engineer and would like to go back for Computer Science. It seems to be a ever growing industry with a lot of demand, and can make a really solid income right out the gate if your work hard at learning to code. I've done a bit of Python on my own time already and enjoy it, and think its something I would be good at. I would really like to get into a top university, although I've heard some mixed data points on whether it really matters for CS. I told myself if I ever go back to school I want to give it my all and do the best I possibly can, so I'm really motivated to get in somewhere prestigious. I know I have the ability and work ethic now to do something like this, so I almost feel like a would have a lot of regret if I don't at least try to push myself to go somewhere prestigious, and feel like it would be an incredible experience. Based on what I said above here are some questions I have...

\-If I go back to my local community college for, lets say, 2 semesters, and then look to transfer out, are they going to just look at my GPA from just those 2 semesters, or are they going to look at my 3.54 GPA from my associates degree as well?

\-I know EC's seem to be very crucial to getting into these top schools. I was wondering if my involvement in real estate would be something worth putting down. I'm part of a couple of local real investing groups and also have my real estate license, and wasn't sure if stuff like this would count as EC or if it has to be directly stuff involved with your school.

\-Is there any real benefit to getting into a top school to be a software engineer? I've heard conflicting things, with some saying its really all about your projects and internships and not the school, but I feel like at a better school you would have access to better internships and have opportunity make better projects lol. If so, any top schools I should be specifically be targeting for CS?

\-My girlfriend is a nurse and my rental properties basically run themselves so the entire country is on the table as far as transfer locations. With that being said I'm a little concerned about cost as well  compared to going to a SUNY school where it most certainly be cheaper. Are there any top colleges that have good transfer scholarships available compared to others? or would I basically be relying on financial aid? (not sure I would even qualify with my income)

Thanks in Advance!!"
r46qrf,1,2021-11-28,Career options for 30 hours per week/4 day work week/6 weeks PTO/fully remote?,PhoenixOfStyx,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/r46qrf/career_options_for_30_hours_per_week4_day_work/,"So, I'm an L1 Security Analyst, could wrack up certs instead of college, but am somewhat interested in a degree to make myself more valuable to leverage a 4 day work week or 30 hours a week full time. I have a history of mental issues [panic attacks, severe MDP, recurrent, severe], and it's fairly damaging working 45-50+ hour position + certs/college, but I also need the health insurance for medical/dental stuff at least a few more months. Living with my GF, if I stabalize my teeth, I could probably get away with part time work to pay rent while I went to finish my degree [she has a Masters], to set up for higher pay.

Incidentally, my girlfriend's sister just got a job making $80k a year working 30 hours a week, remote, with 6 weeks average PTO taken per year with mandatory 2 week breaks at winter and summer. So, I know it's possible, so please no ""not possible/lazy comments."" Granted, she just got an MBA and it is a marketing position, but I'm willing to expand outside of IT if necessary.

Regardless, my current ~45-50 hour a week position provides 6 days PTO per year and 50k a year as an L1 SA, only 2 remote days, and that's quite frankly bullshit, right. I also was selected and completed a 10-week internship with a global leader in Cybersecurity, but still have a LOT to learn. 

I doubt Cybersecurity is willing or able to accommodate my needs, maybe with consulting work or contract work. I could probably bulldoze a job for 3-6 months then recover before the next contract, and that might work after I take care of my dental needs.

I'll also say I don't enjoy blue team overmuch. Looking for needles in needle stacks. I've enjoyed Red Team and Java coding the most so far. Also Web Dev, less so, but possibly oversaturared.

Currently considering a few options:

1: Current job or switch to a new one, full time, get certs, specifically CySa+, rn.

2: Save money, buy house with GF, switch to PT job with lower rent, bulldoze Bachelors in Software Development/Cybersecurity

3: Use benefits at current FT job, few more months, take on FT contract roles then bulldoze college during the breaks.

Any advice?"

r46vk0,50,2021-11-28,[BMAT] I want to be a doctor… but,wanderingolives,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/r46vk0/bmat_i_want_to_be_a_doctor_but/,"this is most definitely not a rant, just maybe a short story of my musing of sorts. also, u either relate to this or not at all.

inspiration 1: the pandemic
“In 2019 and 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has ravaged the world, leaving doctors and nurses burnt out around the world…” the newscaster announces in the background. 
Mother picks up the newspaper and comments about the progress of the ongoing situation, as if she was truly cognizant of the magnitude of the daily reported numbers. The numbers, for many, have long evolved from a panic alarm to small little arithmetic values that we just glance past, desensitized. A little voice burst out of me. “Ahem, Mum, so I’m thinking of applying for medicine. I really think our system needs more help, and i hope to be part of it.” 
She frowns, as if my words have left a bitter taste in her mouth. 
“Jie, I suggest you think about it again. The life of a doctor is extremely challenging. What specialty do you even want?”
“Well, I think our country has an oversupply of specialists and I really think that I should decide later, and pick one where my aptitude coincides with the country’s needs!”
tsk. “What a flippant attitude, you should take a look at my friend’s son. His dream is to be a cardiologist since day 1. Your flimsy thoughts are not good enough”

Inspiration 2: working
“Hi we are happy to let you intern for a few days” 
omg YES finally. After numerous rejections because of this pandemic, finally one went through 
“Congratulations Ma’am you’re pregnant. Look at your baby on the monitor!” 
A wide smile grew. I really want this 

Inspiration 3 and more…

Blow 1: UCAT 
A high score is above 670 for each subsection…. but
score: 2720 
You are not competitive enough for an international student
I’m tired of looking at shapes… 
Perhaps i am not good enough

Blow 2: ISAT 
I got more practice materials! I can do this
oh… i am in the 89 percentile 
Your score is not competitive enough for an international applicant.
i am not good enough 

Blow 3: BMAT
5.0/5.7/4.0A
The scale has been designed so that typical applicants to the most highly selective undergraduate university courses (who are by definition academically very able) will score in the region of 5.0. 
In 2020, the bottom 10 percentile for a certain medical school is 5.4. I guess… this is it then
I really am not good enough 

Blow 4: A Levels 
Chemistry papers 1,2,3… read this sub to find out more.
I guess… this system was designed to weed out academically incapable people like me.

I’m tired. I want this so much but i’m tired. I wish I realised my wishes a little earlier so I could start earlier, but you cannot dictate when something calls out to you. the maelstrom of tests, exams and more have worn me thin. Early admission for universities have come. is this a sign? I think… i’m going to take a gap year, and try all of these again next year. A cycle renews.

Disclaimer: I am very grateful for the fact that i can even do all of these and i do know that it’s a privilege in itself. I’m just a bit tired and ik there are bound to be people saying that if you can’t even do this now, you’re really not gonna cope w med sch. I know…. i really do know… i just… want to say something where people don’t know me."

Recently I'm fortunate enough to received a remote spring internship opportunity from a company. It's fully remote and working 40hrs/week. 

I'm thinking about enrolled as full time students in the meantime utilizing the remote of internship, where I would take some easier, light classes for my academic requirement, and try to avoid the 9-5 classes.

I'm wondering whether anyone has similar experience could share their suggestions on whether the it's doable.

r4gkz5,4,2021-11-28,Get a second bachelors in CS or get my masters in engineering and focus more on computational/modeling/data analysis?,goodestofbois41,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/r4gkz5/get_a_second_bachelors_in_cs_or_get_my_masters_in/,"Thanks to anyone that reads this - I appreciate any and every comment!

Question/TLDR:
I recently graduated with my BS in ChemE and am not sold that it is the best career path for me. I see myself enjoying more of an analytical role that involves programming. Jobs/careers that interest me are chem/bioinformatics, data analysis, software engineering, and computational modeling. What path would allow for me to pursue these and have most room for upward mobility/growth - a second BS in comp sci or get a masters in engineering and take more programming/computational classes?

Context:
I graduated in May 2021 with my BS in chemical engineering. When I started college, I was double majoring in math and biochemistry, but switched to ChemE after my sophomore year. The biggest reason for my switch was job prospects/money/what 19 y/o me thought would make future me happy. I figured that I would need a graduate degree with the double major path to get a good paying job, while a BS in ChemE would be a quicker way to make good money and have more secure job prospects. I absolutely loved those first two years of classes - especially the math classes (calculus 2&amp;3, lin alg, diff eq), the one programming (JavaScript) course I took, and the two semesters of organic chemistry (ended up tutoring for both classes). When I transferred to ChemE, I never really enjoyed my major-specific classes, but I had my eyes on the paycheck/job prospects. I did well in those classes and finished with a solid GPA. 

By early September of my senior year, I had a process engineering job lined up with a company that I had already co-oped for. I really liked my managers/coworkers, had about 15 months of process engineering experience from various co-ops/internships so I knew what to expect, and the job market was pretty tight so I was grateful and I took the offer. 

COVID pushed most of my senior year to remote learning, and the majority of my courses were asynchronous. I took advantage of this and spent most of my days outdoors doing my hobbies and then would do homework/classes in the evening/night. This was the happiest time of my life. It also, quite frankly, changed my outlook on life. Among other things, it made me want to pursue a job/career that made me truly happy and have something that I loved going to every day. By the end of that fall semester, I had started to second guess this job and ultimately my decision to pursue ChemE and foregoing the math/biochem route. Based on what I saw from my process internships, my career path would be manufacturing engineer, then either into management or specializing in some aspect in manufacturing. This path didn't/doesn't necessarily pique my interest.

After 7 months full-time, my managers are pushing me towards a manufacturing engineer role, and I don't want it.  A small portion of my job is data analysis/data-driven problem solving and being the liaison between IT and manufacturing on some of our software that operations uses, and I absolutely love those parts. The other portions are running chemical trials to improve the process/reduce cost, and support operations through day to day troubleshooting and project managing. I don't enjoy this portion as much. I've mentioned several times to my manager that I like more of my data projects and would be interested in pursuing a more data focused/analytical role. However, they keep pushing manufacturing because that is what the company needs due to expansion/retirements, and they think that I'll be a great fit for it. I'm starting to dread the days that I know won't involve any analytical work.

I've been learning Python in my free time, and am really enjoy coding. I'm not exactly sure what role I want, but I do know that I will enjoy an analytical/technology role involving programming, math, and potentially chemistry/biology. Jobs/careers that interest me are chem/bioinformatics, data analysis, software engineering, and computational modeling. What degree/educational opportunities would keep doors open for me to pursue any of these and have room for upward movement? I was thinking of getting my second BS in comp sci online, or going to get a masters in an engineering field (ChemE, EE, biomed) and take elective courses in programming/computational modeling/statistics."
r4h7hy,0,2021-11-28,Internship as High Schooler,Shauxbox,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/r4h7hy/internship_as_high_schooler/,"Hello, hope you all are doing well! 

I am currently a high school sophomore who is deeply interested in computer science. I have been following the news about Facebook's decision to rebrand itself as Meta and its goals for the future. It really excites me and its goal to create a ""metaverse"" is something that I would dream of working on as a career.

I was curious if there is any way for a person to apply to Meta (or any other major technology company involved with VR/AR technology) to work as an intern, apprentice, or just to get professional experience. Currently, being paid is not a major concern for me since I am still a high school student, but getting the opportunity to earn professional experience at such a company which I would be eager to work at one day would be my dream. Does anyone have any advice on how I would earn such an opportunity?

P.S. I already have lots of experience with CS in general (from web, game, and mobile app development) but of course still a lot to learn. My main focus would be somewhere in the AR/VR field since it is what I am passionate about and I have an internship in an existing AR start-up.  


Thanks. "
r4hjgs,2,2021-11-28,Consistency issues/lack of formal degree in CS/ advice on showcasing my work.,topman20000,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/r4hjgs/consistency_issueslack_of_formal_degree_in_cs/,"So Im 33/34 in Feb, and I have been studying coding independently since a little before the pandemic broke out. Mostly in C++, but also a little in C#c in Python3 and in SQL, as well as Beginning to study languages like Ruby and rust. Problem is that while I have a lot of training, I’ve never really been able to put together a lot of projects in their full form for somebody to see my experience.  I take a lot of tutorials online in different subjects, and I save my progress in them both as files on my computer and does repos on git hub.  Recently I got a laptop with Kali Linux in order to dabble in subjects like networking, and Penetration testing, But also to plunge into applying skills in C++ and python on a different OS, because I’ve heard that more can be done with Linux capabilities, and that Linux and UNIX are similar Operating systems(maybe I misheard).  

For C++, I started my training from a game development angle. My original degree is in music performance, but during my masters program I took courses in audio implementation with middleware like FMOD and Wwise, which use the same C++ code base as unreal engine, I’ve studied the QT framework, and I’m currently getting back into it to put together a template project for the company I’m working for right now to help them with a simple incident reporting system. I am also currently enrolled in online courses on Udemy for concurrency/multithreading, design patterns, graph Drawing/theory And c++ algorithms.  I have also been studying SQLAPI++ Libraries for the purpose of building an API for creating and generating schema queries from the MySQL DBMS.  

For python I am taking most of my courses on solo learn.  I have been studying primarily the basics in data science and machine learning, and for my friends brother I have been plowing through the python for finance course.  In terms of GUI frameworks I’ve studied TKinter and I’m currently studying Kivy.  I’m also taking courses in Computer vision/OCR, as well as the openCV library‘s for python.  As for WebDev frameworks I’ve only explored a little bit of Flask, and I’m trying to get into Django, But I’m not sure web development is something I want to do with programming.  I come from more of an artistic background, so I am more used to GUI creation of things, like using word pad in order to generate HTML templates.

I’ve only just gotten into languages like Ruby and rust, and I’m doing courses for HTML/CSS on SoloLearn as well, although I’m still not sure where and how they would be best applied in programming other than web-Dev, which again I’m still not sure is something I want to get into.

I am still not sure what exactly I want to do with programming, except that I want to apply some of these skills somewhere and build up a little bit of beginner experience.  I have thought of trying to apply for some paid internships To see if I can contribute anything with my experience in coding. I’m not sure I can amount to much encoding, but at least an internship would give me the ability to gauge that and see if and what something mike give me a good nitche.

But I have a few problems.

1. I don’t know how best to format my résumé in a way that puts out that I know the content, without having any sort of formal college education under my belt.  My main background as I said is in music. I got my bachelors in 2011, when that didn’t provide me anything I enlisted in the military as an intelligence analyst.  Then came back for my masters because they too kept saying that “you need your degree to be eligible for the work”.  But ever since earning it, along with the previous work experience I have in that field, it now seems like it’s becoming pointless, And companies are only hiring you if you are a “good fit” for anything. And I’m worried that I wouldn’t be a good fit for anybody without even a formal education to get me in the door.

2. I don’t have a lot of great consistency.  Most times I will start a project to up my knowledge, back it up on GitHub, but never have the time to get back to it on my work schedule.  Most of what I will have will be repos of things I create whenever I do tutorials online. The reason for this I think it’s because mentally I’m training to meet requisites of a potential client, rather than having the mentality of a client myself.  I think of a project idea, and in my head it sounds fun, but then implementing it I start getting abstract and focusing on what I’d like to see, rather than how to make it WORK the way it’s supposed to, so it creates this roadblock in my brain😖

3. When I start looking through different job openings, I get intimidated to even apply for the smaller level entry jobs and internships.  Most of all of the actual jobs require a minimum BS in programming, and the internships require that you actually be enrolled in a program.  Which makes me wonder if showing that I’m trying to study independently would be self deprecating.  And then there’s all the different API’s and terminology that they throw in that I’d never even heard of before seeing the job ad itself:  RabbitMQ?  WireShark? Agile/Scrum?  Unit testing? Design driven development???  🤯 i’m busy just trying to make sure I’m up-to-date on C++ 20 standards, that I remember how to wrangle standard templates, that I experiment and keep practicing on how to work with concurrency, and that I retain what I can from Python as well😭.  I don’t understand how anyone can keep up and retain all these unfamiliar subjects??

With what I have going on aside from studying, what is a way to stay consistent on a single project all the way to solid completion?  How does it just click inside of a programmers head so that they can get the ball rolling on exactly what it is they want to create with code?  What is a way to showcase your knowledge of CS if you don’t have a formal degree, and get employers to consider your background?  Are there just certain general Topics in CS, which students at a college level are expected to know about regardless of their programming languages?  Do programmers just save their notes and their experimental projects, kind of like prototypes, so that they can harken back to them when they find a given project implement them in?

for context: i got the interview through winning an award sponsored by facebook at my school's hackathon. i know i'm extremely lucky to have received this opportunity. also, note: it's not for the facebook university internship either, it's a full-on swe internship.

HOWEVER, I AM COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY UNPREPARED FOR IT.

i had about two weeks notice in which i've started grinded leetcode, but i'm struggling with easy and medium problems. the only cs class i've taken was a local community college intro to java course and i'm currently in my university's own intro cs course. we've been learning data structures such as linked lists, maps, sets, binary trees, etc, but i only just learned them a couple months ago (literally learned binary trees about 1-2 weeks ago :') ). big o notation? i've just barely gotten the hang of it.

i'm seeing some other people on this subreddit who are clearly prepared for it despite being a freshman and just Mega Super Übermensch Chads in general, so my expectations are low, but i'd still like some advice about how to proceed. i've heard they'll adjust the questions to be easier since they know my standing, but since i'm struggling with even the easier questions, i'm pretty worried for tomorrow.

i don't think i should expect anything except for a nice interview preview, but i like knowing what to expect. will there be behavioral questions? or will we dive straight into the technical part? will the technical part come first? how is it timed? can i google search documentation? can they see my entire screen?"

I am a PCMB student and although I'm going to appear for JEE and probably NEET too next year I don't think my heart lies in either of those streams. And the thought of spending the rest of my life doing something I am not even interested in the first place, really disturbs me.

r4k836,1,2021-11-28,DevOps Internship Interview Tips?,BloodsoldierRB,devops,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/r4k836/devops_internship_interview_tips/,"Hey, 3rd year CS/SE engineering student.

I have been applying for literally anything relevant to my dull resume, as I wasn't able to land a coop position in my earlier years for experience.

One of these positions was for a DevOps intern at IBM (8 Months), and having heard of the role couple of times before, I didn't really know what it entailed. Turns out there's a lot more to understand in the tools and utility department then I thought i knew.

Guess my real question is, does anyone have experience doing a virtual or even in person interview for IBM or similar company for a DevOps role? My lack of experience in the field or generally giving me stress already, interviews in a couple of days.

Apparently the technical portion isn't as focused on pure coding that other standard 'Software Developer Intern' positions would hone in on; partially nervous as I have been mainly just applying for jobs using standard Java/C/Python experience I had from projects in school and what not; and haven't really worked on anything to keep the skills sharp for an actual interview.

Any and all tips appreciated though, I will take them very seriously and do what I can with the information in the next few days to try and land this position!

Thank You :)"

I wanted to ask how using a OTE would look like for grad school versus sticking it out. 

Before covid, my grades were stellar; during covid, I had to drop a semester completely and used two P/F for the other semester—including one for a core CS class. The only 2  grades I kept for that entire year were good. Despite my academics, I did have a great internship at least. 

This semester, I’ve managed to do well again aside from this class.

I am in a pickle right now, I scored **303** in GRE, V:144 and Q:159 and **98** in TOEFL.

Some info about me : 3+ years of experience in Accenture(Mainframe and SQL)

CGPA: 8.20, Done few independent Data science projects and 1 internship.

NEU has made GRE optional and needs TOEFL **min. 100**(will be taking TOEFL again..I'm sure to score 100+) and NEU MS in  CS deadline : **15th April 2021**

My biggest concern is my undergrad is from non-CS(Electronics Engineering) also I don't want GRE to hamper my chances in admission.

Could you please answer my query?

1. Should I apply to NEU Boston right now with 303 GRE after my TOEFL mid December OR Should I wait and take GRE again on around early Feb 2021 hoping for a better score?
2. I am thinking to apply to NEU with 303 GRE now around mid-December and then if I get agood GRE score(315+).. , I will send new GRE score later early Feb.. since most of NEU admitare declared in March. So, I am hoping they consider my new score. Can I do this?"

I have about 3 years experience coding, but I’ve been jumping and playing around with different languages, so I don’t have in-depth knowledge on any language. Does it hurt to not have experience with a language? 

For reference I did these languages: 
Python (about 4 months), C# (1.3 year), SQL (1 month), C++ (college: 3 months), Java (1 month), and now i’m doing HTML, Javascript and ajax for about 1 month now. 

I’m working on building my portfolio and making a better resume, it’s just that I don’t have any real projects I can show, except maybe a Unity game that I played with.

And yet after summer 2020 (COVID) I haven’t received a single interview from the hundreds of jobs I applied for in my field. 

I even applied for jobs at the companies I worked my internship the most.  Reached out to my managers and they told me they would “put in a good word for me” at any position I applied for within the department. They’ve been at the company over 20 yrs and know just about everyone. Yet I hear nothing back from those positions.

Would it be rude to ask my past managers just what is happening. Because after 100 jobs where they said they put a good word in and nothing comes back I’m starting to wonder what’s really happening??

My felid is writing/editorial news and I’m very good at my job. Like I was cited by The New York Times good. My degrees are in Journalism and Creative Writing. And yet for the past year almost two now I can’t get a single interview anywhere. In sate, out of state, remote. Nothing.

It seems now that the data point has been taken down from the site and it is fake. There was also a fake $100/hr Albertson internship data point for a few days. Although they say they verify their salaries, it seems that there are still some fake data points in there. How much of the website is actually real salaries? These extreme cases I mentioned strike controversy and are hence brought to light, verified, and omitted, but there could be many more salaries that are just as fake but are hard to tell and they are skewing averages. [Levels.fyi](https://Levels.fyi) has been a trusted source for a lot of people for setting expectations, knowing what to aim for in negotiation, and more. If it is to keep this status, they should be better fake salary filtering!

Update: just found this today: [https://www.levels.fyi/offer.html?id=10ff9dda-7fe5-5006-9b0f-8ca2a4d583dc](https://www.levels.fyi/offer.html?id=10ff9dda-7fe5-5006-9b0f-8ca2a4d583dc). This wasn't me but I think it is someone basically testing levels verification and apparently no one checking any of the salaries. I know for most companies a few fake data points are fine, but for small companies with small sample sizes like HRT it can skew the data."

I am not like a very beginner, I have done few freelance projects, but now want to look for a real job.  

For the freelancing projects, I have made:-

1. A website for a nonprofit organization using nodes
2. Another software using pyqt5 (for the same organization)
3. A POS system for a cafe using django
4. and a very simple e-commerce application using django

&amp;#x200B;

Apart from these projects I have also done an internship where I mostly used python and django, but the employer wasn't fulfilling his terms so I had to leave it halfway (I don't have any kind of document or paper to show that I ever did an internship).

Also, I was selected as a product engineer at a company that is regarded as a top company in my country but didn't accepted it as pay was very low.

This sums up almost all my progress and achievement on programming except personal projects. Now, how do you think I should start to look out for jobs? Should I start from very beginning after doing a real internship or I can try for upper positions? Also, how should I develop my CV and present myself, should I mention my freelancing and personal projects, also do I mention about my half internship(that I have no document of) and the job offer or not?

When I was 16, I thought that having a part time job would give me the independence I desperately craved. I was right! I had very sheltering, protective parents, and having a job gave me the feeling of responsibility. 
I took a job at a cute bakery down the road from my house. It was great, but it was my first mistake. 

When I didn't get into the school I wanted for university, I took a year off and just worked full time at that bakery. By the next year, I finally got into a different school. The transition from low wage work to high pressure university sent me into a spiral, and I dropped out after my first year. Desperate to make ends meet, I started working retail, and was stuck with a no good boyfriend. 

I found myself stagnate at only 23, and decided to move to a different province in the hope that an internship would turn into a job. Yet again, I had to get retail work in order to survive, because the internship didn't pay. Over time, the shitty job demanded more and more of my time, until it had consumed my life.

I found myself at 25 with no meaningful work experience, no education, and no prospects. 

I tried to get my act together and went back to school for a history degree, hoping to turn it into a museum job. Again, I worked in the service industry to make ends meet, but this time I focused on my studies  

I graduated at 29 with honours, but still had no meaningful experience to put in a resume. Working all throughout school meant I couldn't take any unpaid internships, and the tiny sliver of relevant volunteer positions were quickly filled by other people (mostly because they already knew people that worked in museums).

Now, at 30, I'm at another no good job. It's at least office work, but I'll never have a career in a museum. I feel like I was lied to. Working all those service industry jobs ruined my chances, because now they're the only experience I can put on a resume.

The worst part is that I'm nowhere near close enough to my real life goals: having a child. I don't know how I will ever afford it."

r4xytr,1,2021-11-29,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (#100!) (11/29/2021),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/r4xytr/weekly_job_qa_thread_100_11292021/,"Hi all,

Here is the 100th installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.
* How do I find computer engineering jobs?
   * If you have no idea what you want, I would suggest just searching a job board (indeed, google, linkedin, etc.) for computer engineering jobs. If you know of a company you would want to work for (e.g., AMD), you can go directly to their website and look at their open positions. You can also use the information you learn from that job board (job titles, requirements, skills, etc.) to refine your searches on other job boards.

All the best,

Had some experience with programming and Data Science / Machine Learning. But I didn't have any work experience whatsoever, not even a single internship. Still managed to find a position as a Machine Learning Engineer in my hometown. Well paid even. And god damn, there is so, so, so much stuff I need to learn, it's insane. I have no clue what I'm doing whatsoever. I managed to integrate some lines of code in a current project last week (yay) for the first time, but it's probably going to take a loooot of time until I'll be able to contribute on a regular basis. 

I'm extremly overpaid right now and probably will be so for the next couple of months, if not more. The only reason they hired me is because they have problems finding more experienced guys, so I guess I should call myself lucky. 

Also it's highly likely that once I have some relevant work experience, there will be a lot of other companies reaching out to me offering me even more money, which imposes a signifcant risk for my current company obviously. 

I was kinda arrogant and thought I'd learn all of that stuff really quickly and easily, but I was totally wrong. Now I understand why most companies don't like to hire entry level candidates. We're simply not good for anything."
r517z8,3,2021-11-29,Advice for a latecomer,doublehelix92,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/r517z8/advice_for_a_latecomer/,"Hi,

I was hoping that I could get some help with regards to internships. I have not been able to think about them recently due to personal issues (namely realising I have ADHD...), and I'd like to do my best to secure one for Summer 2022. I imagine some deadlines have already passed, but hopefully I'm not too late?

I'm a 2nd year Computer Science student at a well-respected university in the UK on track for a First, and this will be my first internship. I have a lot of medium+ sized personal projects, though I was considering mentioning a piece of coursework on my CV since it's in a language I love (Go) and is fairly complex due to it's concurrent and distributed nature. Is this bad form? I'd also be less confident about putting up older projects on GitHub for them to see unless I spend a while cleaning them up. How common is that anyway?

I imagine a lot of (most?) internships are unfortunately going to be remote positions? If not, how does housing usually work? It's almost guaranteed that any vaguely good internship is paid anyway right? I can commute to London occasionally if that is necessary.

I was mostly hoping for some guidance on where to look for internships, something like this list but for the UK would be very helpful. I've tried making a list but so far I have only have 3 and they don't even mention if they're for Summer or not...

Other than that, does anyone have any advice? I think I would do well in general coding interviews, but maybe need to brush up on data structures and algorithms if that's necessary.

Thanks a lot. Apologies to be a burden, but feeling a bit overwhelmed."
r51cip,2,2021-11-29,Describing a PyQGIS tool with resume speak,AllstonGremlin,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/r51cip/describing_a_pyqgis_tool_with_resume_speak/,"Hey all,
I’m a GIS intern and I just finished making a custom geo processing tool for my company that I’m really proud of. Basically it takes an input line and makes a specified number of parallel offset lines at a specified distance, then clips them to an input polygon and extracts the line lengths through the field calculator. It writes the intermediary shapefiles to the temporary memory so the only thing left at the end is the file you actually want. It also has a dialogue box user interface so the not-at-all tech savvy end user will have no problem using it. I’m so proud of this thing and they way it runs out of the toolbox just like the built in functions do I’m actually having trouble turning it into a bullet point on my resume. Best I can do is this:
“Utilized the PyQGIS programming interface  to create a custom geoprocessing tool that calls multiple geoprocessing functions, accesses the field calculator, and has a complete UI.”
Is there a better way I could describe this thing? Any input would be appreciated"

I was hoping to get some insight about where I have a shot at getting in based on my stats. Any and all feedback is highly appreciated!

**Demographics:** South Asian Female

**GPA:** 3.3/4.0

**Undergraduate Institution:** Tier I/II-ish school of India, graduated with a Bachelors of Engineering in Computer Science.

**GRE:** Not taken yet

**IELTS:** 8.0

**Research:** About 9 months of research work on a robotics project at CMU. Only one from my batch who could get accepted at such an internship abroad.

**Interests:** ML/AL/CV+Robotics, Data Science

**Work Experience:** 2 internships done over the summers of 2018 and 2019 (one was in a manufacturing company and the other in a top defence R&amp;D organization of India) but both did not quite help me gain experience in the field of CS, rather I gained extra knowledge but it wouldn't help me much when it comes to jobs.

**Other:**

* Actively participated as members of various technical clubs- Microsoft student chapter, AIESEC, Emirates Foundation, Editorial Board.
* Member of Marketing and Sponsorship team.

**Schools I'm Applying To:** CMU, UMD, UIUC, Purdue, Stanford, UCLA, UC Davis, UCSD (I am aware all of these are ambitious.), UoW, UBC, Uni of Texas-Austin, Columbia, UMass-Amherst, CU Boulder, UoWisconsin-Madison, UNC and UMich.

Based on this, which of the schools do you guys think I have a shot at?  (Wanted to add mid-tier ones but I am not sure which schools are of that level)

I have been chickening out because I feel I need something solid in my background to be able to go to my dream schools so really, any feedback is appreciated!"

I’m planning on re recruiting next summer but still will highly consider going back to these companies. Here are some details, lmk what you think. 

C1: 
- very well paying for an internship ($58/hour)
- McLean VA
- more modern tech stack 
- worse reputation?

Bloomberg:
- 50/hour
- NYC (which I prefer)
- Less modern stack (more legacy code)
- better reputation? 

My gut is telling me Bloomberg, probably because it seems like C1 gets shit on on Reddit. That being said, I’ve heard of a lot of good experiences at both. Ignoring location, what do you think?

**Background**: I have a bit of an interesting story, I’m a business student with a passion for computer science/software engineering; have been programming since middle-school. Really trying to nail down the tech theme in my applications and the schools I apply to. 

**Age/Gender/Race:** 20M / Canadian Citizen (Although ethnicity is South East Asian)

**GMAT:** 730

**Education:** Business Major, from a reputable, Business School in Canada (Tech &amp;amp; Entrepreneurship Concentration)

**ECs:** 
- Founded a startup, focused on helping students build their personal brand, placed first at my university’s startup incubator/pitch competition. Built the entire platform (from a technical perspective) myself. Revenue is quite small though (only free users right now, with a few paid). 

- President of the Business Technology Club, student ran organization; really proud of this. Joined the club when it first started as a freshman, been with it throughout and have had some cool impact. Ran events teaching students about opportunities in tech and held various workshops, brought on corporate sponsors and panelists from top tech companies. 

- Lots of programming projects (it’s something I really enjoy doing, I’ve made stuff using ML/Computer vision; apps used by a lot of students at my university, practical business applications such as automating financial valuations etc.)

**Work experience:**  
- Freshman Year Fall: Part-time internship during school as a software engineering intern, remote for a small startup in the states (not sf).

- Freshman Summer: Interned at a small PE/Growth Equity fund, worked on deals for a few tech companies, client-facing and did some soft eng work. 

- Sophmore Summer: Technical Sales/Consulting Internship at a T2 tech company (think Oracle/IBM/SAP). 

- Junior Summer: Technical Sales/Consulting at a FAAMG. 

Both the technical sales roles were traditionally only for engineering/cs students, but was able to leverage my background and projects to get them. 

**MBA goals:** Primarily doing to build out my network, and get into the entrepreneurship space as close to a tech hub as possible. Specifically going for deferred to use the admission as a safety net to pursue building a startup full time. 

**Targets:** Sloan, Haas, Reaches are HSW &amp;amp; CBS (all through deferred/2+2 admission).

As a Canadian an mba in the states is very expensive, so only really going for it if it’s at one of these schools.

Would really appreciate any tips or advice.

Feeling burnt out.  All I wanna do is start working, but I’m trapped in recruiting hell hundreds of applications and endless interviews and phone calls later.  Even dead end IT jobs don’t want me.


I think I’m employable, I have pretty great social skills and I learn extremely quickly.  I just don’t have enough experience to back it all up.


Firearms aren’t legal in my state, thinking of jumping off a bridge instead.  I didn’t want to do it before the year ends and ruin the holidays for my family, but I’m starting to care less and less.  Feels like I’m just biding my time until my mind gives out for good."

I’m in a tough predicament right now. I’ve lost interest in electrical engineering. I tried to switch to CS, but my major request was declined. 

I’m trying take any CS/programming related electives that I can. At my school, those electives are only machine learning, embedded systems, and comp architecture. Unfortunately, I’m not able to take data structures &amp; algorithms as an EE major. I’m limited to those 3 electives. The rest of my degree is EE-heavy courses that I’m not interested in, but I have to grind through it.

What’s the recommended path, if I want to become a software developer after graduation (Dec 22)? I have some limited programming experience. I know most likely that, I won’t get a internship before graduation. I’ll be going into the job hunt without any “professional” programming experience.

Should I start leetcode along with self-teaching myself data structures &amp; algorithms? For local job postings, I see a lot of full-stack and Java openings. Should I learn full-stack via the Odin project? Or self-teach myself Java? At this point I know that I’m just throwing out options. I’m pretty lost at what to do.

I managed to make up three of my previously failed classes with physics 1  as a C, data structures a C+, and Circuits with a B+ while dropping out of physics 2 class for the second time around cause I was going to fail it again. I am most likely going to fail OOP because of a bad midterm, and I’m planning on retaking the class later if the curve isn’t in my favor. My worry is that these are all core classes, and I’ve had to retake them multiple times. I know I’m not that stupid. I can pass the hardest math classes just fine and I’ve managed to keep my grade around 3.0. I like what I’m studying, even if I struggle with it a lot. But taking all these classes over and over is just getting disheartening, especially with how expensive uni is where I am and my graduation is going to be delayed by at least a year even with off-season courses. I’m not even sure how to get started on projects, since I’ve mostly been doing projects with school clubs where I feel like I’ve learned almost no important skills, and I’ve dropped all of my extra curricular after a bad semester in covid that worsened my depression, and I can’t afford therapy outside of the few sessions my schools gives me every semester. I feel very lost and like right now I have nothing to show for any of the work that I’ve done and I don’t know if this degree is going to be worth it in the end. I’m not understanding the purposes of what it is I’m doing anymore since all I can think about are grades and internships and career, none of which seem to be working in my favor and I’m not sure how to make work in my favor even when I seek out assistance. I’m completely loading motivation to do any work for this degree, but I can picture myself doing anything else and I wouldn’t know where to go if I dropped out.

r5b23h,743,2021-11-29,Unpopular Opinion: Non-Profits Exploit the Crap Out of their Workers,forensichotmess,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/r5b23h/unpopular_opinion_nonprofits_exploit_the_crap_out/,"I may or may not get ripped to shreds over this, but here it goes. Non-profit organizations exploit their workers across the board. I say this having a few years of experience working at a couple different non-profits. Hate me all you want, but hear me out first. 

We all know non-profits provide necessary community services and resources that the government/private sector can’t or won’t. The idea is solid, it makes sense. They don’t pay taxes with the assumption any profits go to the communities they’re serving. Non-profits also receive a shit ton of grants, which is extra government-funded money for special projects. They have literal departments of people whose sole job it is to write these grant proposals. Which is incredibly difficult to do, but I’ll get to that later. The point is, these organizations DO make a profit and spend it in very calculated ways. 

My personal experiences include a year long internship with a local non-profit in which I had to complete 100+ hours, completely unpaid. This internship required me to drive around the entire city, in my own car, no gas stipend, nothing. I tried to ask if the drive time, which was easily 2-3 hours a week not including whatever activity I had to do, could count toward my internship hours. Nope. I was aware the internship was unpaid when I took it. However, I had no idea I was signing up to spend a pretty penny on gas and mileage on my own car. I basically paid to do this internship. Cherry on top was me trying to complete my bachelors degrees among all of this. Total shit show. At the end of the internship, all the interns had to present an idea they had on improving the organization. They loved my idea and asked if I could help make it happen. I was very naive and I said yes. They asked me to literally write an entire grant proposal, by myself, no instruction from anyone, to get money for this project. More exploited and unpaid labor to ask the government to give this non-profit money for MY idea. I ended up just ghosting them after a while, because I was trying to complete a fucking bachelors degree. 

After graduating, I went to work at another non-profit. This was right during the pandemic so my options were pretty limited at the time and I was familiar with this industry. The pay was shitty af, $15 an hour as a new grad, which I was told was the maximum they could offer. However, I was sold on all sorts of training opportunities, company growth, how I would be such an “asset” with all of my (unpaid) internship experiences. I planned on keeping my serving job as a side gig anyways, which ironically paid more. So I took it. The job was fine, boring, typical office job. As you can guess, I started slowly picking up more and more responsibility as time went on. No extra pay though, of course. Months go by and suddenly my department is being phased out. All of my co-workers and myself were going to be placed into another role…Client manager. Much more work, required to use your own car to drive to and from work related meetings with clients. Even to transport clients yourself! No. Pay. Increase. At all. None. 

I started looking at new opportunities right away because fuck that. After this, I found out my co-worker was making absolute shit money. Even worse than me and they had been there almost 4 years. This co-worker actually used to be a client of this non-profit’s program. Meaning they may or may not have had information on their record which could affect potential job opportunities. Just, wow. This non-profit can really help people, but then turn around and exploit them because they know it would be hard for them to find work elsewhere. How else could someone possibly justify paying their employee less than $14 an hour with 4 years of experience at this place? I pretty much lost all hope at that point. It was incredibly calculated and manipulative behavior which really pissed me off. 

The last straw was the new year presentation the executives would send out to everyone. Sitting there, getting paid like shit, being forced into a position with a huge workload, essentially being demoted, and then I hear the CEO start talking about their financial plan. They made a profit of just over a billion dollars and they were planning on remodeling one of their community centers. All modern, high tech, fancy. My blood started to boil. My best guess is that they remodeled an existing center at a lower cost than it would be to buy a new one. That way they could write that off as a tax benefit. Then they could redistributed profits to those “providing the community services” as they’re allowed to do as a non-profit. Of course that wasn’t myself, my co-worker, or anyone else down the ladder. I was pretty offended to hear they made a fucking billion dollar profit but couldn’t increase their wages to a livable standard for their couple hundred employees. I quit like 2 weeks after that. 

I was also forced to come in to the office to do incredibly easy office work, no option for remote at all. All of the executives were at home of course, boss would sometimes come in but leave early. This resulted in our entire office of about 5 people who absolutely did not need to be there, getting Covid. I’m still dealing with post-Covid syndrome 18+ months later. They even filed a workers comp claim on my behalf (I didn’t ask for this, they just did it because it was obvious I got Covid from working there) and denied it. So I had to do my quarantine unpaid because I did not have enough PTO at the job that gave me Covid in the first place. 

I will never work for another non-profit again unless they are paying their staff livable and appropriate wages. I’m sick of doing unpaid work. I’m sick of these organizations underpaying their employees because they can. I’m sick of being exploited even by organizations that are supposed to help people. It’s all about the money, even with non-profits. They receive government money that they don’t pay taxes on, make a profit, use legal loopholes to keep that money, and exploit the shit out of their workers. 

Make unpaid labor (internships) illegal. 

Raise the fucking minimum wage. 

Provide unions and representatives to protect workers rights."

(Fear and anxiety of an adolescent facing the real world),randredditors,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/r5bd0m/help_fear_and_anxiety_of_an_adolescent_facing_the/,"Hello. I (17M) am a high school student from Colombia and I’m kinda lost rn, so I decided to come here for some advice. I am a bit nervous about this future thing.

So, where am I right now? 

Well, I’m graduating from school in June. I have pretty clear what I want to study (Computer Science or Math or both or maybe some other engineering). I speak Spanish, Italian, English and a bit of German. I am not amazingly wealthy but my family earns in Colombian pesos, which is like a shit tier currency so I can’t expect a lot of financial support from them, specially in foreign countries. To help you imagine my situation my mother, whom has a pretty high ranking job in the education sector, earns 1500 dollars a mont. My father earns a bit more but the point is clear, money is not abundant. I have good grades even if my work ethic is nonexistent and I spend most of my time watching YouTube and playing videogames. I am specially good at English (it is really easy if you can just understand basic vocabulary), Maths, Physics, Informatics and Spanish. I have a basic understanding of coding and did an internship in a small software company. I was miserable while working on there, but I think it was mostly due to my poor work ethic and not understanding completely the subject in question (I had to document some micro services in Springboot using Swagger). What else, what else? I have several extracurricular activities such as student representative, athletics practice, participation in several U.N. models, founder of debate, literature and cinema clubs, social service specially working with children from poor families, I have won several essay and short story prizes in inter school competitions, studied German and have done the internship mentioned before. Oh, I have also done several short films but they are not great. 

What are my objectives?

Well, ignoring the unavoidable societal collapse during in the next 30 years I want to have a job which would let me live comfortably since the beginning. I also would like to do something stimulating with management involved. I think engineering carriers are check all this marks so is kinda the path that I am more likely to choose. I also want to leave Colombia. Like rn. So studying outside is fundamental for me. I really have to leave.

Where do I need the advice?

Well, I have several questions for which I would like to get answers. Firstly is where should I study. I’ve been looking at Italian universities like La Sapienza and the Politecnico di Milano and they rank pretty high among the top universities, around 40 in maths and CS. Other places are also possible and my last option is the university of Andes here in Colombia. Which University would you recommend for this subjects (extra points if it is public, has a great scholarship program or is really cheap). I also like to build things with Arduino so I don’t know if something related to that could be a career path to follow (like designing computer parts or something like that). Another possible carrier path is cybersecurity. I am really interested in encryption methods and cryptography and I’m not really interested in becoming a code monkey so something related to the design of this algorithms could be interesting. Also I wanted to ask about employment opportunities for pure mathematicians outside of the academic world. What works can they perform and which companies are employing them? 

So yeah, I’m really lost. Any help is appreciated. Also thank you for standing my kinda awful English."

Not slow like you think, it's slower. In fact, when I spoke to the director of a team on the phone one of the first things he told me was that “banking is boring and slow”. Well it's not just the development that is slow, it's the interview process as well. My interview experience is a long one and it started when a recruiter reached out to me to interview at BOA in September 2021 after I registered for GHC. I spoke to the recruiter for about a half hour (basic background questions). I was then scheduled for a 30 minute interview with a manager during the GHC event. I emailed a follow up thank you and I was informed by the recruiter that my resume was forwarded to various tech managers within BOA. I was then offered an interview for a SWE role which lasted about an hour (simple pseudo code coding on spot + technical questions). I emailed a thank you to the manager but never received a response (no surprise there). I was then invited to interview with a different team in a different location. I was initially invited to “chat” (always assume chat == code word for interview). I then interviewed with about 7 team members (at several different points) during October and November. Each interview request was sent to me with emails stating “are you free to “chat” today/tomorrow""? Great for those who are last minute… And only one was a formal interview request. The chat interviews I attended (with about 5 different people) were mostly background questions and one or two spontaneous technical testing of my knowledge questions. (Like what is this in CSS…) For the formal interview I stated I was available on a specific day during a specific time period of 3 hours. The interviewer informed me that he would call me at the beginning of the first hour and his teammates may call me during the next two. (I definitely learned my mistake in terms of offering a 3 hour availability window on a day). The interviewer called me and asked me a series of tech questions for an hour. The questions during the “formal” interview were mostly technical basic questions (OOP, OS, JS &amp; some math (weird ones)). I then received a call about an hour later from another team member and was asked more tech questions (purely technical &amp; math). Around 15 minutes past the third hour I received a call from the managing director and he asked me how my interviews went... He told me he would send me the requisitions for the role they had in mind for me. I received two requisitions with SWE level III titles and a requirement of 10 years experience. I guess they thought pretty highly of me as I only had 2 years experience (and as an intern during undergrad). I actually responded and asked to clarify if these were the correct roles for me, I explicitly stated that I had not as much industry experience as listed. Never received a response from the manager. A few days later, the recruiter reached out to me (this was at the end of October) and informed me that my interviews went well and she needed to connect with me as they were ""pulling together an offer"". I discussed the benefits with her over the phone, stated my salary expectations upon her request (which she immediately said was too high and told me she would get me something lower), and she requested that I formally apply to a position online so they would be able to give me “the offer” . I naively assumed that I would be receiving an offer in the next few days. I received an email a few days later for another “chat” with more team members. I sadly agreed to the interview. I then sent a follow up after the interview and never heard back from the recruiter. I then emailed the managing director I spoke with earlier and inquired on the status of my application. He then invited me to another chat (with more team members) the very next day. It was about a half hour of basic background and some tech questions. I inquired about the interview process (as I thought I was done awhile ago?) at the end of this meeting but received a pretty indirect response. I had no idea what was next… They asked me about my existing deadlines for offers and I actually mentioned that one was really soon within the next few days. However, they pretty much hinted that the process is slow and it usually takes them 6 months to hire people (I’m not sure if this is normal as I'm literally about to graduate and the longest time period it took me to receive an offer was 3 months and I received updates on my application periodically). Well anyway, at that point I decided I couldn’t handle the interview process at BOA and wouldn’t pursue this further. I did receive an email from the recruiter 3 weeks after my last interview. She said she needed to “connect” with me as they only needed 1 more approval on my offer (disregarded my follow up email from 3 weeks prior?) . An hour later she emailed me that the role was closed. No apology, no explanation. Looks like their top candidate pulled through. I just wanted to share my experience for those interviewing as it may take long and that's not on you. And more importantly, pay attention to a company during the process. It says a lot about the company when employees lack the professionality in terms of the interview process, responding to candidates and overall organization. And definitely remember you have to want this. Like badly. Cuz its hard work just to go through the interview process, spend hours of time and your patience may just disappear like mine. Good luck &amp; you got this.

What are your thoughts on this experience? Do you think I am overreacting? (First reddit post :())"

ECs (in order on CommonApp):

1. Sectional Captain at school computer science team, taught members fundamentals of web development and led a few competitions like ACSL and CAC
2. Web developer intern at a startup, utilized Vue, Spring, Redis, etc. to restructure the system and improve performance (avg. response time from \~1600ms to 300ms)
3. Research Assistant at a University under a professor (Civil Engineering), used R Lang and python NLP framework to collect and analyze data. Researched on change of people's reaction towards COVID-19 over time
4. Web developer intern at a CMU startup, developed an app that helped Carnegie Mellon University students socialize with React, Expo, NodeJS, Apollo GraphQL

Awards:

1. Honors of Distinction (If you get 4.00+ weighted every year)

3. Congressional App Challenge (uh I didn't put this yet cuz results didn't come out, maybe I'll send CMU AO a follow-up if results come out early)

Letters of Recs:

1. Counselor (we don't talk about this she probably just put a templated one and called it a day) (?/10)
2. Math teacher (I had her for 10th and 11th and she knows me really well so I think she put a good recommendation for me (at least that's what I felt after reading it), especially at 10th she roasted me for wanting to self study Calc AB but I pulled it off and amazed her at the end) (10/10)
3. Internship boss from the CMU startup (I'm hyped for this one because she's also a CMU alumnus) (?/10)

AP Scores (for what I included):

AB / BC / AB Subscore: 5

Chinese: 5

Physics C: 5

Essays:

CA: 9/10 - Meh I guess it's alright, showed a story of my journey from gaming to cs

Writing Supplements: 9/10 - I think I did a good job demonstrating why CS and how CMU can help my CS career

PIQs: 9.5/10 - Put most effort on and I believe they effectively demonstrated my personality

Additional Information (On CommonApp):

Couldn't really pick my own courses at 9th grade because of my ELD status (basically your English is bad and school thinks you can't handle honor / ap courses)

School goes ""Integrated Math"" pipeline so it's impossible to take Calc BC as a junior unless you self study AB (which I did among 2 other friends out of the entire class of 2022)

I guess I am the cliché of an early 30’s that is going back to school finally and am going through a AAS program for both Programming and Networking as a double major. 

What is the best way to try and get an internship without the ability to move to a larger city? Since internships are for learning it doesn’t seem like there are as many opportunities for remote but is there a possibility? I think it would also depend on what type of programming but I don’t want to make assumptions because everyone knows how that ends. 

Mostly looking for advise on the best way to go about things. I have updated my indeed and LinkedIn pages even though I haven’t used either in a long time. I’m wanting to get some kind of internship that maybe can be done remotely since there doesn’t seem to be a ton of opportunities in North MS.

r5di9r,3,2021-11-29,Struggling with not being valued or secured,biggigglybottoms,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/r5di9r/struggling_with_not_being_valued_or_secured/,"TLDR My initial passion is being chipped at.  If I can't cut it as a classroom teacher I will feel my dreams were crushed. I'm in a lot of pain. I need an ear, an outside perspective on my situation, validation if fitting and feedback if not.


Where to begin?
I wanted to make a difference by being a mentor like I got and inspiring self expression and showing how to be goal-oriented. I not only don't have job security but am starting to sense I'm not valued or wanted either. I don't know yet, but I do think there's a chance the cons stack higher than the pros. This makes me feel worthless, like a poor decision maker, misunderstood and angry.

I got into teaching for so much more than what I'm finding in the day to day reality, and I'm running out of reasons to stay. Me being probationary forever was motivating me to overcome but now some days it just discourages me. I know we leave teaching with a very transferable skill set, so I'm not worried about the nuts and bolts. I'm in a lot of pain because I've made serious sacrifices for this ""calling"" and am not being seen or valued. I do experience the dark thoughts, but remain rational. 

In any other situation I would gladly abandon something that is not reciprocating. 
This one is sticky and tricky because of my financial indebtedness and personal intangible investments. It also IS possible and even probable that victory is just on the other side, that I just need to hold strong through this storm, after all, the first 5 years are the hardest, and things appear able settle down from here. 


A big achievement for me was *accepting* the fact that I do not know my fate, because it is - ultimately - out of my hands. 
If they don't keep me this year come Spring, I would have to look for a FOURTH school district?! No. 
First year me would've said I can do anything, it's all worth it in the end, more experienced me says I know I *can*, but I won't do this a fucking fourth time. That isn't even counting all the internship type of positions to even get my foot in the door. So...

-Not my first needy post here
 -Checks most boxes of burn-out but also is greater than me
  -My fifth year and third district (embarrassing)
   -Ive come to terms with my martyrdom flaw, it's    now only a weak influence and only sometimes
  -Two non renewals
    -First year was notorious bully admin, next school (new district) I adored admin but who got sick and left, replacement admin was toxic lying who undermined and was much like a used car salesman,   now in Current dist, last year was not really observable of course, this year I am starting to sense they just want babysitters if you're not a vet doing AP or a football coach or something. 

-Ive taken usual avenues suggested; therapy (although shitty), meds, calling on co-workers (extensively), lots of heart to heart talks with classes and even breaking down to admin. 
  -Kids keep complaining I'm singling them out. Obviously I'm not only not intending that but from an objective standpoint it's really unlikely. More like not listening to class-wide redirections then having a fit when I call their name because everyone else had stopped! Admin put me on an improvement plan. 
  -Due to one recording me and I did yell, I was thanking my lucky stars they didn't send me home indefinitely! It wasn't swearing or screaming, but I was clearly pissed and did snap. 
  -I loathe the redundant advice to keep being reflective, because as a highly sensitive person who also has anxiety and depression, I already berated myself for my every mistake. I'm a recovering perfectionist so I FEEL it when we don't reach a goal. Admin tells us to reach out but when I do it's just this impersonal advice and not only doesn't help but often makes me feel worse. 
   -Lessons are fine but I can pick up the pace. I'm flexible and teach a language which is naturally opportune in input and output activities. 



Readers that are not in my ruminating mind...what do?!
Am I just a shitty individual?
Am I a fine person who is just too neurodivergent for this?
Is there something more practical on the career level I'm just not getting?
Is this the state of American schools and I should get out now?
Am I just being overly sensitive to being in a really hard circumstance, where I should hold out to reap the rewards? 
Is there something else entirely? 

😔

Thank you."
r5h1fb,3,2021-11-30,I'm terrified of not being able to make money when I'm out of college. Am I making the right choice studying as a music major?,cosimomemes,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/r5h1fb/im_terrified_of_not_being_able_to_make_money_when/,"18m, freshman in college, in New York State, USA.

I'm currently a music composition major. I've loved music for a long time but in addition to not being all that much at performing I also chose composition as a more stable career with less saturation than the music performance industry. specifically, I'd like to film scoring just because that's my interest, but I'd be happy doing anything in music.

however, when I've stepped back and looked at everything, in 4 years when I graduate I'm on my own and I have no clue what I'd do the day after because it's less tangible than a 9-5 office job. I know this school will help prepare me with internships and maybe current films or commissions looking for a composer, but that just doesn't reassure me the way I'd like it to. even more, so far this semester I've reached out to 3 separate people looking for music for their films for classes and been rejected by each. I have no problem with rejection, but if I graduate and this is my life then it's just like being unemployed and not being able to find a job; i wouldn't be getting any gigs so I wouldn't be making any money.

a lot of this worry I think comes from my father, my maternal grandfather, and my girlfriends father. all of these men worked or are working so hard and make an incredible living for our families. my moms dad sold these alcohol magazines back in I think 40s-80s ish somewhere in there but when internet obviously wasn't around. and so there was a high demand for that type of thing and he just was very well off such that his money went on to support my life and if I'm not mistaken I think part of my tuition. my father runs his own business and has no employees. he's a computer service provider who works 6 days a week and even outside of regular working hours he'll still be maybe watching a baseball game and doing some sort of repair or computer work. my girlfriends dad just recently acquired his 3rd beverage store and actively manages all 3.

I know this definitely set a certain pressure on me that may be unrealistic, but I've tried to logically and analytically think about my current path and not only do I not see myself living up to that but I really just don't see myself sustainably succeeding at all.

for the upcoming spring semester, I was going to try to take some business courses to test the waters and possibly declare a second major in business to have as a back up (by taking these classes without declaring I'm not committed, but if I do choose to I wouldn't have wasted time because I'll have knocked off some of the credits). but lots of the business courses are either filled up or require pre requisites that I don't have as a non business major.

this sub asks for a specific question which I don't really have but I'll give it a shot. I know everyone says not to give up on your dreams especially so early in my life but should I switch majors? should I double major? or are there some words of wisdom anyone has on sticking with what I have right now?"

They followed up with another email asking if I was still interested after they saw that I was graduating from a 2 year degree (I plan on continuing for a Bachelor's). I agreed and have an interview set up in a few days virtually. From the original email she said that she is interested in skills and experience, but I'm pretty sure its a default email for those who are interested. Their qualifications ask for an understanding of networks, routers, switches and firewalls and working knowledge of PC's and server equipment. 

I have two questions. One is how should I prepare myself for the interview, more specifically technical knowledge. The second question is for wages, since on their website they asked what compensation do I expect. I looked online and it said around 15$/hr for an IT Intern though I don't know if I asked for a small amount or not. I live in North Dakota."

I am currently in the process of finding an internship for my IT training/education.

I am in my last year so its going to be a end internship with no assignments.

I have been told by two companies that i can do my internship there, but i just don't know what to choose.

Company A is a big major company, well known in my country. This company is not a IT dedicated company. If i would do an internship there i would probably mostly do servicedesk oriented stuff. Helping around keeping the computers and servers within the company running. The big disadvantage of this company is that it is relatively far away from my home (1/2 hours public transport). Someone i know knows some other people that did a internship there and this person only heard positive things from them.

Company B is a smaller somewhat unknown company. It is a IT oriented company and has mostly external customers which means i would probably get to deal with other companies. The biggest benefit of this company is that it is pretty close to me however, i am not sure if that is really gonna matter in the long run since working at home will probably be something i will be doing in my internship. (20 minutes public transport) In this company i would probably get to deal more with projects like setting up networks in other companies, help keep it running. But it is likely i would also deal with servicedesk oriented stuff. I am not confident in that i would fully know how to help in projects as i have not practiced such things in my previous internship.

My preference goes out to Company A because i probably wouldn't have to bother with big IT projects and there would be more social interaction with new people as thats something i want to have in my new internship. Company is pretty big so there also would be a lot of people that can help me. But i am kinda worried that maybe i am putting too much hay on the fork, might be that such a company is exactly the opposite of what i am expecting and i will be buzy 24/7.

I have previously interned at another IT company and while it was fun, i am kinda wondering if i do need to learn how to function in a big company as my previous company was pretty small.

So what would be the best option for me?"

r5lhrc,64,2021-11-30,TIFU by parking close to work,elratoncitohermoso,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/r5lhrc/tifu_by_parking_close_to_work/,"This happened a few months ago. I (27F) had a big meeting with my two bosses and three people from HR for an evaluation (it was my first year in the company and I was still in training). 

The thing is, I was super late and didn’t want to make a bad impression. So, instead of parking in my usual spot (which is at a 4/5 minute walk distance) I parked in one of the spots right by the entrance of the building. These spots are for guests (I work for a radio/tv broadcast) but there’s a lot of those and they’re mostly empty.

So I park my car and run inside, but I hear: “hey! You’re not allowed to park there!”. I turn around and see a big-tall-scary security guard with warrior eyes. I definitely don’t wanna argue with him but i’m also very late so i tell him: “I know, I’m sorry, but I’m late for a meeting. I promise it won’t take long! 10 minutes tops”. I know I shouldn’t have said that but my brain was on ‘emergency mode’. The guy grunts but lets me go. 

I take the elevator to the 7th floor and arrive at my meeting. I apologise. Apology accepted. And by the way, one of the HR ladies is late as well. Turns out, we wait for her for about 10 minutes. During that time, I think about saying “you know what? I might as well move my car while we wait” but I don’t do it because I know they’re gonna give me a hard time for using a spot that I’m not allowed to use (I live in a very organized country and they’re not laid back about this kind of stuff..). 

Eventually the other HR lady manages to join us on skype and we start the meeting. It’s all very friendly, they give me nice feedbacks about my work and ask me if I have feedbacks as well. I say something like: “I like the job, it’s all good, thanks” but they seem like they wanna hear more. “For our future interns, what would you improve in our program?”. But the whole time I’m thinking about the scary vein-in-the-forehead security guard and realize i’ve been in there for like 25 minutes. “Not much. It’s all good. Thanks”. I look at my watch. They go on: “…And what about the design thinking class we made you take. Could you explain how that worked?”

Suddenly there’s a skype problem and we lose the HR lady. As the others try to reconnect with her I see my chance. “Will you excuse me? I’m going to the bathroom”. 

I get out the door. No time for the elevator. I run down 7 floors and then through the building (it’s quite a big one). I’m like The Flash. I don’t even stop at the reception where the guard is, I just go outside, car keys in my hand, get in, and move it to my parking spot (on the other side of the road). I get out, run back inside the building, run though the hall, try to take the elevator but of course it takes forever, and I evetually take the stairs. Seven floors up. I’m back.

Now. There’s something you need to know about the conference room I was in: the bathroom door is LITERALLY next to it. Not even a foot between the two. 
I realize that i’ve been away for about six/seven minutes and that i’m breathless and sweaty. 

Everybody is patiently waiting inside, I apologize again and they look at me all funny but are too polite to say something. Then I realize what it looks like: I look like I just had a “bathroom accident”, as if i ate a lot of spicy food for breakfast, just enough to leave for several minutes, collapse on the toilet, and come back out of breath with sweat drops on my forehead. 

I sat my butt on the chair with all the dignity I could find in me and we awkwardly went on with the meeting.

I am not long out of college and the position was a full developer not an intern position so I knew it was a long shot but because its remote I said why not. So we organise a time for an online interview and he tells me that the first interview is short and just an introduction to get to know me I'm like fine. So fast forward a week interview is the next day and he sends me the job spec which he kept forgetting to send on during the week and now I find out that the online interview is 2 hours long with a short get to know you section followed by a 90 minute code interview. I was like what the fuck I had no prep time going into an interview for a full dev position what kind of madness is that. Needless to say I told him I'm not doing it and left it at that. Then the same week I have another recruiter ask me to interview for a senior team management role for 100k a year using two languages that are not on my profile or I have ever used. Like seriously don't they screen profiles first. They are mad in the head sometimes haha

I was wondering if anyone has any tips on how to make a killer CV to break into the Cyber Industry. I keep applying, re-doing my CV and Cover Letter all the time and I have no luck. Is there a secret in CV making that I am not aware of?

 I have a small home lab and I virtualise a lot of things but I feel that this might not be enough. I am top 4% on TryHackMe, working on getting that to at least 1% by 2022. I am working through boxes on HackTheBox as well.

I have IT Help Desk experience which I was hoping that it will get me at least an interview but nothing.

 I am currently working on CEH &amp; CHFI through my university degree. I know that I will get hate for that but we get a really good price for these certs through our course. Are there any certs that I should focus on?

I am currently in my second year of uni (UK) and I want to do an internship or a placement in a cyber security role.

(English is not my first language, please forgive any mistakes i might make)

Not sure if this is the right sub to talk about this but i'm honestly frustrated and not sure where else to go.

So, i'm in my final year in college. I'm studying Software engineering. For the past couple of months, i've been looking for an internship opportunity. I've had a couple offers in my country but like most students in third world countries, i was looking for an apportunity elsewhere, mainly in europe.

&amp;#x200B;

Earlier this month, i got an interview with a big company in France, and i was so excitied about it. I  dedicated most of my time preparing for it. I passed two interviews and i got an offer . Everything was fine until today someone from HR called and said they chose someone else for the role. I explained that i already got an offer but they said that the reason that they chose to go back on that was the fact that i was not french.

Obviously not his exact words. What he said was "" Most of the time we prefer to hire our interns after the internship period but since you do not go to a french university we chose someone else. I apologize for the mistake blah blah""

I felt insulted. I was more than qualified for the role. I passed every interview , i got an offer and then got rejected. I'm not sure if this is common or not especially that the offer did not specifiy a certain nationality or location to apply.

&amp;#x200B;

My concern that this will happen again or i won't be given a chance based on where i come from. 

I'm considering applying for graduate positions next year and even trying my luck with FANG and other big companies but i'm honestly not sure if i even have a chance especially being fresh out of college.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my question is : should i stay in my country for a couple years, gain more experience and then apply elsewhere or keep trying to apply in different countries?"

I would really love some help devising a plan on how to go about moving to Europe\~

So, about me:

&amp;#x200B;

* computer science graduate with soon to be 1 YOE as a full stack developer in a fintech company -more backend than frontend, but I've done both-
*  I also have some research internship under my belt in data... stuff -I don't want to get much specific-
* I know Spanish and English.

&amp;#x200B;

 My priorities for the specific country in descending order are:

1.  Allowing me to move there - if there is a place in Europe where it would be easy for me to move and live there then I don’t really care that much about the rest of this list-
2. Thriving IT sector -hopefully a place where its industry is more diverse than just web or phone apps-
3. Developed social security.
4. Not that racist/homophobic.
5. Climate-wise I'm not really peaky as long as I get more than 2 weeks of whatever the locals there call ""summer"".  


things that might help but don't know:

&amp;#x200B;

1. The Central Office for Foreign Education of Germany grades my institution as H+ and my degree as A5.
2.  Grandpa was a Spaniard and refugee from Franco’s era but I think I can’t claim citizenship because my dad didn't -and won't- claim his.
3. My job doesn't care where I physically am, but I don't think it would be easy for me to move to any other country on a third world swe's monthy salary.

  
So, questions:  


1. Should I just write resumes in different formats according to what’s common in every cultural region and just start spamming job offers in linkedIn? Should I also do it on other sites too?
2.  I'm also thinking on doing a master's degree. I have the option to do it here in a sort of ""fast track"" by transferring some uni credits. But maybe I should save money and apply for a program in Europe? I don't really know how competitive it is to get into a good-ish program so it can then allow me to get a job in the same country.
3.  Is it of any use learning a new language if I don't know where I will move? I was planning to enrol in german classes, but maybe my time is best used somewhere else?

&amp;#x200B;

  
I will be very thankful for every comment that would help me getting this dream into a more concrete plan and thanks for reading the whole post !"

r5s27f,1,2021-11-30,The PhD - withstanding the paycut,noblepaldamar,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/r5s27f/the_phd_withstanding_the_paycut/,"I am a machine learning engineer with a bachelors in computer engineering. I had some deep learning internships and did a significant amount of neuroimaging work during undergrad. I have a manuscript in review amongst other co-authored conference abstracts and papers. I also have patents from a multiyear R&amp;D role post baccalaureate. I had intended to go on for a PhD right away, but I declined some offers after I started working full time in that role. 

I began pursuing a masters degree part time last academic year (fall 2020), but this has become inconvenient as my university has returned to in-person classes. I took a leave of absence this semester as I began in a new role right at the beginning of the semester to avoid driving to campus during working hours. The curriculum's focus on basics is a bit frustrating, but I really enjoy coursework when it expands my knowledge, of course. 

However, even if I do get a masters degree, I don't think it's as good on paper as a PhD unless perhaps I write a thesis. Getting to the thesis stage in the masters program requires a lot of coursework which I have noted some friends in PhD programs haven't needed to do. Longer term, I can see my lack of a PhD as a career limitation working in R&amp;D. In my experience, PhDs are treated very deferentially on R&amp;D teams vs. engineers even if those engineers have a masters degree. 

I'm already making boatloads so going back for a PhD full time and taking the pay cut would be really annoying. Ideally, I'd love to hack on a PhD without coursework part time. I would even broach this with the faculty member who I worked with in undergrad as there is so much work I could continue, but I don't know if it is wildly out of the norm. This professor invited me to complete a fully funded PhD in biomedical informatics. 

I am also a little ignorant of what typically goes into a PhD. Some departments seem to require a few years of coursework and rotations in labs. However, my aforementioned connections have gone pretty much straight into research with faculty. I also believe some PhD students just sandwich papers into a dissertation. 

TL;DR: How can I get the PhD without the pay cut? Can I find friendly faculty who would be ok with me working long term and part time on it? Or what other options do I have? I think performing analyses and publishing would be very easy part time, even easier than coursework. I completed the last paper this way. Another option would be to do an online masters. 

Also, and maybe this is presumptuous, but if anyone would be interested in exploring me working remotely with their lab, please feel free to DM. I'd be delighted."

Lately I’ve been having extreme anxiety due to finals coming up, working as much as I can, and paying my rent which is $1250 for a studio.I just feel like the life is being choked out of me. Everyone has to work to survive but being a student means having to study even more. Lately I’ve been cutting my hours to do better in school but now I’m short on money and it hurts. I haven’t been able to pay my healthcare for the last 3 months or car note. I’ve decided to move back home when my lease is up next month. But it hurts because this was the year I finally moved out. I finally got my own place at 26 and now I have to go back home 🥺. I feel depressed bcuz all I do is work, study and pay bills. 

I applied for food stamps, section 8 ect. Surprise surprise I was denied bcuz even tho I’m poor I’m not Poor enough. I don’t have kids because I really can’t afford them. I’m still trying to get myself together why would I bring another life into this world. But I’m noticing that the girls that are just popping out kids are getting all this and that their life is easier. I know somebody with two kids who is 22 yrs old and they’re able to get a two bedroom for 800 because of section 8. Meanwhile hard-working student who goes to work, goes to school, and does everything else with no kids gets no breaks. Nothing but a big F you from the government. 

All this stress and pressure made me apply to internships. I got an internship out in Colorado and it’s going to be all expenses paid and paying me by the hour next summer. This is the opportunity for me to get out of here. They told me if I do well they can offer me a job. I’ve already talk to the senior vice president and a lot of people really like me. I even got a personal email from the senior vice president telling me to make sure that I come on board with the company etc. I accepted the offer and have started planning a new life for myself in Colorado. My mom doesn’t want me to take the job if they offer it to me. She wants me to stay in California but I feel that if I stay here it will be even more depressed. Going to work just so that you can pay the landlord. The landlords are pimps I swear. 

TDR: I’m feeling anxious and depressed because Im trapped in a cycle of work, studying and paying rent. I have to move home and I feel like a failure. I was offered an opportunity but my mom doesn’t want me to take it. Help."

Long time lurker of this subreddit. I'm about to graduate with a masters of biomedical data science this may. After an internship with amazon this summer and around 40 applications/15 interviews over the course of the school year I got a job offer from a large tech company. 

The study guides from this subreddit have helped me the whole way through and I genuinely wanted to thank the community again. I started out with an undergraduate degree in biology/stats, and have self taught programming based on the advice given from this sub. I started reading it as a junior in my undergrad as I was trying trying transition from biology to analytics. While sometimes there can be discouraging posts, the advice some users give has really made an impact on me and given me insight into the career field that I was able to use when choosing my courses or finding skills to work on in my free time. 

I come from a very underprivileged background of poverty, paid my way though both my degrees alone, and have struggled with imposter syndrome as a woman in CS. I just want others to know that you don't have to be the best, get straight As or land the first interview to be worthy of a good job. I have really struggled this year and felt terrible about 2 out of my 5 interview rounds but still somehow found myself with a substantial offer letter. 

So this is where I am now. I'm excited, don't even feel like it's real yet, but I'm also anxious for the future and want to prove myself even more. 

I'm not sure if it would be of any help, but I wanted to try and give back to the community. If anyone wants to know my interview experience or my experience with applications I'd be happy to talk about it with them in the comments or DMs. I'll try to get back to as many people as possible if there is interest. 

Thank you all for the time you put into your posts and for those who have tried to mentor new people to DS. You really make an impact."

I taught myself Python over the summer so I could test out of the introductory CS course at my school and am finishing up three CS classes to catch up this semester, one on OOP and Data Structures (taught with Java), another on Discrete Structures, and a third on Backend Development (learned Flask, SQLite, SQLAlchemy).

I know that there are so many posts like this, but I've read many of them and still have questions on my own based on my current situation. Some examples I saw were from students at VT or Penn State, but those colleges are higher ranked for CS compared to UGA.

Currently I am a 3rd year at UGA majoring in CS and minoring in business, and my earliest transfer date is Fall 2022, which would be my 4th year in college. I have just secured my second internship with a reputable banking / credit card company that pays very well, but as far as I've researched, the company pays SWE interns and full-time engineers about the same, and my dream was to always work at a FAANG / MANGA company. Obviously that doesn't look like it's going to happen this year and I don't know how difficult that would be interviewing for an internship / full-time opportunity at those companies vs. using my next company as a stepping stone since I would have graduated here Spring 2023. I only made it to final round of Amazon but didn't get the offer and didn't hear back from other companies.

UGA and experience-wise, I'm pretty involved on-campus and hold an exec position at one of the computing orgs here. I was also a collaborator on a project that won challenges at a UGA hackathon, and I enjoy working on other personal projects. Though, I am pretty unsatisfied with what my last few semesters are going to look like at UGA, since it's mostly going to be me taking business classes to fulfill my business minor. UGA itself doesn't feel like the right school for me because even though it has become substantially selective, it is still very well a party school (not a party person at ALL), and the university doesn't seem to put much faith or funding into the CS department. Our building is really outdated, and I don't remember the last time I've even had a class in the CS building; they usually just place our classes in some random buildings around campus. The worst of it is that there is no CS professor to teach one of the required classes next semester, and some students said they had to change their area of emphasis or graduate later as a result.

Anyway, currently the only two things making me really debate transferring are that I would definitely be a pretty late transfer and whether GT would really help me get to companies like FAANG / MANGA. If I transfer I would need to graduate about a year later assuming I take 12-15 credits per semester. My reasons for transferring are mainly being able to add GT to my past accomplishments and work experience. It wasn't really difficult securing interviews this semester, but most of the companies weren't particularly prestigious, and I felt like being a student at UGA vs. a better school is a barrier to getting to those companies. Any thoughts as to whether transferring to GT at this stage would be worth it / stupid? All comments are greatly appreciated!"

I would go back but the fact that it is 2 more years and no or little income makes me feel selfish and like a failure. Do I attend a bootcamp?

With almost over 270 SDE internship applications with plenty (tbh almost all) rejections either right after applying or after OAs, I managed to land 1 phone screen. I felt like I did really well in both (technical/coding and behavioral) rounds. I got a follow-up from the recruiter 12 days post interviewing regarding my location preference and if I held any other offers. Things looked on the upside, however in the last few weeks the company laid off a lot of full-time employees as part of their ""restructuring plan"". This also meant that they would want to onboard lesser/no interns for next summer. 

Just recently heard back from the recruiter and they mentioned that although my interview feedback was favourable for a hire, they can't proceed with a offer. Was really hoping I got this job. With no other interviews or even OAs ,landing an internship in the US seems almost impossible!

TLDR; Finally landed an interview for a SDE role, but the company's uncertain future robbed me of a chance to intern there"

I am currently interning at this great law firm and do enjoy the work quite a bit. Although when I was applied for this job I applied for the full time job but then they wanted someone earlier so I was offered an internship with no end date and no information on what happens once I graduate. Due to this I have been keeping my options open and have applied a few different places. I just interviewed with a firm and I got really good vibes but the position is for a 12 week internship to hire program that around week 10 you would find out if they want to keep you full time after the 12 weeks. I really liked what I heard in the interview about the culture and opportunities I would have, but I still do not know what the expectation for me is at the firm I currently work at. 

I want to ask my firm about what their plans are for me and if they plan on giving me a offer, but the idea that they may give me an offer and then I might turn it down for another offer leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I feel like asking them for an offer, receiving it possibly, and then turning it down would look really bad on my end. I also don't know if I should take the other position if it is offered since it is a bit of a risk that after 12 weeks I will be left with no job and back at square one where as if I was offered and excepted a position with my current firm it would be for a full time position.

Overall I am not looking to burn any bridges but really want to take the best possible opportunity. I think while the firm I just interviewed for has some risk, if I were to get a full time offer I feel like I would really enjoy working there and it might be better than my current firm. Any advice is appreciated, thanks!"

I don’t know if I could do this, but I am thinking of maybe negotiating to work part time or even do an internship with them, but even then I don’t know if I could trust them or they would obviously allow.
But in general, the Thursday before Thanksgiving, I get a text from this company that they liked my resume and wanted to do an interview. Everyone will say this is a scam and learning more and doing research, it definitely could be, but as someone that has been trying to look for a better opportunity, I wasn’t thinking and decided to give this interview a try.
I did my research and prepared as best I could and on Monday after the interview which was on zoom, they told me to come into their offices the next day for a second interview.
I go to their offices the next day and the day after they give me the job. Next thing you know they want me in their office for orientation already that Friday after thanksgiving.
I feel like I maybe miscommunicated, but when they called me on Wednesday that I got offered tbe position, I remember I said thank you for the opportunity and assumed I would have more time to officially accept.
Other red flags is the fast process of everything . I had the first interview on Monday, but they actually wanted it on The Friday before thanksgiving. I admittedly made an excuse I was working during that time in my current job, but from what my parents, friends, and people online say, is that potential employees have a right to take time to decide to accept a job offer or with having an interview like that.
The other thing is how this job is commission based ( sales) and throughout the process they never were upfront about this. In the second jtnere wow when I was interviewed by someone else in the company, when they were explaining the positions and the salary, I remember seeing in the bottom of the presentation packet, around $300-500. I asked if this was true and guy said yes, but I should’ve clarified if that was per hour or how it was really distributed, but when I meet with the CEO on Friday, he talked about how he talked about things like “3-5 phones=$30 and $20 per upgrade.” Again I’m so used to the per hour or per week salary logic, so I still didn’t totally understand, but even then I’m thinking this should be based on how many phones I can sell. Also lastly, the other thing is how unclear what we were going to DJ which I didn’t pick up early in the process. Talking wi the family and going tk the office in Friday, it looked like we’re doing something with sales, but in the website and my thinking was that this was an opportunity to work in a marketing/advertising company which I don’t know if it is now.
I should asked again, but I was maybe believing that this was arguably my first decent opportunity with a company.
Sorry if it this is all over the place so hopefully some will understand and get what I’m saying. There is a lot to talk about too, but my plan is when they call me that I will try to negotiate more time to think about their offer and even then I feel like they might be playing me and just rescind my offer Tommorow because they might not want tk wait for my decision."
r60ock,1597,2021-11-30,Dear Anita,ViciousMock,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/r60ock/dear_anita/,"*“Dear Fed-Up Housewife,*

*If he doesn’t realize that what you do is a full time job, then maybe it’s about time he gives it a try. I’m sure you’d be happy to go on “business trips” in the Bahamas while he stays at home trying to stop three tiny humans from putting their fingers in plug sockets or climbing in the washing machine. When do you get a break? When do you get to clock off? I suggest telling him that if things don’t change, you’d be quite happy to go it alone. It sounds like you already are.”*

I smirked. I was quite proud of that one. 

*“Dear Bemused and Confused,*

*Your boyfriend is not being honest with you. He cannot get chlamydia from a urinal, no matter how “well-endowed” he is. Unless he’s been frolicking with koalas at the zoo, your boyfriend has been unfaithful. Get yourself to the clinic and kick him to the curb.”*

I paused for a moment, rereading my reply. “Koalas have chlamydia, right?” I said to Jason, my editor. 

“Isn’t that pandas?” he said. “Anyway, it doesn’t matter. Those were supposed to be on my desk an hour ago.”

“I’m nearly done. You can’t rush the process. I’m changing lives here. I’m helping the vulnerable. I’m-“

“Yes, yes. A real Mother Theresa, you are. Finish them soon or I’ll fill the space with Mitchell’s story about the hamster who plays the guitar.”

An empty threat, of course. My readers would be outraged if they didn’t get their dose of my Agony Aunt Column, “Dear Anita”. I had space in my column for one last letter and I was immediately drawn to a small, red envelope in the pile. It read:

*“Dear Anita,* 

*Do you believe in good and evil? I’ve been having some dark thoughts lately. Do you think sometimes it’s necessary to be the bad guy if the person on the receiving end deserves it?*

*Not-So-Bad-Guy.*”

I flipped it over. That was it. What a weirdo. Probably some homicidal maniac who has found his wife cheating. I put it into my ‘pass pile’ - the intern would send him a ‘sorry-we-have-decided-not-to-use-your-letter,” template reply. 

I eventually decided on the last slot. It was a teenage girl who had gotten pregnant but didn’t want her parents to know that she had been sexually active. I advised her that unless she can convince her parents that the Angel Gabriel came visiting in the middle of the night, they were going to find out at some point. Better a surprise now than a surprise some months down the line when she returns from the bathroom with a newborn hanging out of her. 

I forgot all about that little red envelope until a week later, when another identical one arrived on my desk. This time the letter read:

*“Dear Anita,*

*I’m disappointed but not surprised. This is why the world needs the bad guys. Those who will do what needs to be done, for the greater good. Tell me, have you ever done anything bad?*

*Not-So-Bad-Guy”*

I honestly had no clue what he was on about. I considered whether I should notify the police, but what could I say? Some deranged psycho who thinks he’s Batman keeps sending me letters? I put it back onto the pass pile and carried on. 

After that, they started arriving more frequently.

*“Dear Anita,*

*Do you expect me to give up? To forget? Or do you just not care? Sometimes I wonder if the bad guys are the ones walking around thinking they are the good guys.*

*Not-So-Bad-Guy”*

*“Dear Anita,*

*I’ve given you every chance to do the right thing, but you continue to refuse. I wonder what it would take for you to face up to who you are.*

*Not-So-Bad-Guy.”*

That was it. I’d had enough. Whether it was defensiveness or ego or just frustration, I decided that I was going to write him back directly. 

*“Dear Not-So-Bad-Guy,*

*I am sorry to tell you that your letter, once again, is not quite right for my column. However, considering the volume of these letters, and quite frankly, the alarming content they contain, I feel compelled to reach out to you personally as you seem quite troubled. There is a lot of talk of the good guys and the bad guys. In reality, things are rarely so cut-and-dry. You can choose the person you want to be. I understand that you are upset that your letter did not make it into my column. Unfortunately, I do receive a vast number of letters and so naturally, not all of them can make the cut. I suggest that you seek therapy, for your issues are beyond the realm of what I can help you with.* 

*I wish you happiness and peace in your future.* 

*Anita.”*

I grabbed an envelope to write his address but when I looked back at his letter, I realised that it did not contain the return address. I walked out to the front desk to find Joanne, the intern.

“What do you do with the letters on the pass pile after you’ve sent them the template reply?”

“I file them away,” she said, pulling out a binder bursting at the seams. “These ones are from April through June.” I was almost envious of her organisation skills. My own desk still housed a long-dead houseplant, six broken staplers and some currency that I was pretty sure was no longer in circulation. 

“This guy keeps sending me letters. I want to reply to him personally but he's not put his return address on this one. Can you find the old ones he sent so I can get his address?”

She found them all within seconds. “No return address on any of them.”

“So what do we do with the ones without a return address?” I asked.

“Nothing. If they haven’t provided a return address, we can’t send a template reply. I file those ones away with a pink post-it note, see?”

“So the only way I can get a response to him is by putting it in the column?”

“Yeah, guess so,” she shrugged. 

And of course, that was what he wanted. Well, he wasn’t going to get it. Throwing a tantrum wasn’t going to get him anywhere. I screwed up my reply to him and threw it away. 

It was a couple of weeks until the next letter. In the hustle and bustle of life and work, I’d all but forgotten about him. When the next little red envelope arrived on my desk, I didn’t even bother opening it. It went straight onto the pass pile. That afternoon, Joanne knocked on the door, sheepishly. 

“I think you need to see this,” she said, clutching the red envelope in her hand.  

“It’s just that crazy guy who keeps sending letters. He’s desperate for his 15 seconds, I guess. I didn’t even read it this time...”

“I know. I opened it up to see if there was a return address. Of course, there never is with him. But- I think you- you need to see-”

She handed the envelope to me and I opened it up. A small, grainy picture dropped out of it. It was a picture of me, outside my house, putting my daughter in the car. 

I froze, as it dawned on me. This guy knew where I lived. And he had been near my house. 

\*

“Do you know anyone with a grudge against you? Anyone who would want to frighten you or harm you?” the police officer asked. 

“No. I’m a 35 year old woman working for a local newspaper. I don’t have an arch-nemesis.”

“Do you recall any previous letters that seemed similar in any way?”

“No, but I get a lot. It’s hard to remember them all. Look, he’s obviously annoyed he didn’t get put in the column and now he’s trying to scare me into putting him in. Well… maybe I should.”

“What?” said Jason.

“That is not a good idea,” said the police officer. 

“I mean, he wants an answer, right? I can write a letter to him, publish it in my column, and then he’s got what he wants. Then he’ll leave me alone.”

“Well, it *would* be a good story. I bet the readers will-” started Jason. Typical. If Jason were a cartoon, his eyes would be permanently lit up with dollar signs. 

“Actually, it’s likely that getting a response from you will make the problem worse. When it comes to stalkers-” the police officer began. 

“Stalker is a bit much, isn’t it? It’s only one picture,” interrupted Jason. 

And so it went, back and forth like that, nobody taking any notice of what I thought in the slightest. I watched as Joanne proudly handed her immaculately-kept files to the police, which they carted off in boxes. Stupid Joanne. I had to resist the temptation to tell her that the police did not care about her colour-coded post-it notes. But that was unfair. It wasn’t her fault, after all. In the end, they convinced Jason that not only should ‘not-so-bad-guy’ not feature in my column but that while they are investigating, my column should not run at all. 

“Mitchell will be happy,” I sulked. “I hope that hamster’s been practising.”

Jason smiled, which looked as if it caused him pain, probably because he very rarely did it. “Take some time off. It’s paid time off. Most people would kill for that. Spend some time with your kid. Do some knitting. Write your autobiography. I don’t know. I’m sure you’ll keep yourself busy.”

\*

I wouldn’t call myself a workaholic. I mean, I like to stay busy. Who doesn’t? But being off work was difficult. I’ve never been the ‘daytime tv’ kind of person.

We stayed with my parents for a while, which wasn’t ideal for anyone, but as much as it pained me to admit it, I *was* frightened about the fact he knew where I lived and that the photograph had my daughter in it. 

However, nothing much seemed to come of the investigation, and eventually we moved back home. 

In the time I’d been off work, Jason had had quite the epiphany. He decided that Agony Aunts were old news and that what readers want is something called a “missed connections” column. It involved obsessive, desperate people writing in to describe an attractive person they saw on the train and wanted to ask out on a date. Seemingly incapable of actually talking to the fellow human they had spent their commute creeping on, they took to the newspaper to try and reach out to them. It was supposed to be “romantic” or something. 

One of the benefits, according to Jason, was that the “missed connections” column sort of ran itself, in that all the content was provided by the readers who wrote in. Despite my protests, I was relegated to writing horoscopes. (“Just make shit up, it’ll be easy!”) 

I lasted a month before I left the job. I then spent a miserable year working on a gossip column for a not-very-well-known magazine, before I packed it in altogether and sold my soul for an office job with my own claustrophobic cubicle. I wasn’t content, exactly. It was not my passion. But raising my daughter and seeing her grow into an independent and fully-functioning person with her own opinions and interests gave me joy. 

It was several years later when I came across the job opportunity. I hesitated about applying, not wanting to give up the security and regular hours of my somewhat boring job. But my daughter, now a teenager, no longer needed me as much, and I knew that eventually I would need to start working towards my own life goals again, lest I become one of those miserable ‘empty nest’ parents in a few years. 

Jason had been right in that agony aunt columns did fall out of fashion, but the job I saw advertised for a local radio station was similar enough. Instead of sending letters, listeners would call up to talk about their problems. I’d never done radio, and was worried about having to think of what to say on the spot, but twenty minutes into my interview, I was completely and utterly sold on the idea. 

To my delight, one of the interviewers, who was quite a bit younger than me, remembered reading my column growing up and pushed not only to hire me, but to change the name of the segment from what was going to be “Daily Doctor” (terrible, I know)  to “Ask Anita.” 

It was like a dream and I was caught up in it. Before I knew it, I was on the air. And I needn’t have worried, because once I got used to a new way of doing things, I was in my element. I genuinely loved taking the calls, and my segment became popular. It was only a daytime segment on the local radio, but as far as I was concerned, I may as well have been an A-list movie star. 

\*

I remember it was a slow day. I hadn’t slept well, my hormones reminding me of my age. It was one of those days where you’re trying to just get through to the end. I knew I wasn’t doing a great job with the callers and I’d been asked during a break to “liven things up a bit” which had got my back up. When the next call came through, I answered with the most false, over-the-top “hello” I could muster up, earning me a few scowls from across the room. 

“You came back. You should have stopped.” The line was crackly and the man’s deep voice was barely a whisper.

“I’m sorry? You’re through to Ask Anita. Can I ask what’s on your mind?”

The line went quiet for a moment. And then, the sound that chilled me to my very bones. 

“Mum?” It was my daughter, her voice shaking. 

I don’t even know what happened next. I remember my daughter crying and I was shouting. I remember the line went dead. I remember the sickeningly-upbeat song that they cut to. I remember knowing that something was very wrong, but my brain couldn’t connect the dots. I couldn’t comprehend what was happening, why my daughter had called in or who the man was. 

I remember the heart-wrenching moment of being told my daughter had not turned up to school that day. I remember the way that my hope was smashed to pieces as I found out that she was not at home and that her friends had not heard from her since last night. I remember not being able to concentrate on the police officer’s questions. I remember begging them to tell me what was going on, and when they didn’t know, screaming at them to just tell me everything was ok. 

I thought I had known fear before. But it turned out I hadn’t. Not really. Fear isn’t the tingling in your stomach before a job interview. It isn’t the way your heart thuds before you walk up on stage. It’s all-consuming, completely paralysing, helpless. Every second, every fraction of a second felt like hours until I felt I couldn’t even breathe through the intensity of it. 

I’d always made a point to give my daughter privacy. I thought I was doing the right thing. I wasn’t given privacy as a teenager and so I hid everything and anything I could from my parents. My daughter and I had a close relationship; she told me about her life, about her feelings. The police went through everything, picking apart my daughter’s life, which like many teenagers in this day and age, was very much online. 

At first, nothing they found surprised me. Her friends were the friends she talked about to me. The pictures she uploaded were the same ones she showed me. The boys she liked were the ones she had lamented to me were more interested in her friends. 

But then there was an app. When the police told me about it, it instantly reminded me of the ‘missed connections’ column that had replaced mine, so many years ago. On this app, people would upload pictures of people they’d seen in the area who they wanted to date. Somebody had uploaded a picture of my daughter, out with her friends, and had written, “To the girl in the red top. I saw you walking past while I was with my friends. You probably didn’t notice me, but you’re the most beautiful girl I’ve ever seen.”

My daughter had messaged him, along with a selfie to prove it was her. She was clearly flattered by the attention, especially having been singled out from her friends who she had always deemed as more attractive than her. 

This person posted a picture back, of a normal-looking teenage boy, and they’d arranged to meet. For a moment, I started to feel hope again. It was just a teenage boy. Maybe she had snuck off for the day to meet him. But I knew, as soon as I thought it, that it didn’t make sense. Why wouldn’t she have contacted me? And why would she be calling into the radio show? And that voice was not a teenage boy’s voice. 

My eyes flicked down to the username of the account that had sent the messages.

 “NotSoBadGuy” 

The whole world seemed to fall out from under me. The memory of the man who sent the little red envelopes so many years ago, came flooding back to me like it was yesterday. Whereas my brain hadn’t been able to process anything up until now, the cogs started turning. 

Had this person from all those years ago really taken my daughter, all because I’d started another job as Anita? Is the reason I hadn’t heard from him for so long because my column had stopped? Had he really been lying in wait, to take revenge because I didn’t put his letter into my column? But why would he care so much? Surely after all this time, this maniac would have found other things to focus on. 

I became paranoid then, my fear making me distrusting of everyone. I started thinking back on all of the people I knew back then.

I’d heard that Joanne had been given a promotion a few months after I left and became quite successful, writing opinion pieces. But why would she have gone through such a crazy scheme to get me out of my job, and why would she care that I was doing radio now?

Could it have been Jason, as a way to push me out? That made no sense either. He was in charge and when he wanted to ditch my column, he did. He didn’t need some insane plot to do that.

I didn’t care that it didn’t make sense. I started pointing fingers at everyone I could think of, telling the police to go and get them all, to bring them in, to make them give me my daughter back. By the time I was ranting about Mitchell and the guitar-playing-hamster, the police advised me to go home and get some rest. Not that anyone could rest, when something like this was happening. 

\*

After the longest 13 hours of my life, the police were able to work their magic to track them down. Maybe it’s lucky to live in an online world now.  I don’t know much about technology, or apps, or anything like that. But I know that in the days of sending letters to newspapers, they may not have been able to find my daughter in time. 

NotSoBadGuy, as it turned out, was not any of my coworkers or casual acquaintances that I’d accused. In fact I’d never met him at all. It turned out I’d featured a letter from his wife in my column many years ago, advising her that if she had fallen in love with her affair partner, she should leave her husband and start living the life she wanted to live. I told her that it was the only fair thing to do for her, her husband and her new partner.

I don’t even remember the letter to be honest. It was the kind of letter I’d receive weekly. Not interesting or unusual in any way really. But her husband, NotSoBadGuy, blamed me for the break-up of his marriage and had become obsessed with stopping me from “ruining more lives”. 

My daughter was unharmed, but understandably shaken. I wish there’d been something bigger, some resolution or moment of realisation. Instead, the complete randomness of the person I’d never met, who wanted revenge on me for the letter I couldn’t remember writing, but had written with the best intentions, still haunts me. 

If there is nothing for me to regret, nothing I could wish I’d done differently, nothing I can control, it makes it all so much more terrifying. If one innocent action on an unremarkable day could lead to this, what’s to stop something like this happening [again?](https://www.reddit.com/r/viciousmock/comments/i5robb/list_of_stories/)"

I'm a web developer that's currently on the lookout for front-end or full-stack roles, but I'm a fresh graduate that hasn't actually had a job like this before, nor any internships. This means I'm on the search to get my foot in the door in any way I possibly can. While I have made a portfolio and a resume, I am struggling, and I'm under pressure to pay my rent while working two part-time jobs. It especially is hard finding time between these two jobs, since one pays $10 and another $11.50, necessitating me to take long hours.  


I'm on my own in this regard, as I have no family members that can take me in, nor parents. I have to be with a roommate and pay them $650 a month. I'm getting desperate to find a way to get the job I truly want with the pay I need. I don't really know what my options are other than sending out applications again and again, so any help would make all the difference."
