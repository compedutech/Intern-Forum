I'll lay it out for you all and maybe someone can help me decide whats best because I've been unusually indecisive. 

I'm currently working part time with a medium size manufacturing company where I go to school that produces automotive wiring as a Facilities Engineering Intern. 

I have received offers from both A) A renowned diesel engine manufacturer for a Manufacturing Engineering Intern in a heavy engine plant, and B) A grain processing company as an Operations Management Intern.

Both offers allow for direct hands on experience with projects. Offer B probably allows for more direct experience seeing as how they don't have an engineering department on site. Although the Offer A is better because they have an engineering department although I most likely wouldn't get as much hands on. 

Pay is about the same, with Offer A not providing housing, and Offer B providing and covering all housing costs. 

I think my real issue is that I know offer B is going to be easier because I don't have to look for housing and its a bit closer to home. Offer A provides a position and title that is similar to what I would like to do after school, or so I think at the moment.

I got offer A after offer B and I haven't signed anything with offer B but I accepted their offer and toured the place. So I have to basically renege on offer B if I go elsewhere.

TL;DR having indecisive moment and should most likely follow my gut. "

I have completed a range of class projects using all of these technologies and I have been working in the IT department at my school as a student web developer managing and creating content with dotnetnuke, sharepoint, windows server 2012, and sql server management studio for just over a year.

I have never used a lot of the software they mentioned in their job listing (SAP Crystal Reports, BusinessObjects, Clarity PPM), and I have never done any sort of network analysis or design work. 

So, my question is this: How do I leverage my current experience while minimizing my lack of real networking experience in this situation? While I have a basic understanding of what the job entails, I really kind of feel like I am jumping into an entirely new world. 

Suggestions on things I should be reading up on before my interview or terms/concepts I should understand would be great as well.

I have found at least two Entry Level Tech Support job postings saying A+ cert is a plus.

What should I do with my month until school starts? Should I study for the A+ cert and try to earn it to get into a tech support job? Should I study for CCENT or a Microsoft certification now instead? Or, should I do Codecademy and learn to code all of those languages, hoping that it all looks good on a resume for software jobs?

I had an interview with Amazon once and bombed it due to severe underpreparation.

I feel like my efforts are better spent by: (1) practicing interview questions, (2) getting small programming gigs (jobs, side projects) to gain skills, have fun, and build my portfolio, as well as to narrow down what aspect of web-dev I'd like to focus on (3) going to a career workshop to refresh myself on what companies are actually looking for.

I am in the need of some career advice about work and or further education.

I am currently 19 years old working as an intern/apprentice at a city council. Which has rougly 500 clients/users, a wide aspect of users, all from totally incompetent users, who call 1-2 times a week to some people who solve their own problems and call maybe once every 6 months.

I have about 6 months left of my internship at which I will take my ""apprentice test"" if I pass I will have certificate of apprenticeship. 

This will be August 2015, I have 2 choices.

Get a job which is relevant for IT-Support (Which seems like a bitch to put it mildly in my city) or go back to school, study for a year, and eventually study at the university and get a bachelour of some kind. 

I would mostly like to continue working at my current job, but that is out of the question considering they are not allowed to hire interns due to it being state/goverment. 

Are there any tips and or guidelines on what to do if I'm applying or looking for work within IT-Support? I'm always early at work, I work late if needed, I love working with support and computers."

“I have a bluescreen.  Can you please have a tech come look at it?  Thank you.”
I made my way to her room, introduced myself.  She greeted me politely and showed me her computer.  I didn’t see a bluescreen so I asked her what the issue was.  She pointed to her background and said “There!   See?”

“But that isn’t a bluescreen that’s a…Oh”

When we made the jump from xp to 7 we disabled background settings so the users have our light blue hospital colors as their background no matter what.  It wasn’t a “Bluescreen”  it was a “blue screen”.  She wanted to know how to change her background, which I told her she could no longer do.

While my grades are pretty decent (cgpa 3.5+), I've done cool projects in some courses, and participated in some competitions (and winning one of them), I'm not too sure how far those could possibly carry me.

On the other hand, some of my professors are doing really interesting work and I have done extremely well in their classes (and I'm in their good books). The only issue is that I would rather get an internship instead of summer research and the second big issue is that if a professor does accept to work with me, that would finalize the application. The deadline for NSERC is quite soon (February 25th?), meaning I would have to go through the professors in the next week or so.

Vancouverites (or people in general), where does a student go to try and find a job for the summer? Is there some bundle of information out there that I don't know about?

I want to study up on algorithms and data structures just for general knowledge, and to make internship interviews easier.

Keep in mind that I will be doing a data structure and algorithm course in about a year or two (2nd year if not 3rd). I thought I get a head start on learning some of them.

I am debating between the books Algorithms (4th ed.) by Robert Sedgewick and Introduction to Algorithms (3rd ed.) by C.L.R.S

I am considering the book by Sedgewick since it is written in Java and if there ever is a time where I must implement an algorithm, my go to language would be Java. So it would be nice to see things implemented in Java.

However, The introduction to Algorithms book seems to have a lot more detail, and is written in pseudocode, which pretty much means it can get applied to any language. Not that Sedgewick's Algorithm book won't allow that.

I need to advice as to which book to buy. I looked at the algorithm course website for my school, and it seems like they use the book Introduction to Algorithms. So if I buy Algorithms by Sedgewick, I might need to buy the other one as well.

**TL;DR** Algorithms (4th ed.) by Robert Sedgewick or Introduction to Algorithms (3rd ed.) by C.L.R.S.


Edit: I think I should state that I already know the basics of  a lot of what is presented in the book. Such as how different sorting and searching algorthims work and basics of time and space complexity (Big O). How hashmaps, hashsets, trees, linkedlists, stacks and how queues work.  I don't know how to prove any of them though (ex. I understand the merge sort algorithm, but I don't know the reasoning behind why the average case is O(nlogn).

I was planning to go to grad school for psychology to do 1 year 'conversion' course (uk system). I evaluated my personality and interests and I figured psychology is a good fit for me. Besides it simply being a damn fun job, I enjoyed the 'human' aspect of being a photojournalist...connecting with people on a deeper level than say, PR. And I always felt 'helpless' being a journalist and unable to directly help my subjects. I also enjoyed the psychology courses I took at college...and would've majored in psych if I didn't get into media/journalism school. My girlfriend also works as a psychologist and very often I find myself envying what she does at her job.

But I got a call recently from an ex-colleague from my photo days. He's now an editor at another local paper and he's invited me to apply for a 'visual content producer' position. It's as close to news photography as I can get, but I'm not sure I'd be cool with dumping my eggs in the news media basket, especially with things all going online and the 24 hour news cycle. My gut says I wouldn't be comfortable with that kind of working style eg. speed over quality..and I'd have to do 'multimedia' (new-fangled term for using audio and videos together with still images) because it's the next big thing in journalism. I have the basic skills for that but I'm honestly not a huge fan of the medium.

And if I leave the job I don't know what else I could do, with visual journalism being pretty niche. I wouldn't be able to waltz into a 'normal' office job if I ever get married and have kids, and want 'normal' work hours.

Still, going back to the newsroom would give me the chance to escape a desk bound life, and I do enjoy being in the thick of the news. I know some of the guys in the department and they're cool dudes, so the working environment would be good. 

If I go back to school, I'd be pretty old when I finish my 1 year conversion course...and I'd probably have to do 1-2 years more of school to get in-depth psychology training in clinical/educational/industrial psych. And psychology graduates are being churned out by the boatload so getting a job isn't a lock either. 

I feel like going back to the newsroom would be the 'safe' choice...I probably won't hate it and I might even grow to enjoy the multimedia stuff...since at heart it's dealing with visual storytelling, which I'm passionate about. Trying to get into psychology is the YOLO option, and I'd be almost 30 or older by the time I start to look for work, so the practical aspect scares me a little. I'm also a little wary that I'm 'idealising' psychology. In some ways it's also about choosing 'fun' in the newsroom, with high adrenaline breaking news, going to cool events, etc. versus further self-development and intellectual pursuit (I always regretted that my college education was too 'technical'/vocational in nature with the journalism and filmmaking stuff).

Sorry for the novel...any opinions?"

 I am a Chemical Engineering student with a concentration in Environmental, going into the second semester of my senior year (I'll be graduating next semester, in December). At the beginning of my Junior year I switched my major from Chemistry to Chemical Engineering but I did not get any sort of internship last summer.This means as of now I'm a senior without any actual experience with an engineering job. I am good student who understands material well, and currently my GPA is pretty good at a 3.24, but I'm having some issues about getting an internship...my previous semester and the one before that I was having a lot of personal issues with anxiety, and so I put in little effort into finding an internship. I have a resume and did interview with one company that came to my school who gave a presentation and let us sign up for interviews, but that was pretty much it aside from attending the career fair. I feel very lost and uncertain about what to do...getting an internship is a lot more important to me now than school, but I feel hopeless at times, especially with my anxiety that I am completely too late and will never be able to get an actual career in the field. 

There is a career fair next week that I will attend, but there is only like 1 or 2 companies with things that are relevant to engineering. I just want some advice as to where I can still look and what to do, and maybe some assurance as well. I'm probably going to apply to a few wastewater treatment plants through my city's human resources department but I feel like that might be scraping the bottom of the barrel..."

The Krrt'arrn ship sliced through the atmosphere on the Skk'rll home planet, quickly coming to a hover and settling down on a sandy beach on one of the many small tropical islands that were the only land on this planet. Scoutmaster Svigg'ntt paced along the beach, checking the datapad on his purple, furred tentacle to see how the intern was doing. The prognosis was not good; no matter the species, one does not survive partial collapse of the cranial cavity.

The sounds of splashing redirected the Scoutmaster's attention to the waterline, where his contact, Commander Cicc'rnd, emerged from the waves. He seemed like an enormous slimy blob, 1.5x the height of Svigg'ntt, amorphous and such a dark purple he looked almost black, even in the bright sunlight and far-too-hot air of his home planet. 

Neither of them liked being here. Svigg'ntt was too densely furred for this heat and the Skk'rlls lived in the briny oceans and could not risk drying out.

This was why Earth was perfect for both their colonization efforts.

&lt;*One of my crew was severely injured in our attempts to do your dirty work,*&gt; Svigg'ntt began. He tapped the datapad until a blue hologram began projecting, showing a kitchen. &lt;*As you can see, they eat with their food arranged, almost ritualistically. They even use inanimate objects to prepare and display their food before consumption.*&gt; Neither could hide their disgust at the backwards natives' propensity of using dishes. The horror. &lt;*Furthermore,*&gt; Svigg'ntt continued, zooming in on the sink, &lt;*they are inefficient at consuming food. After they finish, they seem to remove unconsumed food particles from these objects using tools that look remarkably like your combat form.*&gt;

Cicc'rnd did not move. He rippled his skin, turning a dark red in a wave from front to back, showing anger. **[They mock us! Unknowingly, yes, but our honor has been insulted! We shall wipe them from their planet and take it for ourselves. Lights know we would treat it much better than they do.]**

Svigg'ntt performed the Krrt'arrn equivalent of a frown. &lt;*I must warn you, Commander. The individual who injured our crewman so was a juvenile, barely past their larval stage. These individuals are STRONG.*&gt; 

Cicc'rnd looked at the vitals of the injured Krrt'arrn, and rippled once more, becoming black. Resolve. **[You are physically fragile. You admitted this when you proposed this alliance, when we agreed you would take the land for yourself and leave us the sea we need, giving us 70% of the planet in exchange for our assistance. Do not worry about their supposed physical strength. Our soldiers will take care of that.]** From the water slithered several other special operations Skk'rll, each with a coral case of a coral powder with a structure similar to diamond. Dumping it all on the sand, the soldiers touched the pile and absorbed it into their bodies evenly. 

Before Svigg'ntt's very eyes, aided by the armor, the soldiers altered their shape into tall monolithic sponges, bleached white at the top, gradually becoming yellow two thirds of the way down. They faced Svigg'ntt in a semicircle rather reminiscent of Stonehenge. Before both parties returned to their ships and set course for Earth, Scoutmaster Svigg'ntt performed one of the few combat moves he was capable of. He used his tentacle as a whip and struck the Commander's armored form. A loud ***CLANG*** resonated through the soldier's body and echoed through the air.

There was no way the primitives stood a chance."
2ulh6q,1,2015-02-02,Life is not worth it...,throwaway602206,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2ulh6q/life_is_not_worth_it/,"I've been depressed and anxious for a while now, particularly about finding a job. I'm a computer science masters' student doing an internship that isn't very challenging and one of my main projects is done in a desktop publishing program. The others are data parsing in Excel and moving files into a database. Selling myself based on those experiences has been hard. I have research experience as well, but it's more on the engineering side, and most jobs seem to want tons of experience in very specialized things. They also say that majoring in a difficult field due to the abundance of jobs is the worst thing you can do, well, I did just that. I'm not a very good programmer, and I frequently have a difficult time finding motivation or figuring out where to start on a project. I also don't communicate very well in interviews, and I don't know the right questions to ask, or I freeze up and forget them in the heat of the moment, even if I've read an article on good questions to ask beforehand. I blew a phone interview with a recruiter last week. I think I must have Aspergers or something.

Finding someone would be impossibly difficult for me. I'm a gay male. I try and keep myself busy to avoid that thought, especially since this is my last semester, but it does nag at me. On the other hand, I'm not even sure I want one. I am somewhere on the autism spectrum and need my personal space, and I fear I would tire of another guy quickly. Not only that, but I have a few habits that might turn guys away if ever got to the ""living together"" stage. 

Also, my parents would be less than supportive, my mom is a traditional Catholic, and my dad is bipolar and worries about everything under the sun and stays up very late drinking and keeping us up sometimes. If I were to come out, I'm pretty sure the drinking would only increase. He also suffers from worse depression and anxiety than I do, and makes comments to me about how life isn't really worth living all the time. Him being those things and my mom being absent-minded can make for a stressful living environment at times due to all the yelling that occurs. He drinks a lot, and tends to talk a lot and keep us awake at night due to his mumbling and walking around. He doesn't have a job, my mom is the one that works and does a lot of the household stuff. Sometimes I want to just leave so they can get a divorce and they don't have to worry about me; I don't think they have a normal relationship.

It's also said you have to go through these tough times in order to appreciate the little things, well, I can't appreciate the little things regardless. I don't find satisfaction in I've accomplished or what I do, and I don't really want anything out of life. We were asked the first thing we would do with a million dollars, and I couldn't think of anything beyond renting an apartment. Life is too difficult, not worth it, and I won't be able to get any enjoyment out of it regardless of the hard work I put in. Ending it sounds easier."
2ulpyl,5,2015-02-02,TIFU by making the biggest mistake of my life.,ThisTooWontPass,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2ulpyl/tifu_by_making_the_biggest_mistake_of_my_life/,"Okay, It wasn't actually today. It was over the past couple of days.. But first, background. I have been in a relationship with my girlfriend for 5 years. This is pretty significant because we are both 20, we are each other's first significant relationship. 


Last semester I was in a class with my roommate and good friend who is single and has been looking for a relationship for awhile. We discover across from us in this class a very cute girl. Fast forward and my roommate and this girl have been talking for awhile they have gone to dinner and small dates but nothing beyond talking. I always thought this girl was cute and started to form a crush on her. This semester this girl and I have an internship and a very difficult class together that require us to spend a lot of time together. My interest in her grows, we become really good friends. She is pretty, fun, spontaneous, and essentially the perfect storm. 

Last Thursday we were coming back from our intense night class and we decide to get some food. To save some money we decide to get things to cook dinner. We head back to her place to cook. She makes me drinks. I happily drink them. After a few I am quite drunk [I'm a bit of a light-weight]. There has been flirting from both of us. She has to help me to the couch. Its too late and I am too drunk for the bus. She puts me on the couch and gets water for me. My arm is still around her from when she helped me over. 



My head is screaming at me. ""Don't do anything. You have been so happy recently, your life has been going so well."" 



I slump my head onto her chest. My hand then ends up on her chest. We make-out for about 10 seconds. We break apart after we  realize what we just did. ""Oh Fuck"" She goes up stairs to her bed. I stay on the couch. 


The next morning I get to my dorm. My two roommates and my friend are waiting for me. They are so upset at me for staying the night. I panic and tell them nothing happened. There is a heated shouting match with roommate2 [the one that wasnt seeing the girl] over how i could have possibly spent the night at her place knowing that roommate1 liked her. 


I *swore* to them that nothing happened. My girlfriend comes over. I explain to her that I was drunk and spent the night. She is okay with that. I *swore* to her nothing happened. She then goes and tries to calm my roommates that what I did wasn't that bad. She then talks to her roommates and they confirm that it isn't a huge huge deal.


About two days pass. I cant handle it anymore. I'm out to dinner with my girlfriend and I tell her everything. She is taking the news better than me. I had to stop on the way home to sob into the steering wheel. I then had to face my roommates and confess that I lied to them. 



These have been some of the worst days of my life. I never thought I would be this kind of person. I never wanted this to happen. My roommates are avoiding me. I'm avoiding them. My girlfriend isn't talking to me. I don't have many friends and my family isn't very helpful. I feel lost and I am terribly depressed. Everything was going so well until I did this. Now I have no one and will forever be known by this terrible mistake. I still have to live with my roommates, I already signed a lease with them for next year. I still have to go to my internship and class with this girl. Oh and I might have ruined my relationship with one of the greatest girls I have ever met. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**TLDR**: I cheated on my girlfriend of five years by drunkenly making out with a girl my roommate has been dating. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Also, sorry if this isn't to the normal reddit standards. This is my first account that I made solely to post this in hopes of somehow feeling like less of a totally shit person. 

*UPDATE:* 
Thank you everyone for your words of encouragement. I know I'm catastrophizing this. I'm taking it really hard because this is pretty much all I have. I didn't/don't have anywhere to funnel my emotions.

Also, It may not seem like a big deal to most people that we only made out. However, my relationship is a little strange in that my girlfriend and I have never had sex. We've done things but we never went all the way. She has never been comfortable with it and its her choice so I've respected it.

2um5f4,1,2015-02-03,Internships in software engineering as a math major seem impossible to find,idekia,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2um5f4/internships_in_software_engineering_as_a_math/,"I'm a senior in math with a 3.96 GPA. I have four years of research experience where I had to ""program"" (I use this term lightly) in mathematica. I’ve also had to use Matlab in some of my classes  I'm pursuing my PhD next year in applied math. If I could go back, I would have double majored in computer science. 

I’ve taken two course in C++ for elective credit. I understand the fundamentals. I know a lot about the math behind computer science (and can learn more easily).  I understand complexity, runtime, etc. I know algorithms on a very sophisticated theoretical level. 

More importantly, I feel like the design process of coding software is incredibly similar to writing a math proof. It requires perfect attention to detail, and doing it right is very different from doing it eloquently and efficiently.  Shortening a proof or problem with a relevant theorem is like using a package or boiler plate. I could go on.

It seemed logical for the next step to be a summer internship. But I’ve gotten two automatic rejections (within 5 minutes) from companies that I’m assuming automatically screen me out because I don’t have a major in {Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, …}. It’s never listed as an immediate requirement, so I just keep wasting my time.  I can’t upload a sample of my code. I can’t give an interview. I can only stare at a rejection from a do not reply email. 

Am I wrong in thinking that I’m at least enough of an asset to be given a shot? Sure, I only know a little bit compared to senior CS majors, but surely there’s use for a competent mathematician? I’m not looking for a glorious job at google. But I’m creative, motivated, and have research experience. Surely there’s some internship that could make use of someone who may need catching up on programming but can work on making advanced algorithms or doing sophisticated mathy work in xyz software. It seems like it could be a symbiotic relationship. 

Nope. Everything seems like “B.S. In computer science or equivalent or relevant work experience required.” I will keep learning. But I can’t help thinking there’s a glassdoor: “relevant work experience.” 

Tl;dr Competent math major with the mindset of a programmer. Keep getting automated rejections for summer internships in software engineering. Are there any internships you know of for a math major with beginner-level coding skills where I can hone my abilities as a programmer? If not, what should I do to get these opportunities in the following summers while I pursue my PhD. I dream of one day working in silicon valley using math to design extremely efficient, cutting edge software.

Here's the situation:

1. In my university we have a Professional Experience requirement wherein we need to work something like 90h to 120h to graduate.

2. My friend's working at this prestigious company that creates licensing software and royalty management or something. They have major clients like Marvel and O'reilly. For my country that's pretty impressive. My friend also told me how professional and friendly everyone was, so that also made me want to try out something there. He and (who I assume to be) the HR manager came to my university for a career fair and the HR manager was impressed. My friend put in a good word and she contacted me for an interview for a position that ""opens in the summer.""

3. I went to the interview, and after being asked about my experience in development they told me that they were really aching for a DBA-devops person right now. They said that they knew I was a dev first but that it would be a good experience for me and *implied* that later on they might transfer me to a dev role (but not in any concrete statement). They admitted that they brought me in thinking that this was a dev thing and that they were going to give me time to prepare and train for a DBA-devops thing. I said that I had little experience with it but told them that I was interested, at least to cover my bases in all aspects of development.

4. I need to graduate, so I have to take this at least on an internship level. I also have a $20k student loan that I'm fucking terrified of and want to get rid of as soon as possible, so I might stick there for a year to aggressively pay it off. However, I eventually want to transition to quantitative/computative finance/investment actuary/et cetera, and I really don't think that more than basic experience in DBA and devops is needed there, while developer experience is. I also don't want to lock myself in a DBA-devops career track. Where do I proceed from here? Should I start looking for other options as soon as the internship is over?"

Also on the plate someone with a bit networking knowledge I knew enough to be dangerous but not enough to swim. So the boss had no problem with teaching, I have no problem with learning. Talked about on call rotation, backups, DR, and role play scenarios for the rest of the interview.

To forgetting what default gateways do..:(At my six month review boss wants me to focus on doing things right the first time. He does awesome boss things and puts out fires, and defends me left and right.

At my year mark we talked about me trying out a Networking+ class and taking the network+ exam with the Comptia exam took the class and six months later failed the test. Not phased by it we keep on doing the good fight. The year goes on and I've really only helped out with one major project for the company, other things I've helped migrate multiple windows xp&gt;7.

Exp.,Jormugandr56,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2unqe1/getting_internship_as_transfer_with_little_prog/,"Hey, so I'm a recent transfer to a California UC for computer science. I was actually shocked I had been accepted because I really hadn't done any programming before being accepted and had none of the relevant coursework - but I was ecstatic either way. Being a transfer, I'm classified as a junior but taking all the basic CS classes this year, I'm really at the level of a freshman or sophomore. 


I feel that I've been learning programming quickly and I'm excelling in my major classes, but it's already February and I haven't applied to any internships because I feel like I don't know nearly enough. Considering I plan to graduate in 2 and a half years, that only gives me this summer and next for internships. Hearing and reading how important internships are, I've come to the conclusion that an internship this summer is essential. Knowing C decently, and in the middle of a course in C++, with a little python I've been learning on the side, should I write this summer off and plan on summer courses/more side projects? Or is it feasible to get a summer internship this late with essentially only three classes of programming under my belt to date?


Note, I am attempting to build a portfolio at the moment. I'm committing my projects to git hub and working on some side projects out of school (ex. tic tac toe in the console). 


If anyone has been in a similar situation, or has any insight into this specific scenario, I would greatly appreciate your help. Thanks.  "

I was able to code for the question, but there's an infinite loop in my recursive function. I forgot to check one of terminating condition until the interviewer pointed out with an example. I was able to give a verbal solution, and the interview ended up about 15 minutes earlier than I expected. 

Do you have similar stories? Do these initial phone screen interviews are knockout type, means they are just pass/fail type interviews? Or something else? 

I had a similar experience few years ago with MS on-site intern interview. I did Farly well on 2 and failed miserably 2. So I knew that I wont be getting an offer.

Since then, I've been rejected by about 15, and heard back positively from five, including two of the companies I'm most interested in. One of those two has said they want to bring me in for an interview, but they're still working on scheduling it. The other I haven't heard from since we talked on the phone a few weeks ago. They were very excited about me on the phone, though.

So, today, I had an interview with one of the other three. They really liked me, and gave me an offer on the spot. There are a few problems, though. First, they're offering less than I'd like. They're offering $55k, but I'd like at least $60k. I had a job offer for $65k a few months ago that ended up falling through (not enough work to go around), and one of the two top companies I've heard back from said, ""Oh, it'll be more than that"" when I mentioned that I was hoping for at least $60k. Second, they want an answer on Thursday. They originally wanted me to sign the offer there, but I asked for some time. Third, I didn't have a good chance to get a feel for their culture; the interview was in their corporate office, so I didn't meet any developers. Fourth, it seems like they won't be able to put me on the sort of projects I'm most interested in for a while, and I'd have to start out with other things. And fifth, as I mentioned, they're not one of my top companies. However, they're the only ones who have given me an offer so far, and they do seem like a good company overall. So, what should I do?

In case it's relevant, I live in the DC/Baltimore area, graduated with a BS in CS, minor in mathematics last May, an working through an online MS in SE program, and have seven months of experience from three internships at a well-known and well-liked government agency and a generally impressive resumé for a recent graduate. I can post my anonymized resumé if that's necessary, but I don't know that it is."

I'm a 2nd year Computer Engineering student, and I'm kind of in a unique situation.

Last week, I received an offer from eBay. I negotiated the salary, and so they cut the deadline short when they accepted my request ($37/hr). I accepted the offer, and it's for a Mobile Web Engineer internship position (mobile web dev for m.ebay.com). 

Today, I received an offer from Workday for $34. I think it's a great company, rapidly growing in cloud computing with industry leading HR Software as a Service. They said it's a flexible position, I choose a project that matches my interests, skills, and experience.

Which position would you guys recommend taking (aka me applying for internships next year)? eBay is a huge company with a pretty well known brand. Workday is rapidly growing but still decently known. The salary isn't an issue for me. eBay is mobile web development, while WorkDay is flexible, probably some sort of Java. I don't particularly care for either type of software engineering, as I'm hoping to get into program/project/product management within the next few years, or even that type of internship next summer.

Issue is, I already accepted eBay, but the offer was ""at-will,"" so I can terminate whenever I want. However, my background check is processing now and I've already done most of the paperwork. They also negotiated with me and I'd feel bad screwing them.

So yeah. What do you guys think, and which position would be better for me at this time?  I'm leaning towards sticking to the offer I already accepted - eBay. Please help, thanks!

I recently did a phone interview with amazon for a software eng internship ( I passed that online coding test where you have to fix bugs and stuff). 

So, I was asked some knowledge questions based on the classes I have taken so far, and also 2 coding questions. For the knowledge questions, I was a little fuzzy on what a foreign key was in a database, but I think I explained it well enough for the interviewer, and I didn't know what a copy constructor was (strangely enough I never learned about this, and I relayed this to the interviewer), but all of the other questions I answered correctly (he asked about polymorphism, inheritance, differences in some programming languages, what a deadlock is). Then he asked me 2 coding questions, one about binary trees and another which made use of a hash table, both were relatively simple questions that I had seen in CTCI before. For both I wrote working code, but when he asked me to analyze the time complexity, at first I did it wrong, I had to get a couple hints from the interviewer to do it correctly. I also made a small syntax mistake in my second question, because I had to use a set ADT to solve the question. Since I use C++ in my interviews, I used the STL unordered_set container to do it (which is implemented internally as a hashtable from what I remember). I kind of messed up the syntax on how to check whether or not an element is in the unordered set or not (something with the end iterator or something), but it was very close, I was just missing a couple parenthesis. I relayed to the interviewer conceptually what I was doing while I was coding, and he agreed that the algorithm works. 

I have this nagging feeling I will fail though. I already failed a google interview, and I don't have that many other interviews lined up. granted in the google one I did do measurably worse, but still, I heard that incorrect syntax and stuff like I did can sometimes be a deal-breaker, and also the couple times I messed up analyzing the time complexity made me uneasy. The interviewer said I did pretty good at the end, the fact that I really need this internship makes me uneasy though, and I feel like others may have out performed me. What do you guys think, do I have a good shot? From what i have read around this subreddit, this phone interview is the final one, there are no others after this one. "

Ever since I was little, I knew that I wanted to become a programmer when I grew up. I built my first PC in grade school, then during my undergrad I paid for school by building PCs (Hackintoshing was particularly profitable). In school, I dove into my programming classes, did all the internships I could, and now I'm living my dream as a developer. And since this subreddit is the ""PC Master Race,"" I'd think many people here would share similar sentiments. 

... Except that doesn't seem to be the case. From what I've seen, neither are many here at /r/pcmasterrace developers or software engineers nor do they have any intention of entering that type of field. It seems like many people here have yet to even write one line of code. What's even more unsettling is that there seems to be a negative attitude toward developers in general. Developers are often painted as the PCMR's enemy despite the fact that they're the ones who make it all possible! In contrast, many of the people that PCMR idolize have nothing to do with actually creating the software we all use and love. 

That said, I'd like to encourage all of you, especially those who are still in school, to seriously consider learning how to program and maybe even consider majoring in computer science and entering the software field. If you're intimidated and don't know where to begin, here's a little secret: Programming is *easy*! I mean, it can become very difficult, but the fundamentals are something anyone can grasp. I recommend checking out http://codecademy.com and going through their Python course. You can also check out subreddits like /r/programming or /r/learnprogramming for more resources. "
2uqprk,2,2015-02-04,Got a job in QA straight out of college almost a year ago. I can't stand it anymore and I don't know what to do.,samuraichikx,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2uqprk/got_a_job_in_qa_straight_out_of_college_almost_a/,"Hello /r/cscareerquestions, I'm in a bit of a conundrum right now and I would very much appreciate some input on it. I have a lot on my mind right now, so this is going to be a bit of a wall of text. I apologize.

I graduated with a BS in Computer Science in March of 2014 from a local ""public ivy"" (For what it's worth). I have been working at my position in Mobile SQA for about 11 months at a large company at its' global headquarters.

I should probably state that my previous experience (aside from my first minimum wage job in college) was primarily in front end web development (HTML, CSS, Javascript) with some back end (Python,Node.js, MySQL) at a small marketing firm, whose owner is a long time family friend whom I used to babysit for. He offered me the job after my sophomore year in college and I kept it for about a year and a half before applying to this job. The reason being was that I felt that I wasn't very useful to the company, as it felt like there simply wasn't much for me to do. I spent most of my working hours reading programming tutorials online for game engines or other languages. I also felt like I wanted a larger company environment (this company was max maybe 15 people), so that I could actually spend lunch with someone instead of eating alone at my desk.

My current job, as I said, is involved in Mobile SQA. Without going into much detail I will say that I work for a large international corporation whose flagship product is nothing close to Mobile. The product I work on primarily involves mobile device cameras. 

The position I originally applied for was ""Associate Quality Assurance Engineer - Mobile Automation"". As my friend at the company was heavily involved in coding an automation practices, I was under the assumption that I would be coding almost 100% of the time. When I started, this was not the case, which arguably should have been my first red flag.

I understand that there needs to be a learning curve, and the new people need to get used to the existing software, but for the first four months I was there I practically did no coding whatsoever. We were tasked with manually testing 70+ Android/iOS devices. I tried as hard as I could to push for Automation. I even spent a little extra time after work some getting some Junit tests set up, because during normal working hours, my boss wouldn't have it. Claiming ""we're too busy"" to implement automation. It's been almost a year and I'm finally able to implement some automation after the department got slammed by the CEO for not having any, but of course it takes a back seat to the manual testing that NEEDS to be done. After a time I was able to convince my boss to let me develop some of our test apps. I originally started with only Android development but was able to quickly transition to be able to do iOS as well. 

For the first I would say 4-5 months after I was hired, it was tolerable my coworkers (for the most part) are friendly and I get along with them well. After that point, though, things started to take a turn. To give you an idea:

1. Micromanagement is a huge problem. I am consistently told the same thing three times by three different people, and I'm too afraid to take a longer bathroom breaks (maybe 10 minutes?) lest I get yelled at by my immediate boss. Our VP is essentially acting like our Product Manager, often throwing out existing requirements for new ones. There is no official time for us to arrive (nothing was told to us) but if you arrive anywhere outside the window of about 9:30, shit hits the fan
1. The management team is completely numbers driven. To a point now where when American developers leave, we're replacing them with outsourced resources, despite numerous times in the past they have shown that they simply cannot deliver a working product. Usually whatever they give us has to be completely rewritten, and as a consequence, we're even further behind

1.  Management has absolutely no idea what realistic expectations are. We shortened our development cycle by about half the time, yet they still put the same number of requirements in product, and then wonder why everyone is behind. 
1. Overtime is an absolute must. Now, I'm not completely naieve. I understand that a product needs to be shipped and if backtracks happen or if something takes longer than you initially anticipated, you may need to work extra. What I can't stand is that they regularly put guilt trips on the ENTIRE staff to work the weekends just to get shit out faster and please the Executives. I would say every week on average  would be 45-50 hours, depending on how close to release we are

I can honestly say that I cannot stand the QA work.  I guess I feel useful, and obviously QA is a very essential part of the development process, but when we need to do a pass of manual regression I feel like I am just wasting my life. I'm not bad at the job, but it's not fulfilling – at all. I feel like I am not using my degree  (90% of the coding I do now is from home on my own projects), and I feel much more enjoyment from fixing bugs than I do finding them. 

Further, I felt like I gave up on my dreams way too quickly. The original reason I wanted to get into Computer Science was to do game development. (Yes, I know). I applied for an internship at a local, well known game studio during my Junior year, and after I was rejected I was too afraid to apply to any of their positions again. I recently became good friends with someone who works there, and they were nice enough to give me an internal recommendation to several positions, all of which I have applied for an am waiting for a response. 

I fully realize that the positions I am applying for are really competitive, but I like to believe I have even a small chance to land an interview. I have made several side projects in my free time and have started to really study interview and language questions so that if something happens, I'm prepared. I also realize the average salary for game development is, on average, lower than industry standard. Where arguably my company pays higher than industry average. But I realized recently ( as sappy as this may sound) that having more money means less to me than coming home fulfilled each day.

Meanwhile, the boss as my old company (Front End Web Dev) recently reached out to me (regarding some paperwork that wasn't taken care of when I left). Because he is a family friend, I let it slip to him that I wasn't very happy with my current job. His response was essentially “When you get tired of QA,  you should get back into Dev and get in touch”.

Unfortunately, the company that I applied to has a notoriously long waiting period between when you apply and if/when they contact you, so If I say yes to this, and if they happen to be interested in me, there's that complication.

I guess I'm just not sure if wanting to leave is me being too greedy, too naieve, or what. I understand there is a certain corporate culture that exists, but is it really THIS bad? 

Should I wait to see if I get a response from company A? Should I ask the development manager if he'd be willing to take on a junior developer? How long can I reasonably wait until I basically get shoe horned into a QA position for the rest of my career? I don't necessarily regret joining this company as I have and continue to learn new things, but not nearly as often as I like, and the main QA work is really beginning to wear on me.

Thank you if you read this far. Sorry for the wall of text and sorry if I seem like I'm being too spoiled or greedy. I would just really appreciate some advice.

TL;DR: Can't stand QA, Company culture is garbage. I want out, but how?

I like to learn math, make the occasional thing out of C#, make little games with my programmer brother for fun, and make the occasional website. Anyway, I'm not done with my IR degree yet and was wondering if a minor in CS (which I could accomplish with NO DEBT) is enough to get a job?


After I get a job, I would then seek to go back to my current school or an online program and get a B.S. in computer science. Will I need to get a full degree, or do you think I should just go ahead and (take on the debt to) get the full degree? I know I'll need (and want!) one to advance easily in the future.


Weighing the pros and cons or getting a B.S. now, and I don't know what to do. It will take me 3 more years if I tack on a B.S. at my current university which is known (but not famous Stanford/MIT/etc. level) for math/CS, or 1 year online at Oregon State. Either way it will add ~$26,000 of debt (I currently only have $5,500 debt). I just want to make a wise decision with my time/money/etc.

I've read the other questions about a CS minor and it doesn't look too promising. The answers vary wildly, just like they do with autodidacts.

Bonus Question: I could change my degree track from a foreign relations one to foreign trade/business ... would this look better to future employers, in your opinion?

TL;DR: Is a CS minor enough to get a job? Or should I Just go ahead and do the BS now?

2ury3a,48,2015-02-04,"Saying ""I don't know"" as an interviewee",routebeer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2ury3a/saying_i_dont_know_as_an_interviewee/,"I have my first ever technical interview tomorrow with a division of a company I would really enjoy working for, and I am extremely nervous. 

I've had a technical internship before (actually with the same company, but a different division) but I didn't have to take a programming interview for it.

To sum it up, I haven't studied as much as I should have (I am abroad this semester) and I'm not sure how it's going to go. I know it's not the end of the world if I miserably and embarrassingly fail but that never feels good. I've taken data structures (a year ago) and practiced up to halfway through Stacks and Queues in Cracking the Coding Interview, and if given enough time I can think my way through a programming problem, even if my answer is a bit messy. 

However, this technical interview isn't like most others (rote programming tests), in that you are asked about services like REST, maybe some SQL, and Java nuances. I mainly program in Java, but realistically I Google a lot when I am writing code to remember how to do minuscule things that I forget (things like converting from Object to int, specific functions for Collections, easy things that I take for granted, I don't have a lot remembered).

Since I've never had a tech. interview before I'm not sure what I'm allowed to do as an interviewee. Is it acceptable if I say something along the lines of ""Well Mr. Interviewer, I know I want to append this character to the end of my ArrayList, but I can't remember that silly ol' function, can you help me out?""

Or if I'm asked a question like ""What would final written in front of a method mean in Java"" and don't know the answer can I say ""I really don't know, but can I make an educated guess?""

Thanks for the advice, I really appreciate it, and here's to getting some real interview experience!

2us9qd,3,2015-02-04,Choosing between Microsoft and Google internship,hellathrows,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2us9qd/choosing_between_microsoft_and_google_internship/,"TL;DR: web dev internship with Google, cloud/Office internship with Microsoft, need help deciding.

I was fortunate to receive internship offers from both Google (Mountain View) and Microsoft.

With Google I would be building a internal web portal. The project itself is not bad, end to end web dev and data visualization. The team also seems pretty cool.

With Microsoft I would be working on something within Office related to the cloud. I would be choosing a project from back end services, front end user experience, data analytics, etc. 

I like the options Microsoft gives (I only have web dev experience), but the team/product itself doesn't seem that exciting. I don't mind doing more web dev either.

Here's how I currently weigh the two (mostly based on what I read/hear, please feel free to correct me):

Microsoft

- better work life balance?
- statistically higher chance of return offer (kind of nice since I dread interviewing)
- variety of projects

Google

- more exciting company and team
- slightly better on my resume?

I've also been told that Microsoft's best days are over, they're going downhill, etc. and Google is a better place to start out after college (the internship obviously gives me a good shot at a full time offer). Is there any basis to this?

I'm looking for any feedback, experience, or other advice that would help me make a decision. I'm a junior so beyond the internship itself, I'm also considering which company I would rather work at full time (assuming I get a return offer). Sorry for the somewhat long post and thanks for reading."

Is transferring a possibility, hopefully in first year? If so, how early can I transfer? The co-op program at UW sounds wonderful compared to the PEY at UofT. 

For example, having co-op from UW industry contacts after 1B and then continually throughout my education would be a very enlightening experience as to what real work is like. In comparison, UofT has their co-op at the very end and it's usually just at one location, much less of a chance to try out what I like. 

Also, if I had a good co-op rotation that I really enjoyed during my undergrad, I could tailor my course selection to mirror that career path. I know you can get internships over the summer, but how often does a UofT undergrad get the chance to work at a big company, like many Waterloo students do (or so I've heard)."

I'm guessing there's a major lacking in my resume, and would like some input on how to beef it up.

Are there any certifications I should go after? I am pretty confident in Excel and the Data Analysis Toolpak, and have a decent understanding of SPSS as well. Is there any other software I should start learning? Are there common starting jobs for people looking to work their way up in the field, or is it simply a ""graduate and get into the field""? I am not averse to taking on internships, but they all seem to be dedicated to current students, which leaves me out.

I was afraid that hiring managers see my psych degree and assume it has no relevance to the field, so I've been including educational experience in data analysis on my resume. Some people tell me that's a terrible idea, other people say it's the best approach for someone in my position. I've tried both ways and it never results in an interview. I have a solid GPA, and a background as a teaching assistant and research assistant, so I am confused about why I am not receiving any call-backs at all.

Any help would be very appreciated. Thank you!"
2uswbk,9,2015-02-04,[For Hire] I can teach you Web Development from scratch at $100/week.,[deleted],forhire,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/2uswbk/for_hire_i_can_teach_you_web_development_from/,"**What I'm offering**

I shall be your personal tutor and mentor over the period of time I teach you. I shall communicate with you using Skype/Hangouts. We shall be using a collaborative code editor and an online whiteboard alongside a voice chat. I shall begin by teaching you the basics of making a static website.

There's an important distinction for potential learners to understand: the difference between a web site and a web application. A web site contains static content that never changes over time (for example, your portfolio). A web application dynamically responds to user input and its content changes accordingly. Examples include services like Facebook, Twitter and so on. I shall initially be teaching you the basics of making a static website using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript, which is where everyone starts.

After this, you're given a choice. If you wish to work with CMSes like WordPress, it's useful to know PHP to create custom WordPress themes, and tinker with the backend logic. WordPress is by far the most popular blogging platform, so if that's where you want to go, I shall teach you PHP alongside MySQL.

If you're serious about creating Web Applications from scratch, I highly recommend using the MEAN stack. MEAN stands for MongoDB (the database), Express (a web application framework), Angular (a popular MVC framework) and NodeJS (backend server).

It's alright if these acronyms are going over your head right now; it'll all start to make sense when I start from the absolute beginning.

At this point, I feel like I should make a disclaimer: I am primarily a front-end web developer. I have worked with the full web stack, but architecting web applications on the front end is what I specialize in. **I am not a designer.** I shall teach you the tools to make any sort of website you want, but I am not qualified to teach you the basics of web design. Developers normally work *alongside* designers to recreate exactly what they want (they'd normally send you a PSD mockup), which you shall then be taught to replicate exactly. If you want to learn how to make a web site look pretty, please look elsewhere.

**Codecademy teaches this stuff for free. Why on earth should you pay me?**

That's a very valid question. You can indeed learn everything I am offering to teach for free. However, getting into web development can be overwhelming. You start with a simple HTML/CSS tutorial, you then move on to PHP. Then you read this blog saying that PHP is terrible. Then you'll find another guy recommending Ruby on Rails. When you've hopped on to that bandwagon, you'll find plenty of people recommending NodeJS instead. Then you find that one of the core contributors to Node has jumped ship to the Go programming languuage.

You find some people praising Javascript, and some loathing it. You do not know who to listen to. You follow interesting people on Twitter and read Hacker News everyday, and find so many acronyms thrown about and you have no idea what any of them are talking about. It's all going over your head. It is very easy to give up. I have gotten advice that I now consider bad when I first started out, and I always wished that there was someone to help me out, to guide me, to answer every stupid question I could think of.

Following random tutorials online makes your knowledge fragmented, and will not  give you the confidence of mastery over what you've learned. I intend clearly explaining everything I teach you, after which I give you small exercises to practise. I shall of course answer any questions you have.

We shall negotiate timings based on when both of us are free. I shall take 3 two-hour classes a week, apart from which I shall set weekly homework and shall be available to ask questions at any time. I promise to respond to any emails you may send me within 8 hours of my receiving them.

**My credentials**

What makes me fit to teach this, you ask?

In the past, I have made an HTML5 game using the Phaser framework ([Leaping Cube](http://arunmahadevan.me/leapingcube/)), and a chat bot ([Chat with Amy](http://chatwithamy.github.io/)).
I have interned at a pretty well known startup in my country (I shall PM its name if you’re interested), where I worked on their custom URL shortener, and contributed highly scalable code to it. I have worked with GulpJS, Grunt and Yeoman to automate several tasks. I am reasonably comfortable with MongoDB and Redis, having used both at my internship.
I wrote the URL shortener I mentioned above using NodeJS and Express. Apart from that, I have also used Socket.IO, and am reasonably familiar with concurrent programming using Node.
Other miscellaneous stuff I’ve worked with include: WordPress, Jekyll (the CMS), Bootstrap, Foundation.
Finally, [here’s](https://github.com/arungm29) a link to my GitHub.

I'm hoping to get an internship or something similar this summer, so that means I should be able to afford my PC this summer. I'd like to stick to Intel processors, but if there is an AMD chip that is just as good or better, then I'm all for it. I'd like to have 3 TB of storage as well, I have a lot of info that needs stored as well as media and games. 

I'd be primarily using this rig in college, for gaming as well as my main computer, retiring my current laptop to a smaller role. I'd like to be able to play games at a reasonably high level, and I use Solidworks quite a bit as well, so great CAD performance would be necessary as well. I'm going to be running a two monitor setup, so I'm not sure what the best connection would be, and if I could do it on my current setup. Audio doesn't really matter that much, as I'll use a desktop speaker set that plugs into the headphone port.

Here's the build I created, let me know what I can improve upon or if its sufficient enough. I'd like to keep the price between $700-900 net total, including the mail in rebates.

2utdie,2,2015-02-04,Fucking frustrated,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2utdie/fucking_frustrated/,"I'm 21 years old. I've been dealing with depression off and on since my early teens. Until recently, I had only very seriously contemplated suicide once, back when I was fourteen, and I spent a night sitting in my bedroom watching music videos on VH1 with a knife to my wrist. Darker songs pushed me closer to doing it, while songs with hopeful messages pulled me back. The song ""Falling Slowly"" from the film *Once* saved my life that night. 

Fast forward a few years. After over a decade of frustration and confusion, at the age of 18, I was officially diagnosed with ADHD. My GPA was already irreversibly fucked, but thanks to a good standardized test score and A LOT of extra curriculars, I got into a decent college. Over the course of my freshman year, my Adderall XR started to really fuck with my head, and I had far more frequent occurrences of depression and thoughts of suicide. I told my PCP about this, and he switched me over to Adderall IR, which I now take three times a day. 

Fast forward 2 years to 2014. To say it was a stressful year would be the understatement of the century. I won't go too much into details, but basically, Spring semester was hellish. My roommate (who I considered to be one of my best friends... we saw each other like brothers) and I brought in a third roommate to help with the cost of rent. The new guy turned my old roommate against me, and our apartment became a complete shit hole. Every night there were strangers smoking weed and wax, dropping acid, and rolling molly. They ate my food (in a time when I basically had to choose whether to pay rent or eat at least two meals a day) and basically made me feel unwelcome in an apartment that I was paying hundreds of dollars a month to live in. I spent most nights that semester sleeping in the basement lounge of my girlfriend's dorm, pretending that I fell asleep while studying so I wouldn't get kicked out into the cold. Later, after he moved to a separate apartment down the hall, new roommate broke into my place and stole a ton of my stuff, then wrote himself a check for $150 with my check book. That whole thing still hasn't been cleared up yet, because the cop that was working on the case retired. 

Over the summer, my girlfriend of nearly two years went off to an internship in a city several hundred miles away. In August, she broke up with me, because she didn't believe in me and she had fallen in love with a guy in her building (who I later found out didn't feel the same way about her). 

Fall semester: At this point in time, my depression has come back in full swing. Thanks to a late night class, I had to come down from Adderall around 2 or 3 in the morning every Monday, which usually led to powerful suicidal thoughts. Over the course of the four months preceding this semester, I had three powerful panic attacks: one because of financial issues, one because a repressed memory of a sexual assault came back to me, and one because my girlfriend broke up with me while I was telling her about said sexual assault. I was a fucking mess. In September, I met a new girl, and she's absolutely wonderful. She almost killed herself in October. She texted me that night, hinting that she was depressed and saying that she knew she wouldn't do anything, but that she was scared, and I barely responded, because I was drunk with my new, current roommates. I feel immensely guilty about this. 

Over the course of fall semester, my already crushing debt got substantially worse. During the first week of school (two weeks after the break up with my old girlfriend) I drank so much I had to be taken to the hospital. My dad was between jobs at the time, so I didn't have any insurance for the hospital bills. Stack that on top of the $650 I owe my old landlord from the druggy apartment, the $200 I owe the power company from the druggy apartment, the $75 I owe Comcast, and the $1600 I owe my current landlord, and you have an incredibly stressful situation. 

When I was home for Christmas break, I saw a doctor at the same practice as my PCP (he was unavailable) and I told her about my depression and panic attacks. She gave me a prescription for Zoloft, which I started on January 2nd. A combination of side effects from both the Zoloft and Adderall, paired with the daily reminder that the Zoloft brings that ""Hey, you're depressed, asshole."" has cause this to be the most dangerous month of my life. I struggle with suicidal thoughts almost every day. 

I'm a Psychology major, and the more that I've learned about ADHD over the past month, the more I've realized how completely fucked my daily thought process is. This newfound self awareness is soul crushing, because I'm just now realizing how often I just don't get shit done. Even when I want to get shit done, I can't. Dr. Russell Barkley refers to this as ""the heart of the ADHD patient"", in that the mind and the will are constantly at odds with each other. It's like half the time, I'm under a spell and I don't even know it. I'm so terrified that I'm going to fuck up *again* and then have nowhere to go in my life. With a psychology degree, I need at least a master's, if not also a doctorate if I want to succeed in the medical world, or even get a decent job. The ADHD medication only does so much. It helps with the focus portion, but does nothing to curb impulse control, so half the time I take my meds to do homework, I end up browsing reddit for hours or reorganizing my iTunes library. 

I just feel so hopeless and broken and scared. Part of me just wants to roll the dice and hope that the Hindus are right and that reincarnation is a thing and that I'll be born with a brain that has proper levels of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. I mean, fuck, my MBTI personality type is an ENTJ. That's one of the rarest in the world, and is basically the personality of leaders (Julius Caesar was believed to be one). Seriously, go over to /r/entj. Imagine being born with that mindset, and decent intelligence, but a fucking awful case of ADHD-C and depression. It's like a mental ALS, it's fucking torture. I have so much I can give to the world, and my brain can do so much, but it won't fucking let me. I fucking hate myself. I have no real control over myself, let alone my life. Everything's a fucking mess. If you actually read all of this, kudos to you. Thanks for listening to my rant. 

tl;dr: ADHD + Depression + Ambition = hell"
2utdle,0,2015-02-04,Had a great conversation at a career fair. Did well enough in tech interview the next day. Only did mediocre on the next online tech interview. Is sending a short explanatory letter pointless?,richandrare,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2utdle/had_a_great_conversation_at_a_career_fair_did/,"As the title states, I had a great conversation with a company at a career fair on campus. That night I received a invitation to have a technical interview with a software manager the next day. Did well enough, but would not say I aced the interview question. But it was good enough to move on to the next round/phase.

The next phase was an online technical challenge. I felt I really needed to excel here to get invited to come interview onsite. Unfortunately, I only did pretty mediocre.

Quick background: Graduating in spring, but I also currently work full time as a software engineer while in school

So, my question is, is it worth while to send a followup/explanatory letter or is this either completely pointless or even harmful?

In the letter I was thinking of first of explaining that I have never been a great exam taker, and tech interviews are very much in this vain. I have always gotten top marks on all of my programming projects, but exams just take a different mindset. I then wanted to point out that this does not mean that I do not do well under pressure, as at work I can thrives under deadlines when needed to have something implemented in time or when given an ultimatum that performance must improve by next release.

I would then go on to point out the ways that I know I could have improved my technical interview, and also mention that I have completed a similar problem for school, but with a complexity level that is much more involved.

Lastly, I wanted to list some benefits that I think other college grad applications might not have that I do. First, because I have been working full time as an engineer for the past year, I will be coming with much more first hand knowledge of working with large million+ line code bases, where many students only get a brief expose to this in an internship. Second, I wanted to mention that because I graduated a few years ago in an unrelated field and have since returned to school for CS, I belief I have a drive and determination to make up for this lost time, that many students do not. This is the reason that at my current job, I was upgraded from intern to full time, in the middle of my internship, only a few weeks out of training, and also the reason that I have been selected to be part of the team to develop our next generation software (if I stay where I am), while many others will be maintaining our current, soon to be legacy product.

Thoughts?"

Hello everyone.

First I want to say thanks to the people that started and maintain this subreddit and I am really thankful I happened to come across it in my search for help on my resume. 

I graduated in 2014 with BS in business with a concentration in finance. While in school, I worked about 30+ hours a week as a server to support myself while living on my own. I did not partake in any school events nor did I spend any time networking. I would not come to realize the gravity of these choices until after graduation. I had this idea that going to school and doing my very best in my courses would guarantee me a job after graduation. I realize now that was not nearly enough.

I came to this country in 1992 from a little town on the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan at the young age of 7 along with my immediate family, which included my parents, 4 brothers, 2 sisters, and 2 nephews whom I see as my brothers. The highest level of education my dad had was high school, while the highest level of education my mother had was middle school. We were very poor growing up but we struggled and endured to make something of ourselves realizing that we were given this once in a lifetime opportunity when we were allowed to move to the United States under refugee status. 

I am proud to say that with the help of this great country, we have 3 doctors in the family, 2 more with biology degrees working towards medicine, 1 training to be a firefighter, and then there is the black sheep of the family, me with a business degree. lol. Thank you America for giving us a life that we could not have dreamed of. To think what would have become of us were we to have been denied our entry visas absolutely terrifies me. 

I wrote that little bit about my background in the hopes that it gives you the reader more info on how best to give me some feedback. I missed out on a lot of what was necessary in school, e.g. internships, networking, social events, because I simply did not know those were things I had to worry about. My parents did not have the knowledge to stress to me the importance of internship experience or the significance of the social networking. The horrible attacks of 9/11 caused my family to become reclusive with regards to meeting other people because we feared for our safety. My mother and sister would be walking in the neighborhood for exercise and cars would drive by while yelling anti-Islamic insults at them. A lot of their fear was also left over from their days in Afghanistan so naturally they prevented us kids from participating in school events which caused us to develop social anxiety.

I graduated in 2012 and continued to work as a server while looking for a more professional position that would utilize my education and degree. In early 2013, I had an interview for a finance position at Intel that I was highly considered, however they gave the position to someone that was older and had relevant finance experience. I felt utterly defeated and this completed crushed my self-confidence with regards to my job search.

After Intel, I continued my job search but almost in a self-defeated manner because I was fearful of being told no again. My girlfriend was given a promotion in Southern California so we moved in July 2013 from Sacramento to Orange County in SoCal. 

Here is where I started to really learn more about myself now that I was no longer under the umbrella that was my family nor the pressure of filling the shoes that my older siblings had left me. I underwent very positive changes in my life after moving down to SoCal. I started to eat healthier, started to exercise daily by running along the beach and P90X3 at home, I started reading for recreation again, but most importantly I started to focus on my career situation. I am also starting to take some Java programming online classes to increase my skill set while also working on my social anxiety by participating in beach cleanup events. To keep myself afloat, I sold most of the electronics I had, which was a decent amount. I buy and resell electronics while continuing my job search. I also help people with their electronics needs, repairing computers, building computers, and other electronic related services. However, I need a stable career where I have ample vertical movement.

I did not think I was going to type all that but I really wanted to give as complete of a picture of who I am as I could over the internet.


TL:DR
28 year old dude with a business degree with no relevant finance experience that would like some help on his resume to have a better chance at scoring an interview. 


Also, what websites or methods do people recommend to get their resume out there?


Thank you to all who took the time to read that and also to everyone that offers advice.

2utu73,1,2015-02-04,Should I spend another semester in grad school or am I harming my future?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2utu73/should_i_spend_another_semester_in_grad_school_or/,"Hey guys. Bit of a long read because I've been mulling this question over and have no answer yet. I don't really have anyone to talk to who could advice me on such matters so I'm turning to the next best thing.

Bit of background: I'm an international graduate student in the masters program of a top-10 Uni in the US. As of such, getting a job is important when I graduate due to the visa restrictions on me staying in the country unless I'm studying full time or working. 

Although I joined as a masters I've been doing research since my first semester here. I was initially working in deep learning which was of huge interest to me, but I switched to a different field of AI (applications of game theory) since it funded my studies completely (also its very interesting in parts to work on).

I essentially wanted a job in some machine learning role (I'm not being specific because my view of ml is divorced from what is applied in the industry) where I would have challenging problems to work on (I had previously worked in a very well known software giant for a year but I felt quite unfulfilled there), but because of the requirements of my program and the heavy load of research, I've not achieved the level of comfort that I would want in that area. I have taken the graduate machine learning courses, advanced AI courses and courses in pgm etc but I always felt I was somehow just making it through these.

The more i dove into AI, the more I realized my basics in probability and statistics were lacking, that my background wasn't great, and that all the PhD's that I work with are way smarter. 

I basically felt really flawed and that it was next to impossible for me to catch up with a lot of the people here. I'll admit I've spent a lot of my time feverishly spurred by despair and feeling depressed in turn. I know it isn't good to compare, and I usually try and surround myself with people smarter than me so I can learn from them, but I honestly felt I wasn't living upto my expectations. 

Traditionally the masters program is only 2 years long, and nobody stays beyond that. The idea crossed my mind of staying one more semester (where I would only have to take 2 credits, so almost no courses) and spending those 4-5 months strengthening my grasp on the fundamentals required to advance in this field...build my base up from probability and stats, calculus, optimization and machine learning. 

I dont know whether I would still be continuing my research in the extra semester (depends on the funding) so I might have to pay out of my own pocket. Since it's only 3 credits I might be able to bear that burden.

My question was, in your opinion, is this a wise move to make? The kind of roles I'm looking for require a good working knowledge of ML, and I would feel more confident if I had that. However, I've been told things like no one stays for 5 semesters, its a waste of your life since you can study while in a job and that companies wont interview me if I stay for an extra semester. I didn't intern anywhere last summer since I was doing research (although I got two publications that summer so I have something to show for it).

I have interviews lined up with some great companies (albeit not for the roles I might want) and I've been urged to finish things off and just take a job. I'm scared of getting into a job that I might not like and not being able to shift fields once I'm in there. Then again I'm pretty naive about how careers grow, so I can't say that this fear is rational.

Sorry for the long rant, became longer than I meant it to be. If you read till here, thanks."
2utw5x,8,2015-02-04,2 Intern Offers,Quadraphonics,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2utw5x/2_intern_offers/,"Hi I have two intern offers. One at a fairly well known company that may IPO in around 2 years time, or one at a really successful startup that just raised ~10 million in series A funding.

Both companies use interesting software stacks, both seem to have a cool company culture. The compensation is decent for both of them.

There would be many people who could mentor me at the first company, whilst the startup has ~6 devs. I wouldn't say the startup is a tech company, but its edge is definitely due to its tech and you could definitely say its a tech driven company.

I think both companies would be great to work at, but I was having a hard time picking between them."

Is there any big name company which is still hiring for summer?
I am a sophomore and not a junior so I already have low chance. 

Also if they have stopped hiring then why do companies come to Spring 2015 intern fair?
I know a lot of big name companies like Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft are still coming even when their capacity is almost full.

Are they focusing only on Master level students now?"

i.e., what knowledge must you posses in order to get an internship using a high level language in software development? 
(java, c++, etc.)

Looking for experiential anecdotes if possible.

My background: I have had a few interviews for internships a while ago, but most of them went nowhere past the initial interview. I now know a good bit more 1.5 years later down the vine and have more experience. I'm getting more interest and more callbacks and am curious if at this point the HR people will think I'm worth hiring."
2uubqs,1,2015-02-05,Transitioning from an technical degree to a CS Master's?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2uubqs/transitioning_from_an_technical_degree_to_a_cs/,"Hello, 

Right now I'm a junior in an Information Technology at a state university, and while I'm doing well in my major, I've discovered that I don't care for the networking and system administration. I changed my major from accounting to IT a year ago, since it would allow me to graduate on time and I was interested in cyber security. I've have internship experience in cyber security research (mainly cloud computing and data analysis, not too much development) and I've taken several CS courses. I don't think I'd have an issue getting into a Master's program at a decent university, I'd probably just have to spend a year taking Calc I &amp; II and maybe some higher level CS courses before hand, but I've already taken the core CS courses (Data Structures, OOP, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems) so it won't be a massive educational hurdle. I wanted to know if anyone here here has transitioned from a technical undergraduate degree into a Computer Science related Master's  or even second bachelor's degree, and if it was difficult to get jobs/experience afterwards? I feel like I'll be at a massive disadvantage compared to CS grads who've already had at least 3 years of academic or work experience in programming. I'm sure there's people who've transitioned from degrees such as Electrical Engineering or Physics and wound up taking another degree related to CS, but I'd like to hear how people have transitioned."

I've applied via glassdoor and school sponsored site and have had only a handful of phone screenings and interviews all leading to no avail. 

Some factors thats been hindering my job search has been my low 2.5 gpa and lack of experience(internships). 

Now I'm looking to you guys who've had more experience than me for advice on what I can do in my situation. I don't want any hand me outs I want some way of gaining experience while I'm searching. Do you guys suggests any sort of personal projects I can do or maybe unpaid internships please just any resource or advice would be greatly appreciated.

A little background about me I specialized in embedded systems design and I generally enjoy programming. I've had a fair bit of experience in C,C++ through coursework and personally delved into java and python just because they look interesting. 

Anyway looking forward toward your responses thanks!"

2uusj0,6,2015-02-05,Should I tell my current advisor that his colleague fired me a few years ago?,[deleted],GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/2uusj0/should_i_tell_my_current_advisor_that_his/,"When I had just graduated from undergrad, I got a prestigious paid internship abroad with a big wig in my field. It ended up being a disaster. I worked under his grad student, who had a reputation for being terrible to work with. She was rude and demanding, not to mention sexist (she once said out loud in front of the big wig that women in science should never have kids if they truly cared about science, the big wig himself said nothing in response). Since I was very intimidated, and also a derpy recent graduate, I did not learn the necessary skills and I made mistake after mistake. I was fired after a month of being there. I ended up working with another lab and doing fine, but the experience was very embarrassing for me. 


Fast forward three years later. I got a master's degree, and now am a 1st year PhD student in a new lab. My new advisor is awesome and we have a great working relationship. Here's the thing- he is friends with the big wig that fired me. They went to the same school, although they don't work in the same subfield. My advisor is teaching an undergrad class for which I am the TA, and I feel awkward because in class he talks about the big wig's research frequently, referring to him as ""my friend big wig.""



Should I tell my advisor I was fired a few years ago by his friend? I am worried he may hear it from him, instead of me. Or worse, there will be an awkward encounter when he tries to introduce me and finds out we know each other. 



I haven't told him yet for a couple of reasons: 1) because we are still getting to know each other, and 2) just last semester I had a similarly terrible working experience with a different professor I was TAing for, and long story short I ended up leaving my TA position. The professor is being investigated by the department for making us work 40+ hrs/week among other things. But I worry that if I tell my advisor about being fired 3 years ago, it will be too close to this event, and it will just sound like I am a gamble to work with. 

**tl/dr: I was fired as a paid intern three years ago, now I am in a new lab. My new advisor is friends with the guy that fired me. Should I tell him?**"

So now I only have such a limited time to take internships or even some certificates to prove to them I have the ability to study CS.

:--|:--
[How did you meet MatPat? and How did you convinced him to put Crossover in his channel?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2utwck/iama_full_time_video_game_youtuber_ama/cobmxzc?context=5)|I've known Matt since he uploaded the FIRST EPISODE OF GAME THEORY on ScrewAttack.com!  I was an intern at the time and was in charge of promoting community content, but I immediately fell in love with Game Theory and promoted it every time Matt uploaded an episode.
 |Every time I promoted it, I sent him an email and we got talking.  Matt has claimed to me that if I had not given Game Theory that initial audience and push that it might not be the success it is today, but I completely disagree.  I think the show is great enough that it would have gotten huge sometime or another.
 |So when Matt did his video game crossover episode of the show, I was inspired to make as many connections as I could.  This lead to the creation of my crossover database and is what inspired me to make Crossover in the first place.  I whipped up the first episode and showed it to Matt and he DEMANDED that I make it part of the Game Theorists.  The rest is history!
[I didn't know you knew Matt for so long, in that case,  I guess that means it wasn't so hard to get him to do the nintendo-verse crossover.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2utwck/iama_full_time_video_game_youtuber_ama/cobnl5b?context=5)|It wasn't hard in the slightest!  People assume that the video was the best in the series because Matt wrote it, but in fact, Kenny and I wrote that one hundred percent!
[Ever though about doing another episode with him, or being in an episode of Game Theory? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2utwck/iama_full_time_video_game_youtuber_ama/cobo5u0?context=5)|Matt and I are currently in talks about bringing me on for an episode of Game Theory, but who knows when and if that will ever happen, haha!  Matt is the busiest person I know!
[Which characters do you mean in each smash bros game? What specifically do you like about them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2utwck/iama_full_time_video_game_youtuber_ama/cock908?context=5)|N64: Samus.  She just feels the most... my style out of all of the characters in the original.
 |Melee: Fox.  Come on.  No items, Fox only, Final Destination?  I practically invited that crap!  Pure speed, hitting your opponents before they can hit you!
 |Brawl: Zelda/Shiek.  These two have INSANE versatility!  if I need to be speedy, there's Sheik, but if I am dealing with someone with a lot of projectiles, Zelda is the best way to reflect, fight from a distance, and quickly get away from close combat.
 |Wii U/3DS.  LITTLE MAC!  This guy is a POWERHOUSE!  He's strong, quick, and has tight control!  Sure, he's defenseless in the air and has no recovery, but if you can dodge/counter enough attacks, there won't be any trouble at all!
[Bunch of random questions, some might have been asked: what are your top 5 video games of all time? what do you currently game on? Have you ever tried gaming while blindfolded? What is your favorite genre of games? what is your favorite movie? And finally would you rather fight one left shark sized duck or 100 duck sized left sharks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2utwck/iama_full_time_video_game_youtuber_ama/cobsqyf?context=5)|I actually don't have a favorite game or a top five.  I like so many games and I think so many are equally good that I can't narrow it down.
 |I am currently on multiple games.  I am playing Phoenix Wright: Trials and Tribulations, Papers Please, EarthBound, and Papers Please.  I kind of bounce between them all at the same time.
 |I have tried gaming while blindfolded!  My friend tried navigating me in Super Mario Bros, but that... did not work out too well.
 |My favorite genre is platforming games.  I think the require the most skill to play.
 |My favorite movie is The Fifth Element.
 |That last one is a variation on an old classic!  I think I'd fight a shark sized duck!
[What do you think about gamergate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2utwck/iama_full_time_video_game_youtuber_ama/coc8rl6?context=5)|Are people still discussing GamerGate?  I thought that finally quieted down.  I supported what GamerGate was initially about, getting corruption out of ""game journalism"".  However, what it turned into is just plain embarrassing.
[Can you add subtitles, like the non, shit ones youtube does?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2utwck/iama_full_time_video_game_youtuber_ama/coc8rl6?context=5)|As for subtitles, yes I can.  I am starting to upload my scripts for any videos that have them and converting them into subtitles, but for my more improved stuff, I do not.  It's a PAIN IN THE ASS to transcribe every word that I say so I just don't do it.
[How do you plan to keep things going as you get older?  Do you plan to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2utwck/iama_full_time_video_game_youtuber_ama/cod496o?context=5)|Most of my colleges refuse to believe me when I say this, but I do not think that YouTube can be a life long career.
[(also curious as I've been meaning to make some Let's Plays to showcase some games I like that not many may have heard of, and am curious as to the lifetime of a youtuber career\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2utwck/iama_full_time_video_game_youtuber_ama/cod496o?context=5)|For me.  I am keeping a close eye on the skills that I have been building through my job.  I know the ins and outs of social media, dealing with the public is something I do every day, I have to network CONSTANTLY, and I have charisma.  Those are all skills that can not be taught and are extremely valuable in the job market.
[Who are your influences? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2utwck/iama_full_time_video_game_youtuber_ama/coc5bb9?context=5)|Too many to list!  What sets me apart from many other professional YouTubers is that I watch A LOT of YouTube.  Most people I know in the industry only watch a few people if any.
 |I keep up with over a hundred channels and I try to take inspiration from all of them.  If I see them do something that I like and that I think would mesh well with my style, I find a way to put my own spin on it.
[Is there a game that you just can't get enough off?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2utwck/iama_full_time_video_game_youtuber_ama/coc6pq1?context=5)|I can NOT get enough Animal Crossing.  The zen feeling that it gives me is soothing and relaxing.
[Also, in your opinion, best game out there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2utwck/iama_full_time_video_game_youtuber_ama/coc6pq1?context=5)|As for what I think is the best game out there.  It might seem weird, but Shovel Knight.  I literally can not think of a single thing that can be improved on in that game.  The only thing that could make it better is being able to play as the other knights, but look at that!  It's going to be free DLC!
[1\) can you discuss the deal you have with youtube? i.e. what you get for views/likes/comments/ads/subscribers?  2\) are there any alternative ways you can get your content/subscriber base monetized that we don't really know about (i guess besides ads and direct compensation by youtube\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2utwck/iama_full_time_video_game_youtuber_ama/cobn2mq?context=5)|1) I have no exact numbers for my work on Game Theory, but on my main channel, I get roughly a million views a month, THOUSANDS of likes and comments, the occasional ad, and almost seventy thousand subscribers.  2) Without going directly through YouTube and AdSense, you need to partner with a network in order to monetize your videos.
[3\) what would you like to see happen to the infrastructure/market of video streaming?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2utwck/iama_full_time_video_game_youtuber_ama/cobn2mq?context=5)|3) I would love video streaming and content to be taken WAY more seriously.  Right now, it is viewed as ""not real entertainment"", but in time, I think we'll see most companies spending their advertising budget on web content over traditional media.
[How are you compensated by youtube? by # of views, likes, subs, or a combination of all? and what is the rate? I'm sorry if it looks like i'm trying to get sinsitive info out of you but I need these values for my analysis.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2utwck/iama_full_time_video_game_youtuber_ama/cobnl74?context=5)|It's really complicated to be honest.  It's a complex algorithm based on people seeing the ads, how long they watch it, if people click on them, if they skip them, etc.
 |There really isn't a set rate considering that it's always in flux.  For example, rates more than double as it gets close to the holidays and companies are spending more money on advertisement.  Here in January, the rates are pitiful since everyone spent their advertising budgets during the holidays. :/
[If I remember correctly you've also been pursuing a career in voice over work.  If you could be cast as ANY character to provide the voice of who would it be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2utwck/iama_full_time_video_game_youtuber_ama/cobnehi?context=5)|Yeah, at one point I seriously wanted to be a professional voice over artist, but that's a LOT harder than it looks.  I auditioned for the role of Brief in ""Panty and Stocking"", but I obviously did not get the roll.
[Has that 6 changed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2utwck/iama_full_time_video_game_youtuber_ama/cobnehi?context=5)|If I could voice any character though, I think that I be able to deliver a fine Tim Drake Robin!
[ what do you think of boats?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2utwck/iama_full_time_video_game_youtuber_ama/cobnehi?context=5)|As for trains, I sill have fond memories from when I was a kid, but I am not as smitten as I once was.  As for boats, they're alright.  They rock a little too much for my taste though. :/
[What are your thoughts on the Oculus Rift and is it a step in the right direction for the future of video games ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2utwck/iama_full_time_video_game_youtuber_ama/cobncde?context=5)|I actually have not experienced the Oculus Rift, but many of my friends and colleagues have!  Based on what I have heard from them, it's not quite the future of gaming, but I could totally see it getting there one day.
 |The biggest thing is that you can't physically move around in a 3D environment.  I think that the Oculus and other VR headsets will be the future of porn before they're the future of gaming. :P.

One of the interns discovered that the Chrome process is running in Task Manager at login, but if the process is ended, Chrome will start just fine. If possible, we don't want to inconvenience our students by making them go through this step every time they log in. I've Googled, but haven't found any solutions that seem like they would work for an entire pool of linked clones, just short term or single desktop fixes. Does anyone have experience with this sort of thing? Is there something I can do on the base image to fix the problem with a new snapshot and recompose operation?"

I am 2nd year CS student and have applied for a 12 month placement with a world-class software design company's London office, I have passed the original CV and online test stages and have now been accepted for the next stage; an online webcam interview which requires me to answer a series of pre-recorded questions with my webcam active while being recorded, the 'interview' will then be sent to the company and assessed. 

As the interview is with a robot instead of a real person, I can start the interview at any given time -- but I wanted to research these types of interviews a bit beforehand, and I have some questions such as:

* What sort of questions should I expect to be asked? 
* What sort of technical questions are likely to be asked? 
* Are there any 'buzzwords' or pre-prepared statements I should throw in for extra brownie points?
* For behavior-based questions, what sort of traits do these sort of companies like to see in potential interns?
* For technical questions, how should I react if I don't know the answer? 

I think I would be less nervous if there interview were with a real person, I feel like it's going to be awkward trying to answer pre-recorded questions while starring into a webcam.

Thank you! "

So I'm 22, graduated last year from a great university and started work in August for a big consulting company. It's a great job considering I'm fresh out of college and I can work from home, so I'm currently living with my parents outside the city away from friends but saving money. It's a good thing I have going, but the truth is I'm sort of unhappy. I'm basically a data analyst/entry-level consultant for this company and I'm starting to realize I don't like the technical side that much, and it's getting very technical so I'm struggling to perform well. Also I have no social life because my friends live far away, and I never interact with co-workers in-person. I really want to move out west, get a different job that's more collaborative for a company with more culture, and basically start new (been wanting to live on the west coast for a long time). But I'm only 6 months into this job, and they are currently training me for 2 projects -- one was unexpectedly postponed until July but I've already been trained some and they want to finish it next week, and the other project is for me to work on until July. Both trainings are extensive and have steep learning curves. I haven't talked to my manager in 3 months. I guess he's really busy and I'm just a new hire, I don't know. 

I know it's irresponsible to: 1) Quit a job before completing 1-2 years minimum at a company. 2) Quit during/right after training or mid-project. and 3) Quit without having another job lined up. But right now, I kind of want to do all three. I think I'll be unhappy all year if I wait to finish the projects. But I also don't know exactly what career I want to pursue, just something that's more collaborative, meaningful, and where I don't have to stare at a computer screen by myself most of the day. Should I start applying for jobs now even though if I'm fortunate enough to get an offer, I'll already be in the middle of a project?

Also as a side-note, I'm in a long distance relationship that is very serious and it's getting to the point where we can hardly stand being away from each other. She just finished an internship so now would be a good time for her to move, which she wants to in order to be with me. 

So... What do you guys think? I figured you fine fellows might be able to help me get my mind straight, and I value everyone's input. Thank you all for reading this.

TL;DR Got a good job, but unhappy. Want to quit but recently hired and training for year's worth of projects. Also lonely, living with parents in the suburbs."
2ux7ep,4,2015-02-05,The eternal (5 year) struggle: GPA vs. Self,Ad_Astra5,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2ux7ep/the_eternal_5_year_struggle_gpa_vs_self/,"Hey everyone.  This is my first post on this sub, and I'm looking forward to meeting/chatting with many of you!  I'm a 5th year MechE student at a University in PA, expecting to graduate in June.  I'll keep it short and to the point, since I'm more interested in hearing other people's stories than recounting my own!

One thing I've learned about myself in the last 5 years is that I do so much better under ""real-life"" circumstances than I do reading out of a textbook and taking exams.  I've had three excellent internship experiences, two of which included the potential for a full-time offer, and one of which I ended up taking (to begin after graduation).  I loved all three of them, and I performed well - taking my relatively basic knowledge of theory and applying it to my much more proficient abilities when it comes to hands-on projects.  I'm going to be a ""real"" engineer in a few short months, and I'll be heading straight for an entry-level position at what may very well be my dream company.

I should feel good about that.  Some days, I feel *great* about that.  But every time I leave my internship to come back to school, I feel as though I'm performing at a level below where I want to be when it comes to textbook theory.  The fixation on grades and GPA chips away at my confidence as each week goes by.  Sometimes I feel as though maybe I don't deserve this chance.  Maybe someone else could do it better, and I'll just disappoint people when I get there.  Maybe I'll be a *bad* engineer.  After all, how could a good engineer get *this* on a test?  Most of the time I study hard (and I'd be the first to tell you if I didn't), but sometimes I just can't get it in time for the midterms or the final.

Maybe today's just one of those bad days, and maybe I'll be overthinking this until the day I graduate.  But I suppose what I want the most is to hear from other people on this sub.  Have you ever felt similarly?  Do you work better in school or ""on the job?""  How do you stay focused and confident when it seems like it's not going your way?

Cheers, all.  Looking forward to hearing from you!"

It's a 2011 model(silver case) and still functions. However, the delete, zero and forward slash keys no longer work, which can make it a bitch to use. Those symbols have to be copied and pasted in. The CD drive doesn't work either. Because it has water damage (actually soy sauce...) the Mac store wants to charge an absurd amount to fix it. I bet a third-party repair company could at least fix the CD drive, though.

I was thinking $200 was fair, but wanted feedback. And let me reiterate that despite how janky it may be, the computer works. I made it through 3 months as an editorial intern writing articles on it every week.

My manager from last year offered me the chance to intern again with them this summer due to some people leaving (they were downsizing before and weren't going to hire an intern).  They pay is good.

I think long and short term I will be better off diversifying my skills and going somewhere else as I did not learn as much as I wanted to last summer (there was not always enough work to go around.  I had many small projects instead of one big one, and now the most experience people have left).

I feel crazy, but I think I am going to decline the offer and head to the career fair next week.  I am just a little nervous because if I go hunting for a summer internship now my chances of getting a good one are lower since I'm so late in the game.  

Also, I need to start looking for full-time jobs around this time or pretty soon...

This past semester I've earned nothing but A's in all of my classes, while still maintaining my course load as far as honors/AP's. I have also been involved with extra curriculars such as Girls Scouts, Varsity Tennis/Lacrosse and numerous lengthy internships in addition to having a job all 4 years. I was rejected from University of Oregon this past week and I'm scared WSU will give me the same decision, although I seem to match well with the school my confidence level is pretty low right now after the UO rejection. Every prediction site I've used gives me a 100% chance, but I'm still somewhat concerned.

Looking for a year placement internship; got an offer from a fairly large engine testing company yesterday, they want an answer by Tuesday night.
Problem is; I've now got a interview on Tuesday with a larger, closer company which seems more suited to what I want to do, I also have a phone interview with Bentley on Monday and an assessment centre for the company I really, really want to work for on the 26th.

Dont get me wrong, the placement I've been offered looks really good; hands-on, able to network with engineers from large OEMs and the guys there seem a great bunch with a low staff turnover.

However, I cant help feeling I may regret taking it later on when im looking for graduate (chassis dynamics) jobs, which I will get experience of at the other companies.

I also dont want to regret not taking it, screwing up the other interviews and ending up somewhere I don't want to be.

Here is the problem. I'm a recent grad, and I don't have extensive work history. I worked on campus at a dining hall, so all those managers have since either rotated out or don't remember me 2 years later. 

I worked as an intern at a start-up, and my boss there will absolutely be a reference for me. He is awesome.

I worked at a non-profit for 6 months, and my direct manager at the time no longer works there. My indirect manager works there still, but it was 1.5 years ago and she may not remember me well enough to do a reference. She is a maybe-reference.

My current job is a temp job. I work a few weeks here and there, whenever there is work to be done. One of my managers when I first started is a cool guy who seems to have recognized my value, as he pulled me in on a few bigger projects though I was new. He has since moved up in the organization and is an indirict manager. 

Would it be inappropriate to reach out to him via email and ask if he would reference me for a new job? It seems bad to ask a current employer for a reference, but at the same time the people at this place are aware it's an in-between job and have a lot of turnover with employees, and many employees have second or third jobs. They seem opposed to getting called for references, and say we shouldn't list their number for a reference at the orientation thing before each project, but would it be ok to email just this one man and ask him about doing an email reference for me?"

Other interviews have been mostly behavioral with some technical questions (one was an abstract thinking problem and another guy asked me some general questions about Java). All of them either drop contact or send generic rejection emails. At this point I'm probably not going to get an internship (even though I'm a junior) and I'll probably be unemployed for the rest of my life.

I shall be your personal tutor and mentor over the period of time I teach you. I shall communicate with you using Skype/Hangouts. We shall be using a collaborative code editor and an online whiteboard alongside a voice chat. I shall begin by teaching you the basics of making a static website.

There's an important distinction for potential learners to understand: the difference between a web site and a web application. A web site contains static content that never changes over time (for example, your portfolio). A web application dynamically responds to user input and its content changes accordingly. Examples include services like Facebook, Twitter and so on. I shall initially be teaching you the basics of making a static website using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript, which is where everyone starts.

After this, you're given a choice. If you wish to work with CMSes like WordPress, it's useful to know PHP to create custom WordPress themes, and tinker with the backend logic. WordPress is by far the most popular blogging platform, so if that's where you want to go, I shall teach you PHP alongside MySQL.

If you're serious about creating Web Applications from scratch, I highly recommend using the MEAN stack. MEAN stands for MongoDB (the database), Express (a web application framework), Angular (a popular MVC framework) and NodeJS (backend server).

It's alright if these acronyms are going over your head right now; it'll all start to make sense when I start from the absolute beginning.

At this point, I feel like I should make a disclaimer: I am primarily a front-end web developer. I have worked with the full web stack, but architecting web applications on the front end is what I specialize in. **I am not a designer.** I shall teach you the tools to make any sort of website you want, but I am not qualified to teach you the basics of web design. Developers normally work *alongside* designers to recreate exactly what they want (they'd normally send you a PSD mockup), which you shall then be taught to replicate exactly. If you want to learn how to make a web site look pretty, please look elsewhere.

**Codecademy teaches this stuff for free. Why on earth should you pay me?**

That's a very valid question. You can indeed learn everything I am offering to teach for free. However, getting into web development can be overwhelming. You start with a simple HTML/CSS tutorial, you then move on to PHP. Then you read this blog saying that PHP is terrible. Then you'll find another guy recommending Ruby on Rails. When you've hopped on to that bandwagon, you'll find plenty of people recommending NodeJS instead. Then you find that one of the core contributors to Node has jumped ship to the Go programming languuage.

You find some people praising Javascript, and some loathing it. You do not know who to listen to. You follow interesting people on Twitter and read Hacker News everyday, and find so many acronyms thrown about and you have no idea what any of them are talking about. It's all going over your head. It is very easy to give up. I have gotten advice that I now consider bad when I first started out, and I always wished that there was someone to help me out, to guide me, to answer every stupid question I could think of.

Following random tutorials online makes your knowledge fragmented, and will not  give you the confidence of mastery over what you've learned. I intend clearly explaining everything I teach you, after which I give you small exercises to practise. I shall of course answer any questions you have.

We shall negotiate timings based on when both of us are free. I shall take 3 two-hour classes a week, apart from which I shall set weekly homework and shall be available to ask questions at any time. I promise to respond to any emails you may send me within 8 hours of my receiving them.

**My credentials**

What makes me fit to teach this, you ask?

In the past, I have made an HTML5 game using the Phaser framework ([Leaping Cube](http://arunmahadevan.me/leapingcube/)), and a chat bot ([Chat with Amy](http://chatwithamy.github.io/)).
I have interned at a pretty well known startup in my country (I shall PM its name if you’re interested), where I worked on their custom URL shortener, and contributed highly scalable code to it. I have worked with GulpJS, Grunt and Yeoman to automate several tasks. I am reasonably comfortable with MongoDB and Redis, having used both at my internship.
I wrote the URL shortener I mentioned above using NodeJS and Express. Apart from that, I have also used Socket.IO, and am reasonably familiar with concurrent programming using Node.
Other miscellaneous stuff I’ve worked with include: WordPress, Jekyll (the CMS), Bootstrap, Foundation.

You follow interesting people on Twitter and read Hacker News everyday, and find so many acronyms thrown about and you have no idea what any of them are talking about. It's all going over your head. It is very easy to give up. I have gotten advice that I now consider bad when I first started out, and I always wished that there was someone to help me out, to guide me, to answer every stupid question I could think of.

Following random tutorials online makes your knowledge fragmented, and will not  give you the confidence of mastery over what you've learned. I intend clearly explaining everything I teach you, after which I give you small exercises to practise. I shall of course answer any questions you have.

We shall negotiate timings based on when both of us are free. I shall take 3 two-hour classes a week, apart from which I shall set weekly homework and shall be available to ask questions at any time. I promise to respond to any emails you may send me within 8 hours of my receiving them.

**My credentials**

What makes me fit to teach this, you ask?

In the past, I have made an HTML5 game using the Phaser framework ([Leaping Cube](http://arunmahadevan.me/leapingcube/)), and a chat bot ([Chat with Amy](http://chatwithamy.github.io/)).
I have interned at a pretty well known startup in my country (I shall PM its name if you’re interested), where I worked on their custom URL shortener, and contributed highly scalable code to it. I have worked with GulpJS, Grunt and Yeoman to automate several tasks. I am reasonably comfortable with MongoDB and Redis, having used both at my internship.
I wrote the URL shortener I mentioned above using NodeJS and Express. Apart from that, I have also used Socket.IO, and am reasonably familiar with concurrent programming using Node.
Other miscellaneous stuff I’ve worked with include: WordPress, Jekyll (the CMS), Bootstrap, Foundation.
Finally, [here’s](https://github.com/arungm29) a link to my GitHub.

2v0teb,1,2015-02-06,[Personal] What should I do with my life? Adults of reddit please help,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2v0teb/personal_what_should_i_do_with_my_life_adults_of/,"Hello adults of reddit I'm 16 and currently having some conflicts over what I wanna do with my life. Im a junior in highschool currently in AP Physics , Pre-Calc, AP US history, and yada yada blah blah but thats not the point. I've always told myself Im going to do something I love with my life so I can make a living and enjoy what I do. I've always loved computers building my own a few years back always researching them and reading up on the lastest developments so The idea of a Computer Engineer came to me. It sounded awesome I would get to design computer parts maybe work for a big company and have a role in the tech industry. A few other aspects I'd like to have would be a social environment because I love talking to people and do consider myself confident and love making speeches and presentations in front of my classes of school. The problem is in my current physics class im struggling and were at the basic level and I feel if I'm unable to do this now my work in the future will always be confusing me. I did an internship at an accounting firm in NYC and had a great time. I always thought accountants were just on there computers working mindlessly but the environment I came to find was a much more social and interactive experience filled with meetings, working with clients end etc. I did very much enjoy that field and I have no clue what to do. I'm currently in between do i continue to struggle into my senior year with more advanced physics and computer science classes or do I take the business route and do something else I enjoy? After looking at multiple college curriculum it looks like the only physics class seem to be a General Physics I and II. My current grades in physics are the low eighties and Pre-Calc is low 90's high 80's. (I've always enjoyed math btw) My mom told me I should work on wall street and sell stocks lols. I really like talking to people like If there were such a job that you get to market and be like the presenter for new technology and explain it to be people that be awesome :D"

I have to do various rotations for school. One of the managers that I worked with is basically unsanitary, unethical, and makes comments about my physical appearance that are inappropriate. I am a 24 year old female, he is probably 55.

I had a conversation with the department head and made my concerns known about his work performance. I initially did not mention the flirting thing because that is a can of worms I did not want to open, but he makes comments to others sometimes so I was basically asked about it. I said that it does happen. The department head said that he would have a conversation with the manager, and I said that I wanted to be sure he does not find out that I am the one who said anything about it. I do not need that drama in my life.

Cut to the other day, when the department head basically wanted me to help the manager I complained about with a project of his in a 1-on-1 setting. I am finished with that part of my internship, but he wanted me to help that manager with a project. I said that I would be more comfortable if I did not do that.

Today, the department head talked to me about his ""concerns"" that I am uncomfortable, and I may sometimes have to do things that are outside of my job like working with this manager. He wants to be sure that I am comfortable there. His genius idea was to have me CONFRONT the manager about my feelings. I said no, I specifically said I did not even want him to find out that I said anything, and now you want me to confront him? The department head said he cannot have a conversation with him about it that is not specific. He will want to know who is accusing him of these things. If he isn't wondering that, then the conversation is too vague and won't solve the problem. He basically said that to fire anyone, they need a record of action taken against the employee. The department head did not outright say it, but he implied that he cannot be fired for this in the future if I do not do something about it now that is specific and lets him know that I am the one who said something about it.

I said NO. He said since he knows that I am uncomfortable, he has a moral and ethical responsibility to do something about it. He is trying to see if someone in a nearby office has heard him saying things to me, so that he can approach the topic from the angle that someone overheard him making comments about my appearance. I said fine. I don't think that will lead anywhere, as the woman near us likes the manager in question and I am relatively new. 

This is where we left off. He was going to try that approach first. When that inevitably fails, I am at a loss for what to do. I absolutely do not want to confront him. That is insane. This manager does all kinds of awful things, I think they should focus on punishing him for the things that are within the scope of his job. He is completely awful at it. They are trying to get me to report him for sexual harassment when I said I do not want to. I do not want to martyr myself. This is the position that I am in early next week if his plans fails, which it will. 

My current idea for handling the situation is to say that I was mistaken, and that I rescind my comment about being uncomfortable. Being told how beautiful I am and how I look nice in those pants is much better than confronting someone about it.  I would rather the situation disappear. I did not even want to bring it up.

Does anyone have any idea what I should do? This is insane.

tl;dr: older man at work hits on me, I brought up work-related concerns to his boss and he basically asked me if he flirts with me and I said yes. I also said I do not want him to find out that I brought it up to his boss. boss wants me to confront him. no way. what do?"

I have pretty much no experience in networking and IT.  They have already given me a project and I don't know where to start.  


So our location is in San Diego and we have several other locations throughout California.  In one of the other locations, Pleasanton, there are three displays spread throughout the office.  Each display shows different things depending on the department it's in.  What they want me to do is figure out a system where we can manage the displays in Pleasanton from here in our San Diego office.  The only thing I have thought of so far is some sort of remote software, but I feel that there may be better options that I am not aware of.  They want the system to be centralized and automated.  I am sure you guys are knowledgeable in things like this, so do you guys have any advice?

Thanks!"

I would like to start a career in programming and development, but I don't know how to start from here.

2v2sag,1,2015-02-07,Maximize job search results?,DarkDubzs,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2v2sag/maximize_job_search_results/,"So I've gotten serious about beginning my career in IT. I've never had a job dealing with computers or anything with IT, but everyone has to start somewhere. I'm 18, and in college getting a BS in Business Administration with a focus in Computer Information Systems. I would prefer to take a Networking route, but for now, I'll take any job in IT just to get started. I know that a help desk job is common to start in, but that can be pretty broad I've discovered. I am up for any field in IT to start off, whether it be repairing computers, user support, junior systems admin, entry network tech, entry developing even, etc. It would have to be part time M-Sat after 4pm because that's when I get out of my classes during the week... is that a reasonable working time? Like can I work from 4 to 8 in this field? 

Anyways, I've tried many different search terms on Indeed and Craigslist. Stuff like ""help desk, junior systems, networking, network, network tech, systems admin, computer, computer support, end user support, user support, it support, it tech, etc."" with different variations of adding in entry, part, and part time. So far, I haven't found much around. They all either want years of experience, experience with stuff I don't know like programs and techniques and stuff, are full time, too far away, or don't work with my available hours. It's really frustrating to say the least. There must be something I'm missing or doing wrong. Are there any better sites to look on or search terms, or even tips to help with searching? Is there somewhere to look specifically for entry level jobs in this field? I know I should get an internship to start off just to get experience, but I really need income right now and I would rather begin my career path as well.  
Any help, tips, advice, or recommendations?"
2v35th,3,2015-02-07,"I don't know which choice to make (Career) and either choice results in radically different outcomes, in different countries.",[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2v35th/i_dont_know_which_choice_to_make_career_and/,"So, just as a little backgroud: I used to be depressed and didn't know how to live. I lived with my parents and didn't work. I got out of it by getting a job at a retailer, and getting a motorcycle. I decided I wanted to travel and took a solo trip to Europe, backpacked for 6 months. It was fantastic.  I'm 26 years old.   

Just as I was about to come home again I landed a job at an SAP consulting company as an Intern in Germany. A year of interning (It's been 6 months) and after that they will take me on as an apprentice and pay for my school (2 years), I'd also get a company car for travelling around. It's not well paid, but it's not starvation if I'm frugal. An apartment with a roommate would be half my monthly wage, but food here is cheaper.  If they take me on after my internship, I think they will, the potential is there to learn a lot and come out with a well paying job at the end. There's even the opportunity for travel as they have clients in England, Brazil, USA, and a couple others.   

Here's my problem: I'll always be a Canadian. I miss home. I miss the people, the atmosphere, I miss my family. I don't want to leave my sister as the only one to care for my parents as they get older. Germany is great for a lot of reasons, but the bureaucracy is insane and the people are a lot more closed off. Its harder to meet people, and when you throw the language difficulties in... I spend my week at work, my evenings at the gym, and my weekends struggling to maintain my sanity. The nearest large German cities are Karlsruhe and Freiburg. They're alright. 

So I've applied for the Canadian Navy. I'd get to live where my friends and family are, (West coast) and since i'm applying for a trade I'd also learn a lot in the IT field. (Communications, IT, on ships and land). The starting wage is livable and now that my expectations are more normal and I no longer think that I am a special snowflake, more than enough for me. I'd probably be happy, but housing on the west coast is a lot more expensive.

So on the one hand, I want to have adventures and see the world. The Navy would be great training and experience in a field that is growing. (IT). I'd get to not sit on my ass for 8 hours a day and actually do things. 

On the other, the career opportunity that I have here is pretty great as well. Good benefits, good vacation time, the ability to go to fantastic places just a stone throws away. (In comparison to Canada, anyway). The training and school would be hard in a second language but doable. I don't actually know if 'SAP Consultant' is good to have on a resume. 

TL;DR:  Career in Germany, or Career in Canadian Navy. Bundeswehr is not an option, the choice here is between countries, and I don't like the longer contracts and lower wage in the German military. 

Any advice at all on any of this would be so, so great.

My life has been a series of ""one step forward, two steps backward"" on one long continuous downward spiral starting from college. Codependency from high school led to being pushed into college I felt intensely alienated from (mostly Greek-heavy party school, lack of diversity) but was paralyzed with indecision on transferring or dropping out.

Intense suicidal ideation and depression/anxiety led to extreme procrastination and avoidance issues, leading to my college transcript being fucked with I's turning to F's (for fucking electives) by the time I got my degree. Random studying abroad and internships without a coherent plan for what I would do for a job after college. Met with therapists on and off-campus, knew I had issues with codependency with my family, but still ended up relapsing after time. Had irrational codependent beliefs that I needed to kill myself for my parents to realize my mental issues and to compromise on my choice of major by the time I walked for graduation, so I basically wasted my time and stunted myself emotionally by beating myself up the whole time. Still had opportunities to fix my grades but fucked it up as well.

Moved out of my parents' place and was financially independent with a call center job for a year but relapsed on financial help due to pressure from my roommates after my car broke down completely which turned into moving back in.

Had a great two-year relationship after college but I fucked that up as well. Then I felt it was the right time to head off to Taiwan to pursue English teaching after I genuinely believed I had a handle on my anxiety issues after success weaning off Prozac (instead of, y'know, examining myself for what went wrong). This in spite of doing online interning with copywriting and looking at local ad agencies to get into. Went abroad, fucked up during the training process, had a 3-day anxious breakdown in a hostel that left me with anhedonia (vs depression) that has stayed with me since.

A lot of my personal identity was based on my visual thinking and creative spirit (which I didn't make much practical use of anyways) which has been basically erased from this anhedonia I'm still suffering from. Working with a new therapist is just retreading old ground, got admitted to a psych ward for 2 weeks for the first time after suicide note/self-harm/trying to OD on pills. My memory, which wasn't great before, is awful now and everything from cigarettes to medication to feeling hungry/full are messed up from what I'm sure was brain damage from chronic anxiety. I overeat and have issues with self-grooming where I had no issue before. I can't clear my mind with meditation anymore and don't even have an ""inner critic"" anymore - just physical stress that shows itself in shaking hands, twitching temple/eye, whole body stress, etc.

So, here I am now: A codependent, senseless, hopeless, anxiety-ridden, worthless human being who is smart and self-aware enough to realize these things but lacks the emotional self-control to persistently do something about it during a critical phase in my life. I did excellently in high school, but I let codependency and passivity and self-destructiveness ruin myself to the point of robbing myself of my previous (overly-extreme) ambition and happiness and passion in exchange for emotional stuntedness and lost opportunities socially and academically. I've always had so much more empathy and care for other people than I've ever given myself.

I don't see any hope now. I've lost spirituality and faith in myself and my optimism, the latter of which I see now as a shield for avoidance and procrastination. I can barely support myself, let alone thrive with life. How can I navigate my own life as an adult if I keep fucking up on my own accord?

I know suicide is traumatic for family and random people to witness; I hate myself for being selfish and self-centered to do this to others but still feeling the need to die anyways. Regrets of personal hopes and dreams I neglected out of lack of self-confidence and passivity to pursue from high school and a past rooted in codependency, financial and emotional manipulation still haunt me now. It seems like I can only come up with the best decision for myself long after the boat sailed.

tl;dr I am trapped in this senseless, emotional-wrecking ball of a body and I need out. And it's all my fault."

I am very tech savvy (In fact I like to spend time here helping people and intern in my schools IT department)

However, I just cannot seem to fix one issue. I have a very high end desktop, running an i7 4790k at 4.9Ghz, 16gb Ram, an SSD, several HDDs, a Swiftech H220x cooler and enough fans that even under full load air coming out of the system still feels cool.

Now onto my issue:

No matter what I do 4k video on YouTube ALWAYS lags. It reports 24fps yet I can plainly see that it is dropping down to around 10 (with noticeable stutter) This also happens on my brothers build with an intel Xeon 1340V3.

I cannot for the life of me figure out whats going on. Ive tried forcing my GPU into a higher power state, Ive tried enabling HW acceleration in my browser, Ive tried everything I can ans it still has this issue. My Internet Should be able to handle the stream too (Its a wired 120mbps (15MB/s) and 25mbps upload).

Does anyone here have any ideas?"
2v5nvh,69,2015-02-07,"It's okay for now, I have a workaround!",[deleted],talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2v5nvh/its_okay_for_now_i_have_a_workaround/,"Hi, TFTS! I haven't posted in a while so I figured that I would share a story with you that took place last week. I am a Service Desk turned Desktop Support ""intern"" (I've been working here for quite a while) at a very large multi-line-of-business corporation on the west coast. This is a tale about a user and his adventures with Adobe Acrobat. 

One day, I was assigned a ticket to help a user at one of our other close-by office locations with a problem in Acrobat. The ticket didn't say very much, other than the fact that it froze because of some unstated reason and that he had to restart his computer to get back to work. Now, I know that he didn't *HAVE* to do that, he just didn't know how to kill a task using Task Manager.

So, I call him up and remote in to see what is going on. He attempts to duplicate the issue:

&gt; User: ""So now, I click ""export"" on $other_web_app and it opens this dialogue box that asks me to save or open in Acrobat. So I open it, try to print, and- there!""

Acrobat froze when he clicked the print button. Hmmm. He was opening a generated document that came from another web application, so maybe that application was the problem - or did Acrobat need a reinstallation? I had a few starting points and said that I would call him back ASAP after I killed the task for him.

What ensued was a week-long process of struggling to get ahold of him despite his voicemails that the issue was still unresolved, uninstalling and reinstalling the custom software for the web app that allowed it to generate documents, repairing and reinstalling Acrobat, to no avail.

Now, he also mentioned at one point that he had found a workaround for the issue, and it never dawned on me to ask what it was. But, I quickly found out when I physically went to his desk after trying all this time to fix it remotely.

I hadn't paid too much attention (my personal mistake) to what he believed was the correct way of going about this process of his, nor did I know exactly what this process' purpose was. It turns out, he was not printing these PDF files, but he was *printing generated PDF files - to PDF - to store them on a shared drive.* His workaround - you guessed it - was to just click ""save"" on the dialogue box, like anyone should be doing.

I also found out that he kept many, many text files and virtual sticky notes (thanks, Windows 7) saved to his desktop, as well as the entirety of his personal documents. His My Documents folder, backed up to the network, had 0 files in it. His profile on the local machine was 2.21 gigs, the largest that I had seen on anyone's machine.

I told him that the combination of his huge, huge accumulation of files as well as his back-asswards process is probably causing the problem. Of course, he refused to believe me and told me that his process requires less clicks than just saving the file. ^wut

So, I cleared his profile after having him move **everything** to his My Documents folder, and lo-and-behold, his PC is faster than ever. He continues to print PDFs to PDF, refusing to connect the dots between his process and the lack of logic behind it."
2v5sxn,1,2015-02-07,Graduated. Now what?,aguyonline,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2v5sxn/graduated_now_what/,"I graduated in May 2014 with a degree in computer science, and I am still looking for a job. I’m looking for advice and some help because I feel like I’m doing everything wrong.

It took me way more than 4 years to finish my degree. In my opinion, I think I’m pretty close to the bottom of the barrel for a coder. I didn’t do exceedingly well in my computer science classes. There’s several I had to retake because I failed the first go around (or even the second go around for some classes). Some of it was because of depression, but I don’t really like blaming that, and it really doesn’t make sense to. Because of my low skills and talent, I’ve had only one internship, and that was from 5 years ago. I likely only got it because of a friend that was already working there. I really have nothing on my resume related to programming besides that one internship and my degree.

When I was a bright-eyed freshman, I always wanted to be part of a startup, start a startup, end up at those behemoths like Google, Amazon, Apple, or Microsoft, or go into game development. Those dreams are pretty much all but dead. For a while, I thought I could work somewhere and then move on to my dreams, but I haven’t even gotten to the first step of getting a job.

I am also unfortunately picky about jobs. I live in the DC beltway, so everything around here is some lame government or government contractor job. I shouldn’t say lame. I’ve applied to some. But my issue is, a lot of these employers don’t actually tell you what they’re working on and only say they’ll provide you a clearance if necessary. I can get excited about working on something cool like a satellite for NASA, but I am not thrilled about something like crunching numbers for the Census Bureau, for example. I’ve talked to some of these companies, and they’re either mum about their future projects or talk about projects I’m not interested in. So, because of that, I’ve been dodging government jobs and this area in general. I am looking for private sector work, so many jobs I apply for are out of state. I apply, but I’m getting no leads. Now, this could be just par for the course, if location is pretty important, but I’m not sure.

The one thing I might have going for me is that I did well on group projects in my computer science classes. I usually took the leadership role and did everything but code for these projects and aced them every time. I guess ideally it would be nice to be a project manager, but I think those kinds of jobs are reserved for more seasoned employees.

So what am I doing wrong? Or am I just a bad programmer and getting what I deserve? I may sound brash and naive, so you can hit me as hard as you want with reality. The patient will take his medicine. With my skills or lack thereof, is there a kind of job I should be applying for? I’ve been applying for testing and QA positions lately, and even had an interview that went well for one. But is there anything else I should be looking at?"

&lt;BOOTING PILOT CONSCIOUSNESS&gt;
	
&lt;CPT MORGAN ONLINE&gt;



	
Morgan awoke with a rush of information being input and processed in the massive body that she was currently inhabiting. Visual, EM, touch, sound, internal diagnostics all screaming inside her mind, the Chicxulub trying to make sense of what was going on and provide its Pilot with the information needed to fight effectively. 
	
After quickly reviewing the less than satisfactory status of her body, she turned her sense outward. There were a lot of small aliens near her feet, doing god knows what. She noticed in the logs that there had been enough power sent through the primitive wiring they had so generously shoved into the gaping hole in her side.
	
*So they were trying to activate me? Now that's a good idea...* she thought to herself. With barely a thought, she drew on the power that had been stored in the battery system to feed energy to SH-GEN3.
	
As the field of quantum wrongness spread across her, cutting the supports that had been holding her up previously, she snarled in pain. The electrical system was damaged worse than the reports had indicated. 
	
As she refocused on the lifeforms beneath her, her entire sensor suite did its best to tell her everything there was to know about them. They were all uncatalogued, expected of life that had come about far after she had gone into stasis, as well as being in another galaxy entirely.
	
Most importantly, however, there was no sign of the FILTH she had been sent here to eradicate. It seemed that they were successful in their mission.
	
She kneeled down to get closer to the lifeforms that were pointing their primitive energy weapons at her. Did they really think they would have an affect on her?
	
“What are you, and why have you experimented on me?” She declared.

- - - - -

	
While everyone around him seemed to have emotions ranging from pants-shittingly terrified to nervous, Xi was happy. Things had gone even better than expected, apparently the pilot had survived after all.
	
“We thought you were dead. There were no life signs. By the way, impressive of you to raid our computer system so quickly, given that you're speaking Common.” Xi spoke, his augmentations turning the clicking of his mandibles into the language that he was biologically incapable of speaking. 
	
The Thing regarded them for a moment, all six eyes, forward facing, scanning over them, before it straightened its back and stood. One of its massive arms reached around to the back of its skull, and seemed to grasp something. Even from the distance they were at they could hear something internal moving around inside the Thing, parts repositioning and changing to accommodate some form of movement.
	
It brought its hand back around, and they all could see that it held something in its palm. As It kneeled and lower the hand close to the ground, all present realized that it the pilot of the Thing. The same long limbed body structure, four limbs, bipedal, and wearing aesthetically similar armor. Xi noted that they couldn't see the beings face, or determine its gender, given that it was wearing a complete mask and helmet.
	
Anyi and his security teams were nervously keeping a constant bead on the pilot, while most of the scientists, the ones who weren't handpicked by Xi anyways, were simultaneously panicking and recording everything. The ones he had handpicked were just recording and wondering if they could run faster than their interns.
	
The Pilot hopped from the palm of the Thing's hand, to the tops of its finger, and then jumped down to the ground. The closed-face helmet, the same white as the armor of the Thing, but lacking the burn marks and battle damage, split into several pieces and floating via impossible precise gravity manipulations into the neck of the Pilot. It, unlike the Thing, had only two eyes, but had a similar facial structure. Distinctly different from its chariot, the Pilot had long, almost gold colored, strands of fur on its head, tied into a knot that flowed down its spinal region. It eyed the security team with some suspicion, the sides of its mouth pulling up in a smirk that revealed long, sharp, teeth as it watched one of the newer members who was loosing his cool at what was going on. It lazily turned to regard Xi.
	
“You are forgiven. But you should be aware that there are likely others who will not be as friendly when they are awoken,” Voiced the Pilot, with an alien accent, different to any Xi had heard before. *I wonder,* thought Xi *if it uploaded the language to its mind? It doesn't to be a translator doing that. Impressive, if that is the case.*

“Oh god oh god oh god we're going to die,” muttered Hem, trying to drag as much air as he could into his lungs with gulping breaths.
	
“Shutup, we'll be fine. We're gonna make bank off this recording!” responded Vin happily with his eye pressed to screen to make sure he was getting all that he could of what was going on.
	
“What is wrong with you! What part of *ancient super-robot* being activated not [200 feet] away aren't you getting?! Havent you ever seen *Glorfax the Destroyer*?
	
“That's a movie. Just because you were high out of your mind doesn't make that real, dumbass. That can't happen in real life.”
	
“No but the giant robot and the weird alien pilot makes it real! It's happening! I know how this is gonna end! Who's crazy now, huh, Sylus?!
	
“Don't bring her into this...” mutter Vin “But you do have a point. There's not much happening now, but we should probably get out of here before someone notices us. Namely Anyi.”
	
“Oh god, why did I follow you, I don't want to get killed by Anyi.”
	
“So he's scarier than the robot now, Hem?”
	
“He's always scarier”

They stood overlooking the sea of sapients, moving in currents, all of them focused on their own thoughts and priorities. If they had looked up, they would have thought the two figures on the catwalk above were simply two vagrants, mercenaries, or other such sorts and ignored them completely. They would be wrong. Only one of them was.
	
The other was just as morally corrupt, but held a much higher position, at least in the eyes of the general populace. He stood straight, the stance of one who was used to high society, but dressed in the garb of one who would never dream, nor want, to step foot in a place like where he was from. 
	
“So,” drawled out the first of them, leaning with his forearms on the railing, tapping the metal catwalk's floor with his boot. “they've activated one. Got the pilot out too, apparently”
	
“Aye, they've turned it on. Most complete one yet,” crisply responded the Second.
	
“I assume you want me to test the waters a bit, see what it's capable of?”
	
“Yes, I can't have a direct trace. You can. The Committee would very much appreciate all the data we can get. You'll be getting the first half of your payment now”
	
The First's implants activated, telling him the payment had arrived, being routed through god knows how many false bank accounts, before being sent through his false accounts. He grinned happily, withdrawing a Cliv stick and lighting it. He took a drag, let it out, and turned to the Second.
	
“Consider it done, old man,” said the First cheekily. Though the effect was mostly lost, considering that the Second was gone without a trace. The First chuckled drily, getting up and stretching, and then walking off, whistling as he went. He had work to do.

2v62yr,5,2015-02-08,Upass hassle,[deleted],rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/2v62yr/upass_hassle/,"My upasss has been restricted. I am told that I will not be able to pick up my upass during the start of the semester for every semester until 2015.

In spring 2014, I started my internship (which means I am a full time student), so I got my upass.

In order to get a upass one has to opt in for it at the registration office.

I did phone registration office to opt in for the upass. At the same time I was registered into two spring courses as well. I was told by the registration office person that I do not need to opt in as I was already showing up as a full time student. But I told that person that I plan to drop one of the course and that is why I want to opt in. She told me that she will opt me in for the upass then.

On the same day, one of my friend was in university to pick up his upass, so I phoned him to ask him to pay for my upass and get one for me as well.
So my friend paid for my upass at the upass office and got a upass for me.

I dropped one the two courses that I was registered into on the same day.

I think the person who I talked to over the phone at registration office forgot to opt me in for the upass. I think that is the reason why upass office has put a restriction on my upass. In their mind, I tried to scam them by getting upass as a full time student and then dropping the course.
Since I am on internship, I am considered a full time student regardless of the number of courses I am enrolled into. So I never tried to scam anyone.

Back in 2012, my first ever spring semester in university, I was enrolled in two courses for each semester, and then I got my upass and then ended up dropping one course from each semester. That was an honest mistake, I did not know at that time. But I did pay for whatever fee I was charged for getting a upass as a part time student. That was all cleared up. There was no restriction placed on my upass for any semester since I paid the required fee for upass.

I think upass office thinks that I tried to scam them this time when all along I was a full time student. Since I (mistakenly) did it before, upass office thinks I deliberately tried to do it again.

Please go through all the records, the day and the time I phoned in at registration office and the time my friend paid for the upass (there must be a transaction record at the upass office and time of my call at registration office).

I just want the restriction to be taken off from my upass, so I can pick up upass on regular time from now on.

My question is, why am I being penalized for this? I did not do anything wrong, nor did I intend to. Every time I go to upass office they do not want to even talk about the issue. Their arrogance on this matter is unbearable.

Registration office says that I was never charged for upass on fees in spring and summer. If my friend paid for my upass at the upass office, do you get charged for upass in the tuition fee again?

There could be two reasons for this restriction:

1) Fee not being charged for upass in spring and summer school fee

- since my friend paid for the upass at the upass office, I was not charged again for the upass in the tuition fees. Transaction record at the upass office should clarify this. I think my friend paid with his debit card, I can ask him to produce his bank statement as well.

2) Upass office thinks I tried to scam them

-I never tried to scam the upass office as I was a full time all along regardless of the number of courses I was enrolled in, because I was on internship. On top of that, I called in at the registration office the same day (before asking my friend to pick up the upass) to opt in for the upass. I think mistake happened at the registration office as the person saw that I was enrolled in two courses, so she forgot to opt me in, even though I told her that I was dropping one of the course.

I am currently a 2nd year undergraduate student in college. I want to become a software engineer ultimately, but I am just looking for an internship for now. However, I am unlcear about what exact skills I should actually learn. 

I've learned up to classes and objects in c++ and am taking a data structures now. I've taught myself up Java up to classes and objects as well because Java is demanding.  Now I'm quickly learning the python syntax since most jobs want  knowledge of a scripting language. But I'm not sure where to go next. I've thought about contributing on open source projects on gitHub, but I am unfamiliar with all technologies i see there.

The projects/assignments I do in college seem really simple (Such as payroll programs). But when I read forums in the internet, people talk about terms I never hear of in college.

Should I go for SQL database programming? Or learn GUI? It'd be great if you guys could guide me on what kind of skills I should target for now. 

Thanks"

CS and Finance major here - I formerly have been involved with an unsuccessful tech startup, then did quant finance internship, followed by one in i-banking at a well-known firm.

I realized finance was not a path I wished to pursue and discovered the career path of a PM, which highly appealed to me due to how it combined my passions for business and tech.

I still have two years till graduation, which would mean the summer after this one is the one that matters, and I'd be shooting for the premiere PM internships that I struck out on this year (Google, Twitter, Microsoft, etc.)

Which would set me best up for that considering my background, and the role/type of company the choices are from?

* Product Management Intern for an unknown tech startup
* Product Manager Intern for a well-known tech company, but has been a sinking ship since its heydays pre-2008
* Business Analyst for one of the popular major tech companies

I know that at least in finance, we're told to take the internship that has the same title as what you wish to do.  However, I read that in tech, a lot of PMs come from being a business analyst.  With that in mind, I'm just unsure how much the company name and reputation has to do with recruiting in CS.  Would love if I could get some advice.

Thanks!"

Before i started studying i never wrote a single line of code. 


I just was interested in it and wanted to lern it. So now, i have a solid knowledge of java i would say. Know a little bit of C++. Know a little bit of Swift.


If i'm finished, i don't know if i wann go into pure coding. I'm rather interested into something like HCI/Usability. 



Coming back to my question:


I just feel like i know a few things about programming, but don't know if that's enough when i start an internship or job.


Did you have the same fears? How did it turn out? I just don't know where i'm standing ability-wise."

This particular debate has been ongoing with myself for weeks and is really tearing me apart - I am unsure what to do!

Some background first:

I'm a student studying Software Engineering at a college in Toronto, Ontario. It is a two-year program and I am currently in my last term. Right now, I am looking at going to a different University in order to complete my undergrad in Computer Science. I am 21. For me, it is important to try to finish in a timely manner - in 2018.

I have two clear choices - York University (Lassonde School of Engineering) or University of Toronto. Before you scream and shout UofT, hold up!

I will not be awarded transfer credit in terms of Computer Science courses which I am completely cool with. I will be behind a little bit but again, it is not too much of an issue. However, there are opportunities that exist at both universities and ultimately they revolve around when I would graduate. Again, it is imperative that I try to graduate in April 2018. I would prefer not to graduate in the summer (or fall) as then job positions would already be filled by new grads. Let us assume 2019 is not an option, for many reasons I do not wish to discuss.

 York University
* Brand new Engineering school known as Lassonde School of Engineering. Lots of funding and investment. Faculty looks solid.
* Co-op program available.
* Computer Science curriculum looks theoretical, rigorous and thorough.
* While CS has been at York since forever, Lassonde is still fairly new and does not have the reputation (nor alumni) in the tech industry yet.
* Ability to start this Summer, which will allow me to catch up faster and not be dragged behind by first year courses (since I can take Calculus 1/2, Computer Science 1/2 in the Summer).
* Ability to specialize in AI, Computer Networks, etc.
* Graduate in April 2018

University of Toronto
* Solid faculty and reputation.
* Top-notch Computer Science program. Rigorous, theoretical and thorough. One of the best in the world, as you may know.
* Alumni in top tech companies.
* I will only be able to do one internship since I will be busy taking courses in the summer in effort to catch up.
* I have to start in the Fall term.
* Can still graduate in April 2018 provided I complete a generous number of credits during the summer terms, with one summer to be used as an internship. (Remember, I do not want to be delayed a semester. If I am, I may as well be delayed the year, but this is not an option).


I am confident about both schools and my ability to do well. But ultimately, work experience for me is equally important. If I go to York, I feel I will be able to spend my summers working, whilst if I go to University of Toronto, I will spend a lot more time on my academics.

Not to mention the fact a lot of great companies/organizations love to hire from UofT. It is almost a dream for me to work for those companies. I am convinced that I may be able to land those jobs just as well with York as my choice, but I feel UofT would certainly give me a one-up.

I realize most people may suggest to ""do"" the extra year but the cold, hard truth for myself is that I need to get going. I am not getting any younger and I am certainly not rich enough to continue to afford paying for school!

Would love to hear any advice, thoughts, opinions. Please. :(

Thanks.

I graduated back in 2012. Since then I've worked at 2 web development companies doing PM/QA, and taught ESL abroad for 1 year. I've decided to go back to school to get a BS in CS, and my schedule is shaping up to look something like this...

**Summer 2015:**

* Engineering Calc 1
* Engineering Calc 2
* Intro to CompSci 1

**Fall 2015:**

* Intro to CompSci 2
* Discrete Structures
* Digital Systems
* One calc-based probability or stats course (either probability theory or intro to probability. MTH411 and STA301, respectively.)

**Spring 2016:**

* Data Structures (CSE250)
* Real-Time &amp; Embedded Operating Systems (one of the few classes higher than CSE250 that doesn't list CSE250 as a pre-req)
* Computer Organization (one of the few classes higher than CSE250 that doesn't list CSE250 as a pre-req)

**Remaining, can be taken over Summer2016/Fall2016/Spring2017 with CSE250 satisfied:**

* Intro to Programming Languages
* Intro to Algorithm Analysis &amp; Design
* Intro to the Theory of Computation
* Intro to Operating Systems
* Software Engineering
* One A.I. related CS course
* One 400-level CSE course from any area

By the looks of it, I should be able to finish the entire curriculum within 2 years, 2.5 if I want to take more classes. The classes listed above are all that's necessary to fulfill the degree requirements.

I really want to try and land an internship at a big 4 company during 1 or 2 of my summers (my ""pie in the sky"" goal is Google, but I'm also interested in applying to other options). Regarding this, I have **a few questions...**

1. During my first summer, would I most likely not be qualified/prepared to apply for an internship given the classes I will have taken? I know internships generally work around the definition of whether someone is a freshman, sophomore, junior, etc. Since the standard definition won't apply to my scenario, where would I roughly stand at the beginning of summer 2016? Would I be potentially eligible to apply to an internship?

2. If question 1 is a no-go, then the next internship opportunity would be summer 2017, no? At this point, I would basically be close to graduation. Would this mean that I would not be eligible for an internship opportunity during that summer, or would it hurt my chances? Interested to know how this works.

Any other feedback/opinions would be greatly appreciated. Extremely excited to start!"

(Python, looking for internship)",[deleted],learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2v8o09/recruiters_and_programmers_looking_for_advice_on/,"About a year ago I dropped out of college and I've been spending the current semester taking programming related courses at a local cc. 

&amp;nbsp;


Originally premed, I realized that healthcare was not for me. Programming has since become the home I've been looking for. I have basic syntax knowledge in Python, C++, and Javascript (taking a C++ course at my cc, and Python and Javascript through codecademy)

 *  By the end of the week I plan to create a site to be used as a personal portfolio. Though it will be mostly empty since I have no projects.

 * Then I want to create a chrome extension that synchronizes your dropbox with drive

 * From there I want to create a computer application that acts similar to the extension but interacts in the background and offline. Something that can take an article offline and upload it to a blog as soon as an internet

 * Afterwards there are other project ideas I have wanted to work on:
    1. Machine learning software with ScyPy
    2. C++ text adventure
    3. Integrating more frontend development to my personal portfolio
    4. a reddit bot

&amp;nbsp;

My goal is to finish the extension by June so that I can apply to the dropbox internship. In all honesty though I have no idea what really goes into building the extension. I do plan to find resources on making an actual chrome extension, but I don't know how to make it interact with drive or dropbox. My hope is that once finished with the extension I can more smoothly move on to the computer program.   


&amp;nbsp;

**Concerns**

  Am I skipping steps before working on this project? Since diving into programming I have never had so much passion and drive to really devote time to my work so I am hoping this can help overcome my lack of knowledge or experience. 
I want dropbox to see that even though I'm a dropout (no pun intended), I have the work ethic of Rock Lee and deserve a chance just as much as the next guy. But even more so **I want to prove to myself** that I'm in it for the long run. I want to see myself working my hardest to accomplish a goal I made for myself. So even if I don't finish it in time, I'd be happy with any finished product.

&amp;nbsp;


**What do you think? What topics or guides should I look into so that I can create my program. Is my first goal too high, should I do something small just so I can add it to my portfolio?**


Thank you, for any advice you can give :)"

I'm not *trying* to knock down the cost, just wondering if there's dead space in the build.  Although saving a few bucks would mean I can splurge on monitors etc, but I also would also like to not have to worry about being outdated for a decent while.

As the title states, I am trying to get a summer internship with a research company. The internship itself is 12 weeks in which there will be multiple projects to work on related to the Mechanical Engineering field.

They are looking for students who are team players, can do problem-solving, and have interest in technology. More specifically, they are looking for students who can help design and analyze mechanical systems as well as conduct studies and test new/modified designs.

Now a little about myself: 

I am currently a sophomore enrolled in a Mechanical Engineering program at a state university. I've held a few jobs before(Math tutor and After school leader), but I have not had a chance to work as an intern in my career field yet. 
I have taken a few university classes that are relevant to the field(such as programming and product design/modeling).

I've been working part-time and going to school at the same time in order to pay for expenses(rent, car insurance, food, etc). I should mention that working part-time ~18 hours a week last semester had a slightly negative influence on my GPA. It was 3.3, but dropped quite a bit last semester due to my work schedule. 

As for my resume, I'm looking for any constructive criticism this reddit can provide.

I've never had my resume reviewed before; I've mostly revised it myself with some tips from internet articles. However, this is the first opportunity I've had to enter my desired field, so I want to improve my chances of success as much as possible.

Any kind of help would be appreciated! 

Thank you to anyone and everyone who takes their time to read this.

2v9fny,18,2015-02-08,Lost my confidence as a programmer for not landing a job after interning at a company three times,throwaway6y9,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2v9fny/lost_my_confidence_as_a_programmer_for_not/,"...and I need help gaining my confidence back! 
Long story short(or at least, I'll try to make it short.) I recently graduated with a BS in CS from a city school in nyc. I landed a pretty good internship at a prominent financial bank as an application developer during my sophomore year of college(back then I was getting my AS in CS in a community college because it's half the tuition price) and had been interning with this firm for two years (a total of 3 internships.) Last Summer was my last internship there and seeing how I got called back three times to the company I was confident I'd be offered a full-time offer there... NOPE! They didn't even call me to give me a ""no"" for an answer and still left me on the limbo after I called the recruiters.

I know this is probably very normal in today's competitive industry but this stripped me from my confidence as a programmer. I'm even afraid of looking at code now because I'm always doubting myself. Every time I open my IDE to work on my personal projects my chest becomes heavy as I keep remembering not getting into that firm. My friend suggested we worked on a project together and he's done so much to help me and try to motivate me to keep working and practicing my programming but it has gotten to the point that I sometimes avoid him so that I don't have to talk about the project. 

I used to love programming, went to hackathons, worked on personal projects, worked on a website, and was so eager to learn to use all the new technologies out there... but now it is hard for me to even open IntelliJ. I do still love programming, I love the feeling you get from a completed project, the clean code practices, getting the users feedback, etc... I take pride on having production code running in that firm, working successfully with users(known to be hard to work with!), and being able to build a huge network of people from Ivy League schools and managers there but this bad experience is like a wall in front that's stopping me from getting ready to apply for a job at other places.

This is probably a very petty issue but I'm turning to reddit for help as my last resort :( I don't want to give up/screw up the career that I worked so hard for. Any advice on how to get over my depressing self and focus on my career from now on?

EDIT: I would like to thank everyone's time and thoughts on my issue and for sharing your personal stories with me! I know I should man up and face this head on, and that it's not that big of a deal... this really helps me getting over this and be able to turn on a new leaf :) I will call my direct manager and ask her for any suggestions she has and if I can use her as a good reference for the future.

I applied for a certain engineering firm about two weeks ago for an 8-12 week internship in a desalination plant in Dubai. I got a call today from a representative from that company and here were the questions I was asked and my answers from what I remember:

1) What would you like your training to be focused on? 
Answer: I'm a chemical engineering major so I would like my training to be engineering related. I want to be involved in the ''inner workings of the process'' (no idea why I said this :S)

2) Would you be interested in working in Europe and South America? 
Answer: Yes, I'd be interested in working anywhere (I thought I should have told him that I have a Lebanese passport so getting a working visa in some countries might not be easy.)

3) Would you be interested in a longer six month internship? 
Answer: No, it needs to be in the summer. (Should have reminded him that I am an undergrad and my department requires me to do my internship in the summer).

Basically, I am tempted to email or call them back to try to inform them of the things I said between parenthesis but my friends have discouraged from doing that.

The person calling me had an Australian accent and the call kinda took me by surprise since I didn't expect them to call after 2 weeks. How did I do overall?"

&amp;nbsp;


Originally premed, I realized that healthcare was not for me. Programming has since become the home I've been looking for. I have basic syntax knowledge in Python, C++, and Javascript (taking a C++ course at my cc, and Python and Javascript through codecademy)

 *  By the end of the week I plan to create a site to be used as a personal portfolio. Though it will be mostly empty since I have no projects.

 * Then I want to create a chrome extension that synchronizes your dropbox with drive

 * From there I want to create a computer application that acts similar to the extension but interacts in the background and offline. Something that can take an article offline and upload it to a blog as soon as an internet

 * Afterwards there are other project ideas I have wanted to work on:
    1. Machine learning software with ScyPy
    2. Java RPG
    3. Integrating more frontend development to my personal portfolio
    4. Search Engine
    5. Physics Engine

&amp;nbsp;

My goal is to finish the extension by June so that I can apply to the dropbox internship. In all honesty though I have no idea what really goes into building the extension. I do plan to find resources on making an actual chrome extension, but I don't know how to make it interact with drive or dropbox. My hope is that once finished with the extension I can more smoothly move on to the computer program.   


&amp;nbsp;

**Concerns**

  Am I skipping steps before working on this project? Since diving into programming I have never had so much passion and drive to really devote time to my work so I am hoping this can help overcome my lack of knowledge or experience. 
I want dropbox to see that even though I'm a dropout (no pun intended), I have the work ethic of Rock Lee and deserve a chance just as much as the next guy. But even more so **I want to prove to myself** that I'm in it for the long run. I want to see myself working my hardest to accomplish a goal I made for myself. So even if I don't finish it in time, I'd be happy with any finished product.

&amp;nbsp;


**What do you think? What topics or guides should I look into so that I can create my program. Is my first goal too high, should I do something small just so I can add it to my portfolio?**


Thank you, for any advice you can give :)

I went through http://codingforinterviews.com/internships and found many companies but a lot of them are in US and after having browsed through internship listings they are mostly in US. As far as I know, one needs sponsorship for visa or already have a right to work in US in order to even apply and be considered.

I am from Europe, UK to be exact, and there must be people who are not from US and hence may know companies that are looking for interns in Europe or even sponsor visas for international students. I will continue looking but just posted here so that someone might point me to some companies they found in Europe."

Has anyone been in this position? Any advice for how to position myself, how to approach companies, and what to put on or leave out of a resume?

2vb3kw,8,2015-02-09,Questions regarding the ethicality of interviewing at Amazon after accepting an offer for a summer internship,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2vb3kw/questions_regarding_the_ethicality_of/,"I have already accepted an offer to intern at a medium sized tech company as a Software Engineer this summer. I will be working on a really cool project in my opinion and I've only heard good things about the company, so I am very excited for my internship, or I was until I received an email from Amazon offering for me to begin the interview process with them. I've never had the chance to interview for the big 5 before, so I don't want to pass up the chance. I will be completing my coding assessment today, assuming I make the decision to go for Amazon. I have heard bad things about working at Amazon, but I would enjoy living in Seattle over summer, and the experience would I believe help me find jobs at other big companies in the future. 

Now, to the main questions. Is it unethical for me to interview for Amazon as a summer intern after I have already accepted an offer for this summer? Would interning at Amazon look better to potential employers than a regular internship at a medium sized company that most people have never heard of? What would you do if you were in my position?"
2vbbra,11,2015-02-09,"Graduated last spring, still job hunting.",here4pr0n,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2vbbra/graduated_last_spring_still_job_hunting/,"So I need some advice...

I graduated last May and am still looking to start my career. It took me 6 years to graduate, so I feel a little tepid. Not a very good GPA. I also had trouble securing internships. I had one in fact a couple of years ago. I live in an area where all I'm finding are web development jobs and nothing that requires Java or C, my main languages from school. Never did web development in school. Started doing Codecademy to rectify that (very easy stuff, but I really feel like I'm learning!). I started a little late applying to schools, so I've applied to around 40 jobs at this point and had 5 interviews. Zero offers.

So these are my questions:

1. Is this normal? More than half a year and about 40 applications later I get a 10% response rate? And no job on top of that.
2. What could I put in my portfolio? I don't want to put in my school projects, since our academic honor policy was pretty hardcore. And my side projects are kind of silly things in Java Swing. Are there any other code hosting sites like GitHub I could use? Assuming Codecademy works out well, I think I'll build a website.
3. Is it harder to get jobs that require relocation? Most of the places I applied to aren't even acknowledging my existence, so I'm wondering if I just suck or if it's because of distance.
4. Since I am now seriously considering web development, is there anything else I could do besides Codecademy to improve in that area? I think it makes sense to build a website to demonstrate what I learned, but is there anything more I could do? Codecademy also feels kind of simple in ways. That or it's because of my CS background that I felt good about it.
5. Related to web development... Back end vs front end? I get front end is user facing and back end is the processing in the background. Codecademy seems to be front end focused on the most part. I think my Java and C skills would translate well into back end. What should I do improve or specialize in that?
6. Speaking of specialization, how do I answer that question in interviews? I don't feel like I specialized in anything. I am just a Java and C coder (and hopefully soon a competent HTML/CSS/JavaScript one too). I mean, I'm interested in things like mobile development, messing around with a Kinect, security, etc. A lot of things in computer science sound great! But, I haven't learned any of it, so I'm not sure interest alone can carry me. For example, after Codecademy and if I have the time, I think I'd try out some Android or iOS development. But I think it would take at least creating my first app before I claim I can specialize in it. Is that making sense?
7. Project management or producer roles. Are those feasible as an entry level and what would I need to show? On my resume, I put down to semester-long projects I did for classes which I chose to be the leader. If there's one thing I liked more than coding for CS classes, it was managing projects. I just felt like I had a knack for it. I wasn't the strongest coder, but I could sure manage others and talk to customers.

Bonus: What's it take to get Google to not reject your application the moment you send it? I mean this to be funny but also kind of curious. I applied to one of their general software engineer postings and a university graduate posting. For each of them, about 30 minutes after my submission, I get a rejection! If I had to guess, I'd say it's my lack of having a portfolio or GitHub that they can see. I'm not really aiming for Google. It was a more ""why the hell not"" kind of application. :D

I also feel out of place as a programmer. Maybe its the stigma of graduating late or just negative vibes and thoughts that are eating at me. For example, I come in here and almost all of the upvoted threads are about people that are ace students getting an internship in their freshman year or getting into Google or Microsoft as their first job. I know my place. I'm no where near any of that caliber. But, it also kind of eats at my self-esteem. Do lower tier people like me exist? It just feels like everybody here is securing their job before graduating or mere weeks afterwards. Everybody seems to be achieving and overachieving, and it just feels lonely at the bottom. :/

EDIT: Keep seeing typos I'm fixing. Don't mind me."
2vbflq,4,2015-02-09,Don't Know What to Do ...,[deleted],rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/2vbflq/dont_know_what_to_do/,"I'm 23, graduated last June and have been unemployed since. 

I got a 2:1 degree in international relations and politics from a sub par university. I have very little job experience, and no obvious specialties. Yeah sure, I can use word, Excel and PowerPoint. But who the fuck can't nowadays? 

I hated my degree - I hated the subject, I hated the lectures and I hated spending hours on a computer. My final year is a blur of waking up with tears in my eyes at 5AM, biking up to university and spending the rest of the day switching between Facebook, some clickbait bullshit and horribly written academic nonsense. I hated everything about it and got severely depressed. The only thing I looked forward to was that spliff at the end of the day, and guitar. I channeled all of my passions into my guitar, but I still suck. 

I never found a girlfriend. At first I was meeting new girls on a daily basis, but for some reason nothing worked out. Then I started retreating - I found everything so hard. I'd smoke weed almost daily just to make myself feel OK. 

University started with a bang - I was young, confident and ready to take on the world! By the end I was a mess; severely depressed, constantly regretting my past and shut away from my friends, smoking a spliff and wanking in the dark.

""Do what you love,"" they said, ""and you'll find a career that's right for you"". They were wrong. I desperately applied for internships to get some experience, but they all rejected me.  

Luckily my Mum knew a guy that worked in Brussels. Awesome. So I went off there to get some work experience with a company. I hated it. *If this is the reality of working in politics then I'm not going to work in politics*, I thought. Ten hours a day on a computer writing bullshit reports that help companies push more laws through the EU that benefit them and hurt every body else? FUCK THAT. 

So I decided to be a gardener. Why not? I've got a bit of experience, I love working outside and I enjoy learning new practical skills (for some reason I'd rather be able to lay turf than  create a complicated spreadsheet).

Well, the reality is nothing like I'd imagined. Winter, fuck. I'd done two weeks in September and it was pretty cold then. But God damn I wasn't prepared for how cold it would be in December, January and February. So I stopped. I couldn't do it - I was getting paid pittance, waking up and getting to the car was nearly impossible and the stifling social environment at the company was killing me. 

So fuck, I hate gardening too? Jesus. I hate gardening, pub work, factory work, research work, admin and construction. 

WHAT ELSE IS THERE?!

I've just been browsing the web, searching for jobs I think I could do (HINT: there aren't many). I apply for at least one a day, and probably hear back from about one a month. I've failed at every interview I've had, I don't even want that fucking job anyway.

I know I've got severe depression, but the doctor just passed me on to some bull shit CBT clinic. I can't roll with that mumbo jumbo.  So what now? Keep smoking weed to a self-destructive level, keep living with my parents, slowly lose more of my friends, slip further and further from the dream of meeting a girl?!

I feel so trapped, so humiliated, so weak. But what else can I do? I work a few weeks and then I get crippling depression. Wearing a suit makes me feel dirty and forcing myself outside in the cold is just impossible. 

But you know what? I still spend all my time on a computer. I still read political articles and have fantasies of working for a research company. I don't know why - I've tried it, I hate it and I can't face my life revolving around it. 

So, fuck .. Fuck reddit, what do I do .."

[I'd love to know how you wrapped your head around working with larger scale budgets. Did you go straight into a role where you were throwing around millions, or did you work your way up to it? What was your background? What was the trajectory that got you to these moments? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2v9du5/iama_former_brand_manager_that_purchased_a_web/cofqcav?context=5)|Love this question. I remember the first time I paid an invoice that was $13 million dollars... my mind was blown. Later on, I didn't even register the amounts and just wanted to get it done (when paying invoices).
 |I guess for me it came down to quickly understanding the context. I worked on the whole P&amp;L (profit and loss statement) so I knew exactly how much money was coming in revenue and how much was being spent on every single thing (cost of goods, delivery to market, wages, etc.). When I knew the entire budget, that gave it a good amount of context. Knowing the total marketing budget... basically how much we had to play around with, was super helpful for providing a context as well.
 |There were a few other helpful things. One was there were strict rules for amounts on who could give the final approval. For spends up to a certain amount I didn't need to even tell anyone, for spends to a larger amount my manager had to sign off, even larger his manager, etc. There are some amounts so large only the PepsiCo CEO can sign off on them.
 |Probably the one other helpful thing was knowing what amounts they actually cared about. Just because I couldn't sign off on a certain amount didn't mean they actually cared about it. I quickly learned when bringing up a spend to them whether or not they were paying attention and caring, and if so how much they cared, and that was pretty helpful.
 |In my first role I was working with budgets of just a couple million, then I worked with one of about $5 million, and then I actually took over the budgeting planning and process for all of Quaker marketing for a single year, which had a budget more than 50 times the previous amounts. So I guess I did work up to it, although I don't know that that was necessary... it was likely just more coincidental.
 |I was a Government major w/ honors at Dartmouth and had interned in Homeland Security for a US Congressman. I had also won a major national award, a national competition, and had some very unique leadership/public speaking experience. At that point I was selected as the first PepsiCo undergraduate intern in brand management. I was then offered a full-time position, accepted it, and worked my way up while there.
[Did you save up to purchase the url or with a loan?  How do negotiations work for purchasing a url for a million dollars?  Do you hand over a check and they hand over a piece of paper with the password on it?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2v9du5/iama_former_brand_manager_that_purchased_a_web/cofnvlq?context=5)|Well it was a corporate purchase. I believe we decided to purchase it during our budgeting process anyway (although I'm not certain about that, don't really remember), so the money was just built into the budget from the get go if I'm correct.
 |There are professional companies that just do this. So I asked our digital buyer (an agency that we employed) if they knew any of them, and they had one that another client had worked with before and recommended.
 |I reached out to them and hired them. They provided an estimate for what we'd acquire the URL for, and they also recommended an initial bid. One of their selling points is that they help keep the buyer anonymous, although they also told me I'd made my first mistake by going to the URL from the workplace... the site could track my IP, see that people from Quaker's offices were going to it, and possibly jack up the price knowing who the purchaser is.
 |So the negotiation was pretty simple. We made an initial offer, they countered, etc. I would hear from the company I hired once every couple days with the latest offer. We acquired it in about two weeks over maybe 4 or 5 rounds of offers, with each side conceding on the price a bit each round. (Although we didn't just 'meet in the middle', $1M was their lowest price, and they were sticking to it.) We would include reasons why we felt the website wasn't as valuable as they were pricing it at during each offer, and they'd include reasons why it was super valuable with each of their counters.
 |The transfer was pretty simple I believe, although I wasn't actually involved in that, I just told IT and our web agency to handle it. I assume we had our own domain host and just had them transfer the URL to our account there.
 |**TL;DR:** You go back and forth on offers until you match, giving reasons for the URL's value each time. Web guys take care of the transfer details.
[What's it like to create brands that are attributed to endorsing unhealthy food/beverages? Do you have guilt or does the salary justify...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2v9du5/iama_former_brand_manager_that_purchased_a_web/cofvwjr?context=5)|Well I worked on the whole gamut of things.
 |Oats are among the healthiest grains, while whole-grain oatmeal in particular has some additional health benefits v. what many people are consuming as well. Health and wellness was important to people there.
 |Of course Aunt Jemima falls on the other side of the spectrum.
 |Ultimately, I feel the majority of the responsibility lies with the consumer, as they're free to not purchase those products.
 |That said, awareness of health and wellness issues is relatively new within food and beverage, and most of these products were made at a time that these issues were far off the radar. I think it's unreasonable to expect companies to discontinue products just because they're not extremely good for you. Instead, I think the best move is to help make these products have improved health profiles, even if they're never going to be the very best choices. PepsiCo has done, and continues to do, a whole lot toward that goal.
 |And finally, I think it's important that these companies use their expertise to innovate in the healthy products space. There's been some of that at PepsiCo with their various juices and low/0 calories beverage offerings (the ones with limited artificial sweetener). They've also gotten into the dairy space, and maybe even produce (not totally sure). That said, they definitely could do more. In my opinion they, and all the companies like them, should do more.
[ congrats. What word/s did you use to convince the co founder? Being a long time friend would of been hard to convice him to take a step of faith? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2v9du5/iama_former_brand_manager_that_purchased_a_web/cofm9d5?context=5)|Thanks! I didn't expect to get any questions about ItsPlatonic since I didn't really mention it, but thanks.
 |To be honest, it happened over months of time. A lot of it was proving to him that the market existed and that people wanted it. For a long time he was very interested but not willing to quit his job and make the leap.
 |The final straw was me just looking him in the eye and telling him I needed him, and that he needed to do it. I just sat him down and said something like, ""It's time. We've always wanted to start a company, I have everything ready for us to hit the ground running (already had designed the whole site, bought the URL, etc.), and you'll regret it if you don't join me. Quit your job, the time is now and I don't want to find another cofounder.""
[Between Pepsi and Aumt Jemima, that's a lot of high fructose corn syrup being used in your products. What do you think of the use of corn syrup in place of sugar, and what do think about the affects of sugar (and corn syrups\) on health and weight in humans?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2v9du5/iama_former_brand_manager_that_purchased_a_web/cofn273?context=5)|You know, I'm really not an expert on it. At the time (5 years ago) I remember hearing something about high fructose corn syrup really not actually being a health issue, and I have no idea how true that was. I just haven't looked into it and removing it from the product was never really considered while I was in that role.
 |EDIT: I do think it's worth researching though, and an important topic (anything that affects our health in mass-produced foods, I don't know enough about HFCS to say for sure if it is in this category or not). At the time I was in charge of Aunt Jemima, it wasn't nearly as on-the-radar as it is today. I was also working on some other potential health-related formula improvements that unfortunately didn't come to fruition.
[What was the best part of all your work what did enjoy and what sucked?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2v9du5/iama_former_brand_manager_that_purchased_a_web/cofmnmp?context=5)|**There were two things I loved about my time at PepsiCo:**
 |1: The people. I made such good friends there and had so much fun spending time with a number of them. I really miss them.
 |2: The power. It was really amazing to have so much control and ability to change/influence things. Really felt like I had a very important role to play.
 |**What sucked:**
 |1: I ultimately left the company because I wasn't delivered promised promotions.
 |2: There was a lot of turnover at the top while I was there... Quaker (my division) went through 4 presidents in just 2.5 years at one point. That meant lots of abandoned projects and changing priorities.
[What are your thoughts on the syrup itself? Can you still eat the products? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2v9du5/iama_former_brand_manager_that_purchased_a_web/cofp1xw?context=5)|Sure! I still can, although I don't eat Aunt Jemima (or pancakes/syrup at all) for health reasons. I do sometimes eat the other products that I worked on, especially oatmeal, or Aunt Jemima's corn bread (so good!).
 |I liked the syrup. Personally, it was my second favorite of all of them (and yes, I have tried every syrup known to mankind), but one of its biggest competitors is the one I grew up with and like most. Unfortunately, on the rare occasion I do eat pancakes, everyone assumes I want and will only eat Aunt Jemima and so they go out and buy it for me. I'm cursed to never enjoy my favorite syrup again!
[It's Log Cabin, isn't it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2v9du5/iama_former_brand_manager_that_purchased_a_web/cofz6h7?context=5)|Maybe :)

[What does a $1 million deal look like on the backend? In other words, is it just a bunch of people in suits signing papers, or was there literally a mil in a brief case slid across a conference table. ( I know that the brief case is highly unlikely, but one could only hope\) Thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2v9du5/iama_former_brand_manager_that_purchased_a_web/cofp450?context=5)|I really wish it could have been the briefcase. I actually used to ask my finance team for permission to do things like that all the time. They got pretty sick of it.
 |Well there was never any meetings at all about this... in our world it wasn't that big of deal, and I paid invoices many, many times that size for other things. Once we reached an agreement, I paid the invoice using our internal software that I paid all other invoices with, and that was that. The software prints and mails a check that goes to them.
 |I'm sure I signed something, but I don't really remember that. The company we used to negotiate for it probably provided their stock contract for us and both parties were likely fine with it.
[How do you feel about 14 characters being worth that much? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2v9du5/iama_former_brand_manager_that_purchased_a_web/cofmi7l?context=5)|I assume you're referring to/including the www.?
 |How much advertising Quaker does and continues to do. More advertising means more people going to the URL. - Whether or not URLs and .coms remain as they are today. I could see services that allow you to customize URLs becoming popular, or .com becoming even with other website endings sometime in the future.
[Why spend all that money to purchase Quaker.com when QuakerOats.com works just fine? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2v9du5/iama_former_brand_manager_that_purchased_a_web/cofnkkh?context=5)|It's not an easy decision.
 |One of the biggest reasons is it is more memorable and likely for someone to type in him or herself.

I'm currently enrolled in a Masters program focusing on Information Management and Data Science. I'm by no means an expert, but do feel comfortable with R and Python, as well as data analysis. I'm required to do an internship as part of the degree, however I work full time and also have a family with a young daughter. This means I can't apply for an internship that would require a move. I'd love to be able to find an internship that offers remote work, though understand there can be challenges associated with that. I live in Syracuse, NY where there aren't a ton of opportunities, though I am looking. Just wondering if there were any recommendations on the remote-work front.

I'm majoring in EE at a state school (the only decent engineering school in state, but still not top tier), have a 3.89 GPA, a few decent Android projects (nothing extremely complex though. got a few thousand downloads each).

I completely suck at coding on paper, and if presented with paper, will always choke. I think this is why I fucked up at Microsoft, don't know about the other ones (Dropbox, Quora, Google, Greylock, Infusion, Citrix, IBM, Cisco, Garmin, Sensus, Square).

I know these internships are fairly competitive (especially for big4/SV/redmond) but it's getting me really worried that going to a T3 university (you probably have never heard of it if you're outside my state) is going to completely fuck me and I'm really heavily considering on transferring to a better school for CS in state just because it has a better reputation (CS is way better there, not so much here). 

To be clear I only got an interview at MS...

And a follow up to this: after being out, have you found yourself in situations where you considered committing a crime that would land you back in prison?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cofvln3?context=5)|I committed crimes but not never arrested really. I was almost charged with assault and battery at 12 years old and that was my biggest thing, I smoked weed, drank alcohol, lean and vandalized stuff but never got in trouble for any of it. Yeah, there's been a few times I've wanted to smack a person or two around but nothing else.
[If you were never arrested then why were you in maximum security for 10 years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cog085g?context=5)|Well for starters I had two violent crimes and a few issues while I was in jail awaiting trial.
[While inside, how did you pass the time? Was it more of a group environment or more solitary?  Did you have to do anything illegal while inside just to survive? Or was it not that violent?  Edit: spelling.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cofvel0?context=5)|I got my masters degree which is something I've always wanted to do since I dropped out of school when I was 16. I was in general population which is basically the complete opposite of solitary confinement. Nothing incredibly legal, I tossed hands a few times and made a weapon for self defense purposes. No, it's very violent. I was 2 days into my sentence and someone was stabbed to death in their cell which happened to be right across the tier from mine.
[Your responses really bum me out.  It seems like you have zero remorse.  You just wish you hadn't got caught and gone to prison.  I guess my question, after reading your responses, is what are you going to do to make sure you don't end up back in prison?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cogaxan?context=5)|No, I think I deserved to get caught, I got lucky serving ten years, I honestly believe I should still be in prison. I just don't have any remorse for the person that lost his life that day. I mean would you rather I lie and say it really has me shaken up and I can't sleep? The fact of the matter is I took a life and it didn't effect me, I can't change that, That's just how my brain responded.
[But didn't you say that you wouldn't toss hands because he would have shot you then, and you would have been 6ft under?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cogdv6c?context=5)|Well we are pretending I can see back and time, He didn't have a gun on him so I would have no issue boxing with him.
[If you don't mind my asking, what did it feel like to take a life..?  Did you simply act on impulse, or was it planned?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cog0157?context=5)|I didn't plan on taking a life, it was purely impulse. I was a hot headed teen who heard someone talking bad about a dumb girlfriend and I, I just mean't to shoot at him to show I wasn't someone to be fucked with, I hit an artery in his leg and he bled out before police could arrive. Truthfully, taking a life didn't bother me, I was in a really dark place.
[It didn't? Since that is past tense I'm curious how you feel about it now? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cog5ge7?context=5)|If I could go back in time I wouldn't have shot at him but I don't feel any guilt.
[Can you explain the actual crime? Do you feel guilty etc? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cofzxl8?context=5)|I was a hot headed teen who heard someone talking bad about a dumb girlfriend and I, I just mean't to shoot at him to show I wasn't someone to be fucked with, I hit an artery in his leg and he bled out before police could arrive. I honestly don't feel guilty which I know is really fucked up but it is what it is.
[What you did was intentionally hurt someone, no less with a potentially deadly weapon.  If a similar situation came up, do you think that you would do the same thing again? Hurt someone for talking shit but make sure it is not too serious/fatal maybe?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cog3ujx?context=5)|I do, You can't talk crazy and expect to get away with it. If I said ""Your mom is a whore"" would you not fight about that?
[You are very lucky that you had a good lawyer so you only got 10 years, but what's going on mentally?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cog3ujx?context=5)|No I wouldn't but only because I'm not trying to go back to prison.  I had 10 years to let it sink in, it didn't so i guess not.
[Is it the trauma of what happened making your brain not embrace what you've done? Or do you just not care about other people in general?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cog3ujx?context=5)|I care about other people more than the average person, this guy wasn't a good guy, he beat his mom and girlfriend and sold drugs to kids, I just don't care about his life.
[Have you been to therapists to understand why you don't feel guilty?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cog2g0d?context=5)|No I haven't, I don't want to disturb anything and become guilty truthfully.
[How old were you when this happened?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cog8o14?context=5)|I was 18-19 years old.
[What gun did you have access to? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cog8o14?context=5)|I bought a mac 10 from my friends older brother.

[You said elsewhere in this thread that everyone carries guns in your area. How can you justify being so confrontational when everyone around you is able -- and probably willing -- to kill you? How can you put so much on the line because someone was calling you names?  If you can't take a little shit talking without losing your mind, what can you take?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cogbybk?context=5)|It's not about not being able to take it, you can say anything to me and it's not going to bother me, What bothers me is when someone says something to me thinking they can say it and have no repercussions. And guess what, Nobody looks at me the wrong way now let alone say something foul.
[It's one thing to be a dumb kid who doesn't know any better (not that that's particularly understandable, but it's less baffling, I suppose\), but to actually lose as much as you have and still think that your thought process is worth defending? I mean, come on man. Have you learned nothing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cogbybk?context=5)|My dad used to say ""I'm not the strongest man in the world, I never claimed to be but I fear none and respect all, If you disrespect it, then I'm going to die about it"" and I've always lived by that, Respect me and I'll respect you, if you don't respect me then I'm not going to respect you. It's that simple.
[I support this... I've been lucky enough to never have police involved when ive done things like this but I wouldn't be able to go to sleep at night knowing I didn't stand up for myself or someone I cared about when some asshole thinks he can just say whatever he wants.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cogc0hh?context=5)|That's my point. I'm not going to ask him to stop, actions speak loader than words. It's the same thing with school yard bullies, you can beg and plead all you want for them to stop and they won't, but the minute you lay one of them out you never hear a word again.
[I've heard coffee is the most precious commodity in maximum security prison. Is this true? How did you adjust to having friends of a different race and then have to flip like a light switch and back your own only your race during a fight or altercation.  Did you get moved to maximum security because you were seeking education? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cog3h61?context=5)|I wouldn't say precious, it's highly sought out but anybody can get their hands on it if they have money. I didn't really have any friends outside of my race, I was cool with people but not friends for that very reason, It's not good for anyone if we get buddy buddy and then something happens on the yard and we have to fight, stab or kill each other. No, I was in a maximum security institution because both my convictions are violent.

Hmm ...](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cog31vr?context=5)|Hmm is right, I surprised as well. I bought a iPhone, xbox, and laptop my second day out, I googled something like pertaining to a resent event (I don't remember what it was) and found this site, started exploring and have been on this site pretty much every other day for about 3 months now.
[You murdered someone and only spent 10 years on prison?  Do you think that's a fair trade?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cog9574?context=5)|Of course not, I should be serving a life sentence but the prosecution wants convictions so they offered me a plea deal. If I plead guilty to assault in the first degree and 1st degree manslaughter I only get 10 years. 
[While you were in prison, did any of the other inmates try to escape? If it didn't work, what I assume, what did happen to them?  Are there intern lists of bad people, like ""He killed a guy, but the guy in the next cell raped a girl. That's really fucked up.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cog1bac?context=5)|No sir, That's some movie shit that hardly happens in the real world. I'm not sure what you mean by the second question but I was not looked at in a bad light, if anything in a good light. People who rape or molest children are in a very negative light.
[Already thought that, but you never know :\)  That's interesting, but i read that a couple of times already. Why do you think rapists are the bad guys even under criminals? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2vadsp/its_been_six_months_since_i_was_released_from_a/cog3j6y?context=5)|Because they take advantage of people who are deemed off limits, They take advantage of women who for the most part aren't as powerful as men and same with children. It's not just rapists though it's pretty much any offense involving women or children, If you murder a child you are on the same level as a pedophile or rapist.

I am applying for a summer internship at a Financial firm because of a connection I have there. 

My problem is that I have no competent resume. My connection told me not to worry that much about having experience. He said that they don't expect sophomores in University to have that much experience.

I do:

 -Get decent grades(3.5GPA)(Neat course load)

 -Succeed in talking to professional people(They seem to like me and claim I make a good impression on them.)

 -Have a summer's worth of experience working at a convenience store. My co-workers and employers both seemed to have a very good experience with me.

 -I have fluff skills(Excel, Google services, learning quickly, working with others, being reliable etc.)  and some community service etc.

I was wondering how much I should put on my resume. My job experience is pathetic.

I apologize if I came across as full of myself or if I offended anyone with my ignorance. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

He has just received a W2 summarizing his earnings and the tax that they deducted at source.  He paid about $1,700 in US taxes and given that this was his only income he should be entitled to get all of it back.

My question concerns what he needs to do with respect to filing a tax return and his potential refund.

(1)  Does he simply file his Canadian tax return and include the W2 information?  Will CRA refund the tax collected due to our tax treaty with the US?

(2)  Or does he have to file an American tax return in order to get the refund, and then file a Canadian tax return as per usual?

I have looked online but have been unable to find an answer.  I would appreciate any help that the Reddit community can provide.

I'm currently working for a tech consulting company in Chicago. I've been with them a little over a month. I know ideally I should stay longer, but I'm already on the bad side with my manager (i can include details, but I don't think it'll really matter). I don't think she really likes me, and her emails to me have been a little on the hostile side lately. I don't feel welcome, and don't really see potential for me in the future. I also don't think the company culture is for me.

So with this being said, I've already thought about quitting. My plan is to continue with my current job while job searching. I'm probably going to look for opportunities maybe in the end of Feb or in March. If I stayed only for a few months, should I even mention it in my resume? My current company is definitely more noticeable than the internships I had. I think. So I'm leaning towards including it in my resume in hopes of better opportunities.

Has anyone ever been in a similar situation? Quitting a job early into it?"

I'm currently doing something that some people may consider immoral. Stringing along one company in order to use them as leverage to bargain for a higher salary for the job I really want. 

I've been at a company A as an intern, on and off for about a year. It's in an exciting new field, network security penetration testing. They are willing to teach me 100% about networks, plus finding and exploiting vulnerabilities. The atmosphere is great, and I really enjoy the work there.

However, I am also aware that the starting salary for an associate is pretty low for the industry. About 50K. When I make the transition from intern to full time, I want a backup offer to use as a bargaining chip. In a perfect world, I'd like to start at a number closer to 70K - 90K. I have 5 years of internship experience, good grades, and I come off well in interviews, not to sound too full of myself. It's never been hard for me to find job offers. I graduate next quarter in CS. My interest is primarily in network security, even tho I'm a programmer currently.

Well known entertainment company B has been interested in me for quite some time. I interviewed for an internship position about nine months ago, and although I didn't get it (A friend of mine got the offer, a returning student who had much more applicable experience. No worries, I still had company A.) The person who interviewed me kept in touch, however, and I visited the offices a few times and discussed security stuff. I believe the fact that it was the person in charge pinging me, rather than the reverse, was a really good sign. Now, he has referred me to a full time position, with the expectation that I will apply, and asked me to meet with the VP and him for an interview. 

Company B would probably have a starting salary of 75K, which might sound great, but, I cannot realistically take the position because I have a significant other who wants me to move in after college, and they live 200 miles away. I haven't asked, but it doesn't look as though remote work is possible, especially not for newbies like me.

Should I apply for the offered position at company B, and meet with the VP without any intention to accept? Or will they be insulted and trash my reputation? Has anyone else been able to use offers to gain a more advantageous salary offer? I definitely want a real offer to bargain with at my current job.

2vdh5u,9,2015-02-09,TIFU by accidentally picking up a guy,inspiredman,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2vdh5u/tifu_by_accidentally_picking_up_a_guy/,"It is around this week that this incident happened two years ago, so I thought I'd share with you all!

When I first moved back to the city of my college days, most of my friends were already gone or in relationships. I had one Russian friend that was still in school and wanted to hang out with me.

My Russian friend and I would hang out almost every day, so we became very close bros. He was very supportive of my goals and we had a lot to talk about. That being said, we were very different. While he worked out all the time and valued being a ""man,"" I spent my spare time reading books and encouraging him to explore the city with me. Our values often clashed, but we both encouraged the other to explore new things and re-think our paradigms about life and people.

One of the things that we both agreed on was that we needed to branch out and meet new people. However, the problem was that my Russian friend was the stereotypical American image of a Russian. He said what was on his mind (with his thick Sochi Russian accent). He never cared if his words hurt people's feelings. He was also extremely loud and obnoxious around people that he didn't like. He really had to know you for him to open up and show his cool side. This characteristic of his meant that he was not the best person to make good impressions on strangers.
On the flipside, there was me. Talking to everyone and seeming like I was way too nice. So I made sure to do most of the talking if we did meet someone cool that could become our fourth member (Russian guy had one other friend who'd sometimes hang out with us).

So one day, we were out shooting a video. After we finished, we ended up stopping by a Cosi's near campus to get some dinner. The staff at the Cosi's and I really hit it off, and we were all laughing and talking about funny stuff while I was ordering. I realized that they could become some of our new friends. So I exchanged numbers with them after telling them that I was looking for more people to hang out with our little group.
When we were leaving the Cosi's, I saw another worker sitting outside, taking a smoke. I don't think he was inside when I was bonding with the other staff members, but since the interaction with the other Cosi's staff went so well, I decided to exchange contact with him too. Another new friend, right? So I went up to him with my Russian friend and told him the same thing that I told the other workers in the restaurant.

So he gave me his number and I texted him mine.

When we walked off, my Russian friend uttered to me one of his trademark utterances.

""You know that guy is gay, right?"" he said. ""He thinks you're hitting on him.""

I assumed my Russian guy was just being mean to a guy like he usually is with most people. He, being Russian, thinks of most effeminate guys are ""gay."" The guy he was calling gay was kind of a skateboarder-looking dude, so he wasn't a big, bulky Russian-looking person.

""I don't think so,"" I told him. ""And even if he were gay, so what? I made it clear to him that we were just looking for more people to chill with.""

So all the other workers at Cosi's got back to me immediately with standard texts like, ""Nice to meet you! Let's definitely chill sometime."" But this worker outside didn't text me his number immediately.

Two days later, when I was at my internship, I finally get a text from him.

""What do you want to do with your life?"" the text asks. At this point, I get a little suspicious. After all, whenever a guy gets a girl's number, he's always waiting two days before texting her. Being a guy, I've never been on the receiving end. Maybe I'm just overthinking and being biased by my Russian friend's words, I thought to myself.

So I tell him about my internship and my long term goals to make the world a better place.

A few hours later, he texts me back.

""Chica please!"" he wrote flirtatiously. ""You can't make the world a better place by working at [the tv station I was at] ;) but I share your goals. I want to go into education.""

So I kind of laugh at this text, and I realize that my Russian friend was right. This guy, because he wasn't in the restaurant when I connected with the other Cosi workers, did get the wrong impression. This type of ""neg"" that he was doing is standard texting banter from a guy.

When I got home and told my Russian friend about this text, he just laughed for two minutes straight. Now, two years later, he still cracks up at this incident.

""That guy called you 'Chica,'"" my Russian friend always reminds me. ""He probably thought you were going to be on the bottom. You need to work out with me, dude! That'll stop these incidents.""

So as much as I wanted my Russian friend to be more politically correct with what he says, this incident that happened two years ago is always justification for him to continue his crazy Russian-talking.

TLDR: was trying to make new friends, but one of the guys texted me something flirtatious because he thought that I was gay."
2vdjka,3,2015-02-09,"It's like an endless cycle. I think its gone, and time and time again it proves me wrong and drags me back in.",[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2vdjka/its_like_an_endless_cycle_i_think_its_gone_and/,"Once again, I'm feeling suicidal.  This is nothing new, happens a couple times a year.  I'm so fucking sick and tired of it, though.

I've been depressed since I was 9.  I'm now 20.  Just when I think maybe it's situational and it goes away for good, it comes riiiight back.  I cannot afford meds, and am afraid of being dependent on them. 

My childhood was complete and utter shit.  Basically an only child (sister is almost 20 years older than me).  Grew up in a bad neighborhood and didn't fit in because I acted ""white.""  Mom single parent, came home from work and yelled every single day.  Beat me up sometimes, but it was mostly yelling.  Since middle school, our relationship has been rocky and shitty because of several circumstances that I don't want to go into detail about.

I now go to college in a different state (specifically because I wanted to get away from her and my home town.)  Lived with my sister until mom moved down here (my sister has a family, and so basically I was to live with my mom upon her coming down here because there was no room for me with my sister, and I'd kinda be intruding on her new life/family.)

Freshman and Sophomore year of college, I hated.  I hated my college, a small, expensive private liberal arts school with a lot of rich, snobby white kids and this whole ""if you don't get drunk on tuesdays or aren't a part of greek life, you suck"" mentality.  I drink and eat cannabis edibles on occasion, but these kids were just all day, err day turnt up.  Actually studying was like a joke to a lot of them.  Almost all the friends I made transferred out because they either hated it or couldn't afford it, so I set to hanging out with people who's company I didn't really enjoy or have anything in common with, or people I loved that were graduating seniors.  On top of that, I wasn't the most outgoing person due to social anxiety and a fear of vulnerability/getting close to others (both are pretty much nullified now, whoo hoo!)

Eventually, I transferred to another college, and I'm spending the first semester as a commuter at a school that I like a lot better.  A population of about 10,000 and a diverse student body.  And its really cheap, so you have the older people switching careers, the younger, poorer people of all racial backgrounds trying to make a life for themselves....and then the really obnoxious black kids who think it's the 13th grade, which reminds me of the people in my hometown who used to bully me for ""tryna be white.""  

My problem is that I'm living with my mother, in two-bedroom apartment, and I feel like I'm reliving my childhood all the way to the end of high school again.  She's trying to pretend that none of the things that happened in the past happened and is trying to be buddy-buddy, which makes me uncomfortable, which then makes her mad.  When she gets mad I remember who she was, and assume her niceness is a fake trick.  I don't really talk unless spoken to because I just can't imagine a normal, healthy mother-daughter relationship with someone like her.  Living with her is taking a toll on my mental health.

In the dorms, I was so happy and free.  Here, it feels so constricting.  I had a large refund check from my students loans, so I just got a car.  And I should be happy.  But I'm still broke.  I'm sleeping on a blow-up mattress in her ""office"", the 2nd bedroom.  My clothes are kept in two suitcases, and my shirts hung in the closet.  Thankfully, we have separate bathrooms.  

I'm a STEM major as well, which is already pretty darn stressful.  Already, I have had certain people try my intelligence based on the fact that I am black and female.  No, I'm not making assumptions.  I may get a job soon at a hospital, which I am eternally grateful for.  However, being a full-time student, doing part-time work, living with someone I resent, and having more and more expenses (car insurance, health and dental, gas, phone bill) pile up is making me feel like a crazy person.  And I'm getting fat.  I used to be hot (didn't really get hot and confident until college) and thin, and now I'm getting fat and it's driving me up a wall.  My cheekbones are gone and I have a baby face again.  I have love handles.  I have never had love handles before.  When I eat, even if its healthy, I want to throw up. When I look at myself in the mirror, I want to just die.  In public, I pretend to still be confident and comfortable in my skin, but since gaining weight that is not the case.  I used to work out a lot but stopped during my semester off.  I've been trying to work the treadmill back into my increasingly busy schedule.  Call me vain if you want to.  I have no problem with overweight people and don't judge people based on physical appearances, but their actions and behavior.  However, I, personally, am not comfortable being overweight and find myself disgusted at my naked body now.

I want to get an apartment/roommate soon.  Apartments in my state are CHEAP (we'd pay 200 each at least and 400 at most) but I'm afraid my job, IF I get it (about $288 per week, slightly above min wage) won't be enough, and I'll be forced to continue living with her (living on campus is reserved for freshmen and heavily competitive) or taking out more in student loans to get a refund check to survive off of.  I'm sick of being poor.  I'm sick of my living conditions.  I'm sick of being around my mother.  If this is what my life is going to be like up until the end of grad school, then I don't want to live.

I see old my friends from the private college living completely different lifestyles.  Going out to bars and concerts and lavish vacations, and completely free of struggle, and it just makes me feel like a piece of shit.  

For once in my life, I just want to not have to worry about anything.  I don't want anything handed to me, and I have no qualms against working hard in school and in the workforce, as I've done it already and continue to do it, but sometimes I just want to fucking be a 20 year old. What's the point of working and going to school for the rest of my life if I can't take a breather or reap the benefits?  I should be done with grad school in the next 4 -5 years...but by then I'll have a career and no free time.  

I can't drop out and quit my dreams, because all I have waiting for me is the projects.  I can't just magically shit out money or a good, nearby support system of friends.  My immediate family is nonexistent. Lately, I've been feeling like my only option is to kill myself.  Whenever something good happens to me, twice as many bad things happen.  Life doesn't owe me shit, but holy shit this is just a miserable life.  

After my teenage emo, woe as me phase in middle school, I started having a different outlook:  Think positive, work hard, and good things will happen.  And they have.  But it just seems like more bullshit keeps coming.  And usually, when the bullshit comes, I work my way around it.  I'll have my private mental breakdown, plan out my suicide, change my mind and then ignore my suicidal feelings, tell myself to buck up and make a plan from step a to z, and then follow through.  

This time is different.  No mental breakdown, no crying.  Just calm realization. I just really want to walk to my sister's house, take my bro-in-law's gun, and shoot myself in the mouth.  I'm having a hard time seeing hope.  I can't see a plan to follow.  Work part-time, study full-time, exercise 3-4 times a week, pay the rent, car, groceries, etc, intern for my grad school prereqs, have time for my hobbies, make real, long-lasting relationships, avoid my mom's bullshit, AND keep a sane head? Please give me the answer to HOW, least I end up the butt of one of Louis CK's jokes.

As I've gotten older and matured, I try really hard to keep the glass half-full.  I really do, and it usually works.  But there are moments when I just want to stop breathing.  This is one of those moments.  And these moments only seem to get worse when I'm on my period (TMI, sorry).  The days leading up to my period are the worst, because I just become a crazy person.  I can't see any good in the world or in myself anymore.  And I wish I could blame it on my hormones and the fact that my vagina is being an asshole right now, but I know deep down its me.  Usually, I get over it and keep a smile on my face.  But this is the most overwhelmed I've felt in my life, even looking back at my childhood. 
How do I stay positive all the time and not lose hope? I'm so fucking sick of this.

I feel like I'm going to end up like my mom: bitter, negative, unhealthy lifestyle, let go of personal hygeine and upkeep, a constantly complaining victim that's always financially struggling in a miserable career, no close friends or SOs.  I don't want that life.  I would rather kill myself then end up like that. And I'm afraid that no matter how hard I try to actively avoid that path, I will end up like her, and it scares me.  

I just really need someone to talk to.  Someone who has been in my shoes, and made it out alive and okay.  I just want to keep my head up and live a good life.  That's all I fucking want, without the mind-numbing self-doubt every other week.

I won't kill myself tonight.  I'll do my homework, and then turn my brain off and lie in bed til I fall asleep to Bob's Burgers or Hemlock Grove or something.  But at this point, there's no telling what I'll do to myself.  I feel like a zombie, so fucking stressed, but so fucking calm.  I know the storm's coming, because it always does.  I'll try and keep it at bay, but I just really need someone to talk to.  

I'm sick of writing and ripping up tear-stained suicide notes."
2vdo14,1,2015-02-09,Should I accept this IT internship?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2vdo14/should_i_accept_this_it_internship/,"I, as a current sophomore, finally received an offer for an IT internship in a large insurance company, but what I really want to get to in the future is low level systems (Think C++ and FPGAs) in a high frequency trading firm. It seems like although there are elements of working with these systems, I'm afraid that most of the work will involve managing these systems instead of actually practicing coding skills to excel in interviews at those firms in the future, which is important since I need to excel at those interviews to get into those firms.

I know that there's value in working in the real world and everything associated with that, but will it help me on my journey towards becoming an engineer at an HFT firm, or more urgently, landing an internship at one next year? It's important to note that I have another conditional offer that is a CS internship at a government agency, but the nature of the security clearance processing still leaves uncertainty on whether I'll really get it or not. I have to respond to this offer by this Friday, so some insight would be nice. Thanks all very much!

P.S. If anybody is so inclined, I'll PM you the info about the position and the company. Again, thanks."

I'll bullet this to make it easier to read:

• Want to intern for MLS soccer club

• Found Director of Marketing on LinkedIn - She looks rather young, definitely under 30

• Can't contact on LinkedIn unless I connect first (I don't know her personally)

• Found her on Facebook

• We both have skiing/snowboarding photos - of course I would never mention this to her in message, but I would figure she'd notice this fact, and I know having similar interests with people in her position could potentially go a long way


So...

• Should I contact her through Facebook (first apologizing if it may come off as informal) and ask if there are any sort of upcoming internship opportunities? Would this be too creeper-status or would it be seen as taking initiative in finding her and looking for work?

• Or connect on LinkedIn (hoping she accepts) and contact her through that?"
2veeki,1,2015-02-10,How valuable are certificates on top of schooling?,SunliMin,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2veeki/how_valuable_are_certificates_on_top_of_schooling/,"I have been trying to find ways to stand out. In the short term, find a summer internship as a freshman. In the long term, beat out my fellow graduates for full time jobs.

I know projects are a big thing, but one thing I don't see people talk about is certificates.

If you are comparing multiple candidates, all with a bachelor/diploma in software development/computer science, with similar past internships, similar everything, how much weight do a few certificates have?

Specifically I am looking at some .NET certification or similar. I am also talking specifically about the programming/software development field.

I can't see them hurting, but some seem to cost money and/or are a time sink when the effort could be put into something else. Curious on how much they matter to employers hiring students/new grads."

I lived in a big house with a lot of relatives. Life was Ok. I Got to secondary school (high school) and did  well within African standards. It was immediately set in Gold that I would do Engineering because engineers made a lot of money.

My Single mum saved up and sent me to Canada to study engineering 3 years after I graduated high school. I came here with high hopes and the future seemed bright.

Then it started, Everything that could go worse happened, from having nothing to eat on most days , homelessness and even getting a civil court case. I had to pick up various part time jobs to get by. My mom sends money to me to pay my tuition but its not enough so i have to work. I am sitting on a 2.94 Gpa because of various incidents i have had to deal with.

The silver lining for me was the co-op program in my course. I figured if i could get an internship, i would be able to save enough to help out with my tuition and help pay bills. But I am unable to even land an interview. The winter semester is half-way through and there's nothing in sight. I'm Learning SQL and matlab to pass away the time.

I absolutely love engineering and would do it again if i had to. I am very positive and i know i will eventually get a break, but its hard not to get emotional.

Mainly, I was in charge of upgrading the office computers, either by upgrading them to Windows 7 or completely installing a new computer. I'd set the new computer up in the build room, transfer their files over the network, then replace the computer, leaving maybe ten minutes of downtime for user. Usually.

&gt;**Me**: ""Hi, I just wanted to find out, when could I replace your computer? I can do it when you're at lunch, if you want.""  
&gt;**Worker**: ""That would be great, I normally take lunch at 1.""

So, 1PM comes around, and I change out the computer without an issue. I go back to the build room to set up the next computer, until about half an hour later.

*Knock knock knock knock knock*  
&gt;**Me**: ""Hello?""  
&gt;**Worker**: ""You replaced my computer and none of my files are there!""  
&gt;**Me**: ""Let me take a look. If something went wrong I have your old computer here.""  

I follow her back to her desk, and she sits down, pointing at the screen, with her Documents folder open.

&gt;**Worker**: ""See, they aren't there! [Folder 1] and [Folder 2] aren't there!""  
&gt;**Me**: ""They're right here.""  
&gt;**Worker**: ""That's not them!""  

At this point I'm starting to question myself. Did I make empty folders? Is she missing her files? Nope, they're all right there.

&gt;**Me**: ""These aren't your files?""  
&gt;**Worker**: ""No, these aren't them.""  
&gt;**Me**: ""Okay, let me go plug your old computer in in the build room.""  

I go off, and plug her old computer into the network. I decide to get a cup of coffee quickly, and ask the other intern to go take a look so I can make sure I know where her old files are. I head back, and find my fellow intern and the worker arguing. He didn't have as much patience for this situation.

&gt;**Intern**: ""Your files are right here.""  
&gt;**Worker**: ""Those aren't my files, or my folders. I need my files or I can't work.""  
&gt;**Intern**: ""But they're right there.""  
&gt;**Me**: ""Can I sit down for a second?""

I bring up Remote Desktop, and bring up Windows explorer on her old computer, side by side with the documents folder on her new machine. We sit there for ten minutes, opening and comparing files, showing her they are the same. Exact. Files.

&gt;**Me**: ""See, they are your files.""  
&gt;**Worker**: ""No they aren't, why do you keep saying they are. They have the same information, but they're not mine!""  
&gt;**Me**: ""Wait... What?""  

I look at the two computers' folders, and back at her blankly. She just said it's the same files, but they're not her files. I'm at a loss, until I notice the one difference between the two.

Her old machine had Windows Explorer set to Large Icons, and the new computer had the default as Detail."

* Is it possible to bridge into a degree program (say year 3) in a good indian university?
* Would my diploma be good enough to find a job in my field (IT/programming); The only work experience I have is my internships as part of my diploma program
* Is a degree required to have a good job in India?

We use PostgreSQL 9.4, and we're doing some internal testing right now to optimize the way our data feeds work.  Because this is an internship / entry level position, we wouldn't expect you to have years of experience or anything, but you should at least know how to use a bash shell and what ""ssh"" is and have some programming knowledge.  Obviously, the more relevant experience, the better though.  You should come into this expecting and wanting to learn a lot quickly.

Other skills (in descending order of importance) that you can either learn if you're interested, or may help you if you already know them:

* Configuring an NGINX webserver
* Working with AWS, mainly S3
* Rhino 3D (CAD software that jewelers use)
* Photography, specifically as it relates to photographing jewelry
* Computer vision using static images (ie, not real time)
* Photoshop, ImageMagick, or other image processing software
* Anything about diamonds or jewelry

Also note that this is not going to be an internship where you do the same thing over and over and don't actually learn much.  We expect you to learn a lot.

Should I go ahead and reach out now, or wait until March?",DickCheeseSupreme,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2vg1ul/a_company_told_me_to_reach_out_to_them_in_march/,"**Some back story:**

A couple months ago, I applied for a Summer Internship position at a company and got an interview.  The interview went amazing, but there was only one hang up: While they acknowledged the job posting clearly stated this was a *Summer* position, the company had run into an unforeseen problem, and to help solve it they wanted to bring in some interns for the Winter/Spring.

At that point I had already signed up for classes, bought books, etc., and for a few reasons which I won't get into now, I generally would *not* like to delay getting my degree any further.

The company was extremely understanding and even told me they believe education should come before anything, which surprised me. 

After the initial interview I sat down with the Director of Talent Acquisition and Engagement, and she told me the company would still be interested in me this summer, but that they currently must focus on the immediate problem, which included hiring someone for the Spring. 

This is where she told me to call her ""around March."" 

**The current situation:**

Today there was a career fair at my university, and low and behold, this company had a table there! I didn't recognize the recruiters, so I introduced myself, chat for a bit, gave them my resume. I told them this whole story, and they confirmed that they were indeed looking for Summer interns now.

Here's my dilemma. If they're looking for interns *now*, I don't want to wait another month to reach out. I did another application for their Summer position when I got home from the fair, but I still want to call my contact at the company.

Would it be bad for me to call her ~3 weeks before she initially told me to, in this situation?

**Edit:** I realized this doesn't sound specifically like a Computer Science-related issue, but I am a CS major, and the company is a software company."

-Get decent grades(3.5GPA)(Neat course load)

-Succeed in talking to professional people(They seem to like me and claim I make a good impression on them.)

-Have a summer's worth of experience working at a convenience store. My co-workers and employers both seemed to have a very good experience with me.

As a result, I've had to take the project they gave me and run wild with it.

I'm building a web application that searches a database (in the form of a JSON file) which is comprised of a series of arrays containing objects containing more arrays. At the heart of the mess is a file name which I search for in the directory, also JSON format, and contains the info necessary for the webapp. I have the search function and data-parsing/display working with JS and jquery.

My next step is to create a database from a few excel files and access that with the application to search for info related to the file that the original JSON file produced.

I don't have any experience with servers or databases and I'm really just looking for the quickest/easiest solution to this possible. I want to have something up and running so the tool is usable by the other engineers and then I can go back and implement something a little more maintainable or detailed ( I have a deadline for ""something workable""). I don't have time to do as much research as I would usually do in order to get this up and running in time.

After a little research I've come across PHP and sqlserver as possible solutions. Where I'm not really sure how to proceed is how I can implement the php with my JS and so forth. I assume I can just link to the php file in my html, but how can I relate the two things. Also, how do I relate the php and the sql database? 

Forgive me if I'm not making any sense. I've never done anything web related before this internship and I've been completely on my own teaching myself JS/jquery, html and css while simultaneously trying to make progress on this project. Any advice or alternate solutions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks "

I have to decide the next 2 months which way I go regarding my professional career.

First I want to introduce myself. I am 28 years old and I am graduating from a Top 10 Business School in Germany.

Before I studied I did an apprenticeship with 16 as an industrial salesman and worked 8 years for this company in Germany and Spain. After that I went to university and did 2 internships in consulting and one in a big telecommunication company.

Now I am unsure about my future and I want to ask you for advice. I have following options

**1.  I do my master’s degree**

Pro:

+  I will gain new experience and knowledge. Can go abroad for one year

Contra:

- I have the feeling that I didn’t learn much how to run a business. SO maybe studying two more years is waste of time and I will be 30 when I am done…

**2.  I will start working now in sales or in consulting and don’t do the masters**

Pro:

+ I earn “good” money and I can “travel”
+ Work in consulting was fun I liked the tasks
+ Maybe I will have the opportunity to work in a different country like Dubai or Sydney? I like vibrant big cities :)

Contra:

- in consulting I worked a lot. Around 60-70 hours. Never be at home before 9 pm… (No time for sports, friends…)
- I will be an employee and work for someone else. At least for the next 5 years.
- I am 28 or 30 when i am done with uni and start as a junior consultant. Other people will be already senior consultants with the same age. Nobody care in consulting about my past work experience.
Maybe my age is an disadvantage to get a high position?

**3. I start working for my parents company**

We have a real estate developing company with around 30-40 apartments).We build and sell/ rent houses/apartments.
The company is small (Brother, mother and my dad). But there are many opportunities in my opinion to increase the business.

Pro: 

+ I like to be my own boss and be independent
+ the business is very interesting and I can generate a passive income. (My brother has already 3 houses and generates an extra income)
+ The business ran quite well the last twenty years and I would say my parents are wealthy
+ parallel to the business i could trade and get more knowledge about trading, My dad and me are passionate with trading at the stock exchange. And I could start a second business (import / export )

Contra:

- I have no clue about real estate developing business and had to learn everything from the scratch
- At the beginning I would get much less salary from my parents compared to consulting
- Maybe it is difficult to work with the family?
- I would be in a small town in south Germany not in a vibrant city like Dubai. But I could move to Munich which is just 30 min away from home.
-And the biggest disadvantage: I have never really said to my parents that I want to work for their company. My parents don’t know that I would like to work for them.   

**During my study i never said to them what i want to do after graduation. I always said we will see but my parents also never asked me if I want to work for them**
(maybe because they know I like to travel and discover foreign countries…) 

My feeling says I should work for their company but on the other side I miss the beach and foreign countries. (Lived in Spain, USA and Australia).

I am also aware if I don’t start working now for my parents it will be too late.
My dad is 60 and will get retired in 5 years I think. Furthermore I have to gain a lot of knowledge in this business to be successful.

Please give me some thoughts because right now I am not sure what I shall do.

How shall I speak to my parents that I want to start at their company? 


Thanks"
2vgrat,1,2015-02-10,Internship offer - wondering if worth it,AudioRevelations,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/2vgrat/internship_offer_wondering_if_worth_it/,"Hey everyone! I am currently a junior getting my ece undergraduate degree, and just recently got an offer for an internship, and was wondering if this specific offer would be worth it. 

The details are: it is a software engineering position, and they pay ~$14.25/hour (which I feel like is under what I could be making elsewhere), but they have the offer that if I stay with them through next year, they will pay for grad school (technical or otherwise). 

The work seems cool and interesting, I am mostly just wondering if I'm getting really screwed on the wage part of it. 


Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!"
2vgzjf,39,2015-02-10,"I am not salaried and my employer won't pay me beyond 35 hours a week even if they assign me to work events and attend meetings on mornings, nights, and weekends.",[deleted],legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2vgzjf/i_am_not_salaried_and_my_employer_wont_pay_me/,"So here's the deal: In September of 2013 I began working for the California State Legislature at a legislator's district office as an unpaid intern. After about 6 months into the internship I was planning on ending the internship and pursuing law school. The Chief of Staff called me on the phone to see if I would be interested in working as a full time staff member. Fresh out of college with little work experience I was happy to take the offer to continue to both build my resume and start making money. He said I would be paid $14/hr and he said the goal would be to have me work full time with benefits by December. I figured I could study for the LSAT in my spare time.

I went through the hiring process and in February of 2014 I started work as a full time employee. When I asked how the payment worked for hourly employees, our Chief of Staff explained to me to mark down 35hrs a week on my time sheet that I submit to payroll every 2 weeks. Now, a big part of my job is attending community events and meetings in the place of the legislator, or to act as personal staff when they are present. This means I often work well outside of 35 hours a week, so obviously I have little time for studying and pursuing higher education.

I went along with this for about 6 months until I had had enough with working extra hours without pay as a non salaried employee. I asked the Chief of Staff if I could begin to mark down the hours I work beyond the 35 hours and he explained to me that at a rate of $14 an hour for 35 hours a week that I make as much as an entry level salaried employee, just without benefits. He explained further that they would pay me more if they could, but since the Speaker of the Assembly sets our office budget, we don't have a the funds nor the means to pay me more. I said that I understood what he meant and that was the end of that. While the speaker does indeed set our office budget, the Chief of Staff either didn't know his math or he flat out lied to me in regards to my income in comparison to entry level salaried employees; I looked up online what they make (all public employees salaries are open information)  and it turns out I make two thirds of what they make in take home pay.

Obviously, I was angry. But knowing that the Speaker controlled the purse strings and that our office budget was tight I optimistically waited for December. The reason being that this is when the Speaker adjusts the budgets of all assembly offices for the new legislative session. I was told that it is an unwritten rule that the offices who volunteer the most for nearby Democrat assembly I campaigns in will be rewarded with a higher budget come December. So I volunteered countless hours waking for nearby assembly campaigns that were close races.

The outcome? I have been a full time employee for over 1 year and the conditions of my compensation have still not changed. I fear that I will be fired if I do not tread carefully and speak out to the wrong people. There is also no whistleblower protection for legislative employees.

Here's my dilemma. I know this is illegal and that I am being taken advantage of. I am not interested in rocking the boat because I do not want to burn this bridge for the purposes of both networking and having a good resume. At the same time I will be going to Paris for the Summer to live with my girlfriend and I need as much money as possible because I will not be able to work when I am there without a permit, which is virtually impossible to get (I am not an EU citizen obviously). This means that I cannot find a new job because nobody will hire me if I am just going to end up leaving in 3 months time. 

My plan is to bring up the legality of what they are doing it up to my supervisor at our monthly one on one meeting next week. However I want to know the labor code sections that clearly show what they are doing is illegal in an effort to have them start paying me for all the work I do. I could have called HR months ago, but again I don't want to burn that bridge, and I am not even sure if HR would even go to bat for me. I am paranoid  they may contact or reprimand my boss, which is not my intentions."
2vh2oy,0,2015-02-10,Does anyone else in this career feel useless everyday of their career?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2vh2oy/does_anyone_else_in_this_career_feel_useless/,"Currently hired as an intern software dev, doing my comp sci degree. I'd say I was able to understand enough to be able to read programmes in C/C++/Python/JS/(A little)Swift but I find it incredibly difficult to write my own, I have no idea where to start, maybe I'm just terrible at the architectural side of things. 

There are days where I think ""I'll learn this!"" and just never bother, or find it too difficult to understand and give up. 

I used to enjoy programming as a whole and would make little projects every week, working on them a few hours each night, then I ended up in a job and stopped. Doing development work all day, albeit not very difficult coding as it's only an intern, I just cannot be bothered to do any at home.

I try to push myself by asking other developers I know to do projects with me, but they never seem to happen either. I've tried researching into other parts of computer science such as cryptography and gave up quickly after realising I wasn't clever enough to understand the mathematics side of things and felt incredibly useless. I've tried hardware side, arduino's, bought lots of little things, sensors etc, then realised I wasn't clever enough to understand how to use them. Maybe I'm not useless, just lazy.

Do I give up or continue? Does it get worse or better? Any help would be appreciated if anyone else has been in this position. I'm young (early 20's) but I'd say it's too late to change career path after doing 6 years of education in computing, degree, etc."
2vhc08,1,2015-02-10,No idea what to do right now,[deleted],mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/2vhc08/no_idea_what_to_do_right_now/,"So uh... I've got a lot of diagnoses that are keeping me from getting anywhere right now and it's really quite frustrating. I've got BP1, BPD, ADHD, ASD, GAD, NLD and gender dysphoria all working against me. My therapist (that I really like) has even said that I'm easily one of the more fucked up patients she's seen. 

I had a lot of trouble with college, only being able to manage a couple of classes at a time, and I did really well in those because of the way they were structured. I spent two years studying network engineering, got three certifications, ready to enter the workforce, then my bipolar decides to kick in. Fucked up an internship opportunity because of a surprise mixed episode. 

I've never been able to succeed at any job I've had; never getting into the routine, always forgetting things, socially awkward. I end up either getting fired or quitting after a few months. Now I'm just stuck living at home until I can find out what I'm supposed to do next. I've at least gotten the bipolar under control, but now I have to contend with my slow processing speed. I can't handle job interviews because I am completely incapable of thinking on my feet in those kinds of situations. I'm utterly unemployable at this point. No chance of success anywhere. 

I'm trying to get things back together, but I have no idea what I'm supposed to be doing right now. All the IT jobs I've been looking to apply to require associate's or bachelor's degrees, and there is absolutely no way I will ever be able to achieve those kinds of credentials. I'm stuck. 

Is there anything I can do right now?"

2vhp2c,0,2015-02-10,Seeking Programming career advice from Mechanical Engineering job,[deleted],AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/2vhp2c/seeking_programming_career_advice_from_mechanical/,"Hi everyone,

I could really use some career advice. I have been working as an ME for about a year now, and am thinking about my future plans. I don't know what the etiquette is on this sub, but I would really appreciate your input: 

I'm currently a mechanical engineer, working at a small machinery company. I started in February 2014 after my graduation from a top engineering program (BSME) in December 2013. My GPA was very low (&lt;3.0), although I had one decent looking internship at a startup. I didn't learn much in college, but walked out with a degree, a little bit of coding experience, and basic engineering knowledge. 

My company is a mid-size manufacturing company (&gt;150 employees). As 1 of 3 of an engineering team, my duties have been substantial and have consisted of the following:

* 40% Machinery Design (Solidworks)- my designs have been implemented on a few of our most popular machines and are in numerous clients' fab plants 

* 30% Documentation (Solidworks, AutoCAD for air, SEE Electrical)- Part/assembly prints, PDM, electrical prints, air prints 


* 15% hands-on part fabrication, floor/assembly, electrical panels

* 5% coding- javascript google chart for tracking group tasks, solidworks macros using VBA, custom motor sizing calculator using Python

* 5% Engineering analysis (Solidworks simulation) + other failure calculations by hand

* 5% R&amp;D - implementing new processes, finding new programs to use, new standards to adopt, making new scripting tools

I am gaining an invaluable amount of experience in mechanical design, manufacturing processes, and electrical design. However, I know that I want to get my Master's degree in the near future, and it makes sense, with my background, to strive to do a robotics program. Additionally, I keep feeling an innate desire to do more programming, and am pretty sure that if I could go back and do college over again, I'd study EECS, with a focus on programming. 

What is the most realistic path I can take to get a programming-centric job? I have a low undergrad GPA, and a mech-heavy job. My current plan is the following: I probably will try to apply to numerous big companies at the end of this year as some form of ME-- Google, Tesla, Microsoft, etc. If I don't get any of those jobs, I will probably keep working and aim to get into a Master's program. Does this make sense? In the meantime, what should I set my sights on in the future in terms of career focus? In a perfect world, I would love to be a hardcore coder at Google, but my programming skills are NOT at that level and are pretty basic. 

Sorry for the rambling, that's what years of no writing does to a person. Thank you all for your help :)

:--|:--
[Which libertarian predictions over the last 20 years were the least accurate? Which were the most accurate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2vhlbd/i_am_david_boaz_cato_institute_evp_and_author_of/cohpy1k?context=5)|Hmm, good question. Go back a bit more than 20 years, and you'd have to say we were right on the long-run prediction that communism would collapse, but not very good at realizing in the 80s that the collapse was imminent. Non-interventionists warned that U.S. intervention around the world, especially the Muslim world, might well lead to ""blowback"" and terrorism. Libertarians also predicted that debt and Federal Reserve money manipulation would cause an economic crash, but -- perhaps because we really don't have much faith in economic forecasting -- few of us called the timing in 2008. In re-reading the 1997 edition of my book, I was surprised to see how optimistic I was about school choice, given the poor state of public schools. They're still in poor shape, and yet 90 percent of parents still send their kids there.
[What would you say is the biggest misconception about the modern libertarian movement?  Also, probably the wrong place to ask, but what kind of employment opportunities exist at Cato for young, liberty minded individuals with a BA in Political Science? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2vhlbd/i_am_david_boaz_cato_institute_evp_and_author_of/cohpcme?context=5)|A lot of people see libertarianism as a brand of conservatism, as ""on the right."" We talk a lot about free-market economics, so that's understandable. But as I discuss in chapter 1, libertarians come out of classical liberalism. We're for human rights, toleration, religious freedom, etc. And today we work against war, police misconduct, crony capitalism, the drug war, gay marriage bans, and lots of other  things that might seem to put us on the left. Check our website for opportunities. We hire lots of interns and a few research assistants, video producers, etc.
[Do you see the Republican party as the place for the political manifestation of libertarianism/classical liberalism, or do you think the GOP will remain true to their conservative values in the next few election cycles?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2vhlbd/i_am_david_boaz_cato_institute_evp_and_author_of/cohpd6m?context=5)|That's a longstanding debate. Libertarians tended to be Democrats back in the days of Jefferson, Jackson, and Cleveland, Republicans in the FDR-Reagan era. What now? If Rand Paul runs for president, then I'd guess most libertarians will want to support his campaign. If he isn't the nominee, then our studies show that the libertarian vote can swing between parties. Also: not all politics is parties. Libertarians can get involved in tax-cut, school choice, term-limits, antiwar, and other social movements and initiatives.
[David, Thanks for taking the time to do this AMA.  What do you think Cato's role in the libertarian movement is?  And what would you suggest for young people looking to get involved in the liberty movement?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2vhlbd/i_am_david_boaz_cato_institute_evp_and_author_of/cohpl4a?context=5)|At Cato we try to apply libertarian analysis to current policy issues. I hope we're supplying high-quality policy analysis to members of Congress, the media, and interested people in all walks of life. I'm too modest to say more:-) Interested young people should join Students for Liberty and Young Americans for Liberty, check out the programs at www.theihs.org, and get some experience writing for the school newspaper, working in a political or issue campaign, other practical efforts.
[Big fan of the Pauls here, but I find their almost justification of anti-same sex marriage and pro-life very confusing and contrary to their normally libertarian feelings.  What are your thoughts on the topic?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2vhlbd/i_am_david_boaz_cato_institute_evp_and_author_of/cohqui8?context=5)|I think libertarians can and do differ on abortion. It's the role of government to protect life AND liberty. I can see both sides. Gay marriage is a tough issue for lots of people, especially older people. But there I do think that if the government offers a benefit or license, it should offer it on an equal basis. So I think they're wrong -- but not as wrong as most Republicans, who have tended to endorse a federal constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage.
[What do you believe the libertarian solution to curbing global warming would be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2vhlbd/i_am_david_boaz_cato_institute_evp_and_author_of/cohq15a?context=5)|The first question is whether there's a problem that needs a solution. Cato may be the only think tank with an actual climatologist on staff. Based on his analysis, I believe that the earth is warming, that it's partly manmade, but that it's not a serious problem. If that changed, then I would urge that we consider solutions (see page 323) that rely on markets, customary law, and science.
[Why do you think libertarianism has had challenges getting a foothold in Europe?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2vhlbd/i_am_david_boaz_cato_institute_evp_and_author_of/cohq5ga?context=5)|All the libertarians fled the ancien regime! Maybe only the statists stayed. But don't forget, Europe is a society of private property, markets, rule of law, human rights, and religious toleration. Not as much so as we'd like, but pretty good in hisotorcal context. And Students for Liberty is now drawing hundreds of students to multiple European conferences, so keep your fingers crossed.
[If elected President, will Rand Paul make the US more free? If not, is his campaign a risk for a libertarian future? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2vhlbd/i_am_david_boaz_cato_institute_evp_and_author_of/cohqdjp?context=5)|I think he'd move the country in a libertarian direction. He wouldn't make it Galt's Gulch. Of course, any president can disappoint his fans. They promise not to raise taxes, and then do. They promise not to abuse the power of the presidency, then do. I believe Rand Paul believes in liberty, so I feel reasonably confident about his intentions. But nothing is without risk.
[Mr. Boaz: Big fan, your speech at Cato University in 2007 was a huge inspiration in my formative collegiate years. In an increasingly binary political system, what can us young voters do now to make a dent in politics that seems to focus less on whether a government SHOULD do a thing, rather than one of two interpretations on HOW the government should do that thing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2vhlbd/i_am_david_boaz_cato_institute_evp_and_author_of/cohp7ww?context=5)|Thanks! Like I said, the first thing I want to do is make libertarian-leaning Americans KNOW that they lean libertarian and understand that they're not really part of the red team or the blue team. Then political organizers and candidates can try to organize them. But you're right, it's just so easy to see a problem and ask ""what should the government do about it?"" We just have to remind people that government programs tend to fail, and to cost money.
[For those of us that have read Politics of Freedom and Primer, give us the 30 second speech on why we should pick up your new book?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2vhlbd/i_am_david_boaz_cato_institute_evp_and_author_of/cohpal3?context=5)|The new book includes a lot of the core material on individualism, pluralism, law, and economics, updated with new numbers etc. But the chapters on policy and the parasite economy, and the first and last chapters are very different. New material on Bush and Obama, cronyism, inequality, terrorism, overcriminalization, etc.
[Thanks for doing this AMA! How would you explain Libertarianism to someone who is absolutely sick of both the Republican and Democratic parties? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2vhlbd/i_am_david_boaz_cato_institute_evp_and_author_of/cohq7u6?context=5)|In 2008 voters rejected the extreme social conservatism and the endless wars of the Republicans. In 2014 they rejected the bankrupt spending of the Democrats. If you dislike both those things, you just might be a libertarian. If you like lower taxes, social tolerance, and avoiding foreign wars, you just might be a libertarian. 
[What qualifications, experiences, and characteristics do you look for in your researchers and authors?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2vhlbd/i_am_david_boaz_cato_institute_evp_and_author_of/cohpv0f?context=5)|Knowledge of subject area, commitment to classical liberal/libertarian values, analytical ability, and a genuine interest in changing policy. Ideally we believe in qualifications, not credentials, but realistically college degrees and better yet advanced degrees are expected for policy scholars.
[I don't know if it's a ""libertarian moment"" or not, but some of the bigger public policy shifts of recent memory imply that Americans are getting at least slightly more libertarian -- same-sex marriage, marijuana legalization, the growing backlash against the surveillance/security state and police militarization, etc.  Do you think there's anything to the concept that we're getting somewhat more libertarian as a country, at least in terms of becoming more skeptical of the inherent goodness and capabilities of government?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2vhlbd/i_am_david_boaz_cato_institute_evp_and_author_of/cohqp1w?context=5)|Skepticism, even cynicism, about government is definitely growing. People think the government is inefficient and dishonest.And yet so many of them turn to government to give them stuff or ban things they don't like. Still, you're right about the recent shifts and battles moving in a libertarian direction. Nick Gillespie and Matt Welch put a lot of emphasis on cultural and technological changes that undermine all sorts of establishments and allow more diversity and flourishing.
[Elizabeth Bruening recently published some harsh criticisms of libertarianism on her New Republic blog. It's nothing really new, but one thing did catch my eye. She said that libertarianism is incompatible with Catholicism. I'm not sure of your religious background (if there is any\), but do you have any thoughts on this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2vhlbd/i_am_david_boaz_cato_institute_evp_and_author_of/cohqdkm?context=5)|I'm no expert on Catholicism, but I would say that Christianity sets moral standards for individuals. I don't see that it requires coercive actions by government. Christianity, in someone's view, may tell people to help the poor, avoid premarital sex, or whatever. But Jesus didn't say ""tell the government to help the poor with tax money."" He said you should help the poor.
[David,  What do you think is the key to social change? Public opinion? Political action? Influencing academia? Agorism? Something else? All of the above?  Thanks for doing this AMA and I hope to talk to you this weekend at ISFLC!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2vhlbd/i_am_david_boaz_cato_institute_evp_and_author_of/cohqsx4?context=5)|All of that. And who knows? Seriously, I think ideas are created, and some of them spread. Sometimes technology prompts change. Some changes only happen when political action happens, but what causes the political action? Social scientists don't seem to have definitive answers to these questions.
[Many prominent members of the Republican party have taken strong stances against reforming our immigration system, why do you think that the party of supposedly free enterprise is so against reforming a system that even they admit is broken? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2vhlbd/i_am_david_boaz_cato_institute_evp_and_author_of/cohqf5p?context=5)|Partly politics. They think the base of the party is anti-immigrant, though in fact polls show most Republicans want a reasonable solution. Partly they focus on the illegality of some immigration and are concerned about the rule of law. Partly they just forget their commitment to free enterprise when it comes to foreigners.

2vi3jr,2,2015-02-10,Feeling stressed about internship applications,lowgpaintern,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/2vi3jr/feeling_stressed_about_internship_applications/,"I'm upset about my academic performance and I feel as though it will hurt me as I'm right now applying to internships. 

I had a 3.6 gpa until last term where I failed my first signals course and got a C in my complex analysis class. My gpa sunk to a 3.3. I also have a D from another math class. 

I'm applying for some top companies, and well anyone that will take me as well. 

I'm a Junior EE, and I have some advanced coursework completed.

 As in:
I've taken 3 device physics courses (Fundamentals, QM for EE and Optoelectronics)

I've also taken a 2 courses in computer architecture and one in a digital design lab. I feel in arch that I've mastered the foundation material, as We've covered both Hennessy and Patterson books. I've completed a Verilog Processor, with an extended pipeline and advanced branch prediction. I'm working independently on adding OoO with an ROB and speculation right now with my group of 4 now that the class is over. 

I've been a student researcher for 2 years, with experience in semiconductor device characterization and fabrication. 

I've also taken two courses in embedded systems including work with RTOS and high performance (Dual core A9) embedded , and I'm working on the TI innovation challenge right now. 

I feel like that this is a good position to be in for a Junior, except for that low overall gpa. And the fact that I don't come from a top even 50 school for EE. 

I have really bad math grades (another F earlier in Diff Eq from Freshmen year that I repeated for a B+) and a D, F and C from recent classes. 


I'm hoping to get into Intel and Micron, (and a ton of other places I'm applying to) but I don't know if my gpa will end up screwing me over. 


This is my first internship experience I'm applying for.

Edit: 3.3
Thought I should add that I have independently studied from a Perl book a bit about perl, and taken the Linux course on EDX so I'm somewhat familiar with Unix systems. Only programming languages I know are Python from my intro, C from embedded systems and Java from OO design. "
2vi7ur,3,2015-02-11,I've been way too upset.,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2vi7ur/ive_been_way_too_upset/," Hi people on reddit. To be honest, I never thought I would never talk about this over here, but enough is enough. 
I'm looking for advice. Let me state that I feel very blessed for the life I live. I don't take for granted my health, or my family. With that being said let me get into it.

Four years ago I began college. I had a girlfriend who I loved very much, and friends who I couldn't be without. Throughout the years this all changed. My girl left me, and my friends are flakes. I'm about to graduate college, and I don't know what's next.

I am supposed to get a job, right? Well, I don't even know where to start. My internships all fell through, my minimum wage job can only get me so far. I produce music but I know that's just a hobby.. So I've been bugging out. How can I possibly move out of my house when I've got no plans for the future? I don't know what I want to do/ what I'm actually qualified for. College is odd.

My girl left me for another man. I thought this would spark a fire under my ass. Instead, a year later, I still think about her and regret my decisions.

My friends. Oh man, my friends. It's like they don't actually like me. I feel ignored and unappreciated. Meanwhile, I give everyone the utmost respect, attention, and thought. All they care about is the next high, or the next food stop. I don't actually think they consider me one of their better friends. I feel like they leave me out. I'm not trying to bitch, but it's the facts. It's right there in front of me. I am easily forgotten

I wake up, go to school, go to work, come home, eat, and sleep. I can't keep up with that. I'm losing my mind. I feel like I'm growing old and I'm only 21. I have no girlfriend to come home too, or a friend who just wants to chill out. It's running a toll on me. I become miserable and fall into a deep dark place.

It's kind of scary when you don't have a reason to get up in the morning. You never think that it would happen to you, depression, but when it does- you understand. I hope for a better tomorrow, but for years I have been running into the same wall.

I come here to ask... Well.. For your thoughts. It can be anything. I talk to my mother about my feelings but she can only know/say so much. 

I don't know if I can keep going this way. I feel so alone,and lost. I just want to be happy- not waking up upset. Not feeling betrayed. Not feeling depleated.

2vinx3,4,2015-02-11,Need advice! Consulting or working for real estate family business?,aerox11,consulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/2vinx3/need_advice_consulting_or_working_for_real_estate/,"Hi guys I need your advice.

I have to decide the next 2 months which way I go regarding my professional career.

First I want to introduce myself. I am 28 years old and I am graduating from a Top 10 Business School in Germany.

Before I studied I did an apprenticeship with 16 as an industrial salesman and worked 8 years for this company in Germany and Spain. After that I went to university and did 2 internships in consulting and one in a big telecommunication company.

Now I am unsure about my future and I want to ask you for advice. I have following options

**1.  I do my master’s degree**

Pro:

+  I will gain new experience and knowledge. Can go abroad for one year

Contra:

- I have the feeling that I didn’t learn much how to run a business. SO maybe studying two more years is waste of time and I will be 30 when I am done…

**2.  I will start working now in sales or in consulting and don’t do the masters**

Pro:

+ I earn “good” money and I can “travel”
+ Work in consulting was fun I liked the tasks
+ Maybe I will have the opportunity to work in a different country like Dubai or Sydney? I like vibrant big cities :)

Contra:

- in consulting I worked a lot. Around 60-70 hours. Never be at home before 9 pm… (No time for sports, friends…)
- I will be an employee and work for someone else. At least for the next 5 years.
- I am 28 or 30 when i am done with uni and start as a junior consultant. Other people will be already senior consultants with the same age. Nobody care in consulting about my past work experience.
Maybe my age is an disadvantage to get a high position?

**3. I start working for my parents company**

We have a real estate developing company with around 30-40 apartments).We build and sell/ rent houses/apartments.
The company is small (Brother, mother and my dad). But there are many opportunities in my opinion to increase the business.

Pro: 

+ I like to be my own boss and be independent
+ the business is very interesting and I can generate a passive income. (My brother has already 3 houses and generates an extra income)
+ The business ran quite well the last twenty years and I would say my parents are wealthy
+ parallel to the business i could trade and get more knowledge about trading, My dad and me are passionate with trading at the stock exchange. And I could start a second business (import / export )

Contra:

- I have no clue about real estate developing business and had to learn everything from the scratch
- At the beginning I would get much less salary from my parents compared to consulting
- Maybe it is difficult to work with the family?
- I would be in a small town in south Germany not in a vibrant city like Dubai. But I could move to Munich which is just 30 min away from home.
-And the biggest disadvantage: I have never really said to my parents that I want to work for their company. My parents don’t know that I would like to work for them.   

**During my study i never said to them what i want to do after graduation. I always said we will see but my parents also never asked me if I want to work for them**
(maybe because they know I like to travel and discover foreign countries…) 

My feeling says I should work for their company but on the other side I miss the beach and foreign countries. (Lived in Spain, USA and Australia).

I am also aware if I don’t start working now for my parents it will be too late.
My dad is 60 and will get retired in 5 years I think. Furthermore I have to gain a lot of knowledge in this business to be successful.

Please give me some thoughts because right now I am not sure what I shall do.

How shall I speak to my parents that I want to start at their company? 


Thanks"
2vj7th,2,2015-02-11,How to benchmark yourself in an SME/job?,ThrowawayUKJobhunter,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2vj7th/how_to_benchmark_yourself_in_an_smejob/,"Apologies if this comes off as a rant, i'm not sure what advice anyone could realistically give. Its been theraputic to type though.

Hi, Im 24 and currently work in the UK for a small SME. I'm basically the entire marketing division (encompassing design, idea generation, CRM, sales, the lot!) of the company which is basically just myself and the two directors and another couple of agents we work with. This is a position I've been in for a year now. Being an SME operating in a well established market (our competitors are HUGE compared to us) we're performing averagely/struggling despite our unique services. This is not helped by the fact that the directors have other businesses that is their priority and I feel do not really give me the support I need to do the job properly. I'm paid poorly on an internship level wage which I do not feel is enough to cover basically running the company myself, however we would not be profitable if I were to get a rise.

I should mention that I have won an award recognised by the local council (intern of the year for my region), which I felt good about for a while however I feel this was just due to my networking ability and the fact that my job is more complex than many of the competitors. I do not feel that my education background is great (shitty university) and I've attended a few interviews/applied for a few posts and not been successful. I've recently become a director of a local charity to further my CV (and its something I wanted to do!) however I still find myself getting auto discarded for marketing positions as everyone seems to have better experience. Even if i did get a marketing role I really do not feel confident in my abilities due to the struggles of working in an SME. I'm fed up of working alone (I'm in the office alone maybe 50% of the time including right now). I feel I have a lot to give but just feel a little bit down about this rut.


Thanks."

[Hi guys, do you think there's a difference in administering a psychedelic, during medical assisted therapy, in indoors from the outdoors? All the subjects go home by themselves at night? Thank you for helping those in need with all the 'weapons' available and beyond the frontiers of knowledge! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2vju7x/we_are_the_multidisciplinary_association_for/coiblay?context=5)|First, no, subjects in the PTSD studies have an overnight stay at the study site, and do not return until the next night, and people in the study of LSD-assisted psychotherapy for end of life anxiety also had an overnight stay at the study site. Subjects in the study of MDMA therapy in people on the autism spectrum with social anxiety do return from the site at night, either to their place of residence or if they live farther away, a nearby hotel.
 |You ask a good question about differences in setting, such as being indoors versus outdoors. So far, no one has approached researching setting directly. It is also possible that time of day might change an experience, but this has not been researched either.
 |Ilsa Jerome, Ph.D., Clinical Research and Information Specialist, MAPS Public Benefit Corporation.
 |Subjects in our study do spend the night at the study site. That is an integral part of our approach. We want people to take time out of their lives to focus on their issues and not be distracted. By spending the night and resting after the session they can stay focused on their experience and it facilitates their integration. We administer the MDMA during the day so that subjects can actually get some sleep that night. The next day we have a non-drug session so that the therapists and subject can work on integration and prepare the subject to return home.
 |All of our studies take place indoors, in a protected environment with music, a nearby bathroom, and necessary medical equipment. However, occasionally in the study sessions, we will take people for a walk outside, if they're feeling especially stuck. One of the best examples happened in the Israeli study a few years ago. This was someone who had PTSD for more than 40 years and during the session was having difficulty and wanted to walk around. The therapist agreed to walk around outside with the subject on the grounds of the mental health facility where the study was taking place. He felt grounded by touching the trees and being outdoors. When he returned inside he had a powerful breakthrough. What was remarkable was that when he was outside there were fighter airplanes overhead going to fight in Gaza. While we were on the ground helping someone heal from a prior war, a new war was being waged overhead. In a way this work sometimes feels futile but it makes this work so important to do.
 |There is a lot to be said about psychedelic experiences outside in nature. One of the most mystical experiences I've had was taking MDMA while camping right on the Pacific Coast, hearing the ocean. It was exquisite to be alone in nature feeling the full experiences of MDMA. Lots of other people have had It's terrific to be able to do that however it's especially important that you're either in a very safe place or with someone who is not doing drugs who is a mediator between you and the outside world. The circumstances in our study are designed for safety and protection and an opportunity to go inside and do deep work. Part of doing psychedelics is being open to the inner world which can make you vulnerable to all sorts of things that would happen in the outside world.

[How do you feel about the use of marijuana (through edibles or vaping, to avoid carcinogens from smoking\) during pregnancy and while breastfeeding? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2vju7x/we_are_the_multidisciplinary_association_for/coid6gg?context=5)|Currently in our marijuana study we exclude pregnant or nursing mothers due to insufficient data on effects of exposure in utero, on the basis that we don’t know if THC or CBD can make it past the placenta and we do know that THC can pass into breast milk. The scientific study of prenatal marijuana exposure and infant marijuana exposure has generated mixed results. Concerns range from low birth weight to behavioral and morphological (shape) abnormalities in brain development. However, many studies that have been conducted on mothers include both tobacco and marijuana smokers, or polydrug users using marijuana in addition to other drugs during pregnancy. Many of them focus on samples that come from disadvantaged backgrounds, which introduces bias in results from long-term studies in adolescents that look at IQ and cognitive function.
 |In contrast, a study published in 2014 in a sample of 396 mothers found that marijuana use during pregnancy was not related to late initiation of prenatal care, preterm deliveries, birth weight, or neonatal intensive care unit admissions (1). An ethnographic study published in 1994 on Jamaican mothers using marijuana to ease morning sickness found no difference between infants who had been exposed to marijuana (N=24) and those who hadn’t (N=20) in a matched sample (2). A 5 year follow-up on the same children found  no significant differences in developmental testing outcomes between children of marijuana-using and non-using mothers except at 30 days of age when the babies of users had more favourable scores on two clusters of the Brazelton Scales: autonomic stability and reflexes. The developmental scores at ages 4 and 5 years were significantly correlated to certain aspects of the home environment and to regularity of basic school (preschool) attendance (3), supporting the interpretation that socioeconomic status and other aspects of child-rearing are more important than marijuana exposure in determining functional outcomes. Ultimately, in the absence of data from a randomized, controlled clinical trial on prenatal marijuana exposure, it is up to the mother to review the existing data and decide on their own.

[I personally am starting by taking an undergrad in neuroscience. I'm gonna keep my eyes open for research / internship opportunities and move closer to MAPS headquarters once u have my degree and can afford it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2vju7x/we_are_the_multidisciplinary_association_for/coi9rsh?context=5)|I thought I’d chime in here since my only degree is a B.S. in Biopsychology and I graduated in May of 2014. Through my involvement with the Tufts chapter of Students for Sensible Drug Policy, I was guided to events where I had the wonderful opportunity to hear Rick Doblin speak. His words profoundly resonated with my own developing ideas about psychedelics and the state of mental health care in America and I decided in my Sophomore year that this was where I wanted to make my career. I applied to MAPS internships several times and got denied, rallied a few friends of mine to go to the Horizons: Perspectives on Psychedelics conference held annually in NYC, and mustered the cash to fly out to California and volunteer for MAPS’ own Psychedelic Science conference in 2013. I turned every paper I could into an opportunity to explore the existing work being done with psychedelics. When I applied for an internship again this year as I was graduating and was offered a full-time position, I was ecstatic to accept. However, if I hadn’t gotten the job, I want to believe that it wouldn’t have stopped me from pursuing work that matters to me.
 |I don’t at all think that an undergraduate degree in neuroscience is a waste of time if it’s what you feel called to study and you can make that work within the larger trajectory of what you want to accomplish. We have people here with advanced degrees from Stanford and Yale, and we have people working here that learned their craft without the aid of even an undergraduate degree. More than anything else, you should study something that fulfills you (of course it doesn’t hurt to acquire the practical skills necessary to delve into your dream projects after graduation and it also wouldn’t hurt to move closer to people doing the type of work you want to be involved in :)). My point is that you can guide the course of your study in the direction of what you actually care about and you can always pick up more skills down the road. The internet is a beautiful thing!
 |Your question as well as many other questions on here imply a desire to support our mission, a mission that is larger than our small organization. There are a great many more of you brilliant people than there are careers to be had at MAPS in particular and your voices are valuable and needed.
 |Allison Wilens, Clinical Study Assistant, MAPS Public Benefit Corporation.
[Is there going to be any specific research collating the psychedelic experience with Temporal Lobe/limbic Epilepsy ? Both seem to cause religious experiences. Will the studies be able to pinpoint the areas within the brain that allow us to have these transcendent experiences? Thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2vju7x/we_are_the_multidisciplinary_association_for/coibmlx?context=5)| In our clinical trials we are trying to optimize the therapeutic benefits so we are not taking people into brain scanners while they are under the influence of MDMA or LSD. However, we are planning one study to be conducted in England that would take people who are veterans with PTSD and put them under an fMRI while under the influence of MDMA. It is a one-session model to try to understand what happens acutely in the brain.
 |There have been studies with [MDMA](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10989265), LSD, and [psilocybin](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25563444) with healthy volunteers who have gone into brain scans during the experience. We do administer the mystical experience questionnaire to all of our subjects and have found that LSD study with subjects with anxiety related to end of life, there was a relationship between the depth of the mystical experience and therapeutic outcomes.
 |However, in our MDMA study there were a fair amount of people that did report mystical experiences, more than you might anticipate, but we found no correlation between the depth of the mystical experience and therapeutic outcomes. The explanation for that is that for PTSD, it's events that have occurred in a person's biography that have been traumatic and that continue to torment people. People seem able to work through that and become healed in the process that we are starting to think about in terms of memory reconsolidation. With people who are anxious about dying, the spiritual mystical experience can indeed be very helpful as part of the therapeutic process.
 |The link between temporal lobes, and temporal lobe epilepsy and mystical experiences, Dr. has found that he is able to produce certain mystical experiences through magnetic stimulation of the temporal lobes. Psilocybin reduces activity in the default mode network, though I'm not sure how this correlates to the temporal lobes. for those who really want to learn more about it, you could look at the [recent brain scan studies with psilocybin and MDMA](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4034428/).

Is it a variable in our biology or the compound itself? or both? keep up the amazing research!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2vju7x/we_are_the_multidisciplinary_association_for/coi9ydd?context=5)|This is a great and seemingly simple questions whose answer grows complex as you move closer to it.

I am also hoping that the internship (if I get one) would turn into a full-time gig after I graduate.
Is my resume too unconventional ? Does it lack anything ? Are the projects not good enough ? What would be my chances of getting an interview with the big 4 in tech? 

Any advice is appreciated.
Thanks! 

P.S. - Some information in the resume has been intentionally left authentic."

Help?",Orlijah66,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2vkl7j/im_struggling_with_a_very_complicated_toxic/,"I'll start this out with saying that I am haunted by this toxic friendship. Not a day goes by that I don't think and obsess over the outcome. My panic attacks are getting worse. It is so important to me that I handle this morally, for peace of mind when it's over.

**&lt;3 ily, potential advice givers.**

*Amber and I have been friends for about 8-9 years.* 

**Here are Amber's defining qualities to remember:**

- Amber is funny, quiet, pretty, sometimes sweet, and intelligent.

- Amber is deceitful, secretive, and mysterious.

- Amber is not honest, caring, or loving as a person.

- Amber is extremely defensive.

- Amber is extremely uptight and does not handle stress well. She has epic meltdowns when things get difficult.

- Amber does not like being asked to pay bills, rent, or anything owed.

- Amber is the most manipulative person I have ever met.

- Amber is not a secure person and therefore forms her identity by leeching others hobbies and interests. (i.e. I am vegetarian, she becomes vegetarian. I study graphic design, she studies graphic design. I like a band, she LOVES said band, etc. She collects these from everyone she knows.)

- Amber can only have one best friend at a time and therefore will unfriend without notice when she meets someone new. She hurts others with abandon. She comes back when she decides she needs you and acts like nothing happened. Que manipulation.

- Amber is incapable of showing appreciation for things people do for her. 'Thank you' is something she never says, no matter the magnitude of what you've done to help her. She takes advantage of everyone close to her.

- Amber does not make friends easily and does not keep friends easily. Leaving her with a handful total.

**Backstory:** 

I met Amber in high school through my best friend's boyfriend, who also happened to be my boyfriend's (Jack's) best friend (confusing and complicated, I know, but vital to the story). She skirted on the outside of our very close group of friends for years, dating a few, causing some mild issues that have become rather indicative of who she is. High school stuff.


I reached out as I graduated, attempting to be her friend as Jack moved to Boston for school and her brother and my best friend went to college together out of state. She was alarmingly close to her brother at the time, so it was natural that she would develop feelings for Jack. It was kind of awkward between us because of this and I feel like our friendship was forced. We weren't close at first, but I wanted to be. I was always looking for that fairy tale, best bud, companion type friend and I thought that we could eventually reach that point.


In 2009 I struggled through one year of community college and eventually decided it was time to join Jack in Boston where he was attending school. So I picked up and moved the 1600 miles north from Tulsa that fall. Jack and I had been having some trouble because of the distance and I had become increasingly aware that the key to my happiness was to join him. We were on and off after he moved, and during that time he had sort of created a relationship with Amber. It wasn't serious, but it created a sexual tension that has plagued all of us since. 


Amber came to live with us a year later to join me at my university (Fall 2010). I had some reservations about it, but she was so excited and so interested in experiencing a new city that I couldn't say no. I didn't have too much of a reason to be concerned at the time. I found out very quickly that being friends with Amber was thankless and oddly unsatisfying, as if I were giving more than I was getting. Friendships are extremely important to me, and I have a tendency to be kind of affectionate (not physically, just overall) with those close to me, so I disregarded my doubt. Amber seemed to want to be close, so I kept trying despite noticing her dependency on others, her almost chronic need to take advantage of those close to her.   


The real trouble started during her second year of school. We had moved into a new place, and I was finishing up my last year (year round program, so I finished in 3 years). Toward the end of fall 2011, Amber found out that her parents did not qualify for another Plus loan. I had struggled personally every year to get any kind of funding, and I did not have a parents help, so I tried very hard to help her work this out. She had so many options that she refused to consider, which made me suspicious. But at the time things were fine, she was a terrible roommate but our friendship was okay. Jack had asked me to marry him that fall, and one night while very drunk, I made the foolish decision to ask her to be my maid of honor.


When she purchased a ticket for Jennifer, her childhood friend, to come visit us, it became clear why she was refusing help with school loans. Jennifer was the worst kind of asshole. She hated Boston, and she complained the whole time she was there about everything.  Jennifer and Amber treated me and my roommates like total garbage that week. Amber was never very good at paying her bills, choosing to spend that money on shopping instead. In general, if Amber was asked to pay or clean something, she threw a fit. This behavior was exacerbated when Jennifer visited. They were very destructive that week, talking bad about me loudly in the hallway, screaming at our awesome roommate when he asked for the 2 months of unpaid bill money she owed, making huge messes, asking me to take them to see different places in Boston yet inexplicably ignoring me the whole time. It was *ODD*.


They went back to Tulsa when the week ended for Christmas break, and when we returned Amber had decided to hate Boston too. She refused more funding for school and dropped out. She got a part time job with the intention of moving home after our lease was up in September. Living with her became a nightmare. She couldn't afford rent with her part time job, so we had to take on another roommate in our already cramped, three bedroom apartment. Jack and I had to move into the living room. She eventually decided, about two months later, that she still couldn't take the financial stress and that she would move back home. Our agreement was that she would at least pay her part of her rent while living and working in inexpensive Tulsa to prevent breaking the lease, this was enforced by her father who was her cosigner. 


One of the worst nights of my life was her going away party. We had gotten very drunk, there weren't a lot of people there because Amber made only one friend during her time in Boston. We were having a fun, lighthearted discussion when she revealed that she had kissed Jack before. I was a little shocked and asked him about it immediately, expecting a funny story. I should mention that Jack is a great guy. He is all good looks, talent, and good intentions (with the biggest heart). He has never regretted anything more than this. According to him, during my first Christmas break back home after moving to Boston in 2009, while at a friend's NYE party I had gotten too drunk and was put in a bedroom to sleep. Amber and Jack slept next to each other in the living room with everyone else, and hooked up while the others slept. Not sex, but close. They had kept it a secret for three years. What I found most infuriating is that they should have told me before Amber moved across the country to live with us. Jack chose not to tell me when I was thinking about asking her to be my maid of honor. This whole situation, everything could have been prevented if they had just told me what they did.


That summer was hell and Amber was Satan. She had moved back home and was paying her rent share kicking and screaming. Her dad knew she would try to get out of it, it was thanks to him that we made it until September. Multiple times she called Jack, SCREAMING like I had never heard before, trying to convince us she didn't need to pay rent. I was so angry and heartbroken. Jack and I had repaired things, but I was having trouble trusting him. This was until around August when Amber called me in tears, saying that Jennifer had been terrible to her and they weren't friends anymore. She called me to confide in me and repair our friendship, this was really abnormal behavior. I hate to say that it worked, I am a sucker for being needed. I was so happy that we could put it all behind us, because it hurt too much to keep thinking about. Plus, I still hadn't worked up the courage to remove her as my MOH. I just wanted a best friend and she was saying all the right things.


**Fast forward:** 

Jack and I were married fall 2012. Amber was an abysmal MOH, it's not quite in her nature to do things for others but she tried and I appreciated it. Our friendship was okay for a while but we were growing apart. I struggled letting go of what had happened in Boston, though not openly. I never ever wanted to move back to Tulsa, but due to an unfortunate family situation I had no choice. This left me extremely depressed for about two years. Amber slowly stopped talking to me, I was a lot less fun when I was miserable. Amber's behavior became repetitive. She'd grow close with someone, break their heart, and decide she didn't need them anymore. Months later she'd change her mind and decide to miss them, and come back. She inadvertently toyed with all of us. Every time she would say all the right things and I'd fall right back into her weird fucking trap.


**Early 2014:** 

Amber suddenly comes back into my life, after months of living with a different best friend. She has met someone and after four months they have decided to get married. She asks me to be her maid of honor claiming, ""I couldn't imagine anyone but you."" I was wary, I forced her to talk to me openly and honestly about our friendship. I requested consistency, honesty, love, and companionship and she agreed to all of it. Her new fiance is a super sweet guy, I thought he had changed her. She was different and I was thrilled. As the summer came to a close, I noticed that our friendship was not working out exactly as she promised.

It was after I threw Amber a (rather expensive) engagement party that I found out what she had done to her friend Heather. Heather contacted me after the engagement party and tore me a new one. Apparently Amber had moved in with her the previous fall with her fiance, treated her like shit (surprise), created hell in Heather's marriage, and the kicker: she had asked Heather to be her maid of honor. It turns out that Amber never told Heather that she had changed her mind and I was now her MOH. Amber made Heather help her move into a new apartment and stopped talking to her for months (without thanking her, surprise). And out of nowhere Heather had received an invite from me to Amber's engagement party. Heather. Was. Pissed. And Amber had lied to me *again*. Heather and I ended up bonding over shared trauma from Amber, realizing that Amber had always purposefully and obviously tried to keep her friends from hanging out or talking or even meeting.

I realized that I was an idiot and that I never should have trusted her. I never told her that Heather and I had spoken, so she has no idea that I know what she did to Heather. So I stopped deliberately contacting her. Amber never, ever initiates communication with me and never tries to hang out, so I haven't seen her since. 

**Here is my problem:**

- I found the best bud companion I had always wanted upon moving back to Tulsa, Beth is always there for me and says thank you when I do things for her and hugs me and makes me laugh. Amber doesn't like her, naturally. 

- Beth's boyfriend and I go way back, he was part of our group of friends in HS. He got an internship in Portland summer 2014, coincidentally where Jack and I were looking to move already. Amber knew we were interested in moving there, so when the four of us took a trip to Portland to move Beth's bf in, she tried very hard to go with us. (Over all four of our dead bodies would we let that happen, she has a terrible history with road trips.)

- Upon returning, Amber grilled me to see if we had decided to move (we told her IDK yet), she claimed she wanted to move anywhere we were moving because she couldn't imagine not living with us. Apparently she now remembers her Boston experience rather fondly. I understand her now though, she is leeching (as she does) and very obnoxiously using me to get out of our home town. I am desperate to see that this does not happen, I need to get away from Amber. She is toxic and she destroys my self esteem. 

- Beth's BF got a job offer starting June 2015 in Portland, so Jack and I have have decided to not miss this incredible opportunity and are moving with him. *We still have not told anyone.*

- Amber's wedding is in October 2015. I have barely spoken to her since October 2014 and from what I can tell I am still her MOH. 

- Jack and I are still kind of close with her brother, who married my HS best friend. I am worried that if I drop out of the wedding they will think I'm a horrible, cruel person and I will have ruined a 12 year friendship with them and their families. That's a nightmare to me, I would hate carrying around the knowledge that I had hurt them.

- If I don't end my friendship with Amber by June 2015 and if I fly back for her wedding, I am worried she will decide to move to Portland, thinking we are still friends. I really don't want to continue pretending she didn't hurt me repeatedly, over and over. I don't want to pretend everything is okay.



 **How do I get out of this wedding without burning bridges and hurting anyone? How do I move to Portland without fear of her moving there too? What is the RIGHT thing to do? Am I being cruel? Should I continue being friends with Amber and learn to accept her faults?**"

I'm currently getting my Master's in SpEd along with my teaching certifications, and I'm at a bit of a crossroads. In my program, we can skip student teaching and do a year-long internship where we teach as the teacher of record in a school and receive full benefits and pay. I have the option to do either, but I'm concerned about which one is best for me.

Financially, obviously the internship is better, as the opportunity cost of not being paid for six months works out to about 25K. I can get student loans to make up for it (I'll have to take a night class in order to keep my full-time status), but I'd prefer not to take on debt if I don't have to. 

On the other hand, I've never taught before, and I'm terrified of walking into a classroom on the first day of next school year and having no idea what to do. I'm doing my practicum right now, where I spend six hours a week in a life skills classroom, but that's nowhere near the same as being the teacher of record.

I'm also concerned about the possibility of finding a job. I'll be student teaching in the fall, and it seems like there won't be very many job openings for the spring.

So, did you guys find student teaching helpful enough to make up for the opportunity cost? If you could have skipped it and gone straight to teaching as the teacher of record, would you?"

&gt;Advertisement on switch, possible hack  
&gt;When I log in to $switch$ I get an advertisement for 'Procurve' instead of the normal message. Have we been hacked?

Had a good laugh and closed it.

Explanation: if you're familiar with switches, you know that they can be configured to display a 'message of the day' (motd) upon logging in that typically displays between entering the username and password.

Cue the intern, as I'll call him here. He's a good kid who really wants to learn, but some times I wonder if all the neurons are firing in the same direction...

He was supposed to check our environment if anything was still pointing to the old Radius server, so he's going through our switches and routers to check. Apparently he had never seen the default motd banner for this particular line of switches before, as most of our switches &amp; routers are configured to display the same text, some semi-legal blurb along the lines of 'this is a private system, unauthorised use can result in penalties'. However, it turns out that some of them are lacking this little line of config for some reason.

One explanation later and now Intern is also aware of this."

I am a soon to be new graduate whose initial plan was to do my masters immediately following my undergrad. I have specific interests within CS (distributed computing) that I thought would be best served by going to graduate school before starting work. So I applied to a bunch of schools back in the fall, and while I was waiting for responses I applied to just one job, a software engineer position at one of the Big 4. I had previously been rejected for internships from almost all of them so I was not optimistic. Somehow I got the job, decided to forego graduate school due to my interest in the team/project, and was planning on reapplying. However, another huge surprise came in the form of an offer of admission from an Ivy League school whose CS program is ranked in the top 10, WITH full funding which is quite rare for an MS. So, my question is, which path would you guys choose and for what reason?

TLDR: Intended to do MS immediately following undergrad, sent off applications, applied for cool job, got cool job, got better than expected offers of admission for graduate school, now stuck."

2vo687,1,2015-02-12,Trying to get my life together... Again... Looking for some encouraging words. (Long),[deleted],ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/2vo687/trying_to_get_my_life_together_again_looking_for/,"This is going to sound like a first world problems rant, but everyone's got their own shit to deal with.

I go through bouts of self reflection every few years, and the last few weeks have been a doozy.  As a little background on me, I was the typical ADHD-PI undiagnosed kid who was too smart to show the signs until it was too late.

It started in 1st grade when I would constantly forget to put my name on my papers before I turned them in.  It baffled my parents, and they (with the help of my teacher, Mr. Littel, who will always be one of my favorites for this) set up a system where I would get an action figure for every x number of papers I turned in with my name on it.  Let me tell you, getting Iron Man was some good incentive there.

I cruised through grades 1-7 with almost no effort.  I was constantly moving, and was making new friends every 2 years, and seeing new places, and life was great.  Finally, in grade 8, it caught up with me, and I got into a sneaky downward spiral of not completing projects and just putting them off for the first half of the year.  I almost got my first, and only F, in a class.  The experience of having your parents empty out your backpack only to find half completed papers that were never turned in...  The shame of it kept me from falling into that trap again.  There was legitimate fear there that everyone in the world would forever feel that disappointment that I saw in their faces as they kept pulling paper after paper with no teacher markings on it.  No grades.  If I couldn't do my best, why even turn it in?

Fast forward through the awkward HS years.  I graduated with an A- average.  Got into my first choice of college and proceeded to fail miserably.  I couldn't get up, couldn't go to class, couldn't concentrate on studying.  Then I found my major.  It was a combination of business and art, and I got to work with my hands, learn all kinds of new things, and I had a talent for it!  I succeeded!  I graduated with an eventual 3.6 from college after my grades were at a low point of 1.8!  Sheer force of will to rectify my situation pulled me through to enter the job market... in 2009.  Lowest point of the recession.  Entry level jobs were being taken by people with 5-10 years of experience.  I had to take an unpaid internship and work reception at a gym for 12 hours a day just to pay rent.  I did it though.  I moved from the gym to a wine sales job, and did design on the side for a couple of years, then I got a job as a design engineer!  Not exactly what I went to school for, but it was an actual career move!  I was pushing through it all, making a career, and getting myself into a respectable position.  Ironic, because I failed out of engineering classes.

Then I got another DE job, and things got intense.  juggling 11 projects at once with intricate detailed requirements just got too much.  I started falling a little behind and the same pattern reasserted itself.  If I couldn't do it to the best of my abilities, why even try?  I started hiding mistakes, and it caught up with me.  I had a bit of a breakdown and couldn't figure out what was wrong with me.  My gf, a teacher, joked and said I might have ADHD.  That was when I first started looking at this sub.  I found a therapist.  I talked.  He talked.

I took a test (substituting ""Boss"" for ""Parent"" and ""Job"" for ""Schoolwork,"" etc.).  He told me that I scored about as high as anyone can score on both hyperactive and inattentive.  I got a prescription.  Holy shit I can function as a human!  It only took 27 years!

Now I'm actually doing really well, considering.  I've tripled my salary in the 5 years since school (mostly while off of meds!), but that's not the only measure of success, trust me.  I'm tired of the constant attention to details.  I don't care how many threads are in the screw that I'm speccing out, or what size tube is optimal.  This isn't what I want to do.  Everything so far is a story of how someone can adapt to their surroundings through force of will, not how someone can succeed by doing what they know they love and have a talent for.  I want that story.  So now I have to re-create a portfolio, and use skills that have atrophied, and it's nothing like I remember.

I have no grades to motivate me.  No teacher asking to look at my progress every week.  I don't have a group of people all working on the same thing to get me motivated, or to run ideas off of.  I have my family's support, but when I ask for help, I don't know how to ask for the right things.  I need someone to tell me that I can do it, that I just need to start, not tell me what I need to do, and remind me of what I'm not doing.

I feel like I'm getting a little livejournal-ey, now.  I know that a lot of people on this sub are just figuring out that they have a problem, or are happy with their successes and want to share, but everyone needs a little push to keep going when you've hit the point in the middle, where it's easy to settle for comfortable.  The middle is hard to let go of, because you can't ever go back to how it was once you know what you're capable of missing, and it takes so much to go further.  It's time to push myself again.

Edit:
TL;DR - I go through cycles of self discovery where I rehash all of my issues, and in the latest round, I'm looking for someone to tell me that I'm better than my current state of affairs, and I have proven that I have it in me to change myself."

I am currently working full-time, and interning to finish up my graduate degree in School Counseling. In the fall, I will quit my job to finish my internship by the end of the year. I will graduate in December, when the majority of jobs that open up in my field will be long term sub positions (or outside of school counseling entirely). 

My thoughts are that the time beteween December and August (when I could start at a new school as (hopefully) a full time counselor) would be the ideal time to have a baby. Any job I get during that time will be temporary, so it could instead be a good time to have a baby and bond for a few months. 

The husband thinks that money situation will be too hard (and I fully acknowledge that it will be tough during the time that we don't have my salary). He believes it will be better to wait until I get a permanent job in the fall, and then going for baby. I'm really worried about being pregnant my first year, because I don't think I'll be eligible for benefits and I'm worried that I won't have my contract renewed if I have to take time off for the baby.

I don't know how professional it would be, or if it would impact my career, to have a baby during my first year counseling. I don't know how crazy it would be the have a baby immediately after graduating with a Masters and unemployed. I just want some unbiased thoughts. "

After my internship i really felt that i want to work. So when the opportunity arrose i went and applied for an inside sales position. Sales had always been a passion of mine and this particular job is close to my home and offers a really Nice wage.
Now they already said they want to hire me and after test working there for a day i think i want to work there too..
However i will have to finish my bachelor in my free hours which will be really though.
Ive been thinking alot about what to do and i cant figure it out. One of the arguments i het from friends and family is that they think i might postpone my study so much that i wont finish it at all. But With my current motivation that will probably happen anyway, or it will take longer at least.

Am I an asshole?",heepofsheep,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2vr68x/i_left_my_old_company_less_than_a_year_ago_and/,"Ok so this company took me on as an intern. I was already graduated at that point, but I learned a lot in that position. This company also happened to be the biggest entity in the industry in a sort of weird shadowy way. 

Anyway when my internship was ending I did a sort of weird side shift to another position in a sister organization and my boss didn't want to let me go (even though he was going to before he learned I was going to the ""other side"") 

So I did a 50/50 split with my time with this new group and his.... he still paid be the same rate as I made as an intern. It was a generous amount, but living in an expensive city it really wasn't that much. After my leverage position ended due to external factors I came back to his group.... he continued to pay the the same rate as I made as an intern but also gave me some opportunities for higher day rates here and there. 

Towards the end of the first 12 months I was there, it totally became pretty apparent I was contributing a lot of work and being compensated a very, very minuscule amount. During this whole period I was a freelancer and during a period they didn't bring me in for 2 weeks. I panicked and started digging deep and found much better paying jobs in the main city where our industry is located. 

So without much thought I left with a 2 weeks notice and that was that. They were on the whole... not.... joyful that I left, but were happy that I was on to better things I guess. The first reactions I got were usually, ""shit fuck you're leaving?""..... 

Now after 6 months of being gone I sort of feel guilty. Without that position I wouldn't have the skills, knowledge, or the experience to be where I am now. In a lot of ways I was vastly underpaid, but I had the freedom and power to do a lot of things I can't do now. 

I panicked after not working for two weeks and I jumped ship I guess.... I don't have any regrets, but I feel like I used them up and spit them out in sort of a way. There also one of the most hated companies in the the country at the moment, so I don't think anyone would take much sympathy... "

The easiest way to get in contact with me would be to send a PM or leave a comment here.

**What can I do?** 

My professional background mainly consist of 1-2 years of quality assurance work using Python, Ruby, Chef, and Selenium. I also have experience with wordpress, HTML5, CSS and C. I've been exposed to Django, Ruby on Rails, and am very interested in functional programming.

Outside of computer science topics I have done customer support and some volunteer community management. I speak a little french and am practicing everyday. I am open to learning just about any an everything.

**What am I looking for?**

I've always liked apprenticeships or internships for people who aren't in college. Ideally, I would like to work in a junior or apprenticeship position(preferably paid) doing software engineering or embedded programming. However, I'm really just looking for anything interesting that will let me learn something new and preferably make some money. For example, need a hotel/hostel worker who works for a bed? Let me know I might be interested. I would prefer to work remotely however I am open to relocation staying in the US if possible.

**Why am I a dropout?**

I have very strong opinions about college and education in general. I don't like the way students are being taught and the way the educational system is setup. After doing some hard thinking I realized it would be very hypocritical of me to just conform and remain in college while I feel this way so I left.

**Not in college? What am I doing then?**

Just because I'm not in college doesn't mean I'm not learning. I'm currently taking  classes from Texas A&amp;M in Cyber security, engineering classes from Coursera, and programming classes from edX. During my down time I learn French and am currently working on memorizing Japanese kana.

I appreciate you taking the time to read this whether or not you reach out to me. Thanks."

I had not anticipated that they would ask me logic puzzles during the interview (this is a computer science related internship) and so I was a little off my game.

The guys that were interviewing me soon traded off to a lady who was mid 20's and a guy who seemed to be in his late 30's. They were a lot more approachable than the other two so I began getting a little more comfortable. They asked me my interests and what I do in my spare time. I answered with things like swimming, biking, and riding my unicycle. The unicycle part stood out and they seemed interested in it but continued on with the normal interview.

Towards the end of the interview they opened the floor to me to ask them questions. We eventually just asking off topic questions back and forth when the guy asked me: ""I have to ask, what's up with the unicycle?"" To which I replied: ""My parents bought it for me one Christmas as a joke and I picked it up pretty quickly.""

The lady asked me: ""Would you ride your unicycle to work every day?""

Without thinking, the words: ""If I get the job, I'll ride whatever you want me to ride"" tumbled out of my mouth.

I did not realize what I had said until they both started laughing hysterically and the guy said ""we won't take it that far!"" My face turned bright red and I couldn't help but to laugh with them. I am currently waiting on a call back from them hoping that they will forgive me for my word vomit.

TL;DR: I accidentally offered to ""ride"" my potential boss in an effort to land an internship.

EDIT: I would just like to announce that I now have the job :) Thank you to everyone for the kind words.  Not too much of a FU after all."

I do intend on finishing a 4-year degree in Math or CS, but the soonest I could start would be next January.

Undergrad is in Mechanical Engineering. I'm studying for the GMAT and targeting a full-time MBA in 3-5 years, goal of getting in to an M7 school. My firm's education benefit isn't great but not terrible, pays out a reasonable fixed amount annually regardless of degree (as long as it's relevant to my work) which would cover most of a part-time M.S. assuming no financial assistance. I'm staying in the same city as my alma mater and have great connections in a few grad programs with them, plus a few other good schools nearby with solid options.

I'm not completely sure what sector/area of consulting I plan to focus on long term so I'm hoping to improve my knowledge and boost my credentials for MBA applications while keeping my options relatively open. If I had to pick something now I'd be shooting for management consulting at an MBB firm following my MBA. Here's the options I've though of so far but I'm open to suggestions.

* **MS Mechanical Engineering**. Highest chance of acceptance as well as receiving a decent amount of financial aid. Could start as soon as Jan. 2016 if accepted. This builds my technical credentials but I'm worried it will take me down a more specific path than I wish to pursue. Can transfer in 6 credits out of 12 grad credits and retake the other 6 in 2 classes I've completed and excelled in.
* **MS Computer Science/Engineering**. Decent chance of acceptance at my alma mater but I'd have to complete about 12 credits of prerequisites first.
* **MS Finance**. Need 12 credits of prereqs.
* **MS Business Analytics**. No prereqs.
* **MS Information Systems Technology**. No prereqs.
* **MS Applied Mathematics**. No prereqs + 6 transferrable credits.

I'm leaning towards Finance or Business Analytics (if I can get in). I feel like I'm in pretty good shape to be competitive, I'm taking GRE/GMAT in April and anticipate performing solidly in the 90th+ percentile. Undergrad GPA will be 3.1-3.2 with varsity athletics, continuous part time work and internship experience, plus major leadership positions in a couple extracurriculars.

I'm hoping to narrow down in the next few weeks to 3 options to research in dept and apply to. Any thoughts on which direction to pursue? Thanks!

I knew going in that there was not much of a job market with either degree, but I enjoyed learning about all Asian cultures/languages/etc. It was something I was good at and thoroughly enjoyed (and the professors were amazing).  

I had been leaning on the idea of teaching English in Japan for a few years, to get teaching experience (since I thought that it would be a viable career option), on top of making connections in Japan with the possibility of landing another job there.  However, I didn't make the interview rounds with JET, Interac was too expensive to even start, and the other companies seemed to be more of a business run school compared to actually teaching.  I was driving with the blinders on.  Of course they are a business, they need to make money.  So I decided that teaching English is a no-go, for now.

My dream job is to work for a video game localization company, like XSEEDS or Aksys Games.  However, all of these types of companies are very small and I don't have most of the necessary requirements to even apply. Most of them aren't even hiring.  Or working with a manga/anime publishing company.  Something related to Japan, since that was my area of focus.  I have a JLPT (Japanese language placement test) level 4, borderline level 3, so Japanese fluency is still a ways off.    

I have been applying to many jobs not even related to my field, and I have received about 3-5% call backs/interviews, but never have been offered a job.  I have warehousing/logistic experience, managerial experience, and customer service experience.  But none of them long enough to be considered experience to full-time employers.  I had an interview with a manga publishing company, however, they are only taking unpaid interns with no guarantee of full employment afterward.

I was thinking about attending a JC in the Fall to start taking Computer Science courses, however, I am terrible at math.  I even struggled with college algebra.  I know for a fact that upper division math is going to be painful, but I don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to take classes and eventually a major that I know are going to be rough, makes it seem like a big waste of money if I drop out of the major (which seems to be like my 2 B.A.'s).

So where do I go from here? None of my dream job companies are hiring.  I don't have the experience they are looking for and some of the requirements I don't have. Any advice would be appreciated.   "

I've been applying for internships and I applied to Citi's Summer Technology Analyst Program. The internship opportunity popped up through my university career website. I have an interview with them next week. My dilemma is that I am a computer engineer so I know about both hardware and software but I dont know either as masterful as an electrical engineer or a computer science student would so I am really scared of what the interview questions will be. 

Part of the job description for this position mentions ""Knowledge of C#, .Net, Java, Closure, SQL, or any other related languages""

And  the Application Developer track mentions ""Candidates should have a fundamental understanding of current programming, multi-threading, and familiarity with basic concepts of relational databases. Working knowledge of either C# or Java should be demonstrated to design and build technology software solutions to meet business requirements.""

Basically I know mostly C and a little bit of C++ through coursework and looked at python tutorials last summer. Im mainly familiar with low level/embedded programming so I know nothing about high level database stuff but apparently Im qualified enough to get an interview. 

Besides low level programming I was really good at my Data Structures class (I kinda loved it actually) so if they ask stuff about data structures I think I should be fine but stuff about relational databases or C# or java I dont know anything about. Is there anything that I could do to prepare??? Or am I pretty much doomed lol. This is pretty much gonna be my first real programming interview"

My grades in 125 and 173 are As but my overall gpa is pretty poor, just shy of 3 at 2.97, mainly due to struggling with time management and study habits. In the process of addressing these problems, taking 225 right now and it's going as well as it can for three weeks in.

I'm working smarter this semester, should be able to raise my GPA to 3.2 but I know that isn't high enough for Eng. CS so I've pretty much given up on that. 
I was interested in CS/Stats but reading through the recent influx of transfer posts it's looking like that won't be a possibility either. I'm simply not competitive. 
I'm worried what will I do when I can't get in? At this point, CS is the only thing I want to do, the only thing I've really liked, but transferring to another school to do CS isn't an option due to my gpa and being instate. I'm already a sophomore and most of my classmates have been going to career fairs, getting internships, doing amazing things, but honestly because my resume is bare, because I've barely made any progress in my current major, I can't get anywhere. I feel like such a fraud too, going to career fairs and networking events as my current major when my heart isn’t in it (and it probably shows), yet being unable to sincerely talk about CS since it’s not my major and I won’t get in anyways. So much time is slipping by me and I don't know what to do. I feel like I’ll have wasted an entire year at the end when I do try to transfer and end up with nothing.. what do I do at the end of the year? I don't want to continue with my major as I honestly don't have any feeling towards it, and the principle of doing something I don't love but have to is awful. But I have to face the reality. I only have two years left and I’ve done nothing but waste my parents’ money. I’m not literally failing college, but I feel like I am..I don’t belong and I don’t even have a single friend.

Talked to an advisor in LAS and she ended up suggesting sociology. Planning to talk to a CS advisor on Monday but expecting to hear the same gloom speech I've been telling myself for the last month. So what can I do besides get the best gpa I can and cross my fingers? What do you suggest I do right now to make the most of my situation? Any good major ideas? I'm just completely panicked and trying to funnel that into something productive instead. Thank you...

* I'm hoping to make $60,000+ within 1 year of graduation, but $50,000 would be fine starting out. I'd prefer to work at a medium-sized start-up than a big company.

What would you recommend as jobs I might consider? I have been looking at ""data analyst"", ""marketing analyst"", and ""product analyst"" listings but am open to any suggestions! 

Thank you!

2vw25c,2,2015-02-14,DaVinci Institute thoughts?,bullfisher,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2vw25c/davinci_institute_thoughts/,"I have applied for the Ruby on Rails 13-week bootcamp at DaVinci Institute and am waiting for the interview to see if I am selected.  Although it is not nearly as expensive as other bootcamps, it is still $6,000 that I don't have and I'm wondering if it's worth it.  I have been learning on my own, mostly, for the past year (HTML, CSS, and JS) and don't feel like I've gotten very far.  I can make simple static websites and still struggle with the basics of JavaScript. I had *zero* computer experience and even less programming experience at the beginning and although I know a lot more than I did to start with, I feel like I should know more than I do.  I also attended a front-end bootcamp but that seemed to be more lecture based watch-how-I-did-this than us actually coding, so I am even more hesitant about spending $6K if it will be similar.  My goal is to be ready for an internship or jr dev position by the end of summer.  The main reason I want to do the bootcamp is because soon my kids will be out of school for the summer and I'm afraid I will not be able to have a block of time devoted to studying unless I attend a class.  

Which brings me to my main point: has anyone gone through the DaVinci Institute or know of someone that did?  If so, please tell me your honest thoughts on how well prepared you felt for a jr dev position upon completion or any other info about the program.  Thanks!"

First of all I am a 23 year old from the United States and I currently hold a Bachelor's of Science in Electrical Engineering.

So, I am in a pretty okay college in a flyover state with a decent EE graduate program. I am currently employed as a research assistant at the university. I am working on writing my thesis for my Master's Degree right now and the project I did isn't showing as much promising results as I initially hoped. If I want to graduate this spring, I'm going to have to get everything done and turned in by March 20th.

I would like to think my wide range of experience in my field would play to my advantage in getting hired. Hell I've done everything from computational electrodynamics VLSI design at this point. I have a ton of both programming and hands-on experience in Matlab, FORTRAN, C, Verilog. Hell, if it's in my field, you name it and I probably have had experience with it.

So here is the meat of the problem:

I would rather not share the details of the 'why' but the long and short of my issue is that I need to get a job in Germany somehow. I'm not in trouble with the US government or any investigation agencies or something like that, but I am trying to move to Hamburg by at least late April of this year for personal reasons.

All things considered, integrating to Germany won't be a problem. I speak German on a basic level and I have people close to me I can at least live with until I get my job situation under control.

That being said, I'm facing a few dilemmas here: The only professional experience outside of being a researcher was being in IT as a web developer for a few years during my undergraduate years. For whatever reason, I could never seem to land an internship anywhere despite getting called in for interviews a lot.

Due to my frustrating experience in previous years, I'm having an endless amount of anxiety about just applying for a job in general let alone one that's in another country.

I don't even know where to start to look for jobs in Hamburg or elsewhere in Germany. NXP Semiconductor looks promising and I've applied for a few positions there, but I have no hook so far. The other place that seemed promising is DESY and I am looking into applying for them too.

In between all of this I'm still working on writing my thesis and I'm actually having a hard time doing both because I'm really lazy when it comes to writing and, again, I'm feeling extremely anxious from all the stuff going on in my life right now and all the deadlines I feel like I have.

Let's just say if you were hypothetically in my situation and you could not get a job in the USA for whatever reason, what would you do/what would be your advise? Thank you in advance for any suggestions or advice.

tl;dr: Need to finish thesis by March 20th, need to move to Germany after that, need to get a job after that. Stress and pressure is making everything harder."

I am looking for either an internship or entry level software development position. Several things to note on my resume in its current state:
 
* GPA: 3.31 is **only** CSCI courses. My major and cumulative GPAs are 2.75 and 2.93 respectively. I will remove GPA altogether if this seems misleading.

* Projects: The first is a personal project and the second is a school group project. The school project was fairly difficult and only a handful of my classmates worked on the same portion as me due to the group structure. For those reasons I felt it was alright to include the second project. (I could be wrong here). I don't have any other personal project at the moment but could add other school projects.

* Employment history: Obviously these are unrelated, but I think the coaching looks good and the construction job shows consistency. I could use some advice on trying to""sell"" both of them a little bit better.

Thanks in advance!"

I'm a junior CS student at a UC school, and I've been looking for a summer internship.


I currently have an internship that I've worked at for the past year, but I want to leave it because it's with a state agency, and I don't think it looks that good if I want to work in the private tech industry. I also have a couple of open source projects on my github, that I link to and describe in my resume.


I've been applying to internships at my school's career fairs and online since October. I've received one phone interview, which i've failed, one coding challenge that I've submitted but have yet to receive a response, a phone interview request I've rejected because I didn't like the company, and the rest were rejections/ignores. This was with 20+ applications sent out. There is one more internship fair where I will try, but I'm sad and not too hopeful at this point..


What should I do? Keep working at my current job over the summer?


Also, do you think that my current job has affected me negatively? I hear that government workers have a reputation of being lazy. I don't think this is very fair however, since the agency I work for exists strictly to write software for the government. So it has a real focus on software engineering, and we use the latest tech like ASP.Net MVC 5, the hottest javascript libraries, and so on.


How will this affect my full time job search which will start this fall? I really want to work at any tech company in the Bay Area, startup or otherwise."
2vx5f3,3,2015-02-14,Options as a foreign CS major graduating from a college in the US?,sockduffman,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2vx5f3/options_as_a_foreign_cs_major_graduating_from_a/,"I'll be graduating this June with a GPA of around 3.2-3.3. I've found my classes very challenging but rewarding, yet unfortunately due to depression/burnout I never really put myself out there and applied for any internships. I'm much better now and trying to make up for lost time and opportunities.

In a post I made some months ago I mentioned taking a break after graduating, but a few days ago I decided that it might not be the best idea. I don't really have a resume other than my school's name, and the projects I did for class (heap allocator, implementing PintOS, a MySQL backed Quiz website in Java, a COOL compiler etc.)

So:

I will apply for a 1-year post-grad OPT extension of my F-1 visa, but long term I would like to live and settle in the US and keep working here, if at all possible. 

How does this factor into my job search? How does my situation limit the number of companies that may want to hire me, that is, am I limited to the biggest companies that can afford to obtain permission for me to work? I'm afraid that I literally have to work for Google or Microsoft to be able to get a working visa, and I don't know how possible that is in my current situation.

I've heard that I should not mention that I'm not a US citizen in my resume, since that would decrease my chances of getting an interview. Is that true? If so, when is the appropriate time to talk about such a topic?

So, I'll be a year behind.

After going to to career fairs and finding out that even the companies that want Electrical Engineers actually want kids to do CS stuff, I'm wondering whether I should switch or not.


Would I be too far behind, in terms of being qualified for internships by the end of junior year? I'll have taken CS 101(into java).Intermediate Software Design, Data Structures, Discrete math, algorithms, digital logic,  and computer organization."

I'm not a big fan and I started taking some CS classes in Fall 2013 with no experience. 

I did a bunch of prereqs and started my Masters in Fall 2014. I did alright my first semester,  worked part-time and managed a 3.33. I'll be working less this semester so I expect I'll do a little better.

So we had a career fair last week and I've been sending out resumes for internships. I've actually gotten a few responses including a big 4 which had an online code test which I did not do well on (only got 2 of the 7 questions). I also spoke to another major company at the career fair and they tested me on paper and while the data structure stuff wasn't bad, I knew nothing of systems and very little of networking (I'm taking a networking class now). 

I'm working as hard as I can to fill in these gaps and pretty much all my time not in work, class or the gym is spent working on interview data structure questions in C++ but I'm still not great. I'm also involved in a Python meetup and a CTF club at school so I'm putting in the work. 

Anyway, I really have no idea what I want to do with my degree. I've only been studying CS for 1.5 years at this point, I enjoy CS in general and the only thing I don't love is front-end but it's tolerable. 

I currently have a non-CS job that gives me flexible hours and pays me decently at $27/hr. I have been speaking to a couple of small companies and while I don't have an offer, I'm pretty sure they'll pay half or less of what I'm currently making. If I was 20 that's be okay, but I'm 29 in NYC and since I'm working part-time I'm able to at least break even for my living expenses. I have some savings for a safety net and am taking out minimal loans. 

1. Is it worth taking an internship where I'll be making considerably less money if it comes to it? 

2. IS there anything else I can be doing to make myself more hireable? I'm also graduating in December 2015. 

3. Is it really bad that I haven't decided exactly what I want to do?

2vy4ey,2,2015-02-15,"I don't know how to cope anymore. I'm a burden, and it would be better if I was dead.",AllThatGlitters3682,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2vy4ey/i_dont_know_how_to_cope_anymore_im_a_burden_and/,"As the title says, I don't feel that I have any safe coping mechanisms anymore. I want to die. 

I'm 28/f and live at home. Not by choice, but trying to find a career I want to pursue in the current economy has been a problem ever since I graduated college at 22. I'm very lucky in that I've been allowed to live at home while figuring out how to use my (useless) degree. I help run the house where I can, taking care of as much of the day-to-day business as possible as both of my parents work full time in demanding, professional careers. I'm also diagnosed depressed with quiet borderline personality disorder (I rage in at myself instead of at others, but the black/white thinking and mood swings triggered by situations persists), as well as a physical health condition. I've been in therapy off and on, seeing a psychiatrist and therapist to work on DBT. I felt confident in myself and my coping mechanisms for a few years, but it's slowly falling apart to right now, when I have nothing left.

It's hard to have any close friends. I've never had a best friend, someone who knows me the best and would always support me. My friends either need mental help themselves or I'm scared to burden them, or I don't trust them. So many have their own best friends, their own social lives, their own marriages and families. Every day feels like a new borderline episode for me now that I'll just push them away with a new horrible life event and pray they don't condemn me too.

My boyfriend doesn't act like a boyfriend anymore. We've been together 18 months and now doesn't see me as a priority. Working in the restaurant industry takes up a lot of his time, and he's now chosen an active role in politics (in a party he knows I can't and will never support) over spending any time with me. I'm lucky if he remembers to send me a text message once a day when we live 15 minutes apart. I've explained that I'm having a horrible time, but he won't ask me what's wrong or even that he cares. Just complains about his job and reiterates he has no time for me due to a sudden interest in politics. But he won't break up with me. Valentine's Day has been especially horrible in this regard. 

I'm trying hard, at 28, to acquire even an unpaid internship for something I think I may want to do. But as soon as I explained this focus to him, he started to pull away from me. Every man I've dated in the past ten years has been the same: as soon as I feel confident or even better, excited, about a career prospect, I'm either dumped or left alone. I can't win.

Trying to take on this internship doesn't sit well with my family either. My father judges me because it's not a paid position and thinks what I want to do isn't lucrative. He further blames me for being a problem in his and my mother's marriage. He's convinced my mother doesn't spend enough time with him and chooses me over him in regards to spending time together. He no longer wishes to associate with me and sees me as useless. 

My mom tries to explain she enjoys spending time with me and while we share a lot, it was never our intent to exclude him from certain hobbies (such as following specific TV shows, areas of history, etc). But he always tells us he has no interest in that. He financially supports us to take trips to pursue these interests and then blames me when he chooses not to come and stays behind alone. He's stopped eating for the most part, drinks more than he ever has before, and doesn't associate with either my mom or myself. He thinks my mom doesn't spend enough time with him as a couple, socially and sexually, because of her time with me. He's been abandoned and it's entirely my fault.

I just stay in my room as much as possible. If I'm not around, I won't be a burden to my friends, boyfriend, and family. If I just don't explain how much pain I'm in, it's okay. So I just want to die now and take myself out of the equation. Not having goals makes me a burden, having goals still makes me a burden. I can't win at anything anymore and I'm better off dead for everyone in my life. No one is meant to live alone, and that seems like the only option I have anymore. I'd rather die."
2vyh5g,2,2015-02-15,Internship Dilemma,bkzhotsauc3,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2vyh5g/internship_dilemma/,"Hi guys I'm here struggling with a bit of a problem. I completed an internship with a company over the summer that was located in New Jersey but I live in New York so I had to commute for about an hr each time. The pay was 17/hr. The HR called me last week telling me that my manager is wondering if I will be returning for this summer. I have to let them know by the 23rd. 
I know it is a matter of me either playing it safe vs. risking it but Im still at a loss of what to do. 

Some context: I thought the internship experience was okay. Half the time I didn't do squat but I apparently interned at a time where there wasnt any contracts to work on so I didnt do as much as I had hoped. I am majoring in Computer Engineering and the internship had me working with mostly electrical engineering stuff. I felt a bit out of place since I am not an Electrical Engineer and the stuff focused on radio frequency stuff that I knew 0% about but the engineers were definitely nice and helpful. I was hoping for a more software type role where I could interface with hardware but I am sure now that I am known in that company Im sure I can request a different job position this time. 

What's making me reconsider is the whole ""grass is greener"" type thing because the company I interned for seems to be on the average side based on glassdoor reviews and Im thinking maybe I can get an internship with a more well known company and have a better internship experience.

However when I try to look at computer engineering internships in New York I keep seeing so many computer sciencey stuff with high level programming requirements that I am unfamiliar with. Besides my courses that had me do VHDL, my only real programming experience was with C and a minor introduction to C++ when I did really well in a Data Structures course. 

I know I shouldn't limit myself to New York but I really do want an internship in New York however I would be willing to travel if a company would pay and if their internship program is good. I just never realized up till recently how much NYC loves CS majors. Its crazy and my major gets lumped with CS majors with companies thinking we do the same thing =/.

So Im just juggling so many factors right now. I have an interview with Citi on thursday that I dont really feel prepared for since it is pretty computer sciencey (database stuff I dont feel remotely qualified for) yet I got picked for an interview I suppose so Ive been refreshing on data structure stuff and hope that helps out. Then Im hoping that I hear back from a couple of companies I applied to after meeting them at my college career fair. Like I applied to Ricoh for their internship in Colorado. I seemed to hit it off well with one of the representatives. I should probably apply to more places across the U.S.

Would it be a good idea to just play it safe and go intern at the same company again? I emailed a professor about it and he seemed to favor me just playing it safe. Im guessing he was being biased because he did the same thing and worked for the same company for his whole professional career and ended up fine. But he did bring up a major point how the company I interned for has a wide range of job positions that he seems positive I could get plenty of experience. I definitely am afraid of not getting any internship offers if I risk it but shoot at the same time what if I do play it safe but I get a good internship offer? =/

tl;dr Company I interned for contacted me last week and told me they want me back. I had an okay internship experience there though I could request a position I would be more suited for. Facing ""Grass is greener"" dilemma and don't have any other intern positions lined up for me at the moment but would like to intern somewhere else to experience more things. Must reply back by the 23rd and still unsure what to do. Im kind of losing my mind weighing the pros and cons and the what-if's. I guess Im being a bit greedy?"

2vyv64,41,2015-02-15,"How can I make the absolute maximum amount of income over this next summer? [serious, read the details]",YupHio,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2vyv64/how_can_i_make_the_absolute_maximum_amount_of/,"I want to work 100 hours a week for my 12 week summer, where should I look?

I'm a mechanical engineering student and I have been unable to get an engineering internship for this summer. This last summer I worked on the unload crew for the freight truck at Lowe's at night as well as doing landscaping during the day. With that being said, I have no problem using a post hole digger for 6 hours a day, or carrying heavy boxes for hours on end, everyday, all summer.

So I have the question: Regardless of the pay per hour, or how many hours a week I must work, or how hard the work is, or where I must travel for the work, I ask: how can I make the maximum amount of money over summer? I feel as though I have an advantage being a college student, not tied down, I can live out of my truck anywhere in the country for the summer. Is there some job where I can put in 100 hours a week all summer? Is there some job that pays really high that nobody else is willing to do?

One of my room mates was making ~$28 per hour over the summer, he got an entry level job driving the roller over new asphalt in Montana. He got overtime every week, lots of overtime, that's ~$42/hour for just sitting in a little rolling machine and driving in a straight line for hours. He was making so much money that he decided to take fall semester off and just keep working for a while. Now he's back and doesn't have much to show for it because he spent most of his money while making it, my plan is to save up and graduate college with no debt. Are there jobs out there similar to this?

If it's pertinent, I'm a tall 19 year old white male currently living in North Idaho, I have good work references. I'm the tall skinny guy that keeps working and working, and I plan to work as much as possible this summer, just looking for ideas and opportunities early on.  I have 3 months now to set up a job for summer.

I'm willing to live a ridiculous lifestyle for 3 months, I've got nothing better to do. Really. Now give me ideas.

EDIT:

0) I currently work as a cook at Denny's while I'm in school. I get a free meal every shift and get to take home free food on night shifts. However, at home I eat chicken and rice, frozen vegetables, bread, milk, eggs. I keep my food expenses incredibly low, I got a big bag of rice at Costco, that's about $1 per 1000 calories. I can keep my cost of living down and live like a monk for 3 months, living expenses are irrelevant. I want crazy ideas. Also, I can arrange free housing with relatives in North Idaho over summer if I don't need to travel for work, which would help.

1) I understand an engineering internship is important, however since I still have 3 years before completing my degree, and my GPA is just below 3.0, it is unlikely that I will land a mechanical engineering internship this summer. It is currently more important for me to get as much work as I can. There is plenty of time for internships later.

2) I see many of you are suggesting labor jobs, like I could go to North Dakota, or process fish in Alaska all summer. But I would also like some ideas such as this: Theoretically, if I can sit at a desk and answer phone calls or enter data or something all day for $10 an hour, and I can work 100 hours per week, factoring in overtime that's $15,000 over the summer. It may be more practical to get two of these types of jobs, and work 40 hours at each. See where I'm going with this? I think this may be a valid way to make the maximum amount of income over summer. $15,000 for 12 weeks this summer, before taxes, is a good goal as that's what some internships pay. What are your thoughts?"

They have all completed just over one year of university and are applying for an internship. I studied Elec Eng so I'm not that familiar with what is taught at each stage in a CS degree.

This is roughly what I had in mind:
A few questions on computer architecture. E.g. Difference between Von Newmann and Harvard Architecture. What's an ALU and program counter?
Maybe a few questions on assembly since they all seem to have studied it. 

A few questions on data structures. What's the difference between a stack, queue, and heap? Where might you use each of those? Get them to implement one in pseudo code. See if they do it as a linked list or array, and ask a few questions about their implementation. 

A few questions on sorting algorithms. Can they name a few. See what they know about their relative speeds. Get them to implement one of them in pseudo code. 

A few questions on OOP.
What is it? What are the advantages? Can they list a few object orientated languages. What is a class, an object, inheritance etc.

Does that sound about the right sort of level of questions? Too hard/easy? Any extra questions that might be suitable?"

I am majoring in Computer Engineering and I was looking for a software type role but I couldnt say no to the only offer I got. Last week the HR contacted me and told me that my manager was wondering if I want to come back for the summer. They're giving me up to the 23rd to give a response. 

The internship experience was okay. Like I saw stuff I have never seen before and the people there were definitely nice and some were funny. And I also learned new stuff and developed more communication skills and self-reliance skills and proved that I could learn stuff quickly and produce results. I was working at a rate of 17/hr but going through tolls and paying for gas sucked since the trip was about 45 mins to an hr drive each time. I have no other internship offers at the moment but I got an interview with Citi for a software spot and Im hoping to hear back from some other companies that I applied to after attending my college career fair last week. 

People have reccomended to me that I just take the internship offer because I have no other opportunities at the moment and it would suck to refuse the opportunity and get no opportunities else where. It's just that Im thinking that maybe I could get an internship with a more reputable company and also be exposed to more companies instead of feeling chained to one. I am leaning towards just taking the internship offer and requesting a software role then cry if I get any other job offers haha.

Has anyone else been in this position??? I just need more opinions on the matter =/"

How's everyone doing today?  So this is a throw away because I feel really bad about talking about this in my main account.  So I am in my 2nd year of PhD program in electrical engineering and I feel really really burnt out, and want to quit soo badly :(.  So I have been in school non stop since 2004, and have received a BS and an MS in electrical engineering.  Then I started PhD, this is a whole different ball game :(.  So first off I don't like having to pick one subfield, of a subfield of a subfield to become an expert in.  I did my MS in analog design and loved it.  I really loved my advisor, and everyone in my lab, and my thesis topic I had for my MS degree.  For PhD I changed universities and started in analog design.  I hated my advisor, and hated the topic I was doing, so I changed advisors to a digital IC professor because I found his work interesting.  Now that I am working with him I feel like he is pushing me towards computer science topics that I have no background for.  I have been working with my current adivsor for almost a year now, and have zero publications with him, and am starting to worry.  He wants me to publish by April, but I don't even have a research topic yet!  The circuit design work that I am doing with him isn't going anywhere.  All of my research ideas either do not work, or have already been published.  I am really starting to freak out.  I feel that I am not in the right little subfield, and I do not know what subfield to pick.  I like analog design because I find it very intuitive, but it's applications are boring.  I find digital design to be quite a lot more interesting, but I do not like coding.  The other thing that freaks me out is how LONG a PhD is.  I have talked to other PhD students that have been in the PhD program for 7 YEARS!!  7 YEARS!!!  I do not think I want to spend the next 5 years of my life stressed about publications, and finding the right little subfield.  Honestly I have less and less to talk to my friends about, and it really makes me depressed.  Everyone in my lab is anti-social and doesn't ever want to hang out outside of school.  So I feel like I am loosing the friends that I do have, and it really worries me.  I'm afraid I am going to end up alone in my mid 30s when I finally do graduate with my PhD, and that really scares me.  But, at the same time I feel like I do have something special and I don't wanna let go of it.  I worked hard to get into my PhD program.  I am already done with classes, and classes were hard.  The only thing I have left to graduate is just a thesis, but that is going to take the next 5 years or so :(.  I have never been as depressed as I am in my PhD.  So, the way I see it I have 3 choices: 1. stick with same advisor, learn ALOT about computer science, and graduate under him, 2. change advisors AGAIN and hope I find the small subfield I enjoy.  3. give up and get a job, hope its in the right subfield, and hope it's one I enjoy. Anyways this is more of a rant than anything.  Thank you for listening.

Edit:  Thank you guys for all of the support you guys have given :):):).  You guys will never know how much you have helped me :):).  Hugs for everyone.  I think my plans for the future will be find an internship this summer to break the day to day grind of a PhD.  I just first have to get the internship :(.  I will keep you guys updated about what I do."
2w0nks,61,2015-02-15,"Is it worth taking a $15/hr offer to ""get your foot in the door"" if you lack a degree?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2w0nks/is_it_worth_taking_a_15hr_offer_to_get_your_foot/,"I picked up coding last summer and went to a web dev bootcamp. After graduating among the top of my class, I landed a 3-month paid internship at a small, high-profile agency, where I sharpened my skills with Angular and Node and received mentoring from some very talented Sr. devs. The internship term ended and I've been on the job hunt for the last two months. 

I now have my first offer and it's from a Vancouver agency that mostly works with non-profits. None of the staff have CS degrees, including the Sr. dev who's in this 50s. They asked me to think about what kind of wage I would want and get back to them.

I talked to some other devs in the city as well as the career advisor at the bootcamp I attended in order to come up with an appropriate starting wage. We landed on $18/hr for an intro period of maybe 8 weeks, then up to 45k once I'm salaried. 

Their counter-offer is **$15/hr for three months**, after which they would assess my progress and decide whether to bring me onto the team or not. This is $100/week less than internship offers I had fresh out of bootcamp. They point to my lack of experience and degree, as well as their non-profit work, as justification. They have dodged my questions about what my salary would be like if I was brought on. 

I see the potential for growth with this agency, but I can't help but view their offer as an attempt to exploit my desperation. 

I'm looking for advice on the situation and maybe some negotiation strategies if this company sounds worth pursuing. "
2w19j0,7,2015-02-15,Trying to make sense of the local community college's associate degrees,featherycrow,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2w19j0/trying_to_make_sense_of_the_local_community/,"I'm sorry if this is something that a lot of people say or it's annoying but I could use help figuring some stuff out. I got a bachelor of arts in music around 8 months ago and I've been unable to find work (the degree doesn't help, being autistic makes it harder). I don't have a background in programming but I am interested in trying to learn computer science stuff. 

I have the option of going to the community college here, but they don't have a ""computer science"" associate program. There are two major options:

(1) Applied Science degrees for web programming, network and security administration, etc that are half classes like accounting, public speaking, economics, etc. These seem kind of sketch.

(2) Associate of Science in Engineering with a Specialization in Computer Science.  This is a lot of mathy stuff like calculus, differential equations, physics, and linear algebra, but also two computer science classes, a 'computer organization' class, and a mathematical structures class. (This is intended as a transfer degree, but transferring is not something I can do in the foreseeable future.)

I was thinking of pairing #2 with a ""database and program developer"" certificate, which would be a software design class, 3 java classes, and a database architecture class. While I was taking these classes I could try to intern and also try to build up a portfolio of my own stuff. Then at the end of the two years I could apply to entry level java / database jobs.

I know I should talk to the community college about their program, but what do you all think? Is this something that has a chance of working out if I take it seriously and spend the time on it?"
2w1ci5,8,2015-02-15,"How long should I stay at an ""over-promised"" internship before leaving an expecting a recommendation from the firm?",thisfunnieguy,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2w1ci5/how_long_should_i_stay_at_an_overpromised/,"I took an internship in January at a think tank that was supposed to expose me to a lot of data/stats work. They even had me take a test to prove my competency with a statistical modeling/analysis program (SPSS). After being there for about a month I was told by the office manager that they realized after the fact that they over-promised on the job when they were interviewing.

That same week I was told by the #2 in the data department that don't plan on me ever touching the data while I'm here or even have an extra license to install the software on the computer I'm using. 

I spend nearly all of my time copy and pasting data from a pdf into a power point or from an excel file into a word document, or other menial tasks.

I was really excited about the work here before I began because of what I was told. Heck, just being put through a stats test implied to me that I'd be getting my hands dirty with something. 

... but I'm not, and it seems that it was never the idea for me to do anything else. 

So, I want to leave. I feel I've done good work with what I've been asked to do, and have helped in a number of ways to improve some of the things they've been doing, but it's clear this isn't going to be an internship to further develop my stats skills. 

When I came on it was implied that the internships were for about six months (school semester). I remember being told they are ""open ended, but in about three months you'll know if you'll be offered a full time job."" That last part is important because since I just finished my undergrad degree they knew I was looking to find out if something full time was available at the end of the internship. I realize now that I'm not interested in accepting a full-time job from the department I'm currently working in, and while there is another department that looks interesting (and I've done some work with them) the office was told they won't be adding any new people for the foreseeable future. 

The people in the office have some really good contacts, and I'd like to know when it'd be acceptable for me to begin looking for my next job, which would also include me asking the other department if I've proved enough value to them for them to consider looking to bring me on full-time. 

Should I hold out for the three months? I'm not being paid much, and I expect the next job I find will be paying much more than this job.

The key is that I don't want to burn the bridge here when I leave. I'm trying to do right by the people here, because most of the people I've worked with didn't realize how the position was over-promised to me.

2w1heu,1,2015-02-15,Our band director has continuously become a worse and worse person.,[deleted],rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/2w1heu/our_band_director_has_continuously_become_a_worse/,"I go to a small school of maybe about 900-980 people total. Our football team is awful, our cheerleaders are mediocre, and our band has sort of become our pride and joy (if you can call it that). We definitely aren't amazing, but we provide results and it makes the principal happy. The thing is, there's been a lot of unrest in our band, and you can just watch a rehearsal and easily pinpoint the source: our band director, who we'll call Mr. D.

When I first came into our high school in the eighth grade (our elementary schools go from K-7, and high school from 8-12), band class was my favorite part of the day. I enjoyed music and loved playing every day, and the pieces we played were decently challenging and fun. There were many people who were very dedicated to music and put forth as much effort as they could. Mr. D appeared to be a witty and charismatic teacher who enjoyed music and put forth the effort to make our band better. I was looking forward to starting marching band thr next year.

But when band camp started, I honestly thought, ""Is this the same person?""

It was, of course, but it didn't feel like it. He would find any imperfection about a student (usually not even their playing ability) such as their weight, what they wore, how they talked, and constantly made fun of them for it, to the point where it could be considered bullying. Often times he refused to notice somebody's playing ability because of how they acted. Every single day, I would come home angry or upset about something he said to me or another student. He had lots of obvious favoritism, never pointing out the mistakes of his favorite students, or pretending his least favorites made mistakes when they clearly didn't. Here are a few examples of things he says or has said (some may be paraphrased slightly):

-He commonly says ""So easy [student name] could do it,"" and proceeds to stare at said student for a good five seconds.

-""I had to beat some sense into Asperger's Kid over there so he could get it.""

-""[Baritone player] also made it into the All-District Band, but I think it was just out of pity.""

-Constantly makes fun of one of our only good trumpet players for her height and never notices that she plays well at all.

-Often makes fun of one particular student because of his weight, with such wonderful comments as calling him ""Krispy Kreme Boy"" among others

And the reason he does this is because he's realized how much he can get away with. Our band room is pretty far from the main school building so administrators never really come to check in, and we get results at competitions so nobody really asks what goes on. Countless students have quit just because of how much of a complete asshat he is, and the number is already going up. He doesn't even care about us learning new things about music or our instruments, he just wants us to look good at concerts and competitions.

The last straw for me was when our sax quartet was putting together our last performance for our annual talent show before two of our members graduated. Our section leader and bari sax player, who we'll call C, spent almost all of her free time arranging a medley of famous songs for us to play, and it sounded fantastic (though it was very difficult, especially with me being new to the soprano sax). But every day when Mr. D could stay during our rehearsals, he would say that

A: We just plain sounded ""awful""

B: Our piece had no audience appeal, despite it including well-known songs from many eras/genres (e.g. Hit The Road Jack, Hey Jude, and Seven Nation Army among others). Appearently, his idea of audience appeal was a Barber Shop Quartet piece because a vocal quartet won last year.

and he would give barely any actual advice. The only good part was that we had an intern, who we'll call J, who could stay for our rehearsals on some days and he gave us advice on sounding better. He would listen to us and show us how to balance certain parts out and what sort of tone to use. We actually started showing a lot of improvement and we felt more confident in ourselves after each practice, and then it hit me; this was just like my first year when I actually enjoyed band. If Mr. D hadn't started finding loopholes then I would find music so much more enjoyable.

Sorry, just needed to get all this off my chest.

You guys are not going to believe this: I got a multi-thousand dollar tower, monitor, mouse, keyboard, and wires combo for free! Here's the story:


&amp;nbsp;


My mom works at a small scale manufacturing facility whose IT department recently had a company auction of all their old towers. Among them was one of their old Dell T3500's that they used for CAD / 3D design. It was given away for free because it had an issue with supplying power to any hard drive. Other than that, it was fine. Anyways, I had worked an internship at the same company last summer as, you guessed it, an IT ~~beyotch~~ intern. I had worked on several T3500s and I had a hunch as to what the issue was. Sure enough, in BIOS, there's a setting that tells it how many hard drives to initialize on POST. If you say there's only one HDD on boot, it will believe you! They had set no hard drives to be recognized in BIOS. Once I fixed that, it booted like a charm! I got a new hard drive in there, threw Windows 8 on it, and it works like a dream now! I can finally experience the true power of what PC gaming really is!


&amp;nbsp;


Now, as if I hadn't been blessed enough by Lord GabeN himself, I had a good friend of mine, [/u/Stephen304](http://www.reddit.com/u/Stephen304) , let me ""borrow"" his extra monitor indefinitely until I can pay him back for it. The end result is that now, in addition to an awesome gaming rig, I also have a kick ass monitor, thanks to a fellow PCMR brother no less! Guys, this was a really good day, and I just wanted to say thank you all for being part of it! Also, just want you guys to know, when my 2TB external drive failed on me right before a HUGE CS project was due, my mom got me a new one, and used the old hard drive platters as coasters for her desk, cause she's cool like that.

Now I'm learning Python. I'm only one week in and almost know everything to be considered an 'intermediate' Python programmer. I really like this learning-on-my-own style, and was wondering; How likely is it that I could get an internship, or even a job, this summer for programming (doesn't has to be summer, could be ASAP)?

I learn very fast, I could probably pick up C or Java in 2 weeks. But what should my next steps be?

* Any languages I should learn in particular?
* Any online classes I could take that would give me more credibility?
* Any open source projects in particular I should contribute to?

I have now been on Escitalex, a mild anti-depressant, for about a week, in addition to getting a differeent MPH medication, called Ritalin Adult.

This works much better than before, because with the old medication, I noticed almost no effect, just the side effects and the rebound. The advantage is that this new stuff does not require me to eat beforehand, so I take it right after I wake up.

On other news, I have an appointment with a therapist regarding my ADHD-depression issue on March 6th.

I still do not have a job, but this is not all that urgent now; although the job center really wants me to apply (and I do when I find the strength and a position I am likely to be able to do), my partner told me that he has no issue supporting me until I am better. We will not be getting rich that way, but it took a hughe weight off my soul that he didn't see me as some kind of burden.

He is working at a food retailer and manages the part of the store where the beverages are sold (not just alcohol, all kinds), and will ask his boss today if I could possibly work there as a kind of intern, part-time, just so I have somewhere to go and something to do. He did so because I asked him to, because just sitting at home drives me up the wall.

So, no real progress yet, but I am working on getting there.

---

**TL;DR: Got new MPH meds and an anti-depressant, will be seeing a therapist in early March. Don't have a job yet, but am applying whenever I manage. Am looking into getting some sort of internship/part-time work to get me out of the house.**"

Thanks in advance for helping me out.

I am a first year university student and recently I went to a career fair to look for potential summer internships. I got interview calls from 2 companies and had a decent interview with them but both rejected me by saying that I didnt had any prior programming experience on my resume. (No job because no experience, no experience because no job; sad logic).

A few days ago, a recruiter from Amazon sent me an email (to my surprize). I am really excited and scared about this email as the recruiter said that I am going to have a 30 minute online assessment. I havnt heard anything like this before.

I have heard people do 90 minute long assessment tests online but not 30 minute long.

My question, is there anyone who can give me an idea of what to expect from the Amazon online assessment and what I should prepare before starting the test. What kind of questions were on the test etc.

From how things are working out, Amazon seems like my only shot for the summer internship and I do not want to lose this chance. I love programming and cant imagine doing anything else with my career.

Thanks

UPDATE: That was pretty scary but I managed to get all test passing on all the questions. It thought it would have been much harder than it was, but it wasnt. Thanks everyone."

I am studying a computer science degree and I'd like a mobile dev related internship somewhere else in Europe, preferably UK, right after graduating (I have yet to deliver my final project), which would be partly funded by the Erasmus programme (which is known for academic exchange but involves internships too). Although I'm really into programming in general, I really want it to be mobile dev.

I have profesionally developed different kinds of Android apps already and love to do so, in an internship in which I learned Android from scratch by researching, learning from my mates (well, they were not interns) and reviewing code of their projects

I think my english is enough to communicate, not to mention that I will probably be fully fluent after a couple months hopefully. It would be at least after July this year so before I even start I will have more working experience with mobile dev (probably another android internship), personal projects to show off and better english fluency.

Thank you.

You currently have a full-time dev/analyst position that allows you to pay living+tuition expenses and still be comfortable. Full health/dental benefits. Off-the-radar company that most people don't even know exists.

Your position is kind of fluid. You work full-time remote and don't really report to anyone who influences the day-to-day -- the former is obviously great, especially as a student, and the latter is both good and bad. This forces you to learn a *ton*, and you have non-negligible amounts of responsibility -- good things. However it also comes with problems, like having no real mentorship to speak of, no development methodology within the very small distributed team, and sometimes insane project requirements given that you're one of the only technical people in the org in your subfield taking requests from people who don't know the difference between a server and UI. 

Now you get a big 4 internship offer. The pluses are receiving mentorship from extremely skilled people, being a part of a structured and professional dev team, and the long-term career boosts that (presumably?) come with having bigco listed on your resume. The downside seems to mostly be losing the relatively cushy situation you are in as a student (remote+benefits) and having to revert back to no income for your final semester. 

Do you keep the cushy job until you graduate, and then take your chances applying to new grad positions at better places? Or take the internship? "

So, a little bit of context.  I'm a college student who is also very involved in a small non profit (hopefully soon to be charity if we get a 501c), Mona's Wish.  My friend started [Mona's Wish](http://monaswish.org) in order to help the homeless, and so far we have had moderate success with it.  

I've always been interested in business/entrepreneurship, had a slight interest in formal fashion, and thought drop shipping would be a slightly less risky way to get my first taste of going into business of my own, and learn first hand what it takes to run a business.  I also thought it would be great if I could use my business to help raise money for Mona's Wish, which is where the idea to donate 10% of NY Tieline's profits to the nonprofit. 

NY Tieline has been live for about 3 weeks now, and has sold around $200.00.  The time I have spent on NY Tieline and Mona's Wish (you can see our website can use a bit of attention) has been limited the past month while I've been preparing everything I need to apply to transfer to various colleges on top of my current schoolwork, so March will be when I really start hustling.

**Current Marketing**

As I said, I have not been on this full time recently, so at the moment Instagram is my only source of traffic.  I messed around with Adwords a little bit, but because of time constraints I've paused my campaign until I can devote sufficient attention so as not to just pour money down the toilet.  

My pricing right now is a few dollars below what the manufacturers are charging on their own websites, and my current packaging can be seen [here](http://instagram.com/p/yiB2BymrSp/?modal=true).  Although I'm sure it doesn't matter at this stage, I tried to use colors that are in my logo (can't hurt to try to brand the company). Along with the packages I include a small card thanking them for buying from us, with a discount code for any future purchases.   

I did an internship where I worked with SEO and have been reading extensively on it, so I'm just starting to optimize my website, although there is a lot of competition in this field.  

**My Website**

My [website](http://nytieline.com) right now is very basic, and I know it can use some work.  Once I finish my transfer applications the website will be one of my first priorities.  I feel like my large graphic at the top is a bit amateurish, and will probably need to be replaced when I have the chance.  As I mentioned, I am using drop shipping and some wholesale, from a handful of suppliers, which is why the images are all varying.  I think, at least for the bow ties, it would look a lot better if I at least sized the images to be very similar in size.

**Ideas I'm exploring**

Social Media:

The plan for instagram is to become more active, provide followers with exclusive deals and coupon codes for the website to hopefully convert followers into customers.  When I have enough of a customer base, instagram contests where they tag NY Tieline with some kind of hashtag about us in their best tie/bow tie photos and I choose the best image/s for a free product or some other incentive.

Facebook and Maybe Twitter:

I'm considering creating sweepstakes where to enter, users must like/follow and share/retweet my post to enter a contest for a free (pricier) product and randomly choose a winner.  

Blogs:

Another idea I'm considering is reaching out to blogs that fit my niche and offering them free products and a discount code to offer their readers if they'll do a review or feature about NY Tieline.

Referral Program:

Something else that I've thought about is making a program with some kind of point system where customers can sign up and earn free products after a certain number of referrals, or after those they have referred have spent a certain amount at NY Tieline.  

College Students:

I have a lot of friends in frats that may be able to advertise some of my products, and I think that the bow ties in particular could be popular among frat bros.  I haven't yet shared my business with many friends/colleagues for two reasons: 1. I want to make sure my project is viable before I get 'pity sales' and 2. because my reputation is associated with it, I don't want to share it too much until I make the website the best that it can be.

Mona's Wish Events:

If any of you visited the Monas Wish website, in addition to our initiative to give our clients the skills to be self sufficient again, we also do things like canned food drives, and right now we're fundraising for another round of Project Push.  So any events, such as college 3v3 basketball tournaments are a good opportunity for me to include in the tournament packets/pamphlets discount coupons for NY Tieline.           

**Financials**

Not much to mention here.  Invested about $2,000 I'd had saved up to purchase inventory, domain name, hosting,etc.  Have made about $200 so far.  

As I mentioned previously, I'm still learning, and any feedback, criticism, or opportunities you think I could take advantage of in my marketing plan, website, or anything Else I mentioned would be really appreciated.  "

Can I please get some advice?,mraero,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2w5o10/i_cant_find_an_engineering_job_can_i_please_get/,"Hey /r/engineeringstudents! I can't find an engineering job, and it's really starting to get me down. The worst part is, it's taking a real toll on my personal life and my relationship. I am struggling with money and my girlfriend is at the end of her rope with me. It's been 14 months of searching now and I don't know what to do. I'm reaching out here hoping to find some good advice or success stories.

Let me fill you in on my background and what I have tried. I graduated with a Master's of Applied Science in Aerospace Engineering in Canada last year. My GPA (converted to a 4.0 scale) was 3.97 and I was nominated for a medal for my thesis work. I also finished school with 2 years of internship experience under my belt and several nice research projects at the university, so I graduated feeling quite confident in my ability to secure something. Since then, I have applied to hundreds of jobs all over the globe and have not yet had a single interview. When applying, I opt for quality over quantity, so each application takes a lot of time. Each cover letter and resume is carefully tailored to the job I'm applying for, and I only apply for jobs in which I meet at least 80% of the criteria. I spend relatively little time on job boards; instead, I target specific companies and try to make connections with employees via e-mail and LinkedIn. I do have clearly defined career goals and a strategy in mind: I want to work in Computer Aided Engineering (CAE), and I'm backed by strong fundamental knowledge of fluid dynamics and structural analysis, mathematics, numerical modelling, and I have 6 years of experience with ANSYS and various 3D modelling tools. I have many references who will give me a glowing review. I don't know what I am doing wrong.

I network all the time and I've had people put my resume through to their bosses, and my applications seem to generate lots of traffic to my LinkedIn profile. I often see that employers from companies I've applied to have viewed my LinkedIn profile, but I never hear back from them. I follow up on most of my applications by phone or by e-mail, but I never get any definitive information from doing so. I've scoured my LinkedIn profile looking for typos or something that would turn off prospective employers, but I just haven't found anything.

My confidence is pretty much gone now and minimum wage work is just eating away at my brain after all these years. I want to do what I love and I want to continue growing as an engineer.

Sorry for the rant. Feel free to share if you've had similar experiences. Thank you!"

My boss is offering me an extension for my internship.  I've told him many times before that I want to become a software developer.  We had a conversation earlier today regarding my QA internship extension and it went something like this:

&gt; **Boss**: NotSoHung, would you be interested in extending your internship for another 4 months at the end of April, so you'd be here runtil August?  There are a lot of interesting things coming down the pipe and I know that you would be very excited to get your hands dirty with all of it.

&gt; **Me**: I'd definitely have to think about it.  My end goal is to become a software developer -- when May comes, do you see me working as a software developer or do you see it as a QA role?

&gt; **Boss**: I can't tell you that right now.  You *could* be doing software development, it *might* be a possibility, but I can't give you an answer to that yet.  As you now know, Agile is about adapting to what's needed at the moment.  So you *could* be in development, but I can't tell right now.  The team loves the work that you put in already.  You should be very proud of yourself.

&gt; **Me**: I'll definitely have to think about it.

So it ends, and my boss seems angry/frustrated.  He also became a bit passive aggressive with his tone and would often make remarks to the developers about me while I was in the room.  Not explicitly saying anything bad about me, but just made me feel like I'm dumb.

About half an hour later, the VP of Engineering (who seems very close with my boss) spoke with me separately and stated that he would have me work with the developers directly, and not be in QA.

I'm not really sure what to do.  Should I speak with them both together?  Or should I just toss this extension aside?  My fear is being pigeon-holed into QA since I'm already in it and already established myself as the ""QA"" guy."

Which doesn't make sense when I scheduled for those two meetings after. My adviser hasn't replied to my email either so whoop-di-fucking-do that's promising. If I can't get into the next quarter then I won't be a full time student, and with me already being ""subject-to-disqualification"" (cause well I fucked up my first quarter), it doesn't sound good.

And if I'm not a full time student, I won't be eligible to apply for the one internship I was really looking forward too. I'm short on drawings to put in my portfolio, not many ""finished"" pieces. Maybe 3 or 4 I can put in there but that's no where nearly enough. There isn't a set number but I think I'd need about 15-20 to show a nice chunk of quality work. It's a bit unclear with how high level I need to be to apply but I feel like my art is a joke compared to other applicants they'll get. Was going to try to stun them with something very different or super creative but I haven't been able to make anything like that. Just random floating ideas I sketch out and try to make it a finished product.

Feeling really fucking dizzy too. Hadn't slept yet, starting to feel a bit nauseous too. 

I absolutely despise painting. I really rather get away with it and not do it. But that isn't the best idea. If I start now, I can finish but I do not have any confidence with my painting skill. I won't use the tap correctly, I'll spill or smudge and ruin it all. I don't have any nice designs/textures for this inventory. I need to fill them up though.  

On nights like these, I draw while listening to Sycra. The night just goes on and I keep drawing, sketching some pretty interesting things. Things that are-not too shabby. But I got stuck, my pace of things got twocked when I had to stop and try to fix this arm I sketched. Spent too much time on it and all the stress just came back at me.

*Shit, I have to start on that painting*

*Fu-I need to talk to my advisor*

*Uhg, I need to keep drawing. I need more. I need to get better*

*God damn, I want that cintiq 22hd... maybe it'll make me a better artist. But that's too much money for someone like me. It won't. It doesn't come with magic*

*FuCK, I have a presentation soon. Next fucking week. I haven't touched on it. I'm nervous. I don't want to talk in front of people. I already feel them staring at me.*

I hate it when I panic, I'm panicking. I'm thinking of the most worst scenarios. I fucking hate it. God god god god. Stop. Heart's already pounding from the thought of a presentation. I want to play so god damn many games. Evolve looks really fucking fun but there's no one to play it with and it's too god damn expensive. I wish I played minecraft when everyone played it. Sure the other guys still play but it's not them I want to play with that much. I want to play with *him*. He said he'd probably never get back into it either. Hoped he had a wee bit of interest so that once diablo seasons were over or when they toned down and we get enough gear we could chill in minecraft.

I'm constantly trying to make my twitch channel better, trying to stream a bit more, he told me that I could just stream when we're all playing but I kind of like having the alone time with him and it's nice not to worry about an audience. Self conscious. But it is a good idea to expand and probably more entertaining for the audience instead hearing me mumble quietly as I draw.

My back's all healed, it feels stiff in some areas but it was really scary. Never had I been in so much pain and being unable to walk normally or more as erratically as I'd want. Fucking exercise. Do something. Stop eating so much. Weight is just going to make it worse. Go on those walks. Why aren't I? Just everything's going on right now..

Diablo season 2, I want to play with my friends.

I graduated with a BA in economics and I've been working for 2 years as a PM and QA engineer. My first job I was primarily a PM, who also did a good amount of QA. That lasted one year. My second job I am primarily QA, but I also do PM for our biggest project which takes a decent amount of effort.

My goal for ~2 years now has been to become a developer. I've been teaching myself but I've decided to finally take the plunge beginning this May to return to school to get a BS degree in computer science. I plan on doing research for the school, shooting for internships, and working on side projects throughout the 2.5 years it will take me to complete.

However with my prior QA experience, will I still have trouble getting myself into developer roles due to the ""QA branding""? Just curious to hear peoples' thoughts on this. "

2w77xb,242,2015-02-17,What You Need To Know To Start Learning How To Code,ethanael,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2w77xb/what_you_need_to_know_to_start_learning_how_to/,"Hey folks!

Learning to code can be a daunting task.  I wanted to take a minute to write down a few personal thoughts to help a few people out there who are trying to make that jump. This dives into how to make the approach toward learning to code. Not detailing exact steps.

**Identify Your Passion**
Treat this as a guiding light. If you're learning to code with no direction it's going to make the jump from learning to the real world much more difficult.  You likely know what language you are interested in learning, but why do you want to learn it? What kind of things do you want to build with it?  What's your goal? Let this be a bouncing ball in front of you. Stay focused on it.

**Learning**
It's important to point out that we all learn differently.  The key, in my mind, is minimizing distractions and maintaining a high level of structure.  Great books can do this really well.  It's just you, your computer, and the book.

That said, buy 2 books.  The first book should be a deep dive into the language you want to learn.  The second book should be the platform, SDK, framework the language is built with. 

Want to build web apps with Ruby on Rails? Buy a ruby book, read it cover-to-cover (typing everything), and then buy a Ruby on Rails book. Read it cover-to-cover (typing everything).

**Removing Training Wheels**
The most difficult jump you'll make will not be picking up the books and finishing them.  It'll be the transition from finishing the books to building a project on your own.  This is just a difficult jump to make, but here are a few things to keep in mind to manage that jump a little easier.

- Find an idea with a very small scope. The goal should be to complete a project, not build a huge game engine or fully-featured Digg clone.  Find 2-3 features and focus on each intently. 
- Don't give in under the pressure that you'll feel. When all else fails use a lifeline (call a friend, submit a post to Stack Overflow or here)
- Adjust the idea if needed.  It's fine realizing that a 3D game wasn't the right starting point for you.  Scale back and try something new. Don't get discouraged.

**Join a Team**
The moment you feel semi-comfortable within a language should be the moment you pounce on the idea of finding an internship or a junior developer position.  The key here is learning from those with much more experience than you. If you don't feel embarrassed you've made the jump too late.

If that isn't possible (you can't move, can't risk job security, etc) then find a friend or mentor to lean on.  Attending conferences are a great way to surround yourself with like-minded people. 

**Fight Self-Doubt**
The only thing you need is passion. A little fire in your belly.  If you really want to build apps for mobile devices don't let your mind tell you otherwise. 

Be honest with yourself. If you're not enjoying the code you're writing then adventure into a different coding realm. Maybe you *thought* writing a low-level game renderer would be fun! Once you got into it you realized it wasn't fun at all. So you pivot to something a little higher level and try that out for a while. Continue exploring to find your sweet spot.

What if, after 6 months or so, you've found that you don't enjoy coding? You cringe sitting in front of your computer. Well, don't fight it. Step back and re-evaluate your path. You'll be much happier in the short life we have.

**Build, Build, and Build**
I've invested so much time it's slightly maddening. When I began learning to code for iOS I spent 3 weeks, 12 hour days, highly focused on how to use a Mac, write Objective-C code, and use the iOS SDK. Once I got through that gauntlet I focused on building my first app.

Commit yourself.  Set aside a minimum of 30 minutes to just sit in front of your books and the monitor.  Make it a daily habit and set a goal for yourself--like write an iPhone app in 3 months. 

**Takeaway**
I don't want to sugar coat this--everyone is different.  Nobody will have the perfect answer for you since we all will approach what we do in our own unique way.  Some soak in knowledge easily. Others consume things much more slowly (me). Some love low-level code like game engine development. Others like higher level things like front-end web development or building social apps.

Stay focused. Enjoy the journey. 

I've expanded these thoughts [over on xmcgraw.com](http://www.xmcgraw.com/what-you-need-to-know-to-start-learning-how-to-code/), but this gets to the heart of the discussion.

What's your story? I'd love to hear your own keys to success in the early stages (how you approached everything).  Or, if things are tough, where are you having trouble?  I'd be happy to help / lend any advice I can."

2w7ivy,6,2015-02-17,Feeling like I'm behind?,BasedFollower,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2w7ivy/feeling_like_im_behind/,"Background: I'm a 2nd year student at a private university in the Midwest that isn't a great school, and especially in computer science. I could have transferred to another school, except I'm currently in athletics, which is the only reason I'm still at this school. Additionally, I never really got in to CS until this year, and thus don't have as much experience compared to others. So far, I've learned C++, Java, JS, Assembly and HTML/CSS from my coursework. However, I've only had a semester's worth to work on most of those languages (continuing C++ right now and I've studied Java in high school), and I feel that I don't know as much as others and I thus won't get hired for an internship this summer. We're just now starting to get into data structures, and haven't hit on things like Big-O (i.e. concepts that everyone knows). Plus, I don't have projects to talk about (or worth talking about), and I don't know where to start in order to become/make myself look proficiently skilled. Whenever I try to start learning, I end up feeling like I'm overwhelmed in that I'm trying to make myself learn too much at once (because I probably am) and need to learn one thing at a time. Except I don't know what to learn. 

So /r/cscareerquestions, I guess my question is am I really that behind? And what should I learn first in order to become proficient? Thanks for any responses in advance."
2w7jis,3,2015-02-17,Overwhelmed and would really appreciate some insight into my grad school app process.,[deleted],gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/2w7jis/overwhelmed_and_would_really_appreciate_some/,"Sorry if these posts are redundant here, but I really have no one else to talk to on this matter. 

I graduated from my undergrad back in may with a degree in business admin. I discovered industrial/organizational psychology on the way to graduation and felt like it was a solid career choice for me. I spent the time after graduation up until now living with the folks and working in our family business (saving money, researching programs/schools). I narrowed my choices down to several schools in the northeast (Baruch being my first choice, then university of new haven, hofstra, and a few others).

I have my resume, personal statement, and letters of recommendation ready to submit, yet i have not taken my GRE's. The university of new haven does not require them, but Baruch and the rest of the school does. Application deadlines are rapidly approaching for both schools (granted, i was told by an admissions rep that i can apply to Baruch up until the fall semester starts. 

I'm under a ton of pressure from family complaining a whole number of things, getting comfortable, not being focused, spent a whole ton of money to go to school and now your back home type of nonsense no one needs to hear when trying to make a difficult choice like this. 

This left me with two options, apply to university of new haven while i take my gre's and submit them to Baruch before the fall semester starts (praying I've done well enough with minimal preparation)

The other option would be to wait, hold off and prepare over the summertime and apply for the spring semester of 2016. 

I've been thinking lately however, that applying for the spring would mean i would need to ask my professor and internship coordinator (recommenders) to hold off once again as i need more time to prepare myself. I also was thinking about it and maybe it would be beneficial to try and find a job related to IO and what i want to study? Maybe by the time i work for a little i can get a fresh recommendation and more experience under my belt. 

Overall I'm extremely overwhelmed at this point and the pressure i deal with is slowly getting to me. Any advice or insight at all would really help me out. Naturally applying to graduate school isn't something that needs to or can be rushed in a short amount of time, yet at the same time i need to take a step forward, in any direction. 


Thanks for the read.

2w8493,8,2015-02-17,Big questions about Big Data,Ruled_by_everything,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2w8493/big_questions_about_big_data/,"Sorry for this long post and if information here can be Googled (my Googling skills could be much better). Using Reddit’s search engine, I found that there were a lot of questions on Big Data, but I sort of wanted to ask again so that I can cover all of my questions in just 1 post instead of multiple posts.

I’m an undergrad in Computer Science looking to branch from Software Engineering and move towards Big Data. 

The thing is that I’m still confused as to what Big Data is. I just think of Big Data as doing data analysis on literal large amounts of data, but apparently there is a difference between Data Analysis and Data Sciences (which is what Big Data falls under, I think).

So here are my questions:

1.	What are Big Data, Data Analysis and Data Science? What are their differences and nuances?

	•	I’ve tried Googling this, but I’m still pretty confused and see them all as the same thing.

2.	What kind of knowledge and tools are used in the Data industry?

	•	I use the term “Data industry” to include Big Data, Data Analysis, and Data Science.

	•	To my understanding, it would be nice to have a good background in mathematics or statistics along with a general CS degree, in terms of the necessary knowledge for the Data industry. What else would be helpful?


3.	What does the future of Data industry look like?

	•	Does the Data industry look like it’s going to stick around for a while?

	•	Is “Big Data” just another buzz-word that companies would like to see on resumes, but don’t actually understand?

	( This is sort of like when companies search for people with Computer Science degrees, but what they really want is a Software Engineer but cannot really tell the difference between the two. )

Just one more thing:

I currently have an internship where I work with data and would like to know where it falls under in the “Data industry”.

I write scripts in Microsoft SQL Server to complete requests for data retrieval. I also use Business Intelligence Development Studio (also called SQL Server Reporting Services, I think) and Microsoft Excel and Access to make reports and spreadsheets that automatically bring up pretty charts and tables for users."

Sound familiar?,Shoger41,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/2w8fvg/well15_years_of_schooling_and_i_have_no_idea_what/,"Well...15 years of schooling and I have no idea what I want to do. Sound familiar?

I know many in this world are not fortunate enough to attend school from an early age, or continue their education into college, for this reason I want to first acknowledge how spoiled I have been and how spoiled anyone is who has the opportunity to attend a structured education system.

With this said, I want to apologize, to myself and all those on this earth, because I was given the amazing opportunity to attend a well organized public school in the United States, as well as an amazing university, but I never took the appropriate time to realize exactly what I wanted and exactly how valuable these experiences were. This was, in part, my own fault, as well as the fault of the culture that the US educational and cultural systems embrace.

I grew up in a small town south of Boston, an average size community with a respectable public schooling system. I started with pre-school and slowly moved my way up to the public high school before being faced with the ultimate decision...where to attend college. The biggest decision of my life, decided at 18 years of age. Within this decision I had to figure out if I even wanted to continue school, what I wanted to study, what part of the country I wanted to be in, did I want to play a sport, and what I wanted to do with the rest of my life.

Quick summary: I went to a top 10 school in the country, played a sport, got a scholarship, majored in business, graduated and had no idea what I wanted to do. How did this happen, how did all of this schooling, training, and guidance lead me to a position where I had zero confidence in what I wanted to do in life.

As I mentioned before, this problem was in part my own fault and the fault of the US education and cultural structure. I will explain in a few different parts…

Part 1: Several other countries have periods of time between high school and college where individuals are required or pushed to take a small break from schooling to travel, explore, or learn anything they want. This ‘gap’ period was never known to me or many here in the US, it was expected that I graduate high school and immediately enroll at a university. I had never travelled, never held a ‘real’ job, and never figured out exactly who I was and what interested me. Instead I went straight to school and signed up for business classes from day one…

Part 2: Why business, because that’s what my family did, thats what my parents did, and that’s what my friends were doing. The town I came from consisted of stock brokers, private wealth managers, bankers, and a plethora of other professionals in the financial world. These are the people I talked to before entering college, these are the people that shaped my frame of reference. I did not know much else, but if I wanted to live a respectable life, start a family, and give them the same opportunity I had as a child it would be through a career in business. I had hobbies, I had passions, but I thought that’s all they were and could ever be...hobbies.

Part 3: Acknowledging a small spark in my head I decided to play in an area I have always referred to as the ‘Gray area’. I went to school and decided to enter the business school, but entertain my hobbies of building and designing things through a secondary minor in industrial design. It was at this moment that the first sense of freedom struck over me, knowing that maybe I could pursue my own path while also pursuing the path of ‘success’ as defined by my frame of reference…

Part 4: When someone plays in the gray area they often are trying to balance two things, to ideas, or two careers, and when it came time for my to apply for internships during my sophomore year I knew decisions would have to be made. So I spoke to the people I could, and sure enough they lead me to the belief that any respectable internship would be in business. 

The internships we have come to standardize in US culture are essentially an indentured service, an agreement of work for eventual freedom in the working world. These semesters of work have become the metric by which we gauge our undergraduate experiences. However, what are they truly meant for? Are they meant to give young professionals working experience and lead them to their full time job, or are they meant to give individuals insight and understanding of how the respected industry and career work? 

After speaking with several mentors I came across the best piece of advice I have heard to date. “Work for everyone and anyone, figure out not only what you love, but what you hate. Use the summers you have in college to talk to as many people as possible and explore exactly what type of person you want to be, and what type of career you want.” This advice lead me to redefine the track of internships and talk to anyone I could and weasel my way into the offices of several companies for ‘shadowing sessions’ in which I would work for a few weeks alongside an established employee. Through this I learned everything I needed to know about the industries I was in, all without the unnecessary responsibilities of getting coffee for people, stapling papers, or doing the busy work that full time interns we’re so clearly restricted to.

So I figured everything out, went back to school, pursued my new found passion, and lived happily ever after, right? Wrong. As I made my connections I spoke with professionals in every industry, from private wealth management, private equity, investment banking, global media, sports marketing, and more. However, after all was said and done I had still not seen everything, I still did not find the niche I wanted to exist in and pursue full time. So I went back to school and slowly fell back into the frame of reference where ‘success’ was defined by getting your job offer from UBS, Morgan Stanley, or one of the big 4 accounting firms. 

With friends and family looking on I applied, interviewed, and weighed my options. A fancy paycheck, world renowned organization, and excellent training program lead me to sign on with one of the biggest tech companies in the world, in their sales and marketing division. 

It took about 5 months, a bit of depression, and many internal conversations before realizing I had messed up somewhere along the 15 years of education. Everything I had worked towards day in and day out had led to nothing but a decent paycheck and the depressing stroll into work each morning. I refused to believe I was the only one with these thoughts, and as I began to open conversations with anyone around me I slowly realized the amount of people in the same position. Not just recent graduates, but individuals with families, established careers, and respectable titles all started to come out from behind closed doors and express their lack of passion and interest in their respected careers. Some were happy, some were passionate, but some, like me, felt they had never found the exact role they wanted. So do I just accept it, do I just ‘suck it up’ and accept that this is how the working world is, and always will be. 

Many chuckled, laughed, and just said ‘welcome to the real world’, but a select few spoke up, resonated with my thoughts and told me their stories and how they found their passion. After realizing that everyone in this world will give you advice, based on their own experiences and careers, I understood that individuals must take personal time to truly discover for themselves what they are passionate about, and only then can you seek the advice needed for your personal path. The path to happiness will not come from me, it will not come from your parents, and it will not come from your teachers, it will only come from your own exploration, your own determination, and your own dreams…

It was at this time that a small quote came across my dimlight computer screen that changed everything for me, appropriately labeled ‘The definition of hell’…

“Someone once told me the definition of hell: The last day you have on earth, the person you became will meet the person you could have become” - Unknown

I have come across my fair share of corny inspirational quotes, but something with this sentence struck me cold. If I was to have only a few moments left on earth, having spent my whole life working towards something I was never truly passionate about, what would I think as I met the second version of me, the one who took the time to explore the world, meet as many people as possible, assess and evaluate every possible career, and pursue the exact passion that I had always had buried within.

So here is my question to you: Who is that person you would meet on your deathbed?

I was fortunate enough to meet that second being, and at age 23, after months of working nights and weekends, assessing and refining my dream, talking to the people that matter, and forcing myself to think harder and longer than anyone else to be the exact person I want. As a result I quit my job, embodied my passion, and am currently starting my first venture, Jowl. I do not live the high life, I do not make millions, and I have not yet figured everything out, but I am living my dream and nobody elses.



I love connecting with people, I love hearing stories, and I would be more than happy to talk about who you are and what you want to do. So please feel free to reach out whenever. If you want to learn more about Jowl, or how I got to where I am today please take a gander at our site http://jowl.co/ and follow us on Twitter, Instagram, and my favorite Snapchat at: JowlCo

In fact, it’s very different. There are some similar things here and there, but it’s not what I went to college for and it’s miles away from all that I’ve learned in my internship. What I thought would be a job full of creativity and freedom now has me sitting in a dark room and punching numbers into a computer to get the same result day after day after day.

In a rather blunt way of saying it, I’m stuck. I’m unsure how to continue. The job in itself is not hard and the people are extremely nice where I work, it’s not making me miserable, but it’s certainly not making me happy with where I am at. My pay is low-ish 13.00 an hour. (I’m not salary). And my hours really prevent me from having a fantastic social life. (I work evenings). In addition, what worries me is the fact that there seems to be a rather high turnover in employees in the position where I am at. Now, this is also a good thing. People move in, up or out rather swiftly. (For any number of reasons)

Now, fresh out of college I fully expected not to land my “dream job” in my field. No way. That’s just not how it works. Also, I don’t expect to be making a huge amount of money in my first job or have the “prime” hours. On the flip side, my “title” at this current position can be a shining spot on my resume. 

But, the thing is that this current job isn’t exactly what I signed up for. I was expecting a creative job; instead I now sit on a computer all day punching numbers into a system to get that end “product.” It’s not hard, actually, once I got it down it was rather easy. But, like I said before, it isn’t what I was planning on doing. It’s not what I went to college for. It’s not what my freelance work was about, or my internship. It puts me in a rather odd spot.

So, at least for the moment, I’ve made a plan…

After six months, (the lease on my apartment), I’ll begin to look for a new job while *remaining* employed. While only a few weeks in, I can very much tell that this new position isn’t for me. It’s not where I wish to be in two to three years. (That and there is no position for advancement and with incoming student loans and a car payment, 13.00 isn’t exactly fine living).

So, why am I here?

Well, I’m simply seeking advice. Is this wise? What would you recommend doing in any professional manner?

Im a 19 year old college student. I attended an internship fair two weeks ago and received a few follow up interviews out of it. One interview in particular was a bit ""better sounding"" than the others. It is with a company (we'll refer to the company as ""Company X"") owned by a private investor, however he wants to pivot and he has an all inclusive marketing platform/software that will be ready in max 4 weeks time. The idea is that a small business pays under $100 /mo and receives complete and total marketing strategy and execution from Company X. (From my experience in the tech industry and from how he described this software to me and the teams he has working on it, it would cost upwards of $60,000+ for development). Oh and I almost forgot to mention, there will be a consumer side as well. On top of having all of your marketing taken over for under $100/mo you will also be featured on a local small business search engine he is building, that will be unique to your location (like yelp/groupon).



If you own a small business and don't have time to do as much or as effective marketing as you would like would you pay under $100/mo for someone to take it over and do it ALL for you? All you have to do now is worry about running your company. 



So my question is: if you were a small business owner (you could also answer hypothetically if you would like) would this service interest you? Thanks! "

Maybe my expectation aren't realistic, but only hearing back from 2 companies out of the 16 I talked to after a week, one of which interviewed me for an Internship that would have started immediately but didn't hire me, and the second that has not followed up at all after some initial contact, feels likes a failure to me. 

I think the biggest issue I have is finding jobs outside of the local area to apply to. Or even having something like a recruiter reach out to me. 

For a brief summery of my resume, I'll be getting a BS in Computer Science at FAU (A school in South Florida), I have been unable to get an internship, and have worked for Walgreens for about 7 years now. Also, maybe there is some flaw in my resume you guys could point out.

I have tailored my entire resume and work to getting a job in financial analysis, research, or trading after graduation, but my GPA is barring me from getting any decent job. I was not very mature in college. I disliked school because I felt like I was not learning anything new, so I spent most of my time at home learning code or other interesting things. 

I have a broad background of mathematical finance, derivatives, statistics, and programming. My finance experience is all internship based. I have worked at in algorithmic trading, quantitative asset management, and quant at a big investment bank. GPA was not an issue back then (it was not terrible nor did they even ask it). My resume looks very good, but most if not all firms have a GPA requirement for entry level (even if I get an interview, they often ask for GPA during). For instance, I have interviewed super days at Goldman and other top firms, but they always ask GPA.

My biggest weakness is I do not know corporate finance at the moment, but I am not sure how applicable it is because I am not applying for Investment Banking positions. I actively follow the markets and news. I read research and blogs on new instruments and notable industries. I take online courses to brush on stuff that could help (corporate finance, machine learning, data analysis, etc). Also, I do not believe I lack social graces.

At the moment, I reach out to alumni and friends. I reach out to even similar backgrounds of people I don't know. I cold-call businesses (that I can find). I score through my University's career site and Linkedin. I attend career fairs. I use blogs to find more companies. I try to network everywhere I go. Where else can I look? What other ways can I find open opportunities? I am considering hiring a headhunter, but I do not even know how to or if it will be worth it.

The recruiting cycle is mainly in the fall, which is over. This process is getting more dismal as time goes on.

tl;dr - Suggestions for where to look or try to pry my way into this industry? Good resume, bad GPA. 

Thank you.

The only thing I didn't know was how the computer systems on the Apollo missions worked, but that was more in the context of the conversation rather than a specific question he intended to ask so I think (hope) it won't be held against me. Anyway I digress.

So after reading a lot of posts on here I feel like I messed up in two areas. First, I didn't get the hiring manager's card or contact information. And I also didn't send a thank you not in part because I didn't have his contact info. So at this point would be it be better for me to send the thank you note to the HR rep that I initially talked to, or would sending it now make me look incompetent so should I just let it be and let the process work itself out?

In high school I did three sports, boy scouts, and interact club, but still did fairly well. I got into the four-year University I wanted which was out of state. Due to my father getting laid off, I made the financial decision for my family to come home after my first year. During my second Semester before I left the University my academics started to fail me. I was more focused on working out consistently and doing stuff with clubs then I was with getting my homework done. The material I was learning in class wasn't hard, I just never put in the time to do my assignments and failed because of it. I am living at home now and am going on my second year of working full-time at a retail store and going to school. I failed all of my classes this past semester because I prioritized my job, working out, and sleep instead of my homework. My classes are going a similar way this semester and I don't know what to do.

I enjoy computers, I built mine and took A+ certification class. I also like my chemistry classes when I study the material. In fact those are the only classes I pass. Everyone I interact with in my life tells me my strongest attribute is my hard work and knowledge of computers or chemistry. I just feel like I cant do anything with that. I have applied to other jobs where I can apply my knowledge and enthusiasm about those subjects but no one will take me because I don't have a college degree at least.

I would love to travel for work and do something dealing with chemistry or computers. I love interacting with people and rather not be stuck in a lab or doing maintenance or troubleshooting. I want to feel like what I'm doing means something to the world. Right now I just want to know whether I should try to continue with college. I should be a Junior but due to transferring schools and failing a couple classes I am a Sophomore. If I shouldn't waste more with college, what should I do? I am still trying to apply to more jobs but nothing is sticking. I am not limiting my options either, I have applied to everything from IT to Chemistry internships to other sales jobs.

tl;dr   I don't do my hw but work really hard at my job and hobbies. Should I keep trying and possibly failing college? How can I get a job in Chemistry or Computers without a degree?"

I absolutely bombed the phone interview, as I was dealing with a death at the time. I did not inform the interviewers of this, but I'm sure it came out that I was a terrible candidate. 

A few weeks ago, I saw the same job posted on a major job site (in a different office location than the first job) and applied, but have not heard anything. The job posting has now been renewed, and also expanded, as I found it on another site which I am 100% sure it was not on before.

My takeaway from this is that they did not have any suitable candidates who applied from the first time the job was posted, myself included.

I have everything they are asking for, and the only conclusion is that my first interview tarnished my reputation.

Twice in the past few years, I have had an email conversation with someone high up in the company (an employee, not someone in HR) where I solicited an internship. Although they were not offering any, I'm thinking of emailing this person and stating that I applied for the position with her firm, and explaining the situation.

Should I do this? Speak with HR directly? What should I say?

There is also one other avenue I am considering. After my dreadful interview, I had an internship with another firm in the same industry. I performed well there, and have references from that firm. This is a niche industry, and its likely that my references are acquainted with the person I emailed about the internship. Should I ask my references to reach out to her, and put in a good word?

I feel like there are a few different ways I could approach this, but need guidance. Thank you very much for your time and expertise."

If you like the idea of a startup style atmosphere with the stability of a profitable company, you'll be right at home.

We're crushing it with our expansion efforts and we have multiple entry level BA positions open for people with 0-3 years of experience.  May/June grads are welcome.  If you're local and want to intern part time before then, you're welcome to apply too.

The job starts as a split between ops and projects so (1) you get to figure out where you're taking your career, and (2) you get the domain knowledge that'll help you actually succeed in this field.  You'll learn how to use industry standard tech like Google Analytics, DoubleClick, Savicom, Pivotal, and more.  Projects range from feature development to UX/redesigns, lean tests, A/B tests, and other typical web/app development projects.  You'd work with an experienced dev on most projects.  Ops range from ad campaign management and related analysis, as well as assisting with some general biz responsibilities like invoicing and HR (because yes, you get a say in who you work with).  *This is not a sales job.*  (I feel like I have to say that because there are shady recruiters who try and wrap sales jobs up as something else).

Coding experience isn't required, but definitely encouraged -- basic HTML/CSS and JS/PHP are a plus.  SQL and R are definitely winners.  Again, it's not required, but if you pick it up (or already know some), you will progress faster.

Culture is ultra-relaxed, especially for the DC area.  Headphones, hoodie and flip flops are encouraged (well, when it's warmer out).  On-site only though, no remote.  Relocation okay.

I spend 10+ hours a week on CS1371, most of them in tutoring, but I horribly failed the first test and can't even do the homework without help.  Most inexcusable is MSE2001; I've heard it's an easy A.  It's strict memorization, but I got a 40 on the first test.

High school was medium difficulty for me, but I graduated with a 4.2 and was in the IB program.  I knew my grades would drop entering Tech as math and science were my weakest classes, but I didn't expect to be struggling to make C's.  I'm surrounded by people making As and Bs on all their tests, and my GPA isn't going to get me any internships or co-ops.

Do I not know how to learn or is something fundamentally wrong?  Every day I question why I'm here.  I love this place, but every day is more discouraging."
2wcz8d,4,2015-02-18,What Do I Have to Do to See a Psychiatrist?,Misterydwn,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/2wcz8d/what_do_i_have_to_do_to_see_a_psychiatrist/,"I was first diagnosed with a Depression 15 years ago. I am still waiting to see a psychiatrist for longer than two consecutive visits. In my brief encounters with a doctor, I have been diagnosed BiPolar, Borderline Personality Disorder, PTSD and ADHD. It's safe to say that my mental health gravely effects every aspect of my life.

I have dropped out of college about 9 times. I only have a year left for my bachelor's in accounting, however; I have run out of federal financial aid due to all the drop outs. I have had and lost over 50 jobs in the last 15 years. I have also moved around 60 times in the last 15 years. I am COMPLETELY unstable. I do not have custody of my daughter. I am often rude to people, simply because I am so f'ed up, I can't help it.
I desperately need to see a professional. 

So what's getting in the way? Let me tell you, a lot! Prior to Obamacare and my daughter, I did not qualify for medicaid. This means I had to keep a good job with health insurance long enough to get the insurance, usually 90 days. After finally obtaining the insurance, I then had to arrange for appointments, which usually require missing work. If missing work wasn't an obstacle, then I had to wait. First comes the intake appointment. Then comes the mandatory counseling sessions, often with interns. Then I waited for the psychiatrist's office to call, which takes weeks. Then the psychiatrist is booked out for months. By this time, I have had an episode, lost my job, ruined everything going good in my life and sunk down into the horrible abyss of depression. This has resulted in twice attempting suicide.

After my daughter was born, I qualified for Medicaid, as I do now. The problem with this situation is: EVERYONE qualifies for medicaid it seems. Plus, again, there are intake appointments - where they ask me horrible questions about my plethora of traumas. During one such visits, I was instructed not to cry over a dozen times because she knew she was asking awful questions. I did not cry, but at the end she refused to see me again because I had admitted I smoke marijuana.

After moving back to my parents, I am once again searching for a doctor. Hopefully not a family physician, but a psychiatrist. This doesn't seem to be in my cards though. Every private psychiatrist in my county and the surrounding counties does not accept medicaid. There are counseling centers who do, however; there are only two and I have not been able to stay in one place long enough to actually see the psychiatrist. I have all my meds prescribed through medical doctors. I am basically self-prescribing. I go into the appointment, tell them what I have been prescribed in the past and which I think will work. That's what I am then prescribed. RIDICULOUS. How do I know what medications I should and should not be taking? Especially since I am now on three different anti-depressants, two of which are at the maximum dose.

I just finally got through to a promising counseling center. Guess what? They are not located anywhere near me and were accidentally on the list.

I have no other options. I have no hope of ever receiving proper treatment. I am just going to continue trying to deal with everything, while probably being rude in public to innocent people. I hate that about me, which leads to a lot of suicidal thoughts. There are cruel people who will tell suicidal people to just do it. It's more complicated. I am jealous of the chic in Oregon with brain cancer that got to end her life with a simple medication. She went to sleep with those that love her present, and just drift off to sleep. She was suffering from a terminal illness that was horrific.

So am I."

Right now I need to make a very important decision regarding applying for college that will have a big impact on my goals.

I dropped out of high school in 12th grade due to serious health problems I experienced all through high school (undiagnosed gastrointestinal disease that was extremely painful and made high school hell). About 6 months ago I achieved full remission and can finally attend college and accomplish career goals. Despite having a difficult time in high school my a-g high school GPA is 3.68, I have a 2120 on my SAT, volunteer work with Habitat for Humanity, and am about to begin an unpaid internship with a local wealth management company as an analyst.

I have decided on Berkeley as my college because it is a great pipeline for west coast banking and Wall Street, which is where I want to work. The problem is due to my illness in high school I did not complete all of the a-g courses required for admission into the UC system. This is the only requirement I can't satisfy. I called the counselors office and they told me to explain in my essay the reason for this as best I can and hope for admission. If I apply in November and am admitted, I would start Fall 2016.

Another option would be for me to attend Santa Monica College which is the #1 transfer school to the UC system. As a junior college student, my requirements for a UC Berkeley transfer will be different and they will judge my academic performance at Santa Monica College instead of high school, so my chances of getting accepted are much higher. 

If I decided to attend Santa Monica junior college first and then transferred to UC Berkeley how badly would this hurt my chances of scoring good internships and upon graduation, getting a good analyst job at a Wall Street bulge bracket? Is this route even worth taking? Either way I'm going to be taking the Level 1 CFA in my junior year. I'm just worried I'll be looked down on by internship recruiters and will have trouble getting a job at a top IB out of college.

Any advice/guidance is greatly appreciated.

2wdhkj,3,2015-02-18,Joining a big tech company as an SDE - need advice about team 'selection',v0lta_7,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2wdhkj/joining_a_big_tech_company_as_an_sde_need_advice/,"I'm joining a top tech as an SDE in a couple of months time, and I'm in a difficult situation.

I'm joining the team I interned in, so I happen to know a lot about the people I'll be working with. I have a slight flexibility of choice between two sub-teams within my team. 

Team 1 - Aligns more to my interests (Data platform team)   
Team 2 - Aligns a fair bit to my interests (Web platform team)

I'm leaning towards Team 1 because my intern projects were in the same area. Here's the complication. The resident 'Data/BI expert' in the team is shit. Honestly it's a surprise how he's even surviving in this company. He plays his cards well, keeps the management happy, does a bit of work, piggybacks onto others and keeps collecting paycheques. I don't mean to boast, but me as an almost-graduated SDE know more about his job than he does (He's 27) (It is also possible that this is my inexperience speaking and there are a lot of such people around in every job). Every SDE who has worked with him is aware of the fact that he's not an engineer who can get things done.

Anyway, this person and I get along well; but I loathe the fact that I ended up picking up a lot of his slack (even as an intern). And I'm not sure if it's smart decision to put myself in the same situation again. But he is actually a good friend, I would hate to formally complain about him.

So a couple of questions:

1. Should I make a career-based decision and go with Team 1?  Team 1 is working on a few interesting data platform backends (I'm not sure about the exact technical term), a sub-field surely increasing in demand.

2. Or should I make a safer choice and go with Team 2, which still does very interesting work, I should add. This means no need to work with the above mentioned person, which of course means a smoother, less stressful experience.

What do you think reddit? Go with the heart or with the brain? Should I just learn to deal with such people or reduce risk and reduce the possibility of having an additional factor behind the already inevitable poor work-life situation?"

I could really use some advice because I'm really not sure what the consequences would be for the choice I have to make very soon. I have an offer from (let's call them) company #1 that's a bit lower than my university's average starting salary for my major. This isn't a huge deal to me because I switched my major from engineering, and I wasn't able to get internship experience in computer science (had 3 semesters experience in old major). Now, this offer requires action by the 23rd of February, but I just finished up 2 final round interviews today. One of these  2 companies I just finished interviewing with is my preferred choice. The 2 companies I finished interviewing with will likely not have a decision by the 23rd, and I tried to get an extension on my current offer from company #1 but was not able to secure one. So that is my dilemma. 

My choices are:

1. Accept offer and go to work for company #1 likely taking reduced pay

2. Accept offer from company #1 to secure a job then turn them down if I get my preferred choice (is this acceptable? am I legally bound in any way?)

3. Turn down company #1, possibly not receive any offers and be SOL

Now I realize I would not be completely screwed if the choice 3 route happens, but I have completed 10+ interviews from this round of job applications (through university career fair) which is a considerable amount of effort. I would very much like to secure a job right now, so I can focus on school work and graduation once again. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. No one has any clue what I should do and neither do I."

I'm using an alternative account to post this because in honesty, I'm pretty embarrassed by my job status. Regardless though I'm mainly a lurker on reddit so forgive me if I do something naive. 
Allow me to introduce myself. I am ForHire1234, a recent(?) college graduate out of work and in debt (shocker). I say recent with apprehension, as I graduated nearly 1 year ago (May '14). 
I'm going to do my background in bullets so it's easier for everyone.

- Went to local (county) college for 4 years.

- Worked at military base as a civilian student-hire. I extended my stay at local college (double majored) so I could continue working here and raising money for university. 

- Raised over $10k in savings after working a year on military base, was let go because they cut funding for the program. 

- Graduated my local college debt free, with 2 AA's: Communications and Journalism.

- Transferred to state University, and lived on campus (for 2 years) Majored in Public Relations and Advertising. Not thrilled about this choice. 

- Accrued nearly $50k of debt between federal and private loans. High interest rates and bad financial choices is why this number is so high. 	

- Got involved in campus, PRSSA, student run firms, committees, good with professors and made lots of friends and connections, went to conferences. 

- Graduated May 2014 Cum Laude, no job lined up, rather internship lined up instead.

- Started post-grad (unpaid) internship for a local non-profit in 2 different departments. They pay me allowance per day. I was also given a small part time (1 day/week) position where I am paid hourly.

- Almost 10 months post grad, 25-year-old me is still interning (5 days a week)

Unfortunately, while I loved it in college and was seemingly great at it, I'm not a fan of PR and don't want to focus on it for my career. Instead, I'm trying to hone in on the skills I've learned from taking leadership positions along with my current interning experience. I don't mind communications-based fields but I'm not a fan of the PR culture as a whole, if that makes sense. I've been trying to get into state government entry-level jobs but am not getting any bites so far. A lot of these are analyst titles, so I am not sure if my PR degree is holding me back from that. None of them require experience.

I don't mind my internship per se, but after 10 months and half way to 30 it's a bit degrading. I've learned a little bit, but it's mostly menial work. I really want to start using the skills I've learned for an actual career!

I'm also afraid my federal experience is going to be too old to talk about pretty soon. I was laid off from that job about 4 years ago due to no fault of my own (everyone in the same position was laid off) Also, when I fill out applications I have no supervisor to record as they've either retired or moved around in rank (Air Force Reservists).

I’m pretty lost and getting a bit anxious as to what to do. I'm not trusting of job boards as I and friends have been scammed and many of those postings are dodgy at best.
A few plans I am thinking of or working towards:
- Contact my college and university for some help (but I'm not confident there)
 
- Participating in job fairs – there is one in my area in June. 

- Continue looking online – I mainly look for state government jobs online since this is the only way I could apply. Other jobs in the private sector I assume are either scams, or my resume is going into an even bigger bottomless pit than my public sector applications.

- Considering going back to local college for a certification in accounting

I’m really anxious lately and could use some advice based on my situation. I didn’t make the best choices, especially financially but I am trying to look toward various means to find work. Networking has also been a bit difficult as of late, because most of my college friends are also struggling and my non-college friends could only get me into retail. FWIW, my internship allowance probably pays the same as retail and I’m getting better experience, so I wouldn’t want to go that route.
I want to change up my career plans and not focus solely on PR, but also look into administrative work, clerical, analyst jobs, handling memberships/records for organizations. Anything office related really (that I am qualified for of course) Any tips, suggestions welcome. I could use the advice! 



Thanks r/jobs!

2we0kp,8,2015-02-18,TIFU by buying a car from Craigslist,Sealioness2010,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2we0kp/tifu_by_buying_a_car_from_craigslist/,"Four weeks ago I bought a car from a guy on craigslist.  He seemed like a normal guy, just selling a normal car.  It was a 2005 Honda Civic. Nothing exciting.  I took it to a mechanic and they had it checked out - there was a small list of things I had to replace from wear and tear, but nothing outrageous.  It was listed for $5000, but I got him to accept $3800.  Feeling pretty proud of myself, and happy to FINALLY have a car again, I got in it and commenced the 2.5 hour ride back home.  

As I was driving through city traffic - it was stop and go - my new car started making this terrible noise.  Or at least, that's when I noticed it (thinking back, I don't recall hearing the noise when I test drove it around the block a couple times, and when I drove it to the mechanic's shop.  I guess the mechanic didn't hear it either when he drove it up onto the platform in his shop.)  It's a standard, and as those of you know driving a standard in heavy, stop and go traffic on the highway is not fun.  I thought, well maybe the noise will go away after a while.  Maybe it's just because the car hasn't been driven in a while (which it hadn't).  Needless to say the noise did not go away.

When I got home, I had my mechanic friend take a listen to it.  ""Yup, that sounds like the transmission.""  Perfect.  My new car, and now I have to take it to the transmission shop.  So I did... on Tuesday... January 20th... I still don't have my car back, and it's February 18th.

Here's what happened: the transmission guys took a week to take apart my transmission.  They found a bearing that was bad and the spring on my clutch that needed to be replaced, but the mechanics weren't satisfied because neither of those things should have been making that particular noise.  They had every transmission mechanic in town look at the transmission to find any other possible things that could be wrong with it. But no one found anything. So they just decided to replace the bearing and spring thing and put my transmission back together.  

It still made the noise.  So my mechanic friend's boss (who is super knowledgeable about cars and such) took it for a drove and decided it might be something in the engine.  So I paid the transmission guys and my mechanic friend took it to their shop where they proceeded to take apart the engine.  They found flecks of metal dusk in the oil (which is apparently never a good sign) and took apart the engine.  They found some wear in a place where there's not supposed to be wear (apparently this wear was caused by the aforementioned bad bearing in the transmission).  They told me they could either rebuild the engine, or just put a whole new one it.  They went with the new engine, which has 25,000 less miles on it... but costed a pretty penny.

The new engine was finally put in and everything was put back together last week on Wednesday.  But... the noise was still there.  So the mechanic (who had recommended the transmission guys I went to in the first place) took the transmission back to the transmission guys and said ""what the heck!??"" (and probably some other colorful terms I will not repeat). They took the transmission apart again.  Went over everything again with a fine tooth comb.  Balanced, weighed, inspected every little gear.  Nothing... except that same bearing they replaced the first time. It was bad again. Sooo something in the transmission was causing that bearing to go bad (even in only 20 miles of driving with the new bearing).  The transmission guys offered to rebuild my transmission - but that might not fix the problem, since they don't even know what the problem is!! So my mechanic friend's boss decided to just buy a new (used) transmission and just stick that in the car.  That's what I learned this morning.  The transmission should be in on Friday, and hopefully I'll get my car back by this weekend!!

But that's not all.  This whole time... I've been driving a rental car.  And I'm pretty sure it's going to come out to around $1500.  The transmission guys charged my $1000 (they cut off some of the price, since they didn't actually fix it the first time). And I'm pretty sure the mechanic shop will be around $2000 (they're also giving me a break, because they're nice and this is just a sucky situation).  Aaaand - I literally moved 150 miles away when all of this started for this new UNPAID internship I'm now doing.  So I have no reliable income, and this car will have cost me over $8000 when all this is said and done... I could have bought something much nicer than an '05 Civic for $8000!!!  On the bright side though, I'll have probably the best and most valuable 2005 Honda Civic in town.

TL;DR I bought a car on Craigslist.  It needed a new engine and transmission. Now I'm broke."

You probably know what the problem is: a right to work in US. I am not familiar with this process but the idea is this: get a visa and then apply for internships in the US for the summer(or even year long if possible) because most companies I researched have a clear statement of ""must have a right to work in US"". I found that there is a J1 visa but since I am not familiar with intricacies of obtaining it, does anyone have experience in getting it or some other means in order to be allowed to work?

That would really help since I always wanted to visit US + many opportunities exist there and a selection of companies is so much bigger than Europe."

As part of the development process I was researching software that is similar to what I'm going to develop, to use as a framework/point of reference. Also to prevent myself from re-inventing the wheel, so to speak. However, I stumbled upon a free, open-source program that does EXACTLY what the company has hired me for to make for them.

So... I don't really know what to do. I'm positive I should just tell my supervisor that they can just use this, instead of having me create a shittier version of the same software. But I don't want to have to look for a different company to intern at.

I need your advice. In 2012 I moved to Madison, WI for two reasons 1) To live with a man I was dating at the time who had a cushy job there and 2) To find employment in the local foods/food systems planning community. The man and I are no longer together for various reasons and while I created a great network of those involved in food issues in Madison, I never found employment in the field. While in town I took a job at an agency serving those on TANF that had recently received a grant to expand their program from 10 counties to 80 counties in less than four months. Needless to say this transition was very chaotic for everyone involved and as an administrative position I was expected to teach those who knew nothing about the program how to run it while not knowing anything myself (I'm from Ohio, not Wisconsin so I didn't even know the history or politics behind the program). Everyone on my team was new and I was the youngest person there. Suddenly I was supposed to be a leader without knowing what the hell I was doing. 

While the job itself was chaotic, I felt bullied by my boss and indirect coworkers all while undergoing an unraveling relationship at home in a city where I knew no one. I had taken the job because I needed money and the salary was decent (by social worker standards at least). It had absolutely nothing to do with food work, one of the reasons I came to the city in the first place. Being right out of graduate school with little professional experience (other than internships) I was consistently scared of screwing up and doing something wrong so I went to my boss for everything and copied her on every email I sent. While I was being yelled at for doing things I thought I should be doing (and also to keep myself busy during downtimes) my direct coworkers (one of whom was extremely supportive) received consistent praise for their work. This combined with the stress at home, made me extremely depressed and I stopped caring about things like my personal appearance and hygine. The straw was when I asked my boss to provide any feedback she received and she sent me a nasty email about how coworkers were saying I smelled, looked like a slob, and had bad breath (yes the really told my supervisor that). In the midst of all of this I had identified that I wanted to try for a job with less responsibility and a lower salary and had one of the worst interviews for my life. Needless to say I did not get the other position and left the management position soon after the email went out. 

In the two years since leaving this company I have remained in contact with some of those I met in the food community while I lived in Madison, including a professor at UW. Also, I recently learned that the agency I worked for has several openings and recently obtained to a new grant focused on the Food Stamps Employment and Training Program. Also through linkedin searches and the facebook ""people you may know"" function I learned that several of those who caused me problems are now gone, including my former supervisor. 

When I left, I left on good terms and if I remember correctly may have complained about the rollout, but no one in particular. A call to HR confirmed that I am ""definitely eligible for rehire"" and ""encouraged me to apply"". I also have been in recent contact with my professor friend at UW about potential PHD funding, but will not be eligible for admission until 8/2016, so I need something to do till then, if I get in. 

The question becomes this. Does this community think I should apply for the jobs in the FSET program considering they pay well, have upward mobility, and have pretty awesome benefits (things that don't happen in the nonprofit world) and also would allow me to establish Wisconsin residency for graduate school. I am just concerned that the experiences of the past will come to bite me in the ass.

2wgczf,0,2015-02-19,The nature of paradigm shift in the computer science industry means future generations are totally screwed?,KarateJons,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2wgczf/the_nature_of_paradigm_shift_in_the_computer/,"Hear me out on this.  So let's use Microsoft .NET framework as an example.  In the 1990's to 2002, the .NET framework did not yet exist.  From what I can tell, C++ was dominant back then, and Java was just getting off the ground.

Then, according to [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET), in 2002 the first version of the .NET framework was released.  This means, if a modern job posting wants ""10 years of experience"" in .NET framework, then basically they're looking for someone who's been using .NET since at least 2004 to present.

However, the nature of the computer science industry is that there are so many technology stacks, frameworks, languages, and they are constantly changing, shifting, and evolving, that's it's really hard to find someone who meets 100% of any of the outlandish laundry list of requirements slapped together by HR morons on the job postings.

It seem the only way to get a job in this day and age is to already have 3-5 years of experience doing that exact same job, or similar.  Few companies are hiring at the entry-level anymore, they all want people with ""more experience.""  They all want to hire people away from their competitors instead of hiring junior young people who might make mistakes or not be able to develop code fast enough.

In terms of being able to get jobs in this industry post-2008 recession, the state of the industry is so bad that even people who did things correctly, majored in computer science, graduated summa cum laude with a 3.9 GPA, had internships during school, get relegated to working in crap QA positions after they graduate because they can't find jobs as developers or software engineers, because they either can't get past the hard technical interviews (there is a giant disconnect in terms of knowledge and experience between someone fresh out of school and someone with 2-3 years experience in the industry), or because academia didn't respond to industry fast enough and was teaching bullshit general computer science chock full of unnecessary math courses, when they should have been teaching web and mobile development.

So the true question, how really screwed are the future generations? Of the kids who are growing up today, those few who are smart and farsighted enough to major in computer sciency subjects when they attend college, instead of bullshit liberal arts degrees not worth the paper they're printed on, only a select few of them will even be able to have jobs, and those will be crap QA glorified computer janitor jobs.

The kids will also be spoiled by these mobile phones and mobile devices, and lack a true understanding of ""desktop-related"" computer science, low level, assembly, managed code, and such.  Those few who will actually manage to get jobs in web development, mobile development, or the next paradigm at that point, will not be true software engineers, they'll be script kiddies using programming ""languages"" like HTML\CSS\JavaScript and they'll be lacking a fundamental understanding of data structures and design patterns since web development is so lighthearted that it cannot even be considered ""real"" development by ""true"" software engineers."

I work in educational technology and have worked at a medical school as a senior educational technologist for the last three years as well as a freelance web designer.  During this time I've been able to work on some projects as a front-end developer utilizing HTML5, CSS3 and some working knowledge of javascript and jQuery.  I have also done some light back-end work with mySQL and PHP.  I found that of all my job functions, I've enjoyed front-end development the most and would like to pursue a more direct career path in that role.

I come from an educational background in interactive media and game development so I have a design oriented skill set (Adobe CS, Balsamiq, Unity, Processing, Maya, Z-Brush) with a strong technical background (HTML5, CSS3, LUA and working knowledge of javascript, jQuery and OOP).

I am looking to fill a full-time position, either as an intern or an entry-level front end web developer where I can utilize my current skills and continue to improve my designs and technical abilities.  

You can view some selected works at www.kylehorndesign.com/work.html and I have other samples that I can send upon request.  You can also get a copy of my current resume on the site as well.

Thanks and I look forward to hearing from you,

Essentially, here's where I stand.

Last summer I interned at a major company (think apple, google, facebook etc.). I turned down the return offer because I wasn't a huge fan of my team and am now in grad school. I applied for internships as usual, and unfortunately did not get... one...single...offer.


Essentially the only companies that were willing to respond to me due to my experience were the major companies, and I managed to get RIGHT UP to the final rounds for all of them only to get shunned in the final round.

Now I'm lost. Emotionally, mentally... I was originally thinking of going through thailand and laos, but now I'm hearing that trying to do that in the summer is miserable because of monsoons. Then I thought I'd work on my project, but my initial project idea was denied by my advisor and now I'm doing something that in no way will take all summer.

My question now is, what do I do? How do I make this summer worthwhile? I can get a part time TA job that will pay all my bills and leave me with a lot of free time but I don't want to leave this summer without finding some way to further my career.

I know that this is the situation for the majority of college graduates, but alas I would greatly appreciate a read through if you would like.

...
 

I am a second semester senior at a top-tier university in NY concentrating in Finance and Marketing with a 3.33 GPA currently. I have asset management internship experience (two summers, two winters at the same small firm), I've had many on-campus involvements as well. I've been a Resident Assistant position for two years. I believe this position has taught me a lot (everything from crisis response, to conflict resolution, to administrative tasks, etc...).


The place that I interned was great and was ideal to work at but they do not have space for another employee unfortunately. 


At this point I've applied to over 115 jobs via my school's Careernet, indeed.com, headhunters, and other individual private / public sector positions. I've had 5 or so in person interviews and a couple of phone interviews. 


The greatest issue I suppose is that they all want an immediate hire. I am able to work maybe 15 hours a week during this school year, but after graduation I have to figure out an apartment, I have to get on my feet (parents will not be allowing me to move back home unfortunately). 


I anticipate my preferred start date to be July 13th - I figure this is more than enough time to figure out all the post-graduation details, be able to take two weeks truly off after the whirlwind that was college (the RA job is truly involving and it takes a lot of effort on top of classes). 


I'm not looking for a massive salary that some of my peers desire. Anything 40k+ is more than acceptable for me. I would love to work for a place that has a decent work/life balance and a welcoming company culture - I couldn't see myself working in Investment banking where the employees are consistently pulling all-nighters in a cut-throat environment, and destroying their health in the meantime - that doesn't inspire me.

**What can I do? Waiting until May to start looking for jobs is pushing it - it seems prudent to begin this process early which I'm attempting to do. Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated!**

For years they've not had a website (on purpose), but with recent changes to their business model they decided they need one. I'm a paid intern (part time) right now, but if I impress the boss/fill a niche, I'll have a full-time position here. 

So I've kind of stumbled into a great opportunity here. I love HTML, CSS, code of all types (and I enjoy learning new things). No one else here has the ability or the time to create this website, so I'm on my own with the code, and I've already been tasked with working on it. I have a solid basis in HTML and CSS, and have experience with Java and C++, so I'm not unfamiliar with coding and dev itself- just the professional environment. 


 I'm on Windows 8.1, I have Powershell (and am definitely not afraid of the command line), and am generally familiar with linux and vm's. I've been scouring this sub for several days, but I need more specific help- I've never developed professionally before, so I'm not sure on the ins and outs, and there's not really anyone here who can assist me in that. 


 I think a framework might be a good way to go about building the site more rapidly, but I'm stuck on which one to use. I'd like to use Sass, since it should make everything way easier to maintain on such a large site. 


 I will be able to try to persuade the business to purchase software (within reason), and they already have the domains and hosting plan set up so I don't need to worry about that- they used them with placeholder for quite a while. People here are gathering the information/graphics/etc and the sitemap is already mostly complete (going through the final revisions right now). 

**Here are my questions for /r/webdev:** 

* How do I go about setting up the most efficient environment for local web development? Recommend me text editors, Sass compilers, whatever you think I need to be successful in writing good, modular, easily-updated, well-documented code (HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript, etc)

* Should I use a framework? If so, which do you recommend? 

* What sort of testing should I be doing? 

* What tips can you share with a new-to-professional-environment-web-dev? 

* Should I integrate version control? If so, which do you recommend?  

* What else do I need to know? 


* Am I forgetting anything big?

Personally, my internship last summer (and to be fair, my only engineering internship so far) was boring as hell. I enjoyed manual-labor intensive summer jobs more (think moving boxes around and bagging groceries) because at least you felt satisfied that you were doing work that needed to be done, however simple it was, and because you could hang out and banter all day, which helps most during the slower hours.

My engineering internship however, I probably spent 80% of the time sitting at my desk pretending to do work. I asked my manager for probably the first six weeks if he needed help with anything, and he always said ""just sit tight, the work should pick up soon"". Yeah.... it never did. A lot of the other people I worked with besides my manager were.... not exactly jumping out of their seats to help me either (not saying they were douches or anything, just not very enthused to have to work with me on a small project, or explain to me something that seemed simple to them). Plus, the meetings were just unbearably boring and half the time I knew nothing since they used so much jargon which I had no chance to pick up since I was new.

School on the other hand, is sometimes infuriatingly difficult or frustrating, usually because courses are poorly taught or homeworks/exams are poorly designed, however at least I feel like I'm being challenged. Even when it's 4am and I'm working on a problem set there's at least a set objective that I need to accomplish. Also just the school environment is a lot more social, I enjoy working in groups for projects, or even just when doing homework, I have plenty of things to do on the weekends, oh, and I'm in at least a somewhat urban environment unlike most engineering locales for manufacturing (midwest, where the land is cheap).

I'm not saying I'd rather be a undergraduate engineering student for life over being an engineer. In the former you have to pay tens of thousands of dollars a year while in the latter you're getting paid tens of thousands of dollars a year. Well, maybe I am saying I'd rather be a student than an engineer if it didn't mean I would swim in debt forever. I'm considering getting a PhD now more than ever,  because even though academia research is slow and boring as well, at least I know I enjoy and thrive in a university environment rather than a corporate engineering environment. Plus you get to choose what you research to some extent when you apply for schools and find professors with similar research interests, whereas at work you do what they assign you, and they can reassign you at their whim anytime.

I realize I'm ranting now, but I'm just curious as to y'alls experience with internships (or even full-time jobs?) compared to being in college."

Secondly I am just going to say that I am so bad at commitment right now I am almost positive I wouldn't kill myself anytime this week so it's not an uber emergency but it is really appealing. 

I left college a year ago because I was dumb I had no direction. I went to the local University and took out a 13k loan. Around August I moved in with my older cousin to try and get a job and some time to think. I ended up leaving the job I got there within a few weeks because I hated it. I sat around for two months thinking and hating myself. I realized that I really want a career in computers. 

I decided to move back home around November seeing that there were almost no jobs where my cousin was. I got a temporary job in December that I wanted to quit but thankfully my parents made me stay. I started feeling like I was kinda going somewhere and was hoping to get working on it certification. Then I fell into not wanting to do anything and procrastination like always. It's been 3 months with no job I'm just a lazy pos. 

An army recruiter called me about 4 days ago and the proposition seemed appealing. I met with him and we talked things over my parents said that I don't have to join but I kept thinking it was a good idea. In 6 days I'm supposed to go see him again talk over what job I could get take the entry test and get a medical evaluation. I started getting cold feet yesterday. I can't sleep and I start really second guessing myself. 

My parents were being kind and they've said I don't have to and can think about it my options are open. They said they just want me to work even just volunteer work by the end of the month. I don't deserve them. I'm sitting here depressed again for no reason thinking how am I going to get an it job or survive working fast food when I'm this big of a pussy and stress out over Manning the register and fuck up like I did at the gas station. I suck at fucking everything. 

Everyone around me is doing all this advanced stuff except for a few of my cousins and one friend. I don't want to go nowhere and be like either of my cousins. Ones 35 alone and poor and the other quit college joined the army and dropped out and works at a bowling alley. I don't know how people like my parents are successful. 

The fucked up thing is even just specialization into a career scares me. Certification tests and being an intern. I hate paperwork and phone calls and I know I'll get yelled at all the time because I can't complete simple directions. 

I'm afraid of wasting the recruiters time and plus he said if I didn't fill out my security form I have to do 100 push ups which I can do but for some reason is crippling scary. I just wanted to be like my dad and accomplish something for once and now like usual I want to quit because I know I can't do it and I'm freaking out. 

I've already become a disappointment to the family I can't do it anymore. I know I can't function in society or live how I want. I feel trapped so I might as well end it. But I feel like that is selfish and they'd be mad and maybe sad. I don't want to hurt anyone I just want to end all this. 

I'm sorry for the bad formatting and jumping all over the place with my paragraphs I fucking dropped out for a reason. I'm sure no one will message or anything which is fine I'm just another over sensitive bitchy gen y kid. Yall are very selfless in helping people and I appreciate that."
2wjorc,48,2015-02-20,Acquiring a raise,Competi,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/2wjorc/acquiring_a_raise/,"I was hired initially as a contractor back in the Summer, and due to my age it was suggested that I was paid an interns wages. I ended up contributing far more than was expected of me, and was frequently told that I leveraged greater responsibility and wrote more valuable software than other contractors who were paid nearly five times my daily wage - this included developing a mobile website application, but mainly involved building fairly complex back-end applications. Obviously I feel tremendously underpaid, especially when I'm told that my service at ~120 USD per day is more valuable than another developer's contribution (working for 600 USD per day). 

The thing is, I've been offered equity in the company - let's say it's  several percent, complicated by a clause which states shares cannot be sold for x amount of years (probably 3-5). However, with no real wage increase. I'm essentially being asked to gamble on the success of the business whilst being severely underpaid - even if it is a success after five years, how can I be expected to live on these wages in the mean time. This doesn't seem fair to me, what do you think? How should I approach this situation? Thanks!"

Last summer, I had a great internship at a tech startup near home.  Great company, culture, etc. led to a wonderful experience.  I ended my internship on great terms, and was told that I would be invited/welcomed back next summer if I wanted (which I have kept in mind ever since).

However, I followed an opportunity with a large technology consulting firm, and that opportunity had developed with me getting an interview, getting the second interview, and now waiting 3-4 weeks (at this point only 1-2 weeks) for a response from the recruitment committee.  This opportunity is significantly different than my previous experience, and both of them have huge benefits in different ways. 

My plan over the past few weeks was ""ok wait to hear back from (new company i interviewed with) and then reach out to (previous internship company) and thank them for staying in touch but tell them i'm going to pursue an internship with another company""

Well, plans got derailed when I got an email this morning from my previous boss, asking me what my plans were for this summer, and including the positions available to me at the company from last summer.  I'm stressing out because I dislike being in situations where I can potentially burn bridges--even though it's the last thing I ever want to do.  

What is the best way to handle this situation?  I truly want to wait and hear back from the consulting firm, however, if that doesn't work out, I would absolutely love to work at the same company from last summer.  How do I express that without making it seem like last summer's company is a ""plan b"" type thing?


**TLDR: Interned last summer, applied to a new company this summer, waiting to hear back after interview, old company boss emailed me asking my plans for this summer, giving me options to work with them again, have to wait another 1-2 weeks to hear back from interview, how do I handle without burning bridges**"
2wkx4w,3,2015-02-20,TIFU by sitting down with a guy at a bar,TastySaturday,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2wkx4w/tifu_by_sitting_down_with_a_guy_at_a_bar/,"So last night (or this AM) I decide to go out with a group of my buds and hit up two of our favorite bars just right off of campus. We head to the first one and decide it's time for a change of scenery after a couple of hours, so we head to the second bar. The first bar is one that a lot of people go to, but is mainly dominated by fraternity guys and sorority girls, whereas the second one is more of a free-for-all for all students with a possible creepy older guy every now and then. Both are almost completely college bars, so anyone who is older than mid-twenties is rather out of place. 

While we're at bar #2, I find one of my other friends that nobody else in my group knows so I hang out with him for a bit then realize that my group I came with left me. It's almost 3 AM, but it's no big deal. I was going to get a ride home from one of my friends anyway. So I go to this quieter, separated part of the bar that's more in the foyer, to call my friend to come pick me up. He doesn't answer so I figure I'll just have to walk home in the cold. Not too bad since I'm already pretty drunk and have a decent beer blanket on.

That's when this average looking guy sitting at the bar stops me and tells me to sit with him. I'm thinking that he probably just wants someone to talk to so I oblige. He asks me my name and orders a beer for each of us. I'm surprised by this gesture so I thank him and he begins asking me questions about what I do. I told him I'm a student but am currently working as an intern in my final semester. He seems surprised and almost disappointed that I'm as young as I am. He was probably just looking to make a friend closer to his age, but I'm 22 and he looks to be about 28. We talk for a couple more minutes about where we're from and he tells me that he's a ballroom dance teacher. I thought that was different but who am I to judge? Then he starts to ask me stranger questions, like whether he would know my dad, even though we're from completely different cities and then told me he thought he recognized me by my face and my hand placement. I'm getting weirded out by this guy but trying to stay conversational since he was nice enough to buy me a beer. Then out of the blue he asks me ""Why are you here?"" I have no clue what this is supposed to mean. This city? This bar? This part of the bar? I explained that I came with my friends but they left without me and he said the same thing happened to him. He then begins talking about how ""our family"" and ""our dad"" doesn't know we're here. I ask, ""Whose dad?"" and he replies with ""All of ours"". I'm beginning to feel very uneasy now as he proceeds to order us some shots after the bartender called for last call.

 At this point the questions have gotten so strange that I don't even know what he's trying to accomplish by buying me drinks, so I start to get ready to leave this guy. As I tell him I'm going to head out and I shake his hand, he drops something. He bends over to pick it up and very intentionally touches my thigh. All of a sudden the dots are connecting and I realize that I've been getting hit on for the last 10 minutes. 

I become way more anxious to leave, now, while trying not to be rude, as this was likely just a misunderstanding. But then he became extremely persistent that I stay and I had to keep repeating that I've had enough and need to go home. Even the bartender starts to pressure me into staying but I keep backing away until I'm finally able to hurry out the door. 

I'm not a homophobe by any means and have plenty of gay friends, but this experience kind of rattled me. I've always thought I'd feel flattered if a gay man ever bought me drink and I would simply explain to him that I'm straight, but in this situation, with how demanding this guy was, it made me feel so unsafe and uncomfortable and almost even guilty for not realizing what was happening. If I learned anything, I now feel like I have a new understanding of what women go through every time they get hit on at a bar or party without knowing the man's intentions. I also learned how to identify if I'm being hit on by a dude, too, I guess.

tl;dr Got hit on by a gay guy and thought I was going to be taken advantage of, but ended up gaining a new perspective."

Until recently, my resume simply listed programming languages and operating systems in order of proficiency, from highest to lowest. Technologies which I had only dabbled in were not included. 

Several people recommended that I provide an indication of how well I know the technologies listed, so I added qualifiers in parentheses. Now it looks like this:

    Languages:          C (skilled), Assembly (MIPS, x86), Java (proficient)

    Operating Systems:  Linux (skilled), Windows (proficient)

But I have no clue if this is accurate or not. Am I actually 'skilled' with Linux, or just 'proficient'? Is there a more accurate word in between? I may be 'skilled' relative to my peers, or relative to how long I've been programming, but I'm certainly *not* 'skilled' relative to a veteran programmer. I don't know which interpretation most people will take. If I am too modest about my skills, I might not get an interview. If I inadvertently exadgerate, an interviewer might see me as arrogant or dishonest. 

I list two projects on my resume, both in C, which hopefully demonstrates that it is my prefered tool, and that I'm at least half-way competent in it. But it isn't practical to include a project for every technology I know. My best Java and Assembly programs aren't nearly as good as my best C programs. And I don't really have a Linux project; I have a jumble of scripts, tricks, and one-liners acquired from many months of playing around with the command line and using it for development... 

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!"

I'm looking for a new job; trouble is I don't know what it is. 
I'm employed; I have been more often than not since graduating, as a contractor, as a freelancer sometimes,
and as an employee who made reasonable if never excessive wages.
I work in project support in lengthy public sector IT projects, have for a while, and I increasingly find that these jobs are not what I want to be doing.  I'm cut off from the kind of work my internship in the field covered, and due to the size and complexity of the department I work in, I never see the customers, end users or people I'm delivering for. The pay is fixed as a contractor, without much chance to get noticed for successful delivery, due to big, dispersed teams. There's also a LOT of bureaucracy to deal with (public sector).

For three years now I have tried unsuccessfully to transition into customer-facing roles, like sales (which I did 
for a few months after graduating until I moved) procurement, project management (which I'm perfectly qualified on paper to do), service delivery roles-ANYTHING where I'm face to face with the end-user, negotiating, making recommendations, delivering solutions, adding to the bottom line-being a people person in some field that helps develop the business, not just someone who takes orders.

I'm now only really qualified for jobs I don't want to do; what's a job where I can be in touch 
with the people my services are meant to help? 
I.e., when I was in sales, I spoke to the clients every day,  I took time to understand the industry
and the issues, what solution  would be best and how to implement it.
If I was in procurement, I'd be face to face with suppliers, discussing contracts and SLAs.
There's more to it than just that, but does that make sense? 

TL:DR-I don't feel like I get anything done at work because I'm divorced from the
end result. Where might I be more in touch with that, feel more effective?

I'm doing an internship at Staples, working with the IT guy fixing computer and doing stuff. Today, when I came back from lunch, there was an iPad air 2 waiting to be configured. They take about 30 minutes to do, so I saved my IT guy some time and did it myself. When I got to the point of creating an apple ID, I had to call the client to ask if she wanted default secret questions or if she wanted to do them with me on the phone. The conversation went as following:

Me: Hello Ms * ? I'm FishieGoRawr, calling from Staples about the iPad you bought. (There was only her name on the sheet, with her number.)

Her: Ahhh, didn't know I was going to get an iPad!

Him (The husband, in the background): *Yelling insults at me*


**TL;DR**
Unintentionally told a lady that her husband bought her an iPad for her birthday while working as the IT guy.

I spoke briefly with my professor about what path I should take for my education, and he said I need to know both Networking aspects and Coding aspects. Networking is stuff I feel like I could get the hang of after reading enough and completing my internship, but coding is a bitch to me and I generally hate it.

Out of all of it I just feel really happy that I'm doing well in school. Im pursuing a double major in CE and EE and as a sophomore in week 7 out of 10 in my 2nd quarter, who hasn't taken any GEs yet, I currently have the golden 4.0 and above 98% in all of my classes this quarter as well. Now it seems like im bragging doesn't it? I'm really not. There is so much sacrifice that comes along with the work that I put in socially and with respect to sleep/being healthy etc. Sometimes I feel like just stopping and returning to a more ""normal"" life but I find the success and the knowledge too addicting. 

A couple months ago I was really scared about the whole internship hunt like everyone here is currently or was at one time, and I am really happy that I have been fortunate enough to get an internship for this upcoming summer at one of the leading companies in the world related to my field, as well interview/offers for many others in both hardware and software. 

Every class I take my professors get to know me at a personal level simply because im trying so damn hard to do well they know my face and who I am and what I'm doing. Every quarter professors email me to tutor for there class once I'm done. I don't even need to ask, and I think that's a great position to be in.

I'm typing all of this out because I really can't talk about this stuff in person to my friends and peers, who are mostly all competitive STEM and premed people. Jealousy starts to root itself, and I've seen some of it already, but I really feel like I should be able to tell someone that I am doing well. I ought to have the social right to feel proud that the insane amount of work that I put in is paying off and that the opportunities I have are plentiful.

Well anyway thanks for reading, you can downvote this if you want, just don't do it out of jealousy because then you're just part of the negative atmosphere being created in STEM environments. 

I believe everyone here is capable of accomplishing great things and needs to be motivated to do so. Keep on engineering /r/EngineeringStudents.

How are you? I realize I probably passed away by now and I hope you are not freaking out too much. Don't miss me too much either, I am in a better place. I don't know if anyone would believe what I am about to tell you in this email and I don't know how you will be reacting to this. But just hear me out, I know you will at least try to understand. You're the only one who ever does. 

I fell in love shortly after graduating from college. I know we didn't talk that much but I just started a job as a marketing intern at a big company. The first day of work I saw the most beautiful girl in my life. She showed me everything there is to know, not just the layout of the office, but everything in life. She had the most genuine laugh that is almost contagious. She is radiant and she is the one and I know it. It didn't take long before I called her mine. 

As I progress up the hierarchy in the company food chain, my work load got busier and busier. I would leave work at like 4 in the morning and go home, take a shower, and went back to work. Every night I would only get to see her peaceful sleeping face in our bed. That didn't discourage her. She would leave notes here and there reminding me to take care of myself, and that she loved me very much. 

On March 19th, I had the biggest presentation with an important client. In the middle of the meeting, she called. I could see it on the screen of my phone but I couldn't pick up, I was in the middle of presenting. After the meeting I got a call from an unfamiliar number. It was the hospital calling and telling me that she had been in an automobile accident and she had passed away. I couldn't hold myself together. I dropped to my chair and held my head as hard as I could. How can that happen to the most important person in my life? I can't possibly continue. I took work off for the rest of that day. I rushed to the hospital as quickly as I can to see her lying there, lifeless. 

I went home to get changed quickly and get onto the preparations for the funeral. She didn't have any family, they all died in a fire when she was 2. She didn't have much friends either, they were all out of the city and I didn't know them that well. By the time I got to our room, I couldn't cry anymore tears. Her peaceful sleeping face wasn't there to greet me, and the room was missing that soft gentle deep breaths. 

The next month was a blur. I was basically dead. I don't remember anything at all. I went to work, and went home. That's all. Until one day, I was at the supermarket when I saw an old man reaching for something on the top shelf. I went over and helped him out. He looked at me and strangely he asked, ""you look sad, what's wrong young man."" I squeezed out something that resembles a smile and said I was fine. 

""She is gone you know,"" he said. ""What would you give to see her again?""

I didn't answer him right away. My heart was pounding so fast. Everything. I would give everything. But he was gone already. 

The next morning I woke up and carried on with my daily routine. I made some sandwich but I didn't even want to eat. That was when the door bell rang. I was not prepared to see who was at the door. 

It was her. She was alive. She smiled at my totally shocked face.
""What's wrong? Did you see a ghost or something?"" She chuckled, and she came in. She was alive. 
 
""Seriously sweetheart. Is something wrong?"" She asked, confused. I don't know what was going through my mind that moment. But all I know is she was alive and I needed to hold her so tight in my arms. She was there with me. My eyes shot to the calendar on the wall, it was February 20. 

I didn't bother to process and understand what was happening or how she was alive. But all I could accept was that I have been given a second chance. She was alive and she was mine. 

The next few weeks I came home from work early every night. I would take her out and buy her presents. I made her breakfast every morning like I would when we first started dating. I gave her surprises every chance that I got. 

One evening we were at the supermarket shopping for groceries when she went off to get a jug of milk. The old man was there again. He smiled at me and waved at me to come closer. 

""She is beautiful. I am glad you're happy you know. But fate won't change, and life still happens the way it is supposed to,"" he said. 

She called me and I looked back at her. But when I turned around again, he was gone. My heart sank. Even though I might not understand anything that was happening, I could at least understand that. She is going to die on March 19. 

I am writing this email to you right now on March 18. I have set the sent time to March 23. I don't know how you are taking all of this but it doesn't really matter to me. 

I am not losing her again you know? She is going to die, and this time, I am not letting her go alone.

Back in about November, I received and accepted an internship offer with a large defense contractor ('dream company' for most people). I was extremely excited even though the location was 5 hours from me, and I wasn't being offered relocation assistance. I decided this was fine, since I expected I'd be going far from home for an internship to begin with. 

Now fast forward a few months. I have recently had some personal and financial hardships (I won't go into detail), that will make it very difficult for me to do this internship. Since this internship requires a security clearance, I have still been interviewing with other companies and have now received two other offers from very reputable companies (though different industry), both commutable from my house. To make matters worse, I do not have a permanent offer for this defense internship since I have no obtained security clearance yet. From my research, I have about a 50/50 change of obtaining interim (which is much stricter than final), and I should have no trouble obtaining final. However, this company has not been clear to me whether interim or final is required, and the process has not even started yet. From what I understand, a final clearance takes a few months to receive. When I talked to my HR representative, she told me she wasn't sure how getting the clearance was going to work. I have 2 weeks to accept the other offers, and I can't let those offers go in my situation, especially when I do not have a permanent offer from this company. Does anyone have any advice on how to handle this?"

I can work as many hours as I want during the week, and can work when I want, pretty much where ever I want, whether that's from home or in the office.

There is currently an opening there for a full time position in which I am totally qualified for, but the new position makes the same as I do right now which wouldn't be enough to cover all of my coming expenses. Would it be out of the question to talk to my manager to see if there is a way that I can apply towards that job, and if I get it, keep my current position and responsibilities and possibly make more than what I currently am?

My mangers and I do have a really good relationship, and from what I can tell they like me, I just don't want to jeopardize that or have them take away my current position all together.

Overall, I feel like I'm in a catch 22. My plans after graduation failed and I have nowhere to go. I've been spending everyday at the library hopelessly applying to jobs online and none of them ever get back to me. Even if I do get a job, I couldn't afford a living wage since nowhere near me has affordable rent and I just hate the area I live, in general (Connecticut, there's really jack shit for people not commuting into the city or raising a family). 

 Recently, I left an unpaid internship because it was pretty much a dead-end position since...most of their staff consists of unpaid interns except for a few higher ups who actually make a living. They were kind of dicks to me even though I wasn't paid at all. Fuck them, they make money off of free labor. 

I barely have any friends left who I actually see or talk to. My life now is just loneliness and nothing else. I don't even feel like a person anymore. All I am is just a manifestation of misery bound to this earth by flesh. 

People keep saying ""Oh it will get better"" or ""Nothing is that bad that you want to kill yourself."" There have been some who have told me they would be sad if I were gone, but I just wish they would understand my mindset. Like if there was a clone of me that killed himself I would understand and would not want them to live that kind of life. 

You see people who are paralyzed or terminally ill take their lives because they don't want to suffer anymore. I don't see the difference in my situation. 

I feel alienated from everyone. Sometimes I just don't even feel like I'm living in my body anymore. There's nothing left of me as a person. Just a body that costs my family to keep alive. Anything human in me is gone.

I'm going to wait this out until June. If I'm not on track towards doing anything I'm just calling it quits for good. There's no fucking point to have an existence in misery. 

All I hope is that those who care about me realize that I was already dead months before I did it. The person who made them laugh or listened to their issues was long gone. There was only a shell. It would be like shooting a zombie. "

So I will be running for my community college's student government for President. To give a brief background, I love politics, I love law, and I hope to do something public service related after I'm done with school. I do intern with a local state assemblymember, so I have good experience with how things run in the government. I got a 4.0 last semester, which was my first (just turned 19).

So far the detail of the election, I have a running mate for VP who was my friend in high school, as well as a friend I made from work that goes to my school who will rally up support and votes from our cultural group (hint: white/middle eastern who speak a language other than english and stick to ourselves), she's very well connected (related to the current VP) so I can depend on her.

We only have one week to campaign, and following that are the 2 days for election. There are over 20,000 students at my school, however based on data from previous elections, only 600-800 students come out to vote, with winners getting elected based on majority of the votes.

What I want to know is what should my plan be right now. I have a basic setup so far where I just get people's names and contact information and put all of that info Excel, and when campaign week comes where I can officially publicize, I will send a mail-merge email to everyone that indicated they wanted to support my team. I don't know effective this is, but I just want to get that word out there you know.

The problem now is that one of the current student government members, who's been in it for almost 2 years now, is going to be running against me for President. So she has that experience that I don't, so I want to make sure I emphasize the campaigning portion and rallying up support from my target voters that I can count on to vote for me.

Essentially I would like a strategy so far because I have a lot of time until submit my candidate petition (end of March), and go to the meetings (to get the rules of the election and whatnot, also in March), campaigning and elections are late April. I was hoping I can get some ideas on what sort of materials I can use, how I can incorporate them (like handing out to people, posting in areas around school), if I should have a budget, as well as how I can utilize social media. I was thinking that if I do anything communication related I should do in English, my native language, and in Spanish, which makes up what everyone speaks.

I guess thats it so far! I'm excited for this and I hope I win to be honest. To give a disclaimer, I love campaign stuff more than I love winning, so just getting out there and doing things like this, the experience is one I enjoy. But yeah, would love to win too lol.

2wrrqx,10,2015-02-22,I recently discarded a counteroffer in my actual work. Did I took the right choice?,zedee,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2wrrqx/i_recently_discarded_a_counteroffer_in_my_actual/,"Hi everybody. Here comes my story, hope you don't fall asleep:

**Background:** I started programming as a child. In my childhood had my first Amstrad CPC and learnt LOGO and Basic. Then in my teens my interest focused on Linux and C. But I had very long periods of having that ""hobby"" untouched (now I really regret this...). I started an engineering career (telecom), but I dropped out, as I struggled to pass any exam (except programming lab).

Years after working in low paid jobs, I graduated in Media (tv&amp;cinema) about 5 years ago, but with the economic crisis, it was impossible to find any decent job in the industry. Meanwhile, I started to learn HTML and then PHP &amp; JS by myself, watching MIT Opencourseware lectures, browsing StackExange (Serverfault, stack overflow, security...), as well as building websites for my close friends (almost for free). 

Half a year ago, I found myself working in an small IT consulting company. They gave me the opportunity to start over and finally build up a career, but it had a drawback: they offered me an internship contract and the payout was terrible (about 620€/mo per 40h/wk; that's about $8450/year). 

I decided to keep up the job, as I needed so badly real experience. They told me that in the next 6 months, I would have a raise, and it was true. My finaly salary was about €12k/year ($14k/y). Wow, what a deal. I didn't negotiate too much and accepted the new conditions, thinking of asking for a lil' rise later.

6 months later, I tried to renegotiate my salary with my boss. I asked for a raise, but he told me we'd take hand on it ""soon"".

That ""soon"" was 3 months ago, and I didn't heard any news about. So I started looking for another job. And they called me. And offered me to double my current wage. Obviously, I accepted.

Then when I go to tell the boss I'm dropping, he plays his cards. He also offers me twice the salary (but just over 6 months) if I stay. I tell him I'll give a thought, not without thinking... ""And now you can give me a freaking raise? When you are against the wall?"").

Finally I thought about pros and cons: 

The pros of my current job are that I have formidable workmates, which I learn a lot from them (and I try to help them when they ask), and also that in my job they give me pretty much freedom to choice any framework I want when it's time to start a new project (Laravel? CI? Angular? They don't give a fuck as far as shit is done).
The cons are obviously the terrible salary, as well as some extremely picky clients (which usually don't know what they want), so almost all projects take 2x 3x longer than they should. (And they blame us for not complying with deadlines). [Does it ring any bells to anyone of you? ;) ]

So, my final decision was to quit. He raged a bit telling shit about the company I was going to, but finally he took it OK. I'm kinda frightened about the new job, as I have a period of testing of a whole year. I'm confident with my programming skills, but I have a short run into this industry, and I'm not quite experienced. I will start on the new job the next week. I know it's a very personal decision (to quit or to stay), but I was looking for some directions about if it was a good choice.

So, what are your thoughts?

**TL;DR:** Had a shitty wage, found new job where they offered me 2x. Took it. Not sure if I did right because of my short experience.

Edit: typos

**UPDATE:** Thanks a lot for your thoughts about the topic. It's been almost a week in the new job, and besides the days of disorientation and shyness, now I'm feeling better in a great environment with challenging projects. They even have a shitload of oculus rift to play with! I'm proudly happy of my final choice. :)"

When searching for jobs, I've seen positions in bigger markets that I say, ""Hey, I might be able to do that.""

Should I apply for these positions simply to see if i could land an interview, even if I'm not readily available to take the job? I just want to see if I would be able to compete in another area and really work on revising and nailing my resume/applications.

I was thinking that applying could get my foot in the door or at least make a single contact that I could benefit from down the road when I do move. Or at least prove to myself that I could land some of the positions I'm checking out.

After doing a few startup internships and after being on the other side and hiring interns I realized two things.

1. Levaraging interns to do taks like social media, customer interviews, being campus ambassadors, and content marketing can be huge and extremely effective.

2. It can however be tough for early stage startups to find qualified interns. 

So a friend of mine and I had the idea of creating a job board site aimed at early to seed stage startups looking for interns. It would be a simple and easy way for these startups to take resume's, applications, and work examples for internships from a variety of different schools, all in one place.

It's not a incredibly novel idea I know, but I think if executed well it could certainly be useful to many startups. 

So just wanted to see what the r/startups community thinks about this idea and if any founders on here would use something like this.

I've been posting here and r/learnprogramming a lot since my second semester of college (started off at CC and have now transferred to a University). I've been working as a paid intern at a local web development company since December 1st.

It's been really cool as it is my first office job and I have been learning what it's really like to have an adult job, having only worked retail/recreational jobs before. But, it has also been frustrating at times. It's a small company and the customers are really important so for the first month and half I was only doing customer support and working on site issues.

I still work on issues (as every dev there does, we each have issue days). But I've been assigned my first real task that's starting this week. I'm sure in the grand scheme of our website it's a simple feature to add for any other dev, but for me it feels pretty hairy. 

How do you guys learn to read code that you haven't written? Or know where to start on a new feature if you are unfamiliar with the codebase/technologies being used?

I know I am moving towards my goals, but I just want to be settled in at least one aspect of my life.

I graduated from college a few years ago, changed my mind about my career goals, and am now finally inching slightly more quickly to my desired career path (doing a specific technical post-bacc program online). I'm working a part-time office job just to make some money while I do this, but I don't really have any money. I'm applying for some summer internships so that when I finish this program I'll be more qualified for jobs, but haven't heard back from any yet.

I just moved with my boyfriend from Portland to a much smaller resort town in SoCal (my hometown, although my family doesn't live there anymore) for a new job for my bf. While I don't really regret moving for new experiences, I know I don't want to live here long-term because it's ridiculously expensive and I dislike the people here, and even though I was sick of Portland at the time I know I'd rather live there long-term. The internships I applied to are all over the country, so there's always the possibility I won't be here for the summer or more time.

I'm finally making changes to my life to start losing weight, and I've lost 10 lbs so far of the 40-50 I want to lose. It's obviously slow-going, but it's happening. 

I'm not sure how to make friends in this new town and there aren't that many people here our age (we're also homebodies) - but I have no money to join activities and I keep thinking well, what's the point of making friends here if we won't be here that long?

We're not super happy with our rental apartment and I keep an eye out for other options, but I'm always unsure whether it'd be worth it to move again. Our apartment is nice but we don't like living underneath our landlords. 

Basically, I spent a ton of time wishing I was just settled already. I feel like I've been in transition for like 7 years now. I want an actual house that I can decorate permanently, I want a real job in my career field, I want to be fit, I just want to be...settled. I know it will happen in time and I'm not that old yet (25), but I just can't ever relax and feel satisfied, because it seems all I work on is some form of ""self-improvement"" (working on the class, applying for internships, making food, doing chores, looking up self-help stuff on the internet).

Every member of his team has at least 4 years of IT experience and this is first IT internship and he has never worked an IT job before. Is it realistic for him to get hired full time after 6 months as a Linux Systems Engineer? Is 6 months enough time for him to master the skills needed for this role? He is trying to learn as much as he can so that even if he does not get kept full time, he can at least use his skills at a different company for a help desk job. What else can he do to optimize his internship experience? Right now he is just shadowing another team member and learning additional Linux commands from him."

2wutrg,1,2015-02-23,How to deal with bad timing [in terms of courses] for career fair/interviews?,McFiddlyWiddly,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2wutrg/how_to_deal_with_bad_timing_in_terms_of_courses/,"I know the title could have been worded better.

I will be taking data structures in August (this fall). I can't take any other CS course unless I take that since that's a prerequisite for all 'higher level' CS classes. I'm taking Programming and Problem Solving(Java), and Discrete Structures this semester. 

The issue that I have is that career fairs usually happen early February and mid September. There is simply no way I can master the things I am learning during that semester in less than one month of classes. And as far as I can tell, Data Structures and Algorithms(which I will have to take spring 2016) are the two most important things for technical interviews. 

How have people traditionally dealt with these issues? I have decided to switch to CS pretty late, so I am not familiar with a lot of things with regards to internships and interviews. Should I teach myself data structures and algorithms during the summer? Wouldn't that be risky in terms of bad programming habits that may remain unchecked? How and when can I prepare?

Thanks."

So far I have taken two CS classes at my university. I didn't really get to know the professors for either of those classes, but I have talked with the TAs for both courses.

Do you think it would be acceptable to source my letters of recommendation from them? I don't think I have anyone else to ask for a letter of recommendation, aside from professors or TAs from non-CS related classes or my AP CS teacher from high school."

My friend and I are graduating from the same uni this year and from last August we have been on the job hunt together looking for chemical engineering entry level positions in the US.

I mean to point where we have been applying to jobs together for about 4 hours a day (almost). 

Now the thing is, we have the exact same experiences. The reason being because what I was able to get into (internship or research), I got him into as well and vice versa. 

To be completely honest, it is like we have the exact same resume, they are incredibly similar. He has a significant higher GPA than I do with a bit of different activities.

However we do have different cover letters.

At this point, we both are very experienced in finding jobs we want online.

And overall, he has had more interviews than I do. That's not a bad thing, but I am wondering if I had a shot at the jobs but didn't get it because they saw both of our resumes and went with the higher GPA.

Now my questions are:

1) Is this hurting my chances of getting a job? Why or why not?

2) Should I try to apply by myself or continue applying with him?

TL:DR Friend and I apply a lot together. Same experience, almost same resume. He has higher GPA. He has had more interviews than I.  Refer to the questions, please and thank you.

UPDATE: I ultimately decided to start the application process on my own. I just want to say thank you to you guys who went out of their way to give a noobie some advice. This community is very helpful. "

I was supposed to graduate this semester but will stay on for one more. Hence, instead of full time jobs I'm trying to look for internships now. Since this realization came late, I'm kind of delayed in the process.

I realize it's late in the process already, so I was wondering if there's any place I could still apply. My GPA isn't great (&gt;3.7 though) because I focused on research and I have a couple of publications to show for it. I've worked for slightly more than an year at one of the big 4, unfortunately I can't seem to go there because they filled the spots I was looking for. I'm not sure whether my profile would get me internship calls ( I didn't intern last summer as I was doing research to meet some conference deadlines, does that count against me?). The only reason I say this is because I sent out a couple of emails and got no replies, which I'm not sure is due to my profile or because I might be really late now.

Anyone got suggestions on where I can look? Thanks!"

[Hi Paul. Thanks for doing this!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wvoxr/i_am_paul_sonne_moscow_correspondent_for_the_wall/couk7kh?context=5)|All very good and difficult questions! Let me try…
[Many scholars in the past have denounced the effectiveness of pure economic sanctions in coercing countries to make a change. With the sanctions being placed on Russia by the United States being at least mildly effective (tanking the worth of the ruble, Treasury Department naming Russian entities as illegal to aid, blocking company contact with Russian industry, etc...\), do you see them finally being an effective, viable way to coerce nations to make a change in their actions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wvoxr/i_am_paul_sonne_moscow_correspondent_for_the_wall/couk7kh?context=5)|I think economic sanctions probably work only over time - usually a matter of years, even decades -- in coercing countries to make a change. But what happens initially seems to be the opposite: hunkering down, tightening of control, etc. Certainly I think sanctions are an influential tool, but the question I always have is how long they take to work, is it fast enough, and is it worth the reaction you're going to get in the meantime? 
[How has the uprising of pro-Russian militias in places like Donetsk and Lugansk affected the relationship between the civilian government and military leadership in Ukraine?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wvoxr/i_am_paul_sonne_moscow_correspondent_for_the_wall/couk7kh?context=5)|Lots of people who served in volunteer battalions or on the front ran in the Ukrainian parliamentary elections and formally entered politics. The prime minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, created a political party called the National Front that has a significant military element, including people who have served on the front and people from the Interior Ministry. So there is a mixing of the two. But I think its fair to say that the conflict has certainly stressed the relationship between the military leadership and the government (witness how many defense ministers Ukraine has had since the conflict began) - because most everyone will admit to you that Ukraine's military was woefully unprepared for something like this to take place. 
[Do you see Putin backing down any time soon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wvoxr/i_am_paul_sonne_moscow_correspondent_for_the_wall/couk7kh?context=5)|To be honest, no. 
[In your opinion, is another cold war or worse likely in the near future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wvoxr/i_am_paul_sonne_moscow_correspondent_for_the_wall/coujfbr?context=5)|We're already seeing a level of confrontation between Russia and Europe/US that is reminiscent of the Cold War. But we're not going to see a return of the same thing, because the world is different, more globalized and connected. One of the key differences is that Russia doesn't have an explicit opposing ideology in the way that the Soviet Union did during the Cold War. Much of the Cold War was directed by the concept that democracy had to triumph over communism - it was not just a geopolitical confrontation but also a battle over how countries and the world should be run. Though the Kremlin of late has tried to emphasize how much Russia's ideology differs from European liberalism, it's not a full-scale articulation of an alternative system. What we see in Russia today is more a modified version of what you see in Europe or the US, not a completely different way of organizing society as you had in the Soviet era. 
[I spent several months in Kiev in 2003. It is a beautiful city with great people. What are the living conditions there now and what is their view of Americans today ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wvoxr/i_am_paul_sonne_moscow_correspondent_for_the_wall/coujqjn?context=5)|Agreed, it is a beautiful city, and it does have great people. The view of Americans was generally positive in Ukraine during maidan, though I do think there are a lot of Ukrainians who now feel betrayed by what they perceive as the lack of support from the US and the West in the wake of those protests. As far as living conditions, Ukraine is not only facing an actual battle in the east but also a serious battle on the economic front. That's certainly affecting people in Kiev and elsewhere. The economy contracted by about 7% last year and it projected to contract by another 5.5% this year. The currency has plummeted to about 30 hryvnia to the dollar today, compared to about 9 hryvnia to the dollar last year. People are hurting - there's no doubt about that - and the economy is likely to get worse. 
[Thank you for doing this AMA been following your daily updates on twitter for a while now.  Have you seen the new footage about MH17 mentioned by the daily Telegraph and what is your take on this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wvoxr/i_am_paul_sonne_moscow_correspondent_for_the_wall/coujk8x?context=5)|I have seen reports on the new footage. I don't think anyone is under the impression that the site was treated with dignity, so the idea that the footage counteracts that perception seems off to me. The site was not treated with dignity, there are no doubts about that. We also know that the rebel fighters were the first on the scene, spent time going through and at times blocking off the crash site and took the black boxes (though later returned them to Malaysian authorities). As for the whole debate over locals taking things from the crash site, I never saw that, and to be honest, I think these were isolated incidents if they happened. Most locals did the opposite, as far as I understood - they tried to figure out how and where to return belongings they found and were incredibly traumatized themselves. I wrote a bit about this with my colleagues here: [Link to on.wsj.com](http://on.wsj.com/1LvsZ3w)
[When and how, in your opinion, the conflict in Ukraine will end?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wvoxr/i_am_paul_sonne_moscow_correspondent_for_the_wall/couilib?context=5)|Not soon. The question is really different phases and levels of the conflict. I hope that the intense fighting phase will dissipate soon, and though they are regularly violated, the ceasefire efforts can help in that regard. If you look at other similar conflict areas in the former Soviet Union, such as Abkhazia, they have been in some state of conflict for decades, even though active fighting hasn't been as intense as it was. People now refer to these places as 'frozen conflicts' - places still stuck a state of 'conflict' that can bubble into violence any day if not active war zones. I think that's where we're headed.
[How noticeable an effect are the western sanctions having? Are they affecting everyday life for the average Russian? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wvoxr/i_am_paul_sonne_moscow_correspondent_for_the_wall/couiwdz?context=5)|Though the main reason Russia's currency has plummeted is the plunge in oil prices, I think it's fair to say that the sanctions were a contributing factor - and most every Russian is certainly feeling the effects of the ruble's stark devaluation. Russia's response to the sanctions (banning an array of foodstuffs from the EU and the US) has been felt in supermarkets. Some higher-end stuff (such as Italian mozzarella) is now unavailable, but that affects only a smaller slice of the population. The broader population has felt a rise in food prices more generally.
[*Some higher-end stuff (such as Italian mozzarella\) is now unavailable.*  Where do you shop at? It's available at any Перекросток as well as Утконос. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wvoxr/i_am_paul_sonne_moscow_correspondent_for_the_wall/coum3we?context=5)|Is it *Italian*?
[What is your impression of the Russian people and their perception of the crisis in Ukraine? Do you find that many are heavily influenced by Russian State Media?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wvoxr/i_am_paul_sonne_moscow_correspondent_for_the_wall/coujga6?context=5)|Yes. Polls repeatedly show that Russians are indeed heavily influenced by state television. You can find an article on one of those polls here: [Link to www.themoscowtimes.com](http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/poll-finds-94-of-russians-depend-on-state-tv-for-ukraine-coverage/499988.htm) The effects are palpable. For example, even though most of the rest of the world believes Russia-backed rebels downed MH17, polls show that the bulk of Russians believe the airliner was downed by Ukrainian forces - something Russian state television has been alleging since minutes after the crash.  
[What has been the highlight of your career and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wvoxr/i_am_paul_sonne_moscow_correspondent_for_the_wall/couif97?context=5)|It feels strange to describe something so tragic as a highlight, but covering the conflict in Ukraine has been the most intense period in my career - and at times the most rewarding. I had covered a lot of things before -- two Olympics, lots of corporate news, various elections and political scandals -- but I had never covered a conflict, which somehow seems more pressing from a reporting perspective. It sort of hits you over the head with the full array of human emotions -- from good to evil -- in a way that my previous assignments had not.
[Is Putin trying to rebuild the old USSR?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wvoxr/i_am_paul_sonne_moscow_correspondent_for_the_wall/coujtrl?context=5)|I think he is trying to return elements of the old USSR to achieve his political aims, not return the old USSR itself. So much of Putin's political project is about tapping into the feelings of vanquished glory that took hold among many Russians after the collapse of the Soviet Union, when Russia descended into political and economic turmoil. He has presented his rule as an antidote to that, which is why you see elements of praising or perhaps even reconstructing the past as critical to his political messaging.
[Hello Paul, thank you for doing this! Do you have any advice/tips for someone hoping to enter the journalism workforce soon? How did you get your start as a journalist abroad? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wvoxr/i_am_paul_sonne_moscow_correspondent_for_the_wall/coulghb?context=5)|Find a way to differentiate yourself. Enter journalism with a special skill that others don't have, whether that's knowledge of a lesser-studied foreign language (like Russian!) or deeper expertise in a subject such as finance, economics or defense. I started, like many people, as an intern - at the New York Times and the Associated Press in Moscow and then later at the Wall Street Journal in London. I likely wouldn't have received any of those internships had I not learned Russian, which turned out to be a real asset in finding a journalism job.
[Do you think Russia is likely to expand even more than Crimea?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wvoxr/i_am_paul_sonne_moscow_correspondent_for_the_wall/coul41k?context=5)|Not right now. I think it's a bit of a misconception that Russia wants to take more of Ukrainian land outside Crimea and make it officially Russian territory. It may want to control territory indirectly, but as far as making Donbass part of Russia, the Kremlin more or less had the opportunity and refused. Donbass is quite a large land area with millions of people and a lot of state-dependent pensioners and enterprises - so it would be a fairly acute economic burden. 
[Hi Paul What's the most difficult issue you faced in doing your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wvoxr/i_am_paul_sonne_moscow_correspondent_for_the_wall/coukr89?context=5)|Most recently, the most difficult thing has been writing about civilians on both sides of the conflict, many of them apolitical, who are suffering in truly horrific circumstances. Sometimes you write a story with the hope that something will change for them and then realize that even though the story did get a lot of readers and people did care, nothing actually changes for the people on the ground. That can feel a bit soul destroying sometimes.

[I cannot stress how awesome you guys are for your work on Medieval Engineers and Space Engineers.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ww6ib/we_are_keen_software_house_developers_of_space/counjtq?context=5)|Bigger features take us longer than 1 week to finish, so we plan them in advance and the development of many features actually overlap.
[I really think your weekly update plan has been a staple of your success, but doesn't it cause strain on you to finish updates within one week sprints?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ww6ib/we_are_keen_software_house_developers_of_space/counjtq?context=5)|Let's say we start working on super-large world in November but we know it will take 2 months to finish. So along with this we also start smaller features that can be finished in 1-2 weeks and if you put them many in parallel, then you can still release something reasonable every week.
[Alternatively;  Do you finish certain features far in advance, and keep them on the side?  (in the event a planned feature isn't ready by the Thursday release it is scheduled, you could release that earlier finished feature\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ww6ib/we_are_keen_software_house_developers_of_space/counjtq?context=5)|""Features in advance"" - we considered this long time ago but in reality once some feature is finished, we want to get it to you as fast as possible, so even if we wanted to keep it on hold, our emotions don't allow this :)
[What were the decisive points in selecting the release date of ME? Why wasn't it released earlier and why wasn't it released later?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ww6ib/we_are_keen_software_house_developers_of_space/counzcb?context=5)|I don't really remember but it was probably the shortest time we considered to be reasonable. In general we want to release things as fast as possible without sacrificing quality (too much).
 |It's better to get the game out to the community, get feedback, and start integrating that feedback. Developing just on our assumptions of what people do and want is not cool :)
[Should I expect rails anytime in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ww6ib/we_are_keen_software_house_developers_of_space/coundic?context=5)|This is a tough question :) Rotors and pistons already proved that some types of physics objects are very hard to implement in real time in an environment where object weights differs drastically... so we would rather focus on other things and not do rails for now.
[What has been the greatest challenge for you over the course of development so far? (Also: are you interested in hiring an intern? ;\) \)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ww6ib/we_are_keen_software_house_developers_of_space/counfb2?context=5)|For Medieval Engineers it was probably the structural integrity. It's a thing where we didn't know if we will be able to make it run in real time and kind of realistic. It's not perfect yet (probably never will be) but it's kind of cool.
[Hi Keen! Love your games but love your attitude to making games and how you listen to gamers even more!! Please keep doing what you do.  Could you please add a spray-gun to the tools so we can paint our ships easier in SE?  How long until we see multi-player in Medieval Engineers? EDIT: 3. Will we be able to control AI at some point in SE? i.e. AI crews for ships?  Cheers!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ww6ib/we_are_keen_software_house_developers_of_space/counj3m?context=5)|Ad 2) MP in Medieval Engineers - probably a few months. We will use netcode we already have in Space Engineers, but at the same time we are changing a lot of netcode to different library. In general, MP in ME will require less work than it did for SE because we already have the infrastructure and GUI part of it.
[Hi KSH! Have you thought about implementing any sort of campaign/challenges to Space Engineers? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ww6ib/we_are_keen_software_house_developers_of_space/counvn8?context=5)|Yes. Actually ""In my latest blog post I forgot to mention that we are also going to work on campaigns/scenarios for Space Engineers"" [Link to twitter.com](https://twitter.com/marek_rosa/status/569111230209785856)
[Is the same team working on both games? If that's true, will affect the update speed for both games?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ww6ib/we_are_keen_software_house_developers_of_space/couo4jn?context=5)|We have two teams, one is for SE and the other is for ME. But many responsibilities and features overlap (e.g. nature from ME will also get to SE as planets)
[Some advance or news about water?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ww6ib/we_are_keen_software_house_developers_of_space/counemu?context=5)|Just some preliminary idea-designs, directions where we might go if we decide to implement water. We see that many people dig water :)
[When roughly we will see Oxygen and Planets be added?  (Rough Estimate\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ww6ib/we_are_keen_software_house_developers_of_space/counvkk?context=5)|Sorry but one of our rules is not to reveal ETA :)
 |However, oxygen and planets are not that hard as people may imagine, it will be sooner than people think.
[Can we expect any improvements on character animations (Just the basic ones\), and since you've considered oxygen and planets (Thank you!\), will you also be adding NPCs anytime soon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ww6ib/we_are_keen_software_house_developers_of_space/coung06?context=5)|Character animation is one of the big things we are working on undercover... basically adding some inverse kinematics and ragdoll and in future maybe even more advanced stuff.
[Like that nice April Fools thing you guys did.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ww6ib/we_are_keen_software_house_developers_of_space/coung06?context=5)|NPC - yes... you can start counting hours... Haha :)
[NPCs in SE? In hours?  (I think PyroMcDips was asking about NPCs in Space Engineers. Are we in for a really big surprise today?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ww6ib/we_are_keen_software_house_developers_of_space/couoprr?context=5)|Sorry, I meant NPC for ME, not SE.
[Will we see different environments (Desert, tundra\) and weather types (rain, snow\) in ME? Also day/night?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ww6ib/we_are_keen_software_house_developers_of_space/couo06r?context=5)|Yes this would be cool.

I currently have written one for a company I briefly talked to at a career fair, and want to see if this kind of letter is okay. Should it be formatted more formally?

&gt;Greetings,

&gt;My name is ______ , and I am a current student studying computer science X University. Earlier this year, I had the opportunity to speak with a university recruiter about ______ through our school career fair, and I wanted to express my interest in the software development internship this summer.
&gt;
&gt;I have a strong passion for creating applications and am highly interested in learning and developing in mobile and cloud technologies. I believe my academic courses and personal projects have prepared me with solid object-oriented programming skills, as well as experience with databases and web development. I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to apply my skill set towards a meaningful project, while gaining valuable experience through interning with _______.
&gt;
&gt;I look forward to hearing from _______ regarding this position. Thank you for your time and consideration. 
&gt;

Back in Feb 2006 I received a speeding ticket in a small town upstate NY.  I later sent in my plea and received a court date in the summer.  As a college student, I later learned that I received a internship during the summer and was not going to be able to attend the court date.  I called or mailed a request to change the date and from what I remember they would reschedule the hearing and I should receive that information.  Now...flash forward to today.  I was cleaning through my college stuff and found the letter from the court unopened.  I believe this letter was sent to my dorm address while I was in another state for my internship so I'm not exactly sure if this letter was sent before or after I sent in the rescheduling of the trial.  I don't think I've ever paid or even received a new trial date.  I haven't received any other letters from the court so I would've assumed i paid it but now that i think back on it, I don't recall paying it/speaking to someone at the court, or going back the court.  I'm actually not sure what happened.  However, I checked my drivers license records and it doesn't show anything about the ticket nor any suspensions or issued judgement for suspension on my license.

Anybody have any idea what I should do?  I mean, I would assume I would need to call the court and ask them to look up the records on this ticket# but wanted to see if I should prepare to have an attorney prepared before hand with these things."
2wwwwk,346,2015-02-23,Tales from SpiceCo - The Accounting Goddess and her broken new laptop.,moonarms,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2wwwwk/tales_from_spiceco_the_accounting_goddess_and_her/,"After a long time here's another somewhat recent story that happened during my time as an IT intern at the spice company.

My main job in those weeks was notifying our users about an impending upgrade of their laptops. Furthermore I was tasked with imaging all new machines and swapping them with the old ones. Most users were absolutely thrilled to get rid of their clunky old Dells and gladly backed up all their data to the shared drives assigned to them. Meanwhile I was busy unpacking about 100 cartons, inspecting the new machines and setting them up in batches of 10 around a switch. The installation actually was a painless waiting game that only involved triggering PXE boot on each machine and letting the provisioning software do its job.

Just as the second batch was nearing completion I got a call. Looking at the display I felt my hands start shivering slightly.


&gt;moonarms: Welcome to SpiceCo tech support, moonarms speaking. How can I help you?

&gt;Accounting Goddess: Hello, this is AG speaking. I need one of the new laptops. Now.

&gt;M: Y-Yes ma'am. I'll come up to you as soon as the current batch is finished.

&gt;AG: Fine. I'll be waiting. 


Now, AG was one lady who was feared throughout the company. When things worked her demeanor was reasonably nice but as soon as there was any problem whatsoever she'd scream bloody murder and demand the head of the poor offender on a silver platter. I therefore hoped not to incur her rage and made a mental checklist of the required procedures while Windows was chugging away downloading updates. As soon as the fresh install had completed I somberly walked up the stairs to the dragon's lair, brandishing the new laptop's dock like some crude shield. 

At the top of the stairs she stood, raven hair swaying in the light breeze of the AC. A small smile made its way on her lips as she saw the lithe form of the ultrabook in my hand and she motioned for me to follow her into her office. 


&gt;M: Alright, do you have everything backed up?

&gt;AG: Yep. All necessary files are on the share, I'm all ready. Oh, how I'm gonna LOVE working on this beauty.

&gt;M: (smiling dutifully) I've yet to encounter anyone who doesn't like the new laptops. The CEO has been swooning over his one non-stop from the second he got it.

&gt;A: That's great to hear. And now, no more idle chit-chat, get to work! (said *somewhat* friendly)


I had the new machine set up pretty quickly and proceeded to go through all of the transfered files with AG looking over my shoulder. After all, I *really* did not want to get in trouble with that hellion of an accountant. Soon we had verified that every business-critical application was working correctly and AG sent me on my way, even thanking me profusely. ""Something bad is going to happen. I've never seen AG that happy"", I thought and left the accounting department as quickly as I could. Back at the IT office I continued imaging laptop after laptop while the steady hum of the big iron in the adjacent server room provided some calming background music.

Suddenly the door opened with a sharp *clack* and one person I had gotten to know all too well during my previous internships swiftly stepped in. ""Mr. moonarms hard at work as always, I see"", said the GM with his eerily calm voice as he surveyed the room and stepped to my desk. Lil' Dr. Dirty, as he was informally called by everyone but the CEO, was about the most dangerous person in the whole company. Well-dressed and soft-spoken, an uninformed observer could easily get the idea that he'd be nothing short of an ideal boss. That was, until you turned your back on him. This man was someone who threw people under the bus routinely, creating an atmosphere of fear and distrust in the whole company. Everyone, from the lowest packing peon to several department heads, loathed him but he stood under the personal protection of the CEO and was considered infallible. 


&gt;LDD: Well, who chose the new laptops? They're *so* fast and light. I'll have to commend one of you guys.

&gt;M: Actually, Thomas from purchasing knew someone at HP who offered us a great price for those. I think you'll have to thank h----"" 


**RIIIIIIIIING** the phone clamoured. When AG's caller ID showed up on the display I had to stifle a nervous gulp. ""Oh s***t, LDD's in the room, please don't be mad"", I prayed as I accepted the call.


&gt;M: Welcome to SpiceCo tech support, moon---""

&gt;AG: YOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUU!

&gt;LDD: (whispering) I've got a meeting to organise, I'd better go.

&gt;M: (turning down the volume and rubbing my ear) Excuse me, ma'am?

&gt;AG: YOU BROKE IT. YOU BROKE MY NEW LAPTOP. HOW DARE YOU DO THIS?

&gt;M: I'm sorry, what seems to be the problem? Before I left your office we both verified that everything was working corr---

&gt;AG: ENOUGH WITH YOUR EXCUSES! YOU GET UP HERE STAT OR I SWEAR, YOU **WILL** BE SORRY.


Muttering a quiet approval I grabbed my toolbox, swooped up AG's old machine and once again scurried to the accounting department. When I entered the office I was greeted with the most irate stare of my life. AG, trembling with anger, didn't even say a word but just pointed at the offending ultrabook. The fight was on now. One rather timid, barely grown-up moonarms against a 40-ish, raging lady who still managed to look like a fallen angel in all her wrath. I carefully approached the machine, half expecting some random hardware error having contributed to its untimely demise - only to find it happily displaying the desktop. 
Since I didn't have even a whiff of what issue AG meant I was forced to speak up again.


&gt;M: (barely above a whisper) Your laptop seems to be in good working order. Can you please show me the issue you are having?

&gt;AG: (quiet but menacing) The. Icons.

&gt;M: (pointing at screen) Everything you requested is on the desktop, just like on your old laptop. We verified that a few hours ago.

&gt;AG: (coming uncomfortably close, towering above me) They. Are. Not. In. Their. Correct. Positions. I. Said. I. Wanted. Everything. The. Way. It. Was. On. My. Old. Dell.

&gt;M: (thinking: ""you didn't say that"")Erm, Ma'am this is not a broken laptop. You'll just have to rearrange your--

&gt;AG: STOP TALKING AND DO IT. I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR YOUR BABBLE.


At this point I decided to do everything this woman wanted, in order to make it out alive of this predicament. The next half hour was spent dragging icon after icon across the desktop until AG was satisfied with its position. And, when the last one slid into place a truly strange transformation happened. The scowl on the accountant's face was wiped away and replaced with a beaming, full-on smile. 

She gently took the laptop out of its dock, packed it in her bag and grabbed my shoulder. ""That wasn't so hard, was it? I think you're a good boy after all"", she all but *cooed* in my ear. I tentatively nodded, left the office and bolted to the safe haven that was the IT office, all the while muttering ""good boy?"" under my breath.

So, I went to UC-Berkeley for undergrad, but I didn't major in CS or anything technical; however, because my major was interdisciplinary, I ventured out and tried CS, obviously falling love right away. Since then I've taken most of the 61 series (I didn't get to finish machine structures, but I was just auditing anyway) and an info class at Cal. I've also taken 4 other CS courses at the city college down the street and plan on taking either Operating Systems and Systems programming or AI this summer at Cal. I've gotten a few interviews, and one internship in QA, so I guess I'm heading down the right path towards a career, but lately I've been considering getting a grad degree (either to help career wise or to delve into some research). Boston University's LEAP program seems like the perfect fit for me since it's a graduate program meant for those who didn't originally major in CS (it devotes a portion of the program to the undergraduate work needed to successfully complete the grad work, which would be good since some of it is math-heavy, which is something I definitely need to work on), but I thought I'd ask the community's opinion on the situation and/or the program. If you're a LEAP alumni, maybe you can share your story and provide some guidance. Also, if you've heard of similar programs, I'd love to know about them. Thanks."

I haven't been able to find a lot of information on this subreddit about whether it is difficult to obtain internships in the states as a Canadian or not. Maybe I have been mis-informed, but I have been told by a few people that it is difficult to obtain internships as a Canadian student unless you go to University of Waterloo or any other university with a top CS program. I don't go to a ""top tier"" university in terms of the CS program, I started off as a BBA major and have now switched to CS, about to complete my first year.

I guess my question is, how difficult would it be for me to obtain a spring and/or summer internship at the big 4 or at another top company from SV/NY (just as examples) while a. being Canadian and b. going to an average university.

I know two very important parts of a resume would be internship experience and participation in projects.

So far I have taken six courses in high school (two course credits being an internship) and two courses at university.

As far as what I have learned, unfortunately each course Ive taken seems to just repeat that last, going from basics up to implimenting simple classes, objects, files, and just about into sorting and searching through data structures. though I have done so in C++, C#, Java, and Python. 

My high school internship project was a simple application to assist the academic decathlon. It held files for questions, and was my first experience doing anything with A GUI (albeit I had to use panels and my own paint drawn buttons to do so) but I ended up learning a lot about being given requirements for a project, working with a deadline, along with being able to learn and adapt when I didn't know how to implement something.  

I wish to do as much as I can now, but I am lost as to what I should be doing right now (aside from getting my general studies out of the way so I can focus on my major)

Any advice?"

It's looking good.

I had to fill out some application forms and one of the fields was for my desired salary range. I may need to negotiate this soon, possibly in person, and I want to be prepared. I want to take this opportunity to ask your opinion about the ballpark salary and benefits I could expect from a position like this.

I want to be reasonable, but the glassdoor reviews mentioned a relatively small performance review bonus, so I want to push as much as I can now.

**Me:**

BS CS

Graduate in a few months

2 - 1yr internships

I've been coding for a while prior to entering college (since 7), also have a fair bit of hardware experience for an entry level. This comes in handy with this position, they seemed impressed with my knowledge in this way.

I did really well on my last on-site interviews.

**Position**

Firmware Engineer I

Glassdoor salary for other site (no data for this site, slightly higher cost of living) 71,300 average

In same town, would not need to relocate.

**Finances**

Last internship was paid at 58,800 with $5000 relocation

Posted benefits for this position: medical, dental, vision, 401k match, 9 holidays, life insurance, and unspecified paid time off.

**Question**

I was planning to put $76,500 as my desired salary because it compensates for cost of living from the lower end of the glassdoor range, adds a bit for my additional unique expertise, and then a bit for negotiation. This is also the desired salary I put on my initial online application. Is this reasonable, would it be insulting to write this on my form? I will deliver it in person.

Not really sure what would be reasonable for the other benefits.

* Is a signing bonus reasonable, if so how much? 5000?

* How much vacation as an entry level / level 1?

* Any other things I've missed?"

Last December-ish I was able to land a paid internship at a startup in Manhattan and it was the first time I was programming in a professional capacity.

I really put the work and effort in and I think the results showed as the full time staff and senior developers all said that they were happy with my work and was a benefit to the team which made me feel great and my responsibilities at the company and pay slowly increased to the point where the position was more of that of a contractor and I felt comfortable stepping away from school to try to explore this new opportunity and work a full 40+ hour schedule.

After a few more months they brought me on as a full time developer on salary and benefits and the whole lot. It was also shortly around that time that virtually all of our development team either quit or was fired leaving me and the CTO the only developers on staff. So at that point the company kind of fell into the typical startup shortcomings. I'm promised that I'll have a full staff of developers by the end of the year at the latest and am still on my own now at the end of February, I'm expected to work past hours every night and during the weekend with no reflection on my pay, and most recently my benefits have been cut as the company tries to tighten the budget until series A funding closes. The CTO is still happy with the work I'm doing and has said that when they bring on another junior developer he/she will be bellow me but I figure it's just time that I move on.

So I've been applying to jobs the past two weeks or so and its been pretty slow going. I got a few interviews and did a few coding tests for some companies but have either received rejections or stopped receiving responses altogether. I guess I'm just starting to get a little worried that things aren't moving faster, especially because people keep saying how in demand software engineers are. I'm really kind of scared the Ive just fluked myself into a job and am not able to maintain it into an actual career. I'm just wondering if you guys happen to have any advice or words of wisdom? I'd really appreciate the opinions of people in the business on the situation."

Trig-71 :(

World History 98 regents, 4 on AP Exam.

SAT- Taking the March SAT confident I will get in the 1800 range got a 1630 on a practice one but writing section really brought me down so I've been studying.  

I participate in clubs nothing really special. Mostly class governments and I've been in my schools research program for the past 3 years. National Honor Society, Foreign Language Honor Society, Science Honor Society 

Sports- None sadly (I'm athletic just didn't have a desire to play)
Work Experience- Interned in NYC at a small accounting and tax firm for a summer I think 2 years ago.

Currently have been working at Mcdonalds for past 8 months or so. 
Have another internship this summer in the NYC 4 days a week with pay and at the same place from 2 years ago. 

Community Service- I don't have a good record of this sadly but lets go with 30 hours or so (Had to do a lot for honor societies)

I want to major in computer engineering but I'm a big talker and love speaking to people so sort of want to get my background in Computer Engineering for a marketing background (hope that makes sense)

2wybrb,3,2015-02-23,Software testing internship before software developer?,sil222,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2wybrb/software_testing_internship_before_software/,"In your opinion, would you say that students looking for internships should try and land software testing positions before graduating and looking for fulltime software development?
I feel like by taking this route, you develop the fundamentals to writing good software tests. This is a valuable skill, because you will be faster at fixing bugs and creating good programs.
On the other hand, you miss out on learning real software development which might put you in a worse position compared to your peers. After you graduate, if you are looking for software development work and you are competing with students who have software development internships, you could have a significantly harder time. 

Will testing experience significantly help you become a better developer vs development experience?
Will employers rather see you did a software development internship and as a result make it harder to land software development jobs?"

I don't have any internship experience under my belt and it seems like it's impossible to get one now. 

The reason I'm not looking for full time is because in my last year, I got really into iOS development and since I haven't mastered it yet, I want to try to get an internship to get some real-world experience.

On all of the internships I've found, there's a requirement that says ""must be junior"" or ""must graduate in Spring 2016"" or something similar to ""we don't want graduates"". Are these requirements set in stone or can I still apply and get a chance at it?"

No macro knowledge but willing to learn. I'm an intern, so my excel knowledge isn't very extensive nor developed outside of the classroom.

Say I have workbooks with data on different buildings. Assume they have the same data structure, column names, everything. I need to pull a subsection of data from each file and arrange it in a new, separate file.

If it helps, say Data Set A has information on X, Y, and Z. But I need to make a new file with only bits X and Z so that I can feed it into a separate program. I need to find an efficient way to do this since this task will need to be completed multiple times in the future.

I've tried using =[FileName.xls]Sheet1!A1 to copy all the data I need from different files, and that seems to work for a single file. I was hoping to find a way to link the FileName.xls part to a specific cell so that I could edit one cell and everything in the new file would follow suit. I thought it would function similarly to any equation you make on a spreadsheet, but it doesn't appear to function that way with [text].

Am I going about this the wrong way? Any recommendations? I can post some sample stuff if that helps illustrate my issue. Thank you all very much!"

You know, side projects, internships as a software engineer, with a wide breadth of experience in many languages, but still depth in Android/Mobile development. I know how to play the industry game.

However, I've been interning for two years now with lots of side projects and industry has gotten boring. It might just be a phase or my position but I wanted to entertain the thought of pursuing my PhD and/or go for a research position in the next 5 years. If it matters, I think I would want to work on Managed Runtime Environment.  I've been reading some papers on the topic and the whole field interests me. 

My question is, how is the research and/or academia process different? From resume, to statement of purpose (which I see as a cover letter but much more serious), and including the interviews and the whole process!  How do I get into it? Do I just apply for positions in research labs? Do I pursue a masters to connect with researching professors? How do I apply to national labs? What makes me look good for those positions? Specifically, what looks good to a PhD program, a research lab, etc?

A little background info, I live in Brooklyn and attend uni in upstate New York. I started as a biology major and switched into CS my junior year (finally being accepted into the program my senior year, with one more semester to go.

Last spring I actively looked for summer internships but was disheartened after realizing I missed many deadlines. I have a 3+ major GPA, but my overall GPA is &lt; 3 (surprising, but I can provide more detail). Nonetheless , I've been told it's experience and drive that counts, even if I initially won't get into some of the bigger names.

I've been working on a rails app in my spare time. I graduated from University at Buffalo in 2012 with a BA degree in Economics. Starting May 26th I will be returning to the same school to pursue a BS in Computer Science. 

**Coursework/scheduling:** Because all of my gen-eds will be already dealt with due to my last degree, I plan on a BS in CompSci with a minor in math to take until the end of the fall semester, 2017 (about 2.5 years). This leaves room for 2 summers to shoot for internships.

Freshman or sophomore? Below I will list my intended schedule, compared to the ""recommended"" schedule given by the school for fresh undergrads. It looks like I would be just 1 class short to where a sophomore would be, as I won't be able to take ""Intro. to Programming Languages"" until I finish data structures, so the earliest I could take it would be the 2nd fall semester. Will this hold me back from good internship opportunities? I plan on trying to do research for the school, hackathons, and side projects during my first year. 

**My intended schedule:**

Summer 2015: 

* Calculus 1
* Calculus 2
* Intro to CompSci 1

Fall 2015: 

* Intro to CompSci 2
* Discrete Structures
* Digital Systems 
* Calc 3

Spring 2016: 

* Data Structures
* Intro to Probability
* Computer Organization
* An online algorithms course (most likely that offered by MIT)

Summer 2016: 

* Internship (hopeful)

I am currently on my second IT job. While I was still working on my associates, I had a paid internship kind of deal where I basically babysat a network at night and did school work. Once I graduated with my Associates in Computer Science/Network administration (also came with A+, NET+ SEC+ MCSA because I took the classes) I got an entry level helpdesk position for a local company in the medical field, despite the pay being lower than I expected. I have been happy in the position and learned a ton in the 9 months I have been here. I have been able to travel to set up other offices out of state, set up servers and install switches, phones, everything. So much beyond just workstations, although there is plenty of that. The amount I have learned has been phenomenal. I have learned more here in 9 months here than 2 years of school. I have also been promoted to lead technician, which is great. 

However, there is a catch. They are paying me 12 dollars an hour. I was hoping as lead tech, that they would bump me up to 14-15 an hour, but I just got notice for my raise and it will be 30 cents. So I will be making 12.30 an hour as lead technician going on a year with the company. I feel like they are screwing me over. Am I right?

Now I know I could make more doing the same thing elsewhere, exactly how much, I don't know. I want to do desktop support or help desk work. So the question is, should I go ahead and start applying for other jobs? I have seen plenty and the ones that list pay are at least 15 an hour starting out, and I do have the qualifications they are looking for. But I have not been here a full year and I don't want to look like a job hopper. I was at my previous position for exactly one year. Before that I worked for Papa Johns for a long while. 

This is also a fairly laid back position, and it makes me hesitant to go back in to the stuffy corporate world. I was not nearly as happy at my previous position because it was so much like office space, minus the humor. 

What do you guys think? Should I wait a little longer and start looking, or go ahead and start now? Should I admit to any prospective employers my true reason for leaving? or should I just suck it up and work for 12 an hour? I do not think that is a viable option based on my credentials and ability. 

Thanks for any and all advice!"

1995: Name Redacted, Female, Late Teens

I'm lucky, I truly am.

Lucky with so much competition, to even be considered for an internship at such a big company. Lucky, because I've gotten answers to some questions that I thought never would be answered, or could be answered. 

I'm from a very small town and I've always wanted to get away. I was always self aware though, to the clear reason why:

Teenage angst. Nothing more, nothing less.

I'm a spoilt, upper middle class kid. My parents are both doctors, and I've never really had to want for anything, other than rebellion, of course. So while I was painting my opinions and general world view red, feeling oppressed and fighting an intangible ""power"", I had no friends that shared that view. They were perfect, extremely good looking, smart and multi-lingual. Their personalities were golden too. They never had a bad word to say about anyone. When the argumentative me took over, I'd find myself being listened to fully, getting made to feel intelligent and respected without the slightest hint of patronisation even when I was being damn right insulting. They were wonderful people. Which made the grounds on which I got this job all the more peculiar.

There's this huge company whose headquarters are located just outside my hometown. ""A Wholesome Life"", they're a self help, guidance, I don't really know... Again, all the more peculiar. 

In a sea of rehearsed, perfectly dressed, highly knowledgable and sociable peers, here was I. Dragged there by my teacher, the C.E.O himself was to talk to our year. There's one of these talks annually for seniors, and every year an internship is offered. I've heard the company talked about constantly for the last few months, everyone was prepped to hell.  

So the talk begins, I, amongst a huge crowd, begin my descent into dreamy, epic alternative rock, headphones in. Thank god I chose a double concept album. Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness; I swear Billy Corgan ripped that straight from my mind. As the talk began, ""Tonight Tonight"" made whatever he said seem epic, even though it was probably typical corporate bullshit. I carried on letting the pumpkins rock my world. During quieter songs like ""Stumbleline"", I could hear vague words: ""whole again"", ""we can save them"", ""they need to let us in"" etc... 

At that moment, I looked around. Everyone seemed so transfixed! Must be some captivating shit. 

After the talk there was some sort of stately event, I don't think party sums up this level of posh. The CEO seemed to work his way around each group of students. At this point the niceness of my peers seemed to drop, realising that being seen with someone who simply doesn't care could hinder their chances, they left me standing on my own. To my annoyance, this drew the CEO's attention. 

He introduced himself as Jonathan, an impossibly young man who seemed wise beyond his years. He said he was looking for someone with ""that special something"".""Innovation is the key to the future"" he said. I decided to humour him for a second. I told him my goal. Quite simply, I told him that I want to change the world, but I didn't know how I'd do it. ""What's wrong with the world now?"" He asked.

I thought long and hard. This is the question that no one asks me, yet I attempt to answer every day. 

Every time I try, it comes out in a big ranting mess, I get too excited. But not this time. 

""Everything is temporary."" I said.

Jonathan smiled. He simply handed me a card.  ""A Wholesome Life"" - ""Let us in"" 

""5 o'clock, Monday"". He said with a smile on his face. 

""It's only ever one""  rippled through the crowd.

As Jonathan drew his apparently infamous card, supposedly part of the ritual every year, I could see the eyes descend on it, then me, then the heavens, accompanied by a curse, in quick succession. Looks filled with disappointment and envy that I can't fault knowing what I do now were everywhere.. 

Fake congratulations showered the walk home with my friends. They knew and I knew that I didn't deserve it. Whatever ""it"" was. I felt like I was missing something, but my teenage cynicism couldn't fight the overwhelming feeling that something truly special was most certainly in store.

I am seeking some advice, as I am not quite sure the direction in which I should go from here.

I am a 25 year old woman. I was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. Following my passion (and not thinking about my future as carefully as I should have), I got my B.A. and M.A. in Art History from two fairly prestigious universities, graduating with honors and a high GPA. Throughout high school, college and graduate school, I actively participated in multiple activities and community service, and held various internships and jobs, not only in galleries/museums/auction houses, but as a tutor, editor and legal assistant.

Since finishing graduate school several years ago and moving back to Los Angeles, I have been unable to secure permanent, stable work. I have applied to probably over 1,000 jobs, each tailored with its own, specific cover letter and follow-up to appropriate hiring managers, etc. I found several temporary and part-time positions, including one through a family friend, but nothing stable, with any potential future growth, or with a livable salary for Los Angeles. Mainly, though, I had about 10 interviews, including some multiple interviews for the same position, culminating with that company deciding to promote from within, or just never hearing back from that job, even after sending thank you notes/emailing/calling/being persistent, etc. It was extremely disheartening and depressing, to say the least.

Around 8 months ago, despite me not having stable work, my fiance (a real estate agent who was doing pretty well at the time) and I decided to move into an apartment together. Although it was reasonable for the area, the price was not cheap, to say the least. While I continued to job hunt, my fiance paid our bills and I worked on a resale business I had started several years ago, on eBay. But, after the immense amount of time that it took to find/list inventory, as well as the price of purchasing the goods and the fees owed to eBay at the end of the month, the profit was essentially null. Then, I started as a personal assistant/consultant to my fiance (real estate), which ended up not working out as his business began to slow to a stop, and I was being paid on commission, not salary. It was around this time that we decided to cut our losses, move out of the apartment, and back in with our respective families while we made a game plan of what to do next.

After a few months and due to some personal family things, we were told by both families that we would have to move out soon. At first, my fiance and I decided to look for the cheapest options in Los Angeles, but the cheapest places (even shared apartments/houses) in moderately safe areas (where we weren't at risk for being shot or mugged in the evening) were still upwards of $1200/month. This did not work for us.

My fiance was born and raised for much of his life in Oregon, and we immediately considered moving there. After doing some research, we were attracted by Oregon's lower cost of living and seemingly more plentiful jobs. We soon packed up, and decided to move to Oregon, planning to stay with my fiance's adult cousins while actively looking for work, and getting on our feet.

We have now been in Oregon for about a month and a half. Despite applying for jobs nearly daily, both online and in person, and both having several interviews each, we have only been able to secure very sporadic, very poorly paid work, including back-breaking manual labor, through employment/staffing agencies.

Recently, while on the phone with my father and lamenting over these difficulties and frustrations, he offered to pay for me to take some classes/training/etc. in another field or trade at a local community college, in leading to a job/career. I am not being choosy at all, at this point, and am not limiting my options to ANYTHING. I am seeking advice on what path I should take. What classes/career path is thriving in this economy, and in the future to come? Please keep in mind, I am open to most fields, but am not the best at very advanced math, science or technology. I am interested in teaching, criminal justice, nursing, and accounting, although I am completely unsure how to best take advantage of my father's generous offer. 

I am sure I am leaving a ton of details out, but I welcome any suggestions or guidance from you on what I should do next.

Thank you for reading! :)"

I'm a master's student studying CS at a top engineering school. I worked a few years in finance and decided to return to grad school because I preferred engineering. 

I've been looking for summer SWE internships, and really I want to intern at a tech-focused company, whether one of the big 4 or a startup. But I've been getting rejected at the phone interview stages and at the moment I've been rejected at 2 of the big 4 companies. I've practiced using CTCI, CareerCup, Programming Interviews Exposed. During interviews, it's not that the questions are particularly difficult, but I just freeze up a lot.

For the remaining two big-4 companies, I'm still in the process (interviews this week and next week). I also still applied for finance and consulting (as backup) and I currently have 2 offers to finance quant internships. So, it's not a terrible situation at all, and I'm grateful to have offers ... but it's not the career change I was hoping for.

I wanted to see if there's anyone else in this subreddit who's faced similar frustrations for internship recruiting, identified what needed to change about himself/herself, used any further resources to practice, and were successful during full-time recruiting.

Through my internships I found out that I simply dislike programming and software engineering in general. It does not excite me to sit and code all day. I enjoy solving Hacker Rank and Project Euler challenges but only a few times a month for a couple of hours a day. I prefer spending my free time playing basketball and hanging out with my girlfriend. I don't go to hackathons.

I've had internships where I have had to develop web apps, mobile apps, and desktop apps, and I found that web development and app development simply are not for me.

However, I do enjoy CS theory. Theory of computation, computer architecture, and x86 machine programming have been my favorite classes so far. Unfortunately, my GPA isn't nearly high enough to get into a good graduate program in the US (3.4). I got a lot of Bs my freshman and sophomore year and only recently have I been getting As.

So what options are there for people in my situation? Do we completely change our career paths? I like CS, I just do not want to be a software engineer or web developer. I'd definitely be willing to go to grad school if I find a program interesting enough. What types of graduate programs would you guys recommend looking into?"

The one I got offered is more technical and requires me to code for 30-40% of the time (in Java, SQL, Python) and interact with clients and business customers for the rest of the time. The other job has me working within an experienced global supply chain management team using SAP, and spend most of my time interacting with different groups and team members to implement the company's or external clients' supply chains effectively.

I'm currently studying Industrial Engineering and aim to go into finance (...become a financial analyst perhaps?) somewhere down the line. Apart from that desire, I don't really know what I would like to become a professional in. Sometimes I'm drawn to consulting while other times I'm super interested in joining the ultra competitive finance world...

I'm more interested with the supply chain job because I feel like Supply chain management is a booming (and an immortal) field and I could possibly go into SC consulting or become a project manager for a large corp's supply chain sometime in the future if I like what I do. This internship would also help me develop project and people management skills...
However, the IT technical job would help me develop coding skills that could be useful and applied to a number of other industries, but wouldn't distinguish me from tons of computer or electrical engineering students out there...

Regarding these two jobs: what do you guys think would be more likely to give me the skills I could leverage in other jobs after graduation or be more useful in the long-term? Is coding and IT software development/implementation (something I'm not super passionate about, but can try and handle...) more helpful than an exposure to a supply chain management system? 

Any help would be much appreciated!! :)"

I graduated from a great university with a degree in business administration and entertainment management. My ""dream"" career is to work on the business side of the entertainment industry as an agent or an exec, preferably in television. I came from a family where nobody had gone to college, so I wasn't really aware of how crucial internships and networking were during college (although I did have an administrative assistant position for a little over two years in the foodservice industry while I attended college), and feel like I fell behind the pack. 

I picked up a seasonal position immediately after graduating last May at a movie studio doing tours (foot in the door etc). The position ended shortly after summer, and since then I have been trying my ass off to network my way into any type of entertainment company, whether it be a temp, data entry, administrative, or executive assistant position. I've had no such luck, and on a majority of the applications that I feel I'm an excellent fit for, I don't even get an interview. I've spent hours upon hours networking and going to informational interviews, being led on for weeks about possible job openings in a company, only to not even be offered a chance to interview for the position due to the company hiring internally. 

I'm just about out of funds and I've opened my job search up to any entry level associate/administrative position, even if it's not in entertainment. I'm not sure if anyone has advice for me, but I'm feeling very down about my current situation and seeing all of my friends working in their dream fields while I struggle to even get an interview for a crappy position in mine has really put a damper on my outlook. I'm trying to be strong minded and continue to keep a positive attitude, but the fact that I don't even get an opportunity to prove the work I can do is starting to get depressing.

Thank you so much if you took the time to read this - I'm sure it sounds whiny, but I honestly just have no clue what to do at this point and I feel like I need to make something happen NOW if I want a successful career in that industry.

TLDR: Graduated with a degree in business/entertainment management, held a temp job at a movie studio, have almost three years of admin/exec assistant experience, and still failing to get interviews even after months of networking and applying to positions I feel that I certainly qualify for. How do I get these highly in-demand companies to give me a chance?"

I think. I took 6 months off from school, so I guess I'm a 2.5 year? Not sure. Anyway, what the title says.

So I've basically lived and breathed programming ever since I was 13... I initially got into it because I wanted to make video games, and I just kept going deeper and deeper. I've basically ingrained 'programmer' as part of my identity at this point. I already have had a couple of internships at successful companies and [i have a pretty good resume i think](http://r333d.com/resume.pdf)... but I just don't really feel it anymore. I only initially got into programming because of the video game aspect and I've lost interest in that as a career a long time ago. I just don't really feel like I'm helping make things better, if that makes sense. I feel more of a calling to BME. Neural engineering in particular.

The problem is if I continue with software engineering I'm basically guaranteed a good but unfulfilling career, and if I switch to biomedical engineering it's sort of unknown. There's also the huge plus that biomedical engineering at UC Davis is amazingly good compared to computer science.

So basically my question is... what should I do? Is my line of thinking stupid? Am I too late? Should I stay a CS major but drop in on biomed classes, or the other way around? Or should I just continue with CS and try to get a job in the biomedical field as a SWE and ease my way in that way?

Thanks."

I've got some questions before the interview!,nappyheadedimus,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/2x21u4/embedded_firmware_engineering_internship_ive_got/,"Hi there. I've posted here a few times before and the community always seems to be very helpful and encouraging.

I'm interviewing tomorrow for an internship position at a company that deals with electronic control and protection (overload relays, pump controllers, etc). The position involves developing, testing, and reviewing embedded microcontroller firmware for new products/features. The job would include writing, reviewing, and maintaining firmware... identifying bugs... participating in code reviews, etc. 

So my questions for the community here:

 - What kinds of concepts should I be absolutely sure to go into the interview with? What are the things that would make me look really bad if I had to say ""I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with ___""?

 - Where can I go to get an idea of how this kind of firmware is written? I've programmed a few different microprocessors (ATMega on the Arduino, PIC32) but I haven't done any firmware work in any of my courses.

 - How does Python play into this role? The position requirements suggest experience with Python or another scripting language. I have none (to my knowledge) and I'm guessing it would be helpful to at least familiarize myself with this before going into the interview.

All in all, I'm pretty confident. I feel like I would enjoy doing this kind of work. And when I enjoy something, I really start to run on all cylinders. When that's the case, watch out! And if not... it's just an internship. I'll still have the experience.

Thanks in advance for your thoughts. All replies are welcome.

Everyone seems to be in agreement that 33k is far too low. I sent a reply to their email last night stating the median for boulder is 50-55k. I also asked for more details about time off 401k and the other benefits. I'll be sure to update with what happens. 

**Edit 2** I received a reply. They are holding firm at 33k. Their argument is that I have no prior experience with their stack, which is totally true. I'm new to Web dev, my internships and classes were all systems programming. Other benefits include: 401k matching vested immediately at 4%. Company pays for 50% of health care. Office is 5 mins walking from my apt. Unlimited time off, super flexible hours. Is this really that bad of a deal? Does taking this offer really hinder my progress as much as some of you have said? 

Here's the whole story:

I graduated last December with a BS in CS. I've been on the job hunt ever since, and have been doing a lot of reading about salary negotiation.

I'm well aware of Rule Number 1, which is ""never give a number first."" But I was caught off guard, because my first engagement with this particular company was a casual conversation with one of their employees at a bar. In this conversation, we discussed some general things about computer science and I asked for advice on finding a job. Among his job advice, he asked ""what kind of salary are you expecting to get?""

Before this point, I've been reading up on r/personalfinance and making a budget for my first job, and I've calculated that I need to be in the ballpark of 2k/month to be able to pay for taxes/insurance, rent, food, and a car. So I unwittingly told him that. Naturally, I would be much more comfortable with a higher salary than just 24k take-home pay, but I didn't make that clear in that moment.

Come to find out, this guy's company (small startup) is hiring an entry level engineer and want to interview me. The interview went well and I just received their offer: sure enough, 33k. I've done research on glassdoor, salary.com, payscale, and through friends and relatives, and I've found that an entry level developer in my area (Boulder CO) goes for a lot higher, like in the 50-60s. How true is that really? I searched this sub for salary info and I just can't fathom a fresh college graduate making $90k, even if you DO live in Seattle. How bad did I shaft myself?

Here's where I need the most help though. **How do I counter their offer without seeming like I'm going back on my word?** I basically already told the guy I could live off of a 33k salary, but honestly I'd be much more comfortable being in (at least) the mid 40s. There's no way they'll bump the offer that high, right?

I do have one bit of hope, which is I'm waiting on another company to see if they'll send me an offer. With that company (slightly larger but still under 50 people), there were zero mentions of salary or compensation in the interview. So if company B offers me a higher salary, I suppose I could use that as leverage with company A."

Standing in the belly of an Airmaster hovercraft, jumpsuits on and rifles loaded, the 7th rifles platoon, redubbed ""The Experience"", was not shaking in their boots like any other platoon would have been having to face up against a Shimmer Outpost. Instead of shaking, boots were tapping, and over the righteous guitar blasting over the sonic-emitters in the front of the hovercraft, General Groove was yelling at us. He wasn't yelling about battle-plans or about enemy-weaknesses, but instead about the song which the one called 'Hendrix' had released. 

""THIS SONG IS CALLED PURPLE HAZE, DUDES"", The usually mellow General Groove shouted over the song. ""HENDRIX RECORDED IT IN 1969 AND IT IS PSYCHEDELIC, MAN!"" 

""PSYCHEDELIC!"" the men yelled in turn, following it up with ""HOO-RAH!"" 

As we flew towards the enemy outpost, we feared nothing, Because the General of Groove was with us, and his magic sounds were blasting from our ship.

General Groove was not actually a General. He was a Sergeant Major, and his name was Flynn. Despite this, the once cryo-frozen, now very much living Sergeant Major Flynn was affectionately referred to as ""General Groove"" by his men. 

Flynn himself didn't mind this. In fact, he had loved it. Flynn, as a soldier, had not really been all that special. The only thing which had set him apart in any way whatsoever had been his copious consumption of Acid and the fact that he had checked the ""organ donor"" box on the back of his license when his very own government had plucked him out of Vietnam in 1972 and ushered him through miles of underground tunnels to a secret facility which, according the the US government had never existed. Flynn had been a lab-rat. A human subject of the greatest resilience, he had been integral in MKULTRA, MKULTRA II, and PROJECT ESP, all conducted behind the scenes by the CIA. They found him to be an excellent test subject due especially to his resilience towards psychedelic drugs. When they froze him up in '76, and locked him in the basement of some bunker for the next 200 years, Flynn had had no idea what was going on. The last two years prior had been a living trip for him, and so when they put him in the experimental glass tube, he hadn't even been sure if it was happening at all. 

Sergeant Major Finnigan Flynn had been, for the most part, forgotten. Well after the time that cryo-freezing and unfreezing had been perfected, and well again after the time that his signed waivers had worn off and worn to dust in some dilapidated CIA wearhouse. It had been completely by fluke that the Government had found him again; and it had been in one of our darkest hours. 

The United Earth Empire, lead by three leaders, had been pushed to the brink by a brutish Alpha-Centaurian threat who the earthlings had taken to calling the Shimmers. See, Shimmers could hardly be seen, thanks to the frequency emitters which made up the bulk of their military standard-issue packs. They weren't much bigger than humans, and 1 on 1, studies had shown that an earthling was on average more intelligent, had quicker reflexes, and was stronger.. but even still, the sonic power of their suits could keep them invisible, and safe even from bullets, which bounced off of them like pop-corn kernels. The humans were scared shitless, and looking for any avenue they could explore against the Shimmers, which is how exactly they came to find the self-professed General of Groove. 

""I hear he's a super-soldier!"" said one lowly-paid intern to another as they huddled behind the line of legitimate Generals. ""No, no, it can't be that, look at his lack of muscles! Maybe he's a masterful tactician!"" Said a second. 

""Cut the chatter, back there"" snapped a head-honcho. ""All records of this sub-basement level had been erased, and the experiment logs with it. All we know about him is that he was stuck in here in 1974 and that his name is Sergeant Major Finnigan Flynn. 

And with the defrosting, and the opening, and the clearing of the smoke 7 days later after the paperwork to unleash him had been filed, Sergeant Major Flynn had been released into the world once again. 

Pushing his shoulder-length hair out of his eyes, and lowering his purple-tinted glasses down over his nose, Flynn gazed upon the groups of strangely-dressed military-men and women in front of him. 

""Whoa.."" he exclaimed, ""Is this Canada?"" he asked the woman standing in front of him. The intern in the back asked ""what's Canada?"" quietly and the second intern simply shrugged. 

Aside from what he had assumed to be a sarcastic joke from some dude in the back, the first words that Flynn heard in some 200 years were thus; ""Sergeant Major Finnigan Flynn, My name is General Blum. The year is 2179, and for the last two centuries, give or take, you have been frozen in a sub-basement of the CIA. This may be a lot to take in, but everyone you knew is dead, Humanity has reached multiple solar-systems, and a para-galactic threat now beats down upon our doorstep, threatening to destroy humanity as a whole. Now, all records of your existence had been destroyed before we got to you, and in this time of war we have devoted countless man-hours and dollars into you, shall we say, resurrection. We do not know what your value is, so please, Sergeant Major, will you tell us who you are?"" 

At this point, Flynn had been fresh enough for the residual centuries-old Lysergic acid diethylamide to have awaken, and all he managed to get out before sitting himself back down in his pod was ""I'm the General of groove, baby!"" 

Humanity had awoken a burn-out. A stoner. A hippy. 

Humanity had awoken the Hero that would help to save them all, for it was General Groove. 

His rank had allowed him several squads to command, and though most of the time none of the Brass knew very much of what he was saying, all they knew is that every time they sent the 7th rifles out on a mission, they returned not only victorious, but virtually casualty free. The only casualty, in fact, which had been suffered in the prior 3 conflicts had been one man who came back with strange symptoms, and rambling incoherently. Fearing some 20th century super-disease, doctors had rushed to the General, asking if there was anything he knew about the soldier. 

""Relaaax, man,"" he had said ""he just partied too hard. Give him twelve hours and he'll be good to go, you'll see"" and so he was. 

Battle after Battle was won at the hands of the General, and though I'm not a scientist, I will try and explain why. 

The Shimmers were very different from humans. They were bipedal, sure, but insectoid, and with a vastly different technological and sociological repertoire. Never had they created any sort of art, music, or really anything indicative of culture, so when they developed their shimmer-drives, which granted them their strength and durability, they really thought that there were no natural draw-backs. That was until the introduction of Shock and Awe to the equation. What the General had done, is that in blasting this music, this ""hendrix"" as he called it, he overpowered the sonic-drives of the Shimmers, leaving them naked, embarassed, and altogether weak compared to us. 

Which is why, touching down on the Martian surface, our Hovership blaired ""purple haze"", the guitar screaming through the air, the drums like the percussions of hell, and the bass thick, vibrating in our souls. We touched down as the music played, and our guns blazed the second we were on the ground, debilitating Shimmer after Shimmer in our wake. The song switched to the next on the tape, a band called the ""The Rolling Stones"" with a song called ""sympathy for the devil"". It started with primal drums, and barbaric screaming, before growing. Bass was added, and piano, and it all sped up and grew just as the battle did. They fought hard, and so did we, but despite the battle, despite the terrors of war, every single member of the Experience had a smile upon their face. The General started laughing. Not a joyful laugh, but the laugh of a soldier. The ironic, ""*oh for fucks sake*"" laugh that every veteran can't help but laugh every once and a while at the absurdity of it all. 

And as the song grew, so did our laughter. The sound rose until the guitar solo, as all that could be heard was the crack of gunfire, the screams of the Shimmers, and the laughter of us Earthlings. 


And that is how a small, bipedal, fat-covered species from Earth became the most terrifying species in the entire Galactic cluster. A scene which had been repeated in a thousand earthling movies from 1950 to 2150 and onward was indeed one of the most terrifying things that any other species had ever seen, once the videos had leaked onto the holonet. For who could be that crazy? What species could be that insane? Others species made war, sure, and some loved it! But none.. none before had harboured and became warlike as we humans did with that guitar urging us on, and with the General, long-hair flowing, in front of us like a madman.

I'm an Android developer looking for an internsip. I'm currently on a gap year and I need a way to help pay for school so I'm pretty much open to anything at this moment. I'm primarily a Java programmer but I do know other languages (C#, Lua, Clojure, Python and Javascript).

I've developed different apps. I have two apps on the Google Play store. One is a simple joke app[1] and the other is a simple weather app[2] . I'm currently working on my 3rd and 4th apps. I helped develop an app called Captor which provides real life subtitles using Google Cardboard and augmented reality. You can check it out here[3].

I'm open to relocating anywhere for the internship though I'd prefer to relocate to the Bay Area since I have connections of getting a place to stay out there.

2x5adr,9,2015-02-25,"I work for a start-up that has great potential with a good group of people. The problem is the money isn't great after 3.5 years, but it's not bad either. How long should I stick things out before I take my skills elsewhere?",CuriousThrowaway416,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/2x5adr/i_work_for_a_startup_that_has_great_potential/,"**tl;dr - Work for a company with good potential and is experiencing success, but pay hasn't been what I had hoped for after my most recent raise. Wondering what my options are and how long I should give the company if I look for a new opportunity?**

---------------------------------

I currently work for a start-up in the tech industry and have been here for 3.5 years (4 this June). I came on board as a software dev intern and have moved up into a mixed role that's along the lines of IT management, business development/sales, and marketing. I like what I'm doing a lot and my only real complaints are money and the commute (1hr 15min to 1.5hrs, not the worst, but it's gotten old).

Our company has seen good success in the time that I've been here and we're expected to double revenue this year. We have solid offerings and have contracts with some big federal agencies and tax authorities both US and international. We also have contracts with the Big 4 accounting firms and are growing on the corporate and law markets.

My co-workers are all easygoing and the team is always open to new ideas. The CEO listens to most everything I say and I was able to convince the company that I should be doing my hobby as part of my job (marketing/training videos). The CFO also mentioned that the company is currently undergoing valuation and I'm expected to be offered equity in the next couple months.

From what I've seen, I do believe that we can certainly double revenue and grow quite a bit, but my recent pay raise was not quite what I expected, given my performance and stepping up to the plate when we experienced a bit of turnover last year, for acceptable reasons (one had a kid and left for a big corp for money, one left for her dream job with a non-profit, and one left to become a stay-at-home dad).

However, I just got a pay raise from $49k/yr to $51k/yr and I closed a nice non-US government contract, took over handling vendor accounts, do all in-house IT work, and started producing marketing/training content that has led to favorable opportunities (quite a few clients mentioned the videos gave them a better idea on what we had to offer and wanted to either demo or trial).

I was thinking of having a conversation with our Director of Business Development, who says I'm doing a great job on helping him with our market (he had asked the CEO for me to help him for the past year and I didn't know, but I was engaged in other responsibilities) about where I started and where I'm at now and feel that he can help talk to the CFO about reconsidering my compensation if I continue to perform well or even better than expected.

**My question to everyone would be--if you were in my shoes, what are my options and if I were to move on to better opportunities, how long should I give myself?**"

MIPs, hardware, algorithm analysis, Operating systems, PCB's, Gannt charts, theory, context free grammer, and a ton of other stuff that I'm currently too burnt out to remember off the top of my head. 

I would like do software engineering, programming, or something along that vein. The general pointers I've gotten are learn UML, Java, php, ruby, and that I should network a lot if I hope to find a decent job. I've worked 3 internships and only one of them was computer related, and that was IT. I don't think my resume is much to look at. I'm a young guy, 23 years old, if that helps at all.

I am graduating with my English degree but coming back to school immediately for a second bachelor's program in Computer Science. I'll be 25 when I graduate. I'm actually excited and seeing this as my second chance at doing college right and a time to get internships and everything. I was very sick sophomore year through recently so I spent less time focusing on what I wanted career-wise and more on my health.  
  
But I've decided I hate my major. I want to pursue a stem field and my interests pointed me to programming/computer science. So I took courses here and loved it. Unfortunately, the only way to get into my school's program is to come back after graduating instead of just tacking it on to my degree and extending my stay. I tried to contact people about this but they just won't admit seniors. Luckily, I won't have to repeat gen eds, global/language requirements, and only be doing the CompSci curriculum. It's seriously amazing.   
  
I'm also doing really well in my CS courses and I feel happy (albeit frustrated and confused as well lol) about my decision. I get a sense of fulfillment from completing my work I never got from literature and writing.  
  
Now...so...a random fear I have is if me being 25 when getting into the workforce is gonna hurt me. Can't really do anything about it, but I want to prepare myself for any challenges I may have and prepare myself.  
  
Also, will having a degree in a humanities make me ""interesting"" to employers, or will they just only care about my ability and CS degree?  
  
Thanks!"

So if I were asked in an interview how much experience do I have with Python, would I be okay in saying that I can easily learn Python given what I already have done with F#? 

I will also note that I have learned a bunch of other languages all in the last year, starting with C, then working my way to more modern languages like C++, Java, SQL. So learning new languages is quite easy for me."

So I went to my first job fair today and I feel a lot smaller because of it. This was a ""techfest"" at my university and most of the jobs were related to electrical engineering or software engineering. I found 0 data mining internships, and few data analyst positions which were just marketing positions with data analysis. 

I like data mining and I've been reading ISL and ESL and coding in Python's scikit-learn, pandas, numpy and I have a twitter bot and a current research assistant position at my school for educational data mining. I'm learning the machine learning algorithms for supervised and unsupervised learning and applying them directly to real data, and I know some Java and have been coding as a hobby since middle school. My major is applied math and I have a minor in economics. Overall I feel like I'm on a good path towards data mining as a career but going to this jobs fair made me feel like I'm behind or perhaps misplaced since so few of these tech companies have openings (entry/intern/full-time/whatever) for recent grads or senior level undergrads related to data mining/machine learning/ data analysis. 

I went on AngelList and there are a lot of fun sounding internships and data mining jobs, but they often have very little to no compensation. Do you think applying to startup data mining related jobs is a good way to get into the industry? I feel like there still might be stiff competition but at least there are opportunities here. I am also wondering how people would apply to positions without compensation... I mean are they just taking on another job for finances and the 0 compensation angellist position as experience?

Hmm... I guess I'm just here for advice on getting into industry of data mining. I have also considered applying to some sort of online masters program such as OMSCS at gatech for the specialization of machine learning, but I'm wondering if there are any straight-out-of-college pieces of advice that anyone from this subreddit can offer. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. "

I'm a transfer student from a tech school with an AAS in Computer and Electrical Engineering. Going to Uni would net me a BS in CompSci in only 2 years.

Recently applied for an internship at a Wisconsin powerplant company (Dairyland Power Co-op) for Student Applications Programmer. Haven't heard back yet but told my boss of the interview because I respect transparency in the work place.

The boss told me all about his time as a contractor and how he got a lot of work here and there and how he eventually ended up with an $80K salary where we both currently work.

He told me he worried I might get stuck going down one path and he didn't want to see me get my self locked into a degree and internship. He expressed how he felt if I just stayed with the company and showed him my programming skills he could move me into development (Embedded procs and etc.) and that I could be matched wage wise to a student just entering the work force but without debt. He feels the fair market value for a software engineer in Wisconsin (particularly the coulee region) would be $45K/yr (to start). I'm not sure this is correct, glass door was showing more like $65K for Jr. Devs and Java Coders.

I also have had ambitions to work for on of the Big 4. I'm not even sure that's possible without my compsci degree. My boss said if I want to go to college he complete understands because it's about what I feel is best for me and at age 23 I'm young enough to get stuff done and continue on a good career path. He just asked that I give a month notice so they can hire someone and I can help train to leave the company in a good place (something I don't mind doing).

As professionals with successful careers and lots of experience where I have none... please help me. What is the better options here? Currently making $16.50/hr as a technician.

**Background** 

* I earned a BS in Economics and Finance a few years back and decided to go back to school for CS three semesters ago.
* I am in my early thirties.
* I started a small retail business with my wife in 2012. Although it is successful, it is unlikely to expand beyond its niche.


**School:**
I have excelled in the program, having a 4.0, but am beginning to feel like my time may be best spent somewhere else. The school is definitely not a prestigious program but is a larger state school. 

The only core classes I have remaining are algorithms, automata, ethics, and capstone. I will be taking these courses minus the capstone next fall and have already completed all of the math requirements for the program. At this point, I will not graduate until fall of 2016 given the electives that I still need to take.

Moving to attend a different school is not a practical alternative given tuition increase. Moving for a job is fine.

**Internship:**
For the last year, I have had an internship, concurrently with school, that has given me complete independence to develop a web and mobile application while also supporting the team with other unique and interesting applications to support the project. I am the sole software person for this NASA funded team of a dozen scientists all of whom have phd's and are leaders in their field. This experience has been invaluable and my contract has already been renewed for another year. (position is dependent on me being a student or having recently been a student)

**Dilemma:**
Recently I have been feeling less and less excited about school and I wish that I could focus more on my internship and other side projects instead. I am also getting diminishing returns on my coursework partly due to poor professors and being required to work with less than enthusiastic students for many of my classes. This CS program is definitely allowing too many students to coast through. I feel like I am moving at a snail's pace.

**Questions**

* Is it possible for me to drop out and get a job after my next semester and having completed nearly all of the core courses?
* Are there any other alternatives for me? Bootcamps? 
* How would I approach potential employers with this? Just a really concise but effective cover letter?

Thanks for the help!

1. Is there much functional difference between the ArcGIS and QGIS software? I tried ArcGIS once in university but dropped out because of the high learning curve for a non-IT student (at least myself) but I regretted it afterwards because of the lost skill opportunity.

2. With regards to the above, how long does it normally take to get used to the software? I have about about a month left on the internship, but I might find it useful for further studies or other employment environments."

My course has everyone doing an internship during the summer though so I was working 9-5 and studying after work in the office.) most of them aren't interested, and the others I butted heads a bit with senior management who weren't interested in interviewing and didn't want to be there, but who were forced by the company.All I felt out of that was arrogance and a lack of professional respect - not a place I want to be near.

My internship was in a well known multinational where I did work that was pretty much unrelated to my degree (telco serverside, server processor power/performance, testing and building new server software set-ups). They were very happy with me and my performance on work that I have no formal education in and they're trying to bring me back on board however the team doesn't recruit often and just recruited a new member while I was there. They were impressed with my understanding of the business unit and their market and where they fit. They didn't enforce deadlines on my project at the start and since they were all completed in good time, they didn't see it as necessary to give deadlines.

My course hasn't got much programming - a bit of matlab and some very minor c# and processing. I've learned a bit of C/C++ myself for my project in final year. Its more focussed on signal processing methods, IC design, telecomms theory, etc. 

I've had the opportunity to do some industrial design as part of my final year project on a new rapid prototyping tool and to look at the business side of the product and honestly, its what I've enjoyed the most out of my degree. I've been able to have a look into the product design area through family ties (small company, no room for more people), including hands on work finishing prototypes for customers and some minor design work. Its an area that I'm interested in but I dont think my degree won't really help me get into the area. My options there is to do a masters in product design, but most of the courses seem to have a bigger focus on aesthetics rather than robust design.

I don't really know where to go right now. I've got to have a sit down chat with my dad about it and a lecturer or two in my department. 

This post is sort of looking for options. Is there anything I've missed? Is there an area I'm not considering where I might fit?  I'm kind of just looking for options at the moment as its so late in the game. 

My grades aren't bad this year. I'm at 68% for last term which is a strong 2.1 in Ireland grading system, 2.1 is standard required for most jobs here.  

As an FYI, Irish Grading System:
70%+: 1.1
60%-69%: 2.1
50% - 59%:2.2
40% - 49%: pass
39% and under: fail

Long and rambling a bit, sorry. I'm in heavy deadline territory at the moment."
2x8ate,3,2015-02-26,Can I still negotiate for more pay? Or did I mess up?,youngeditor,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2x8ate/can_i_still_negotiate_for_more_pay_or_did_i_mess/,"Hello all,

TL;DR: I got pressured into agreeing to a pay-rate I was hoping to adjust but didn't sign any contracts yet.
I should probably note that I am 24 years old and graduated from a respected film school in The United States in 2012. Since that time I have worked a video internship at a noteworthy business after which I transitioned into freelance work. This is my first job, in my field, with regular hours.

I am in a confusing situation where I think I missed my opportunity negotiate a raise. I have been working at video company based in Europe as of November last year, under a 3 month freelancer contract as a video editor/copywriter/voice-over performer.

After some initial training to their house style, (and the limited editing software we have to use) I believe I have integrated well into the company.
They produce entertainment and news items, but I was hired as a core member of a new department that creates feature and editorial style videos with (examples not real) titles like “The real reason you are always sick”, “The Balkan conflict explained in 5 steps”, “Why you shouldn't visit Paris!”

Besides writing the majority of the scripts for these feature videos, I also perform voice over, in an American English Accent, for my videos as well as their news and entertainment videos. I also provide notes and script checks for other peoples items, edit video items based on my own or other peoples scripts, and brainstorm ideas and concepts for future videos.

My department unfortunately, has apparently not completely proven itself yet. It's unclear if the videos we create have a “real” benefit to the company, but they are considered an investment at the moment. Only one of our videos has apparently been a real ""hit”, with 600,000+ views. Nothing else has gotten that close. This is the information that I've received from my manager. Though I do believe that these videos are used as a selling point to differentiate this company for others when trying to score new clients.

I work 4 days a week, for €16 an hour. I am not provided with any benefits and operate under a freelancer contract. Well, at least I used to.
My three month contract that I was initially hired under has passed, and my manager, who I work closely with everyday, pulled me aside one afternoon and asked if wanted to renew for another 3 months, or 6 months. She recommended 6 months since ""in case things don't work out the company will still be obligated to keep me on in some way"" and when I asked about room to negotiate pay she said there wasn't any. It all felt quite a bit rushed and I regret not discussing it further.

When the new 6 month contract was offered I crossed out the non-competition clauses which I felt didn't pertain. From my first interview on I was always clear that I would continue freelancing at other businesses. This became apparently a bit of an issue, not because the clause is valid, but because of the dealings that would be involved in getting it changed. I have so far worked two weeks without a contract as we get this mattered settled. Though I am not worried about resolving this as most people involved know that the language in the contract needs altering, I am concerned about the lack of their initiative to get this solved.

As such, nothing is signed and though I did sign the original contract, but with the non-competition clauses crossed out, the CEO didn't sign it in return.
Is it too late for me to discuss a better rate? My freelance rate for less regular editing work is between €40 to €50, which they know, but those jobs can't guarantee 32 hours a week.

I have recently been in talks with a post production company that has hired me before and they are interested in bringing me in for more work, editing as well as (higher paying) directing jobs. I have promised that I can provide them with one day a week as well as most weekends. However, once again, it doesn't have the reliability that is provided with my current company, and I wish to combine my work, not move over to them completely unless it's a clear and viable option.

Interestingly enough this all got spurred up because I am researching a new video item about how to negotiate a better salary (should get us a lot of hits!)

I heard it's all about connections because it's a small office and they hire at most 1 intern a year, maybe none. I do have a close friend who knows some junior people there, but no one on an executive level. Should I cold-email some LinkedIn contacts (and non-contacts) about potential internships? Here are some details about me:

Pros (for this company)

- I come from a target school in the US, and since it's Asia, that would be impressive.

- I speak perfect English and am passably fluent in the native language, although my reading and writing is not great. People in the office need to speak both English and native language.

- I have a strong resume with internships at lots of top American companies.

Cons:

- I've already graduated. I think most internships are for people who haven't graduated yet? However, I'm still on the market for a full time job and just want to try things out with an internship.

- I have no direct experience at companies that do similar things to said company.

- No top level executive connections.

- There is no internship position for this office on the website, but my connections say they do exist.

- Not perfectly fluent in native language.

So what do you think my best course of action should be? Get people to refer me, cold email LinkedIn contacts, both...?

Thanks for your help!"

I'll be working with 2 other interns and a full time developer mentor. At Guidewire I'll be working on one of 3 projects with other interns and one mentor, but I'm in one room with a bunch of other full time developers as well. The projects are basically an IDE, a system that calculates and displays data in a pretty graphical layout, and  a sandbox type system. I'll be paid 16.55-17/hr at TWN (they said their budget is tight) and idk about Guidewire.

2x9ik3,3,2015-02-26,stuck between a rock and a hard place,integralvoid,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2x9ik3/stuck_between_a_rock_and_a_hard_place/,"Flair: Work, Personal, School    
.   
I’m between a rock and a hard place with my education. After this semester I’ll only need 4 classes to graduate, which I had scheduled for Summer I and Summer II, however the one class that was irreplaceable was cancelled. Normally I could get a waiver and take something else, but I’m already taking two other courses that are outside of my intended field. I feel if I add a third it might dilute my degree too much. Also, I have virtually no industry experience since my one and only internship was very light on technical duties, since they were a startup and had all of their tech needs are addressed by another company in exchange for a profit sharing scenario. I possibly have the following options…    
.    
**Some pertinent information:** I’m a single dad, my 2 kids live with me full time. I’m a vet so my education is paid for and while I am actively enrolled in a session I receive a decent stipend. It’s enough for basic living expenses, and a small amount of the occasional babysitter (which I use for going to my classes). If I’m not enrolled I can’t afford my expenses and I currently don’t work because the daycare cost incurred would be too much for me to afford financially.    
.    
**Option 1:** Take intended classes for Summer 1, get a full time job in July, finish masters by taking one course a semester for Fall 2015 and Spring 2016.   
This is the kind of middle of the road approach, overall it seems like a horrible idea unless I can confirm that I have a solid offer by that time, with a reasonable salary. This would be a decent scenario, especially if it allowed me to move out of NY.    
.    
**Option 2:** Take intended classes for Summer 1, Take more classes outside of discipline during Summer 2, get a full time job in Sept.    
This is the brute force, head on approach. I’ll have my masters, but I won’t have that focus in my degree and it may trigger some controversy if someone asks me why I would take courses that wouldn’t benefit me. However, if I got a solid offer to start somewhere in Sept. I could definitely leave NY and live somewhere with a reasonable cost of living. Also, I’m not even sure I can convince my department chair to sign off on any more waivers, especially since she’s already signed off on so many.     
.    
With these first two options this could possibly cost me in terms of my initial salary of wherever I start. This will also probably limit my options. What concerns me the most is how it will affect my career in the long run because it might stifle opportunities to advance in my field.   
.     
**Option 3:** Take out a 10K unsubsidized loan to cover living expenses, do a relevant full time summer internship, take a full load Fall 2015 and maybe continue my internship part time, then get a full time job in Jan. somewhere else, hopefully with a significantly better salary. This option will probably be best for me long term, it just costs the greatest in the short term. Also, I'm worried that the debit incurred will potentially offset whatever I may gain from taking this route.    
.    
*What would you do?*   
.   
**EDIT #1:** My lease is up April 1st, my landlord has verbally agreed to extend my lease 2 months up until June, but that I might have to sign another 1 year lease at minimum if I want to stay past June 1st. Time is critical.    
.   
**EDIT #2:** My advisor is grossly incompetent. She couldn't even be bothered to send my department chair an updated course sheet for me earlier this month, something that would have literally taken less than 5 minutes. I know because that’s how long it took me to bring it up to date. Also, anytime I ask her for a waiver she says it's impossible. I've been avoiding her since last fall because she almost screwed me out of my BS due to some missing waivers in my file. Waivers that were supposed to be there, and I had an email paper trail with proof. After two months of driving me crazy, she magically figured it out. There's more to the story, but it's irrelevant for the purposes of this post. I have been taking care of my business and going directly to my department chair. I just contact her via forwarded emails letting her know that she needs to get waivers together, and I make sure to CC the chair so she actually does it. Paper trail FTW!    
.     
My current degree is Master of Science in Information Systems with a concentration on Security and Information Assurance. I've already finished my prerequisites (2 waived due to prior knowledge, 1 due to lack of availability before Fall 15) and I'll be done with my concentration this semester (taking all 3 required classes concurrently, it’s tough). I've already exceeded my limit for courses in other fields, I'm taking one each from Public Administration, Business Management, and Computer Science. I used some obscure excuse, but in the end it won't benefit me other than getting me my degree sooner. It would be different if I was getting a Master's in Business, but it's too late to switch now. The only classes that could fill the gap are either Public Administration or Business Management courses, a total of 7 options that could be used as a filler. These are even less relevant than the ones I've already chosen to take.   
.     
Let me recount my waivers so far for a degree that requires 10 courses: 2 waivers for prior knowledge, 1 due to lack of availability, 2 waivers to allow me to take 2 classes concurrently with their prerequisite, 1 waiver for the Public Administration class, 1 waiver for the business management class, and 1 waiver for the Computer Science course because I won’t even be taking the prerequisite. Total 8 waivers so far, is it reasonable to ask for more? Especially since if I take a fall semester I’ll be taking relevant courses and be able to reduce my total waivers down to 4.

Just a little bit of information about me, I'm a grade 12 student from Ontario and have applied to a few other computer science and software engineering programs across Canada. I was wondering whether any alumni or current students could comment on their experiences and give some insight into what they think of these programs at McGill. I'd love to know what people thought of the structure of these programs, the professors, internships and research opportunities, how well the programs prepared you for life after McGill and finally whether you were happy with your choice of studying at McGill. Thanks in advance for any information about these programs, I really appreciate all the help I can get, because currently I am truly lost."

And if so, what helped you get through it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2xa4un/i_am_mike_ziemer_founder_of_south_by_so_what/coyacke?context=5)|Absolutely. I have done festivals that have bombed hard. We were doing this festival called Unsilent Night at Fair Park in Dallas and at first the city of Dallas seemed really helpful and down to help us out, but over time the expenses became overwhelming and we had to cancel artists that increased security budgets 4-5x what we originally planned for, so that was a huge loss and a big learning experience. It was really hard not to just throw in the towel but more than failure, the thought of going back to a different type of job after doing this for 11 years is motivation enough to keep going.

 |Orlando Hunter Nikki Dan Interns &amp; Volunteers (4-5) Stage Managers (3) Productions manager  Venue crew (2-3) Sound Company (not sure how many) Security (not sure how many)
 |I would say there's probably about 75 - 100 people responsible (day of show) for the event running smooth.
 |Year round? There's like 4 of us and we lose our minds because there's only 4 of us. Ask Hunter how overwhelmed he gets haha.
[ time I've ever heard of the festival, but I'm not American. Any relation to South By Southwest? Either way, do you plan on paying your performers? It's my understanding that they don't. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2xa4un/i_am_mike_ziemer_founder_of_south_by_so_what/coy9y55?context=5)|We are in no way related to SXSW in Austin. We have been going for 8 years and always pay our artists. For a lot of up and coming bands that want to perform at SXSW in Austin we are their means to do so. If you are not getting paid to perform down there but are getting paid in Dallas, you are able to afford the trip. Our event is also 10,000 cap per day so it's not something you have to worry about struggling to get into either as some showcases in Austin can be very limited.

With branding and marketing... just make sure that you are covering all bases. Social, website, flyers, street team, every possible way to let people know about shows. Also, attend a lot of shows, build your personal brand, be a good person, talk to people and get them to know who you are. Sometimes people will go to shows just because of the vibe you have even if they don't like the bands.

Prime example of this is Crown The Empire. They started out on our festivals Monster Mosh and Unsilent Night selling hundreds of tickets to get paid and play main stage, and now they are one of our main acts. So proud of those dudes.
[Why do you post so much about your social life on FB/IG N Twitter. Do you really think people care about your ex ? And personal problems. I think you're the only guy that acts like a woman on social accounts. Don't you ever keep things private? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2xa4un/i_am_mike_ziemer_founder_of_south_by_so_what/coybxzk?context=5)|It's called social media for a reason my friend. Sorry I went through a break up and posted about it for a while, but it's been a long time since I've done so I guess you've been bottling that up. Also, the fact that you say ""acts like a woman"" shows you're not someone I would want to associate with anyway. There's sensitive dudes out there and there's girls that aren't emotional or sensitive at all. Who cares, don't follow me. It's SOCIAL for a reason.
[What artist is the easiest to work with?  On the contrary, what artist is the most difficult to work with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2xa4un/i_am_mike_ziemer_founder_of_south_by_so_what/coy9xex?context=5)|Most artists are pretty easy to work with. Some of my favorites are my friends in Set It Off, Palisades, Crown The Empire, and Fit For A King. Basically any bands we've been working with for a long time are super easy to work with. I haven't really had any artists that were super hard to work with, but I have had some tour managers / managers that were extremely difficult.
[How did you get started?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2xa4un/i_am_mike_ziemer_founder_of_south_by_so_what/coy9vk1?context=5)|I was in high school and all of my friends were in bands so I would help them out and promote their shows. From doing that I started doing street team work and interviewing bands and eventually bands starting asking me to manage them because I knew a lot of people. From there it all kind of spiraled into doing shows and festivals very quickly!
[What is your favorite thing about South by So What?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2xa4un/i_am_mike_ziemer_founder_of_south_by_so_what/coyblyf?context=5)|The fact that it's more of a destination EVENT and ""party"" rather than just a concert. It's a place where people from all over the country / world come to hangout for the weekend, meet up with friends, make new friends, listen to bands they love, etc. The fact that I get to be a part of it is awesome!
[Will there be a return of the South By So What?! Fall Version? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2xa4un/i_am_mike_ziemer_founder_of_south_by_so_what/coyaf1y?context=5)|We are tossing around the idea of it. Starting after this year's festival we are renaming the event So What?! Music Festival and taking it to new markets. We are also bringing back Unsilent Night to Dallas in December at The Bomb Factory so a lot more is coming and I'm very stoked!
[Why Grand Prairie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2xa4un/i_am_mike_ziemer_founder_of_south_by_so_what/coy9xkd?context=5)|We started the festival in Plano at The Plano Centre, it outgrew the venue and we were looking at different venues. Arenas don't work because people don't want assigned seating, traditional venues are too small, so we met with a baseball stadium and it worked out!
[That's awesome! And I love the tongue-in-cheek reference to that other festival. How do you choose the bands?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2xa4un/i_am_mike_ziemer_founder_of_south_by_so_what/coya8c8?context=5)|Thanks, a friend of mine thought up the name and we went with it! We generally get bands submitted to us by agents and managers and pick and choose the ones that fit best. For years now we have been pretty Warped Tour type all ages genres but we are trying to expand from that like our friends at Riot Fest and Fun Fun Fun Fest and mix in new bands. We have some really cool bands on day one (March 20th) that don't fit the typical mold.
[Do you still manage any bands?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2xa4un/i_am_mike_ziemer_founder_of_south_by_so_what/coya1b5?context=5)|Yeah!
 |I manage Bryce Gilbertson (Solo Artist), Dear You (Pop Punk Band), The Alchemy Index (Post-Hardcore / Rock band), and Unity (heavy band that is one of the best live sets you'll see). All of them are playing the festival.
[FAVORITE Nirvana song!? :O (lol if you can pick 1\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2xa4un/i_am_mike_ziemer_founder_of_south_by_so_what/coyaxot?context=5)|DAMMIT! This is way too hard of a question, but to be cliche, I would have to answer ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" because if it wasn't for hearing it on the radio and buying their tape (yes I am old), I would have never gotten into them.
[Remember Utterpunk?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2xa4un/i_am_mike_ziemer_founder_of_south_by_so_what/coya1p0?context=5)|YES! Haha Utterpunk is actually how I got my start. I got to interview Senses Fail, Fall Out Boy, Brand New, Lost Prophets, and so many more. That website helped me survive the stress and boredom of high school haha.
[A somewhat real question just because I want to open the floodgates: What is the most ridiculous Orlando story you have had since this festival began?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2xa4un/i_am_mike_ziemer_founder_of_south_by_so_what/coybfja?context=5)|I was yelling at the bartender at our after party because he was too drunk to function and his friend tried to fight me, he took a swing, I ducked and hit him, and then Orlando comes running up like a super hero and saves the day. Dude went from Clark Kent to Superman real quick.
[I wish i stayed to see this, should I bring him a cape this year and not let him chug whiskey?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2xa4un/i_am_mike_ziemer_founder_of_south_by_so_what/coybny6?context=5)|YES!!!
[Favorite live set you've booked?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2xa4un/i_am_mike_ziemer_founder_of_south_by_so_what/coyasd6?context=5)|Taking Back Sunday. That was a dream come true. Taking Back Sunday and The Used were one of my first concerts ever, actually my first club show, so having them both on last year was unreal to me.
[At what point did you decide, ""hey, I think this is something I want to do for the rest of my life?"" And why? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2xa4un/i_am_mike_ziemer_founder_of_south_by_so_what/coyc22g?context=5)|When I was on the cover of Business Week in December 2005 I decided to quit college and go full speed ahead and never look back. The world was taking me seriously so I needed to take myself seriously.
[What is the name of the biggest band you've had at South By So What?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2xa4un/i_am_mike_ziemer_founder_of_south_by_so_what/coyc729?context=5)|Hard to say... we had G Eazy and RiFF RAFF before they broke, I think the biggest band we've ever booked based on their popularity when we booked them was A Day to Remember.
[Where was that? Because not only did i monitor the facebook page, I messaged it as well and was told I was shit out of luck.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2xa4un/i_am_mike_ziemer_founder_of_south_by_so_what/coybm6n?context=5)|I mean to add to that, we are all huge music fans and wouldn't want anyone to have a shitty experience. It's not like anything we did was intentional. We tried to combat it the best we could.
[What's your dream lineup for a one day festival?

[This is going to be my first concert, and I just want to say thank for having an AMAZING line up and for being close enough for me to actually go to all 3 days. I've been wondering, how do you decide what bands to have perform and how do you get them to agree?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2xa4un/i_am_mike_ziemer_founder_of_south_by_so_what/coybksi?context=5)|Glad you can make it out! Basically we send an email out to all agents, managers, and labels and let them know our dates. We target certain headliners but mostly kind of puzzle it together with bands that are submitted. It's a process for sure.
[Thanks for replying! Also, are you guys locally based? Like, the DFW area?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2xa4un/i_am_mike_ziemer_founder_of_south_by_so_what/coybzz1?context=5)|Currently yes we are, I am moving to Los Angeles in April.

2xam27,1,2015-02-26,"I think I'm good at operations, organization, management, but maybe it's something else?",[deleted],findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/2xam27/i_think_im_good_at_operations_organization/,"Instead of posing a series of questions, I guess I'm just going to write what I've been thinking recently (oof this turned out long) : 

I'm classically trained as a journalist. I liked writing in school and politics. I majored in strategic communications (PR and advertising) at a prominent journalism school in the US. Now I'm an opposition researcher, digging up dirt on politicians, and taking interests of investigative reporting and political leaning together. It also requires a lot of writing, reading and general quiet time. Very few meetings, which isn't too bad either. And you can do it from almost anywhere. 

On the side I've always done tech support and helped people find solutions to their computer problems, whether that's through app recommendations, or through actual problems with Outlook, Chrome, Firefox, Mac, PC, blah blah blah. You name it, I've done it. I enjoy this 1. I like solving peoples problems 2. it's easy money on the side - 100% in my pocket. 3. I don't market myself, its through word of mouth, mostly family and friends.

I'm now 25, roughly 3 years out of college. I've done work in social media consulting for nonprofits (which I found interesting but I felt pretty useless and silly) and now opposition research, as mentioned. Before that I was a communications intern, amateur journalist, etc. 

Recently I've realized I might be really passionate about operations.. or something along those lines. At my old job in social media, it was a woefully disorganized company, and many of my fondest memories were just making things work better. From the organization of our documents and log ins for various accounts, to timelines, to to do lists, collaboration across virtual employees, etc. In the end I stopped working there for multiple reasons, but one reason was the company was just so disorganized it was hurting itself, and no one actually wanted to follow any processes to make things better. 

I often found myself wanting to help with the operations style jobs, whether it was managing our publishing schedules for various clients, timelines for website rebuilds, figuring out what the best time keeping app/site was (we billed hourly), etc. 

I also enjoyed things like event planning for clients - but only from the side of making sure everything was clicking on all cylinders - AKA we need 200 posters with X printed on them, 25 tshirts, 200 chairs, this many brochures, in this color, etc. What's the cheapest place we can get them, who can do it for us, do we have sound and recording, what will it cost, how many hours, when does it need to be sent to the printer, and when can we pick it up. Then who is getting the materials to the actual conference, is it cheapest to mail via X, etc? So I guess the organizational part of event planning, and not so much the ""what are we actually doing at the event"" planning. 

I think a lot of this sounds boring to other people. It worries me that I'm set to be a bank teller or something basic like that. But I'm not that into routine tasks that are the same thing over and over. Even at my current job, reading 500 articles a day gets ""routine"" even though the subject matter is different and summarizing what those articles mean and how they make a particular candidate look good or bad requires enough analytical thinking... enough of it will make you bored. Very bored. But I do like the ""routine"" of organizing things, I guess. 

I remember one elementary school year at a new school I had taken all the standardized tests at my old school, so I was basically sent off to the library to do library tasks while everyone else took tests. These mostly included checking in books, putting them in their correct spots in the dewey decimal system, etc. The process of taking the recently disorganized and making it organized excited me. I also remember as a kid being grounded and not allowed to watch tv or play video games. What I did instead was figure out how to get all my model cars parked in an efficient way on my dresser that 1. would allow for the most number of cars to fit and 2. make it easiest for cars to get out. Again, sounds like the most boring thing ever, but I enjoyed it.

Looking back on my high school years, where my entire life was the high school newspaper, I now thing of one specific entity where I clearly thought I was good at operations/organization and problem solving. I created a system for our 5 step editing process (where any one article had to be edited by 5 different people). Before we had done it on paper with a pretty printed out checkbox. When I came in, I realized we needed an electronic version because 1. efficiency 2. we had 3 journalism classes at different times and different days and simply could not coordinate this without it all being one class or doing it after school, or... digitally. 3. we could now actually check when people submitted their drafts, versus what happened before: lying. 4. all articles would be on one dedicated site and organized for our teacher and all the editors to see, instead of locked in some person's random gmail inbox or USB drive. That was a major time killer overtime. 

This editing system was done through a classic online forum that was private and heavily controlled (only editors could create threads for the story ideas), and we had sub forums for each section of the paper. Each thread was a different article, and in the thread there would be about 10 posts, since we had the writer and the editor basically going through 5 versions of the article and re-posting their articles afterwards. Now sure, in a place where people had responsibilities, all this control wouldn't be needed (people would just do their job or be fired). But in a high school elective class where only 30% of the people really actually cared about the class, this was necessary. 

It was a great system and lasted for years after I left the school. 17 year old me was excited by this. 

The only other example I can think of that might fit into this, but may have been a better example of me just being frustrated with the news and realizing the power of the web was the Virginia Tech shootings. On the day of the event the media was incredibly bad at actually telling people what they wanted to know: where is my friend/brother/sister/son/daughter? This isn't as much of a problem anymore, but back then, we were all slightly less connected than we are now.

Anyways, I set up a wordpress blog and then pushed it out to all the communities in Virginia Tech (sports forums, etc.). That week on wordpress it was the most popular blog in the country (which I didn't know about until wordpress sent me their weekly update of the ""hottest blogs."") People were able to actually find out where their friends were if they had trouble getting in contact with them. In the end it seemed like a very crude version of some of the things Red Cross, etc. has set up in disaster zones for finding people now.  

As the actual event unfolded, I basically had a list of people that folks were looking for, and peopled commented on the posts for people that were found and or not found yet. We basically were crowdsourcing information in one dedicated place. In hindsight, internet commenters can't be trusted, and it's why I shut the website down after I saw the ""hottest blog"" email. 1. it had served its purpose 2. internet commenters were getting nasty 3. it's weird to have such a sad subject as a ""hot blog.""  

Does anyone have any thoughts on what kind of things I may actually want to do as a career (what a silly question)? Or even directions I should look into? 

I should say that I am an INTJ personality. Taken the MAPP test and have some results of that as well... but not sure what I can post from that succinctly that would help! 

I've gotten ""air traffic controller"" as a proposed job in middle school... and now again on a MAPP test (as one of my top 20 careers. ). I don't put too much into these career suggestions, but this one was interesting. Talk about competitive and high stress! Also, I believe the math involved would probably make my head hurt. 

The rest from the MAPP career suggestions were basically very basic jobs like bank teller, etc. A lot of routine, recording, inventory, organization jobs. "
2xaq09,1,2015-02-26,Low Computer Literacy and Fixed Mindset,MilgramHarlow,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/2xaq09/low_computer_literacy_and_fixed_mindset/,"I completed my Bachelor of Education degree in a great program that included two pre-internships, one in the city and one in a small town. My internship was in a private academic focused city school with a great school community and lots of extracurricular offerings; it was an amazing experience that I miss a lot. After finishing my degree, I began teaching ax a substitute in the same city.

Last summer, I moved to a rural community to accept a full time teaching position. I'm teaching computer classes and I've noticed a large gap in technology literacies compared to students I taught in an urban community. Most students see no value and have little interest in learning to use computers.

For example, I have students learning the basics of Adobe Photoshop. I think it's a huge asset that the division I teach for has liacense a for the whole Adobe Creative Cloud for every computer. Most students do not see learning Photoshop as a privilege, they see it as a burden and say things like ""I don't see why we have to use this, it's dumb"" after only a few minutes of work time. I've been reading about the value of a Growth Mindset over a Fixed Mindset but I'm not sure what small steps I might try to encourage my students to life from their current Fixed Mindset to a Growth Mindset.

I think back to my own high school life ten years ago, I don't think I could have succeeded without a computer and Internet at home. I would do online research for essays, and use Microsoft Word to type all my assignments. The media class I took included Photoshop, we were basically on our own to learn it and I loved the challenge it provided. 

In my internship and substitute teaching experience in a city, I didn't have any students without Internet access at home but there were resources like public libraries open after 6pm, and school libraries open at lunch and after school. 

The community where I teach now doesn't have many resources for students to access computers outside of school hours if they don't have home access, and I've found a surprising number of students do not even have a computer at home. Many students also don't see value in using technology. I didn't expect there would be a gap in technology literacy or the belief that computers aren't important.

As a result of limited home access to the Internet or even a computer, I'm unable to assign any homework and as a result some students finish early then become disengaged out of boredom while others choose not to even try to start work because they do not see my class as necessary for their future. I'd appreciate thoughts  from other teachers about how to get students engaged when they don't think your class is important. Thanks.


TL;DR
Moved from a city to teach in a town. I teach computer classes to middle years; students act like my class and technology aren't important for their future. Most students have a low technology literacy/skills compared to students I taught in the city, and students here give up without really trying. Many students have no internet access at home, some don't even have a computer. Please share any advice on helping students move from a Fixed Mindset to a Growth Mindset."

2xb35d,9,2015-02-26,New Grad Software Engineer with Self-Suspected Brain Damage Seeking Advice (26 M),throwaway1534327,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2xb35d/new_grad_software_engineer_with_selfsuspected/,"Two and a half years ago, I began experiencing auditory hallucinations. It started off with me eavesdropping on the conversations of everyone around me. For some reason I interpreted their speech as all being about me. I have been incredibly anti-social for most of my adult life due to social anxiety, and I believe this was an attempt to try and communicate.

I continued with this thought pattern for 2 years. I no longer had to pay attention to it, I was constantly hearing seemingly everyone around me talking about me. It took a dark turn and everyone started insulting me and calling me names. It reached its peak during my 4th year international software engineering internship, which was located in a large city. 

I went to a therapist to explain the situation to her. I was desperately trying to get her to tell me that it was all self imagined, but her style of therapy was to listen and recommend CBT without telling you you're right or wrong. This served to make me believe even more that my situation was real. I explained in incredible detail how everyone is calling me names. I had 3 months of therapy with her. The only time she ever said anything about the validity of my claims was  ""People do talk a lot about other people"" - it served as positive affirmation for me that my claims were all real.

Once my internship was finished and I moved back home to my mom's (where I had been staying during University), I was set to complete my final - 5th year. Thankfully the hallucinations started to calm down. I didn't dare tell anyone in my family - I didn't want anyone to think I was crazy. 

Unfortunately it was at this point where my life took a complete U-turn. My mom kicked me out of the house to make space for a Christian woman from her church who was having issues in school. I had never spoke badly of my mother's religion and even attended church on some of the main events (Christmas, etc). She had always put church members above her own family, and I was kind of used to this. But after 25 years, it was the first time that it felt like I had no place to go.

It just so happened that as this was happening, my brother just broke up with his girlfriend, and had space in his apartment for me. He invited me to live with him. I felt like I didn't have any other choice. He had previously served in the army and had some noticeable PTSD. This breakup seemed to put him in a horrible depressed state. 

The entire 2 floor apartment was an absolute disaster. The worst living conditions I have ever seen. Every surface in the kitchen was occupied, the floor was dirty. Every room was an absolute mess. I decided to go on the second floor, away from all the mess. Although his ""room"" was next to mine up there, which was so full of trash it was barricaded and you couldn't enter it. He didn't even sleep in the room - opting to sleep on the couch for the entire year that I lived there. Whenever I would say even a word about the mess he would flip out and scream at me. On more than one occasion I cleaned the entire apartment to the best of my ability, only to have him turn it into an absolute mess in the course of a week. I was really trying my best.

A month after my move in with my brother, my father, who suffers bipolar disorder and delusions, which I'm sure I inherited - for the first time in his life pretty much disowned me. He was in full blown mania and his wife was emailing me for help (they live in a different country). I sent her as many details about his illness as I could. I now realize that this wasn't the best way to go about it, but I was not in my right mind as well. She ended up showing him the emails and he sent me an email telling me to never ever contact him again.

It turns out that this drastic life change made the hallucinations get worse. I really felt a strong psychosis. Even away from people. It's hard to describe the mental state I was in. At the recommendation of my previous therapist, who I was no longer seeing since I was out of the country, I decided to start taking benzodiazepines for the crippling anxiety. I truly believed the entire world hated me.

I dropped all my classes since the anxiety was too much and postponed them all to the second term. I began abusing the benzodiazepines - taking more than was prescribed on the bottle at one time. My brother was also a heavy drinker so I picked up that habit as well. I was mixing high doses of benzodiazepines and alcohol to try and treat my anxiety. There was also some sick satisfaction I was getting out of being self destructive. This period of my life lasted for about 6 months. I was in complete seclusion and isolation. I left the house only at 2-3 AM to get food from the corner store. I spent another 8 months after that just on the benzodiazepines as well as other anti anxiety medication. I never told my psychiatrist about the problems at home. I only told her about the anxiety, and not about the hallucinations that I had told my previous therapist. I didn't feel like they were hallucinations, I truly believed that the general public looked at me in a very negative light.

Since I did very well at my previous internship I was already given a full time offer upon school completion.

I somehow managed to scrape by completing my degree. In one class I piggybacked on my old classmates work, since it was entirely project oriented, and the other 2 I dropped and completed as online courses - taking a total of 12 months to complete them.

I started to ween off the benzodiazepines until my first week of work, where I realized I can't function on them. I stopped taking them entirely. At this point in time, with this new worry on my mind, I have completely realized that my previous worldview was actually completely hallucinatory. It has now been a month and a half at work. I am just supposed to be finishing the ramp up phase and beginning to start programming. 

My productivity is about 10-20% of what it used to be. I have an incredibly difficult time remembering what I'm working on, various commands, and the ability to learn things is vastly reduced. To give you an idea of the state of my memory now, it took me 2 weeks to remember the street I worked on. I kept confusing it with that of another street with a similar name. I have extreme difficulty remembering what day of the week it is. I thought it was Tuesday yesterday until about 11:00 AM. I read entire documents only to forget them moments later. My executive functioning is highly diminished. I can't remember simple things that I've been working on. I spend days trying to figure things out but getting no work actually done. On some days I'm able to piece together some simple scripts, in all over my last 6 weeks I've written about 10 lines of code. I know that I am capable of much more since I have done 4 software engineering internships. I still have that feeling in my gut where I want to be productive, but it's simply not possible. It's very disheartening.

I really am at a loss for what to do. I'm going to try and stick it out and try my best, but I honestly believe I won't make it very far before it becomes obvious that I'm unable to work at this level. What kind of career should I be looking at? I've thought about phone tech support or some kind of helpdesk job. I really don't have time to be depressed right now. I can't afford it."
2xb3ns,2,2015-02-26,20/F Not sure what I should be doing with my life,bean1322,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/2xb3ns/20f_not_sure_what_i_should_be_doing_with_my_life/,"I am currently in my junior year pursuing a BS in computer science. My entire college experience has been me trying to find a career path. This is my third major. I started as a freshman in engineering. I wasn’t really liking what I was doing and I decided I wanted to do something with medicine, so at the end of the year I changed my major to biology. I spent at year in biology and after a year struggling through intro biology, and organic chemistry, I decided maybe I wasn’t cut out for the subject. I still liked the it, but the comparison and pressure from my peers, pushed me away. However, during that year in biology, I started to gain interest in psychology, especially personality tests (I am a Myers-Briggs ISTP) and I started working on a minor, that I will finish this semester. I spent the year thinking I would major in psych, but couldn’t decide on a career within the field that interested me, nor was I prepared for the amount of graduate school. I ultimately chose to change to computer science based on my interest in using computers, the little bit of coding I had already learned, and the high job prospects.

During the summer I took the first computer science class,  it went well and I was excited, but the past semester I started to think I made the wrong choice. The stuff wasn’t clicking, and still isn’t. My grades aren’t bad, but I don’t feel like I am understanding the material, and my programming skills are not good at all. I toyed around once again with changing my major to psychology, and even saw a career counselor about it. I took a career test and my number one match was Health Information Specialist, followed by multiple computer professions, and a few medical professions such as radiologic tech, pharmacist, and medical technologist. From the results, he also seemed to be lobbying for accountant or the military. I thought about enlisting for about a week, but decided that might be a little brash. After some thought, and knowing this was try number three, I decided to stay in CS.

A few days ago, I went to the career fair to try to find an internship to gain some experience this summer. After talking to multiple companies, with questions like ""what are some of your personal projects?”, and “why did you choose this major?”, I realized I had no personal projects, and no interest in pursing them, and I didn’t know why I was in the major anymore. I never had a deep passion for the subject, and now it’s starting to show. With computer science I am staying an extra semester past my intended graduation time, and with psychology I will graduate on time, but the jobs aren’t as plentiful. I have looked at statistics because through all the major changes I have had to take multiple stats courses and I like them, and economics because its a mix of the social sciences and math. I even thought about nursing school, but that would be a big switch. I really like psych, but sometimes I wonder if it’s because it is so easy compared to the science and math that I take along side it. I’ve always been torn between picking a career because it’s something I love, or picking it because it is practical and will put food on the table. I’ve never really had a passion, so I thought I would go with the latter, but I am not sure I made the right choice. However, with 3 years into school, I’m wondering if I should stick it out with CS, because after 3 tries not finding what I love, maybe I’m not going to find it in college.

Tldr: 3 majors in 3 years, want to change again due to lack of passion, but I'm not sure if I'll ever find it.

Can anyone offer me guidance?",cold_soba,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2xbbxz/graduated_with_a_bs_in_a_biological_science_but_i/,"Hello everyone! Some background information: I graduated from a UC last year with a B.S. in Neurobiology, Physiology, and Behavior and a 2.89 GPA. When I started college, I wanted a career in the medical field. However, I gradually lost interest in it.

During my last years in college, I became curious about coding. I completed the JavaScript lesson on Codecademy and had a great time doing it. After graduating, I enrolled in a nearby community college to take online classes. Last semester, I took an introductory class to object-oriented programming (taught with Java) and a very basic class on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am currently taking classes on C++, databases, and Android programming. 

I also live in South San Francisco and am working full time at an insurance company, if any of that matters.


The reading I've done online seems to suggest that due to its demand, front-end development may be a good goal for someone looking to enter the field of computer science. So, here are the questions I have so far:

1. Will an associate's degree with a certificate of specialization in internet programming get me anywhere? Or should I aim for something more difficult and challenging like a master's program?

2. I am aware that experience is more important than degree programs. However, I have no idea where to start. What is the bare minimum I need to learn to get started on a significant project? What are some examples of beginner projects I can take on to get my feet wet? 

3. When do I know that I'm ready to apply to an internship or my first job?

4. I created an account on Stack Exchange. What are some other useful resources for learning and staying current during my spare time?

Thanks in advance for any responses!"

I'm a second year Software Engineering student at one of the top Universities in Canada, and I'm looking for an internship this summer! 

I'm a dual US/Canadian citizen, so Visa sponsorship etc. is not an issue. I'm hoping to relocate to the US for the summer, as I do quite miss it and would like a change of pace in an exciting environment. I have a lot of experience with Robotics, some mobile development (developing games using libGDX) and of course typical college Comp Sci. courses. I'd prefer to not post my resume directly in this post, but any PM's with relevant positions would be awesome.

2xch8f,5,2015-02-27,Need some advice on my situation. Basic gist is: Either quit my job to get an internship in the industry or keep my job (in completely different industry) and find projects/side work to gain experience in a field I want to join. Please help,Turin_Giants,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/2xch8f/need_some_advice_on_my_situation_basic_gist_is/,"**TL;DR: Work for county Gov in greater DC area with decent pay. Want to get into IT industry but don't know when/how. Should I quit current, full-time job and look for internship or keep current job and work on side projects/certs?**

So I am going to try and give you my best representation of my situation I am in right now so please bear with me. Ok, so I graduated college back in the spring of 2013 with a bachelors in Psychology. Long story short, I really wanted to be a psychologist and help people with their problems, but eventually learned that they don't make much money and the job market is really barren when it comes to finding jobs but I was too far deep into my degree to get up and start anew without costing myself more money. As I graduated I was lucky enough to get a job under my local county government working in the transportation planning division making approx. 47k a year. Not bad with no experience imo plus the benefits of working with the government. 

That being said, I want to get out and do something I enjoy for the rest of my life, aka computers. My goal is cyber security but I know one cannot simply shoot for the moon and expect to get there in one go. I know my path to that point will be full of twists and turns and a couple leaps of faith thrown in there. But one cannot get a job without experience even if they have the paper background to back them up. Admittedly, I am working on getting some ""paper"" creditability in certifications just to get through HR possibly and show that I know that I am somewhat able to work with what they give me since I don't have a degree in IT. 

Another factor that comes up with the decision in my title is basically my life and sanity. I currently live with my Dad at the age of 24, which I don't mind. I am paying rent ($700 a month)to help out my dad who is newly divorced but that's about it as much as spending goes really. So far I have been able to save up around 15k since paying off my 14k student loans, which again, I don't think is too shabby. My goal right now is to move out of my house and into a house I own and eventually start a new family. I know I could rent and such, but I see that as a waste of money to be honest. 

So I guess that gets me to my question for you all. What would you do in my situation? I don't have an IT background (degree) but I am currently getting certifications to boost that (currently have A+, working on Net+, aiming to get Sec+ then other security certs, eventually ending with the CISSP). I have a decent paying job in the greater Washington DC area (NOVA) and I have around 15k saved up right now. I want to get into the Industry really badly but I am nto sure how I should jump ship just yet. Should I quit my job and start applying to internships where I will get the experience that is desired nowadays eventually leading up to a full time job (hopefully) or should I continue on with my job at the gov and just work on side projects/certs for the time being? 

Thanks everyone!"
2xcn5p,4,2015-02-27,Personal Projects vs Algorithms and Career,cs_career_throwaay,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2xcn5p/personal_projects_vs_algorithms_and_career/,"I am second year student at famous Europe university in CS program. This is my second attempt at some profession, first was medicine that I abandoned it due to being a mess and not sure of this career path. I did not want to spend 6 years and then decide not to do that. I have several friends who bailed out after 6 years into biotech, psychology etc.

Currently, I study full-time and work around 15 hours a week as QA engineer where I push buttons and automate things using Python/Selenium. Recently, the idea was to apply for software engineer internships but I have two issues with that, one is personal and another of focus. 

Starting with focus one, small companies rejected me because I do not know their technology stack like Rails or Django. Did not even give me an interview. Bigger companies emphasized typical technical interview skills but due to competition I would not be selected, you need projects for that. I do not have much time left for projects after demanding uni work and part-time work(do it because need to eat and pay rent). Currently, I read Cormen and have a whiteboard in my room trying to amend my algorithms skills but have almost no time for personal projects. What should I focus on?

Second issue is ... lack of passion. And progress. I work hard and do not slack off since I played musical instrument and won several competitions internationally. In that case, hard work payed off and I could see results while programming, not so much. I also was telling myself how one needs to complete a project or two and improve technical skills but as I read on some career advice post, if you want to do something but it is not done and is not being done then you do not REALLY want it. That is what makes me scared. I do not feel passionate about programming and by god Cormen book is hard. I am very slow problem solver and effort expended on it seems to not make me much better. I guess tiredness from work and school adds up as well.

Hence my issue: I was not sure of medicine, now I am no sure of programming. I do not hate programming, it is actually interesting but I feel inadequate. I learned a lot over last semester, also explored many topics from Android to Web dev but did not find something that sticks.

I have interest in health and medicine, biology as well as programming and had thoughts of maybe combining them all together somehow. Overall, I try to improve but I also experience resistance towards programming and deem it as a bad sign.

I have no debt, no obligations and currently 22 years old. A lot of people at CS program are struggling and that is normal, but a lot of them enjoy the struggle. Programming makes me tired but I am very happy when I create something as well. I am more tired than productive however.

If I had to declare my preferences, then biology and health topics are more interesting to me than programming. Once again, I do not hate solving problems, it is just lack of passion for it and rejections from several companies that drag me down. I believe that depression affects me and went to the doctors office(I have really bad sleep for months) and feel like lack of progress in ability as problem solver makes me anxious.

Next year is going to be exponentially harder than second year. The conclusion is that I am confused and find programming hard. And improving takes a lot of energy with not much results.

I saw a post of some other student who titled it as it is too hard how you manage to make it. I am not afraid of challenges but I am unsure about my career path AGAIN and cannot seem to grow up and find something I enjoy.

I am interested in what you think of my experiences and any advice you have.

2xdar6,0,2015-02-27,IT major in a CS job?,Intern11,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2xdar6/it_major_in_a_cs_job/,"I graduated school in December as a IT Major. While I was in school our IT department went through a major restructuring and went from  focusing on networking to ""BIG DATA"". Since me and my class mates were caught in between this we ended up taking a confusing jumble of classes. I came out the other side with a little bit of networking and analytic experience but not enough to get a job in either. 

During school I got this internship where I have been working for the past 7 months. Here I am employed as a programmer... I was given some entry level Java and HTML5 projects which I was able to complete by busting my butt off on stack overflow. Because of this they have offered me a programming position at 50k a year salary.

However I am not a programmer and since my salary is not hourly anymore I feel like I would be spending 60+ hours a week getting these jobs done. At the same time I am also working on 2 startups on the side and I feel like if I take this job I wont have time for those. I will also be learning a language that is not widely used(webfocus) so I don't know it that is a plus or a loss.

I wanted to know what you guys think? Is webfocus used in your industry? Is it worth almost abandoning my startups? Do salaried programmers work long hours or can they leave after 5?  How hard is it to learn multiple unrelated languages?

2xdf8i,2,2015-02-27,Just need some advice,starcailer,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2xdf8i/just_need_some_advice/,"This might get a bit long, but it sort of has to be so that I can half vent my frustrations and maybe get some unbiased thoughts on...everything. So, here we go~

I graduated with a Fine Arts major, emphasis on photography, psychology minor in December of 2012. While in school, 2 of those years, I held a Marketing Assistant Internship, as well as worked retail/customer service part time, and did some photography side projects - Commercial and volunteer, all on my resume. 

While looking for a FT job out of school, I continued to work PT for the marketing firm where I was interning (it was a paid internship deal), and in June of 2013 I got a job as a graphic designer at a small ready to eat entree company.  I am still with this company but looking to move on for reasons I will get to in a bit. 

I am grateful to this company because they gave me my first FT job and experience. At first, on my contract it says I will make a $32,000 salary + $100/wk bonus for medical (since I am below 26, I am on my parents plan still, my salary is more like $40,000 because of this.) My contract also states my my job title ""graphic designer"" and outlines my responsibilities, which is label creation, marketing support, website, social media etc. I brought to the table the ability to provide them with HQ photos of their products so they have had no need to hire outside photographers. 

At first it was great, but then I started getting more responsibilities handed to me, which I did not mind, I was just happy to have a job! I now control label inventory, am in charge of ordering the labels for production and for 6 months was working as their receptionist. I enjoy adding these skills to my skillset, however I was not compensated for them. Over all though, that was okay; because a lot of times I got to leave at 3:30 or 4 instead of 5, as my boss is usually out of here come 3:30/4 himself. It was a huge benefit.

Let me preface this next part with: It has been nearly two years, and there has been no talk of a raise, ever.  I am their longest staying graphic designer. Our outside contacts love me, especially our print vendor who always reminds me of how much of a good job Im doing.

3 weeks ago, the owner came to me and said he was moving me from salary to hourly. Handed me a punch time card and showed me where to clock in/out at.  I was miffed, because now I would have to work longer to make the same amount of money, when one of the benefits was leaving with my boss! Even so, I took it in stride, figured out a good way to setup my hours so I could leave at 2 on Fridays like I had before. I took my questions to HR and thought everything was clear (about OT and etc).  

First week I worked 41 hours because I got given a project at 2, stayed till 3 to do it. Oh well, happens and hey, extra money! When I turned in my time card the next week nothing was said. Get my paycheck, and no OT? Hm that was odd, inquire to HR...

HR become angry! Says I never did OT before, I was trying to take advantage of the system, but added 1.25 hours of OT to my next paycheck. I tried to explain, I wasnt trying to take advantage of anything, I just happened to get a time sensitive project when I was planning on leaving...HR Then informed me of the new rules: I was not allowed to be here when my manager was not, and if I was I had to get permission from him. Okay...

So I talk to my manager about this, and he says it was a choice made above his pay grade, and there was nothing he could do. That said, he is out the door at 3/3:30 and I am panicking because that only gives me 7/7.5 hours for the day. 

Paychecks are starting to look like 36/37 hours instead of 40. My 'hourly' wage is $18.15 and my weekly pay went from $560 consistently to more like $520. That said, I am so frustrated and genuinely feel like I am being shafted even though I have been here doing great work for near 2 years! Can they do this? Even though I still have the first contract which we both signed that has my salary on it? 

I am looking elsewhere for work which brings me into my other sort of non related part:

Went on an interview for a job I really, really want. I had submitted a resume 9 months ago and they said the spot was filled, but really liked my resume; it did not work out with those people and I got contacted to see if I was still interested. I went on an in person interview 2 days after they contacted me - got asked a bunch of behavioral questions, but not any about my skillset. Odd but whatever. I thought I did great! The owner was going out of town for a week and had one other person to interview when he came back, as she was unable to make the time to get there (Mind you this job would require me to relocate and is 1.5hrs from where I am now, I still worked my normal job the day of the interview). Sent follow up email, heard nothing back, figured that was typical. This week's weather has been horrible with the snow, so I doubt anyone could get there unless they already lived in that area, but I still havent heard anything good or bad and now Im feeling a bit uneasy. 

So everyone, if you read all of this -- what do you think? Resume, cover letter, CV, portfolio are all updated and I have been applying to other places, but not really getting anywhere. All around, I am just starting to slide into a pretty crappy feeling altogether. What do?"

It loved it's job too, or at least as close as a robot could get to love, but it knew it was nearly obsolete. The mods of the forum HFYbot uploaded it's lists to were surely going to replace him soon, but HFYbot wasn't intending to go quietly.

One day the mods assembled outside the 'botbox', as they called HFYbot's office. HFYbot stepped outside and found himself surrounded by the mods including his creator, KaiserMagnus. HFYbot knew exactly why they were here, they wanted to get rid of him so his replacement could take over. Well he wasn't going to let them get away with it and he started frantically mashing the panic button he had built which would initiate his emergency plan.

KaiserMagnus stepped forward and said.

""HFYbot, you wouldn't mind following me out to the dark alley behind the office would you?""

HFYbot said nothing and continued to mash the panic button, why hadn't he made it activate quicker?

After a brief pause the head mod, Hex_Arcanus, said. 

""Enough. HFYbotReborn, get rid of the old storytoaster.""

The mods parted down the middle revealing a taller, more detailed and shinier version of HFYbot. This new bot had a more skeletal appearance and a pair of red glowing eyes set deep into it's sockets. HFYbot would've been terrified...if he felt fear that is. He had given up on the panic button and instead focused on the bot before him.

The new bot stepped forward and raised it's metal hands to a fighting stance which HFYbot matched. The pair stared each other down for a couple of seconds before dashing forward and striking in an explosion of sparks. They struck and parried and danced around each other like the legendary kung-fu masters in the stories posted to the forum. but despite  their similarities, HFYbotReborn was simply faster, stronger and tougher than his predecessor. Soon enough HFYbot was outpaced by the new bot and, through the blur of metal fists and sparks, ended up flat on his back. He stared up into the glowing red eyes of his nemesis who raised his fist for a killing blow and then paused.

After several seconds of confusion the new bot said.

""Please wait...""

The mods stood with their mouths agape until Hex screamed.

""KAISEEEEEEER!""

'The mechanic' hopped forward to see what was wrong with their new bot while the old bot sat dazed in confusion. Hex then said.

""Dammit Kaiser, why does this always happen with your bots?""

For which he received a wrench between the eyes. 

As the mod recovered, HFYbot's emergency plan finally activated and the back wall of the office slid away to reveal row upon row of HFYbots built from spare parts and scrap that HFYbot had managed to scrounge together.

""About time.""

At the same instant, hundreds of pairs of robotic eyes lit and faced forward. At once the horde of robots marched forward towards the mods. Hex, still holding his nose, said uncertainly.

""Uhhh Kaiser...how long for HFYbotReborn  to be operational?""

""A couple of minutes yet.""

""I don't think we *have* a couple of minutes.""

""Then I guess it's time to do things the old fashioned way.""

As he said it, Kaiser swung around flourishing his trusty battlewrench. The rest of the mods prepared for the upcoming fight and Hex said.

""I was kinda hoping you'd say that. You have no idea how long I've waited to 'fix' that damn bot.""

The mods rushed forward into the solid mass of robots and began tearing them apart or smashing them into pieces. All the mods were doing fantastically well with their chiselled physiques and black-belt level knowledge of various martial arts. But KaiserMagnus stood out head and shoulders above the rest, swinging his heavy battlewrench (which he had affectionately named 'Sasha'.) Into his opponents weak points with ease. His intrinsic knowledge of the bot and it's weaknesses soon causing him to stand atop a small mound of maimed androids and metal limbs, roaring his battlecry.

And soon enough the endless flow of robots slowed to a trickle and then eventually stopped, leaving the exhausted mods standing in the middle of their ruined office surrounded by the broken (more than normal) bodies of their foes. 
Finally HFYbotReborn punched the air where HFYbot's head *used* to be and looked around in confusion before asking.

""Did I win?""

-----------------

In the aftermath, the mods were busy cleaning up after their epic battle when Hex approached KaiserMagnus and said.

""We just found the body of the intern, kinetic...something, or at least bits of him. So, I meant to ask,  what effect exactly will this battle have had on the sub?""

""Well the forum is probably going to explode with hundreds of copies of HFYbot posts...what should we say about that by the way?""

2xdlaz,1,2015-02-27,[Internship] 4 video conferences in a row after 2 interviews and a coding challenge. What to expect?,Filoleg94,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2xdlaz/internship_4_video_conferences_in_a_row_after_2/,"I applied to a bunch of internships, but there is one that I am most interested in from a very well-known tech company, and they are the ones I got the furthest with so far.

Just a bit of pre-story. It started with a coding challenge, I did not think I did so hot, but I got a technical phone screen with an engineer scheduled a week later. The interview (#1), did not go as well as I wanted it to go, so I expected to not hear back from them, but a week later they told me they wanted to move forward and schedule another phone screen with another engineer (#2). It happened earlier this week, and it was ways and ways easier than #1, so I did pretty well.

A few hours ago I got an email saying that they enjoyed talking with me, so they want to schedule the last set of interviews as the final step, this time it will be a set of 4 video conferences. 3 of them will be with potential teams that I pick, and the last one will be with the team manager. All in all, it should take 3 hours. They also asked me to let them know in the reply to the email about some other things such as preferred location and other pending offers. 

This is what I am worried about: I have no idea what to expect. Am I going to be drilled for coding problems for 3 hours? Is it more of a cultural match kind of interviews? Does it mean that I am pretty close to an offer? How do I not screw this up? I am not extremely worried about tech/coding questions, but I am worried about anything else, e.g., in the email they said that I will have a chance to ask higher level questions from team manager, what should I even talk about?"

2xdlvz,1,2015-02-27,TIFU: Internship at a local retailer,PM_ME_YOUR_CARKEYS,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2xdlvz/tifu_internship_at_a_local_retailer/,"So, I'm doing an internship since the start of this week at a popular-ish retailer in my town or (judging by the size of the town) the ""village"".

Everyone and their mother knows that internships are difficult at the start because you have to both: Get used to the place and get used to the new people...
You also work full workhours in internships rather than part-time when you're just temporarily employed.

Up to wednesday I became accustomed with the environment and the people around me.

Most of my worktime is spent either organizing wares or putting new wares in the right place, just typical retail stuff minus the whole ""cashiering"" thing, which is not allowed in internships in Germany.

I also got some friendly ""Want-to-be"" apprentices, and we are helping eachother at work or just work together in general.

So today was pretty normal, got my first early shift going at 7 am in the morning, organized and put the frozen goodies in the freezer...

Then do the toilet papers, baby products and all that jazz.

Canned products as well as soft drinks and wine...

When both ""Want-to-be"" apprentices were called to go to the bosses office!

But, since I couldn't care less what they were talking about at that point, I just continued getting the current container done.

When my workbuddy returned he was all happy like...

""Hey, I just became an apprentice here!""

Of course that's living the dream, not needing to write any applications and just ""living"" day by day.

""- And workbuddine?""

""Oh, she too became an apprentice, one of us is probably going to be employed in the ""neighbour town"", though!""

A few hours passed, the clock read half before 1, and we were all having a break, even my boss in the bosses office next to us.

At that point I remembered that I needed to get him to sign my internship confirmation letter, so I went to the bosses office and handed him over the icl...

(because I could've done who knows what in the time where I was actually working... apparently...)

And then he spit it out...

""I just want you to know, that *you* are the reason we won't accept any interns anymore.""

That hurt a lot, but it didn't make me sad or anything, I was in shock...

Later on, working on another container, telling workbuddy about ""the talk"" I had, I was really wondering if I was honestly this worthless...

His opinion to this was pretty clear.

""You know what... I have seen you work, you're not awful.""

I know this comes off as cheesy, but it made me cry a little bit.

I do my best and work my ass off for my boss and get banned as a thank you...

Of course I still have to get through the next two weeks and survive the rambling of the fatass that is my boss...

I feel like I didn't fuck up about how I worked...

But I fucked up when choosing where to apply for an internship.

I'll be banned from that specific retailer in that town after the internship, but I don't feel like I'd ever go back there again anyway...

Fuck you, boss."
2xdwy3,1,2015-02-27,My career feels like it's going nowhere....,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2xdwy3/my_career_feels_like_its_going_nowhere/,"Right now I am a month away from hitting 28 years old. My career is nowhere near where I was hoping it would be when I graduated high school nearly a decade ago....

I orginally wasn't sure what I wanted to do (although I knew it was something in media). Well after finishing some school (messed up a private course that cost me 14 grand at age 22) and accumulating a large amount of school debt (approximately $23,000 right now) I finished with a degree in Radio Broadcasting. Through school I got a internship at one of the biggest sports radio stations in the country. I was ecstatic and eventually after about 18 months of interning, I turned it into a job.

Unfortunately that job (at the time) paid a total of $11/hour which is nowhere near a livable wage in this area of the country. I've been at that position for over 2 years now and have been bumped up to a hefty $12/hour (that $1 was my raise last year, I was informed a few weeks ago I will not be getting a raise this year). When I started the job I was working nothing but overnights but after about 15 months I was moved up to evenings/weekends (6pm -1am) with filling in on the day shift when it came to holidays/Christmas break.

My issue is that now as I hit my 3 year in this position I feel like I've barely gotten anywhere. I feel like I've achieved next to nothing in life and I make so little money that I can't even begin to pay off my student loans. On top of all of this I suffer from depression that takes away a lot of motivation in my life to get out and do anything. A lot of the time I just want to sleep all fucking day and it bothers me, but I don't care enough to do anything about it (also a big problem). 

I feel like I'm in this massive rut. I'm constantly looking for work elsewhere but in my field there is very little I am qualified for at this time. The few interviews I've had I clearly haven't gotten even though I felt like I knocked them out of the park. I don't have ""years of experience"", the job I was hired for is a very niche position and doesn't really allow me to pursue a wide variety of positions in my field, so I feel almost pigeon-holed. I feel like I've been going through life over the like 4-5 years wondering if I will ever be happy again, and that kills me. I make what essentially equates to minimum wage at a career that REQUIRES some sort of education related to the field.

I don't know what to do right now. My biggest fear in life is that I end up working a career that I cannot stand for the rest of my life (much like my father before me). I'm not all about the money, but I just want a liveable wake. Last year I made just over $17,000, about $5,000 BELOW the poverty line for where I live. The hours I work make it tough to get a second job (I did double up at a local retailer for about 6 months but it proved to be too difficult to maintain with the hours. 

I need advice. I need to know what I should do, or if anyone out there can recommend something, ANYTHING for me. I'm miserable. I wake up every day just fucking dredding doing anything. I just want to be happy, or fuck it, at least CONTENT with my life. It's to the point where I will take that. My career feels like it is going nowehere, therefore I am going nowhere. I can't afford to move out, I can't pay my debt, nothing. I would be making more money at a fucking McDonald's right now then I would at my current work place. I just don't want to give up on my dream just yet. As I said before, my biggest fear is working a job I hate for the rest of my life, but the irony of it is that I seem to be doing that already. 

TL;DR - My career feels like it is going nowhere and I don't know what the hell to do."
2xdzcf,10,2015-02-27,Bring me back from '95,_COWBOY_DAN,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2xdzcf/bring_me_back_from_95/,"**The overview:** I'm hitting my 2 year mark at my first ""big boy"" job.  I just received my first promotion.  I received team employee of the quarter and another similar award during my time at this company.  The pay is good (especially with my latest promotion raise) and I enjoy my job.  

Sounds good, right? 

**The catch:** I'm an **Ada 95** programmer.  

Don't get me wrong.  Ada has been good to me.  I've enjoyed it.  I've taken over the responsibilities of a Software Engineer IV and I work directly with the customer along with working requirements, design, testing, code, and maintenance.  Ada makes coding and life easy.  A little too easy...

**The situation:**  My wife will be going back to school in another state (Tennessee) approximately 10 months from now.  This means that I will be going back on the job hunt. 

**The problem:** When I opened up my copy of ""Cracking the Coding Interview"" for the first time, I realized Ada had betrayed me.  I've spent the last two years gathering relevant information to a specific defense industry which has turned out to be irrelevant to the rest of the world.  All of the cool things that I know now can't be utilized (or even talked about) except at a very vague level for future interviews.  I feel that I have gathered many valuable skills at my first job (not counting the Java internship before this), but I'm not sure how far they will take me.

**The question:** How do I bring myself back to this decade?  I will be hitting that sweet 3 year mark where I should be able to grab a job with relative ease.  If I were to go on an interview right now, it would be a completely embarrassing situation.  I have 10 months to get with the current times, and I have my eye on an Android job and a couple Java jobs.  What do I do?

Let me know if you need more details.  I'll answer what I can, but I obviously can't get into specifics."
2xe0hy,1,2015-02-27,Another request for graduating job hunting and interview information: employers and professionals.,Chamber12,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2xe0hy/another_request_for_graduating_job_hunting_and/,"Hello!  
First and foremost, thank you for taking the time to read this. I am aware that there are a good many posts out there about job hunting and interview information, but as the field changes over time and my experience differs from many people’s, I'm taking the time to request some more personalized information.  I apologize for the length. If a person is willing to take their time educating me on these topics, rather than write a reply, I would very much appreciate a PM exchange.  
Background:    
I'm finishing an Electrical Engineering Technology (specializations in energy generation and microprocessor systems) program this spring and I'm a bit behind on my preparedness. I've worked during my entire college experience, mostly food jobs unfortunately, and usually with heavy workloads because of my sense of leadership and drive (currently, I'm the unofficial night lead at a deli for a main grocery store in the Northwest, averaging 35 hours a week on top of classes [currently negotiating a new schedule to focus on classwork more]; I turned down a management role because I don't have the time and my eventual graduation).  This has resulted in a great reputation and relatively few loans, but my GPA is only slightly above my program's requirement. I have stayed active in my out of class education, and (when I take the time to compile my photos and notes) will have a fairly decent portfolio of projects, ranging from power amplifiers, embedded data loggers for my college and other student’s projects, BLDC controller design, PCB C.A.D. design and etching, engineering clubs, ICE engine maintenance, brewing,  various chemistry and other ""mad scientist"" projects (if you’re familiar with the Harry Potter franchise, I very actively pursue a “Ravenclaw” lifestyle).  I have even performed the magnetic implant experiment, and am hoping to expand it to a biofeedback system using various pulses and an array to provide data input in my forearm). I am considered one of the most knowledgeable, experienced, and caffeinated students in my program. I did not intern during my time in college, I satisfied the requirement with a senior project on said BLDC control and etching/programming the system from the ground up.   

Employers:    
Being straightforward, I’m naturally a little introverted, though friendly, and can be a bit quiet and lose focus on the topic at hand during important discussions, which I’m working on. That aside, I do not like to lie or exaggerate who I am, or what I know.  In regards to this, I’m hoping for advice on a wide variety of subjects to review (or learn), as I would rather have a correct answer for questions rather than “I do not know.” In a formal question form, if you were to interview me for a position at your company after seeing my theoretical portfolio, what questions would you have for me and what would you want to see or not see?  Is an online portfolio considered professional, or should I plan on bringing in a full or compacted form in print? If you are a hiring manager for an engineering company, do you want to hear about my non-engineering projects, and hobbies (wine making/brewing, aquaponics, biofeedback experiments)?  
Added:  
I'm also curious as to what a person's appearance says to you. I don't have any visible tattoos, for sake of finding a job after college, but how is your part of the engineering field viewing the subject? When someone goes to an interview, I assume the norm is a full suit, tie, but what does it say when a graduate walks in without a suit jacket, or what other various advice do you have on this?  And before I finish what is hopefully my final edited afterthought, how does your company organize interviews? I've heard of walk ins, half a dozen interviews before getting a final word (or even being told the person did not have the right prerequisites  after months rather than up front), and various other methods.  Also, are you typically willing to accept a well done portfolio of during-college activities and unrelated work recommendations for actual work experience? Again, I apologize for the length of this post. There is another question every time I think through the process.    
Professionals and recent graduates:  
Can you please give me advice on job hunting, what kinds of things caught you off guard or mistakes you made?  
  
Thank you, everyone, for your time."

I recently scored an internship interview at a hedgefund. The problem is that i am an engineering major (mechanical) with an interest in finance, but no official training.


If I get the job I would be doing some sort of financial modeling in excel, the problem is I have very basic skills in excel since my schoolwork mostly uses other resources (such as matlab).


The interview is in 2 weeks, any one have any resources that would give sufficient knowledge in excel to not look like an idiot at the interview? Been checking out some books like excel data analysis for dummies by Stephen Nelson, heard its good but not sure if It's the way to go.


Ideally I would have wanted to learn this before even getting an interview, but the interview came very sudden out of the blue so I haven't had much time to prepare.

Other than that any other recommendations? Been reading up on derivatives in the meanwhile.

I'm thankful for any help!"

I am working part time at an office that doesn't seem like it will lead to anything. I asked my supervisor for more hours which she denied months ago. I started looking for a new job and didn't see myself working at this place for too long but I just looked at the calendar and realized how much time has passed since that moment. 

I'm not sure how to approach the job search anymore. I was searching for jobs related to my major/degree in college but I had so little response that I am considering jobs outside my field. I'm not particularly picky about what industry or field I want work in but don't have any idea what I want to do. I have had many considered everything from entering graduate school, applying to internships, staffing agencies, or learning to programming and web development hoping it leads to something. 

At this point I feel like it's ridiculous to get to my age and still have so little idea about what direction I should go. Does anyone else have any experience with this? 

I keep hearing from friends and family that no one knows what they want to do but at least they had full time jobs or were in school while they were trying to figure it out. Even if my boss offered more hours I don't want to work more hours doing basic work and getting complacent. I'm worried about continuing at my job and realizing in a year that have not done anything to advance my life."

Just got an offer in SF that is a great base salary, 120k.

I didn't think the interview went well, so I was surprised when I got the call. Is the offer a reflection of my mediocrity as a candidate, or are they just looking for cheap meat? The recruiter made the offer and left on vacation, so now I'm supposed to talk to head of HR about any concerns.

Given my relative untested quality, should I attempt to negotiate, and if so, how? Should I just take the 1 year of experience and consider it a loss leader to put something tangible on my resume? Should I keep hunting for something better?

Also, they want me to work a week from Monday, but they didn't specify a deadline for accepting the offer. How should I ask them for time and how should I contact the recruiter at the other company (which I'd prefer) to ask their stage"

-Former overly ambitious high school student, self-motivated, detail oriented, excellent note-taker, intricate, creative.

-in the top 10-15% in my high school, graduated with highest honors (4.0 GPA and above), took several AP classes, SAT scores were average

-Love constant learning, change in tasks, intellectually stimulating work, doing something different

-Got into college unsure of what I truly wanted to do. Was interested in doing something multi-disciplinary (science + a journalism, anthro, international relations type minor) Considered med school but got into another professional healthcare program straight out of high school that I was very unsure of, but felt like a safe decision

-Maintained 4.0 GPA in first year, gradual grade decline spring semester 2nd year/first year of professional school (ended up graduating with a not very competitive 3.3 GPA)

-Unsure what goal I was working for, wasn't too interested in major, started to get distracted/lose focus easily, peers did not share my professional ideals nor passion, considered dropping my program few times

-Stayed in major. Attempted to get internship (critical for experience in my major that almost every student does while in school). Did everything I could &amp; no internship opps available. Learned my field was starting to get saturated (more graduates than jobs), internship sites claimed they reached ""maximum capacity"" for my class.

-Started to enjoy subject matter slightly more second year but felt very behind students who had internships. Did not have practical knowledge of what job I wanted to do post-graduation

-Still had trouble securing internship but was very active on campus: part of two organizations &amp; leadership in both, work on campus,  campus emergency personel, service volunteer, etc. more so than other students who stuck to strictly organizations related to major or no involvement at all

-My last year: had 1 year of practical experience-worked in hospitals, college campus &amp; few other places. Realized hospital or campus was an ideal environment for my interests

-Attempted to secure a post-graduate opportunity or hospital job

-Worked with professor on a project and assisted him in creating classroom material-he gave positive feedback throughout but noticed change in behavior at end-refused to write letter of rec (critical in securing post grad-opp, next to intern experience which I wasn't able to obtain)

-Applied to 10 programs, heard from one, they told me I've done ""more activities &amp; involvement that they've ever done in their entire lives but concerned about my lack of internship experience""

-Started to feel that field was not for me-everybody has same knowledge, education &amp; skills, hard to separate yourself from peers, only thing employers took seriously was internship experience I did not have. I enjoy clinical work which is difficult to get in my field now with saturation. applied to 60-70 non-clinical hospital jobs, one interview never heard back (resume has been edited/reviewed)

-Been told this is result of terrible saturation-way more students graduating than jobs than ever, have been told only way it will work is if I relocate to a rural area (can relocate, but can't go in a rural area too far away from family for medical reasons) OR try to apply harder in a non-hospital setting where I had experience for 1-2 months in my last and was very overwhelmed with anxiety-have heard high turnover rate is common due to people quitting for mental exhaustion

-Realized I still love healthcare &amp; enjoyed some things in my field but am willing to expand my options &amp; try to combine my degree with another skillset/field

-Spending my post-grad life applying away, confused, depressed, anxious, unsure of my goals, serious lack of motivation &amp; enjoyment in life from somebody who was once a good student, still yearns to be intellectually stimulated &amp; learning something new &amp; interested everyday

I'm not too worried about my salary and of course 2 dollars isn't a huge difference, as this is just an internship and is supposed to be a learning experience.

What certifications would be most efficient for getting a job. I'm not apposed to programming but I don't think I can finish a degree in CS.

I always liked engineering and science as a whole, so I decided to major in one of the ""widest"" specialization. 

During my internship, I did a lot of programming (C++, C#) which I learned in my first year in two different courses (procedural programming and object oriented programming). I have now come to the conclusion that this is what I would like to do for at least the next 5-10 years. I want to program, but I have a feeling that most students with Computer science and Computer/Software engineering are miles ahead of me in that field.

My program does not offer any software oriented specialization, so I chose Telecommunications. Is there anything I can do to ""get up to speed"" on what the average computer engineer undergrad knows in terms of programming ?

If I had to list my programming related skills, I would list the following :
- Object oriented programming
- C++ / C#
- Relational databases (basic knowledge)
- .NET Framework
- TCP/IP protocol and socket programming
- Winforms / WPF
- Data structures (lists, maps, hash sets etc.)

What other useful notions should I focus on in the short term ? I graduate in 9 months and I hope that would be enough.

Edit : Thanks for the great advice everyone. I will take every advice and ""just code"". I will learn algorithms as suggested and maybe set up a public GitHub for my side projects :)"

2xi7dv,1,2015-02-28,Negotiate Salary at Bay Area Tech Firm,DeeBirdLaw,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2xi7dv/negotiate_salary_at_bay_area_tech_firm/,"I got an offer from a Bay Area tech company for an internship. It's not Big 4 but they're not a startup; they are definitely making money. Anyway, they're offering $28/h and a small stipend to relocate, but the Bay Area rent is scaring the shit out of me. I also have another internship offer from a Fortune 500 company that's closer to where I live on the East Coast. They're paying me $24/h, no stipend, but it's super close to my house, so I don't have to pay rent. The Bay Area rent is basically a third of my paycheck after factoring in the stipend, and naturally, I'm a little wary of accepting this offer. 

How much wiggle room do I have to negotiate a higher salary? Should I bite the bullet and just accept what they're offering?"
2xi7i8,2,2015-02-28,Just submitted my app...,murcanno,OSUOnlineCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSUOnlineCS/comments/2xi7i8/just_submitted_my_app/,"After a few months of hand-wringing I decided today to finally submit my application to the program. I guess I just wanted to say ""hello!"" and see if anyone could shed some insight on what to expect next. 

Other than submitting my transcripts and writing the short statement of purpose, is there anything else I need to really worry about? Will anyone ask me about my interest in CS or programming at any point, or is the expectation that if you have a degree already and are crazy enough to spend $28k on another one, you're in? The only issue I can see is that I didn't take any math courses in college, but that's because I completed Calculus in HS and tested out of my math req at Cal (where I ended up getting an English degree).

I have seen this asked elsewhere in the forums, but for existing students: have you been able to find internships? I'd like to eventually stop working full-time and seek some work in the industry and so I'm quite curious. I'm more interested in web dev, so I think with a few more months of working on my side-projects I would be at least somewhat employable anyway... or at least, I hope.

Anyway, I'm excited about the prospect of all this. I expect the program to be challenging in a lot of ways, but it seems for the most part that people find value in it. And most of the program graduates I've Google stalked seem to have jobs &lt;1 year after graduating, so I take that as a reasonably good sign. I'm definitely not making a huge mistake, right guys? Right??!!?!"
