My school is a vocational school that offers different academies for different fields and, you guessed it, I'm in the IT academy. They allow students to work towards getting industry certifications and at the moment I have all of my MOS, 3 MTAs (Windows OS fundamentals, Network fundamentals, and Security fundamentals), A+, and am testing for Sec+ next week and Net+ as soon as we have vouchers for it. I've got an internship at an IT company at the moment but not too fond of it for a few reasons I don't want to get into. 

 What I'm wondering is what is my best bet if I'm looking to specialize in cyber security or something similar? Like, should I look into going to college for something or just keep getting certs and getting experience in the job I have now. Just need a little bit of guidance. Thanks for any help! :D

Recently, I've been real fucking nervous about my future and what I plan it out to be. I'm currently doing a year internship at a large food manufacturing facility and once I come back I have a few semesters left of mechanical engineering depending on how quickly I want to leave then I'm off to the races to the ""real world"".

I recently saw the thread of ""
[What city do you intend to live in upon graduating](https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/54urto/what_city_do_you_intend_to_live_in_upon_graduating/)"" on this sub and it hit me harder than I should have. I've been on internship for 5 months now. I had some great expectations coming into this place (pretty big company) and it was related to what I thought I had wanted to do for a career. 

But now, I'm a bit too self-aware of the workplace and there's three types of people I see. I see the people that work and probably 50% of the people are only here because every time they realize they hate their jobs they look at the shit eating grin of their child's photo on their desk, sigh, and get back to work. Another 40 % actually enjoy the challenge but work 10-12 hours a day to meet the ridiculous demands of production and clients, and consequently, are stressed all the time. The last 10% are shift workers who work carefree but don't get paid very much and have no chance of forward progress in the company.

In the spectrum, I fall around the first and second type of people.

Maybe that information wasn't that important. But maybe that'll give you some background on the college life angst that I'm feeling recently. 

Ideally in the future I *want* to be:  

* Making a comfortable salary to be able to support family and not worry about making ends meet (6 figure too much to ask?)
* Living in one of the three major Canadian city (1. Vancouver 2. Toronto 3. Montreal)
* Be happy with my life
* Find passion in what I do
* Be able to lead a work life balance.

Is it even possible to do all five? I thought with this internship I'd be golden to continue on with my career development as a manufacturing kind of girl... but now seeing the reality of what working is, I wish I invented snapchat and sold out so I could just be smoking weed and drinking my days away with my (non-existent) boyfriend on the west coast.

No clue where this post is headed, I'm a little défoncéd and I just wanted to vent. I understand I still have a long ways to go before I have to decide but not having my destiny in my hands is concerning.

Cheers,

I have read this thread a few times and it seems to be very helpful... time to ask for some personal advice.

I'm currently negotiating my startup offer letter and it's looking less than favorable (I think...).  I came into the company 8 months ago as the Lead Front-end engineer and designer of the company.  To put this into context, the startup had virtually no front-end presence and their brand (especially in terms of design) was not good.  I worked for 8 months and almost 5 of those months were without pay (due to a verbal agreement between myself and the CEO).  I am currently a senior in college and have taken a huge risk working for this company... (foregoing other offers and opportunities etc.).  

I would like to start off with this: the work is amazing, the cofounders are great, and I truly believe in the product.

However, with that being said, they are offering me 1% in equity and telling me that this is ""really good"" (salary is currently not being discussed, but will be discussed shortly).  Quite honestly, I'm still in school and am currently an ""intern"" for the company and I have no fricken idea what I deserve––I've simply never done this before and I just want to get what I ""deserve"".  The company is about 1 month away from closing a deal for close to 2M in funding.

Please help :( here is a clearer picture of my predicament:


**Accomplishments:**

• I have singlehandedly built the brand of the company, including but not limited to logos, aesthetic, look-and-feel, and design.

• Restructuring the entire front-end architecture, front-end development practices, and front-end technologies.  

• Building the entire front-end framework in which all of our customer facing products are built.

• Restructuring the entire company development workflow and communication pipeline (i.e. Slack, Trello, Git).

• Contributing to business conversations regarding all product-related matters such as product creation, development, and innovation (effectively a large part of what a Chief Product Officer would do, from my understanding).

• Completely redesigning and restructuring the company's pitch deck which greatly moved forward conversations with VCs and investments which could prospectively total over 1 million dollars.

• Managing three interns over the summer; educating them on the front-end framework (essentially the role of a manager).

• Going above and beyond with most tasks that are asked of me.


**Accumulated risks:**

• Foregoing other work-related opportunities (of which included salaries and equity) in order to continue to dedicate my time to the company.

• Worked (and currently working) for the company during my final semesters in college in order to help the company succeed, which affected my studies.

• Working through extremely late nights to finish products for launch, finish the pitch deck for four critical pitches, fix errors, and design interfaces (although I understand this was my own decision, this risk should still be considered in the evaluation of the final offer letter).

• Working with a clear head and good faith in light of the fact that the company owed me $20,000 in payroll.

• Working as an intern while happily shouldering the responsibilities of a full-time employee with no concrete benefits set in place (most namely equity).

Any ASAP insight would be greatly appreciated because I am in the midst of the negotiating this offer.  Please and thank you people of r/startup &lt;3

EDIT: Some people have mentioned that my risk on this situation is low, but I would like to argue otherwise.  Currently this company is pre-client, pre-revenue, and pre-funding (although we are going through rounds as of last week, many people have told me that you simply are not funded until you are funded.).  This is my first true job out of college and there are many opportunities out there Computer Science grads.  Some of my friends have gotten offers at $110K and 100K signing bonuses with 100K stock options vested over 2 years.  I have worked at big companies (like Amazon) and I have worked at other startups, so my experience aligns with those types of offers.  So considering that I will be signing with this company and putting a lot of time into it, I want the reward to at least accurately balance the risk."

i'm a cs student and i'm currently doing an internship where we use Java EE / JSF to build enterprise business applications. I've also had my hands on ASP.NET/MVC Razor and i'm comfortable with Javascript/jQuery. Now i don't have that much spare time but i almost always have an idea for a small web-application.

I'm a fan of java and its mentallity, planning and building stuff consistent/well structured. But i thought stuff would be easier with jsf than it actually is. It takes too long for me personally until i see some results, and the results usually look pretty boring if you don't use primefaces etc.

I'm going to implement a RESTful-Service (with JavaEE) and maybe take a look at one of the many frontend-frameworks. 
When setting up a RESTful-Service with JavaEE and implementing the frontend with oop javascript i think i may be doing stuff twice (impl. classes etc. in Java AND Javascript). So i've stumbled across GWT, Vaadin but i wonder if they are still in use and if this ""compile java to javascript""-idea actually is reliable and also performant. 

Would be nice to hear some opinions on all of this.

I switched into the major at the end of my sophomore year from being in a totally different field. My university's # of pre-requisite courses required for CS were not abundant so I was able to finish within two years. Honestly, I have a dilemma where I feel like I have no knowledge even with the degree. I regret the fact that I didn't stay an extra year for additional guidance and learning.

All the pre-req courses felt rushed and I was learning 3-4 languages without being confident in one language first. No internship experience because I was taking classes over the previous summers. No database knowledge and I simply suck at programming. After taking the courses, my memory did not seem to retain the majority of the information. 

Right now, I am delaying my job-search process to play catch up on learning a lot of CS concepts and data structures. I attended a few hackathons. I have been practicing questions on HackerRank and LeetCode. I also try to complete really simple coding projects for practice other than university assignments. 

I cannot explain things for the life of it so I am extremely nervous for technical interviews. My limited knowledge and limited people skills don't help either. I am an introverted female with not a lot of friends in the field. 

I am hoping to find an entry-level job in the field. Knowing the fact that I don't have any internship experience, would this be a good idea? Will I be able to start interviewing within a month at this rate of coding everyday and practicing questions? How can I be a confident coder and explainer? Any suggestions can help me tremendously.

I routinely print out lists of companies in major cities and go one by one through each of the sites trying to find openings that may not be posted on the major job listing sites.

All help would be greatly appreciated.  I am willing to start tomorrow and I am looking for a salary that is average for the entry level based on my research.  I am so ready to start my career.  Thank You."

It is a pretty decent offer at a ""technology consulting"" firm and I would be very happy to work for the company and the location.  I would still be developing software, but I'm nervous about losing the ""software engineer"" title that looks so nice as opposed to ""technology consultant"".

Anyways, I have pushed that offer back as far as it will go and it will expire in 2 weeks.  I'm currently in the process of scheduling interviews with two other companies for a ""software engineering"" position, but they will most likely not even be close to offer time before my current offer has expired.

Is it poor etiquette to explain the situation, and ask salary/benefit questions before an in person interview???  This way, if the SDE position benefits are much better I will feel comfortable going out on a limb and risking turning down an already extended offer.  BUT if it is very similar, I will know and be able to save their time and mine by just accepting my offer that I have."

Applied to 50+ companies and got 0 interviews, most of the companies i applied to where from US, Canada, UK. I can't apply for a job in my country because the tech industry is pretty much dead, as in there are no jobs for CS here, and if there is one the salary would be that of a janitor's. However i haven't gotten any reply for any of the companies I've applied to, and i'm not even aiming for Big 4 or anything, just any paid internship will do. I know my resume is not that great, but I've seen people in the US with resumes far worse than mine get interviews, at least at small companies, so it must be because i'm a foreigner. I've already read CTCI, EPI and already mastered leetcode, hackerrank and similar sites, i believe i could do a pretty decent interview, but i still can't get a interview anywhere, no one would even give me a chance. 

Is my CS career over for being a foreigner? I really don't know what else to do.

Hey everyone. So I graduated about a year ago now (10 months ago to be exact) and I've worked an internship and am now in a contract position since the time of my graduation.

It took me about 3/4 months to find my first internship, mostly due to what I imagine had to do with my lack of experience and pretty rigid soft skills. I've come a long way this year in terms of soft skills but experience is still a question mark in my opinion. 

Where I am currently is not a bad place to be. I am with a very large healthcare management conglomerate in my city. It was pitched to me in my interview (and for a VERY significant piece of my decision to take it) that this was a contract to hire position - and not many people stay doing it long. They told me that they have not had a full team (for reasons other than employee dissatisfaction, it's often the team that other parts of the company scavenge their talent, from my understanding) in the two years that my boss had been there. 

All of it sounds great when I write it out, but that little part of me is still telling me, look dude, this is temporary. Go in and kill it every day and never slack but at the end of the day you're racing against the clock. As in there is a chance I'll have to conduct a job search within the next 90 days with two positions of less than a year on my resume. Surely that can't look good right? How common is this situation with new professionals like myself? Would really appreciate some feedback or tips on steps to take next.

I need some advise on which universities do I have a realistic chance of getting into.

* Major: math or computer science. (Undergrad: Computer Science + Applied Math + Physics 3 majors, + pure math minor)
* Great grades, a few academic-based scholarships
* GRE: haven't taken yet, expecting 170 on quant and ~155 on verbal
* GRE math subject test: haven't taken, not sure what would get. But I'm fairly confident, since I did well in all my undergrad courses.
* Research experience: participated in a part-time project with a prof. There were like 4 or 5 contributors, I was listed as the 3rd author. Paper accepted into good conference. I didn't get to go to the conference, the primary contributor went. Also I have a full-time research term coming next winter, but by then I would have already submitted my applications.
* Internships with big name tech companies. (This is probably more useful for applying to CS than math)
* Another internship in a government research facility, in a tangentially related field. However that research didn't lead to any publications.
* Letters: 1 from the prof I did part time research with, 2 from other profs who taught me courses (got perfect grade for both), potentially another one from internship manager, if it is useful.
* I'm Asian, I heard this make things harder.
* Undergrad is in a semi-well known university in Canada.

My absolute dream school is MIT, other ones that I really want to get into are Princeton, Caltech, Berkeley, UCLA. However I know these ones are really hard to get into. So in your opinion, what are some realistic choices for me?

55jy5s,1,2016-10-02,I messed up,willeehuhm,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/55jy5s/i_messed_up/,"Hello reddit, 

I want to start by saying that I came here because I don't feel like I can talk to my friends about my problem. I made a mistake - I cheated on my on/off again boyfriend currently we are not officially back together but we are exclusive to each other. We have been together for almost four years, known each other for five. We met through a fan website for a very famous musician, we talked for an entire year before I (unknowingly) went to college nearby where he lives. We decided to meet and I kid you not, and I know this sounds cheesy, but I instantly fell in love with him. I knew he was the one when I met him and we fell in love. We spent my entire freshman year dating (he is two years older than me and was also in school at a different school at the time). I noticed there wasn't a lot of progress in our dating life so I questioned him about at the end of the school year and he admitted that I loved him more than he loved me. That hurt and we separated and didn't talk for a while. Later in the summer he surprised me by visiting me in my hometown (a really big city hours away from where he lives) and instantly I felt the connection again. This time he seemed to be more invested and after a little bit of dating we made it official! I should note that my program requires me to do 3 internships and unfortunately I had to move further away from him during my first internship. It was hard, and I was dealing with depression from being so far away from everyone. I cried a lot but he always made me feel that everything would be okay and it was - he would come visit me every two weeks and we would both take turns going to visit each other. Somehow it worked out and after my internship I moved back to my college town to continue school at the end of the spring of my sophomore year (I don't have any breaks I've been in school every semester after my freshman year). Our relationship took a weird turn that summer because we were fighting a lot more and were unhappy. We decided to take an official break from our relationship so that he could focus on his senior year and so I could have some space to be happy. We haven't gotten back together since then and that was end the of summer 2015/beginning of fall. The Fall semester rolled by and we would still go on dates, be intimate, but we both messed around with different people and we both realized it wasn't for us and what was for us was each other. So we decided to become exclusive and work on our relationship. Spring 2016 and this summer were hard because we kept having serious fights - I was also having a lot of personal problems because I just recently came out to my family and they didn't take it well. After counseling, things got better and our communication improved immensely. However, we still had some problems and I was unhappy. 
A little about me: I'm Latino, I like consistency, I don't like much change, I'm kind of aggressive but very sensitive deep down inside. I have a hard time communicating my feelings or saying things in a polite manner sometime. I'm a hard worker, very organized and plan things way ahead of time. I love showing/receiving affection. I'm driven by my emotions and am a bit impulsive.

My partner: Is white, a lot of our disputes are a result of our differences in how we were raised and being culturally different. My family raised me with thick skin and he is a lot more outwardly sensitive, very good at communication, very logic-based mind. Sometimes lacks emotional sensitivity. He is very open minded and is all about people being whoever they want to be without judgement. He is very driven but is unorganized and has anxiety issues that requires medication. Would rather let me put two and two together when figuring out what is wrong as opposed to being direct with me. 

He is beautiful in all aspects. I, for a long time, had a hard time accepting that someone like him could be interested in me. I have self esteem issues. During college I got in really good shape and began getting attention from men especially when I came of age and started going out to bars. 

Sexually we are compatible as well but there could be improvements on both our halves. When I was feeling unhappy in our relationship, I noticed our sex life also was not great. So a lot of the time I would get curious about the men who would show me attention. But now that I decided to give it a shot, I instantly felt wrong and didn't like how it felt or what happened. I regret it whole-heartedly.

This weekend, I cheated even though we are not officially together - we are exclusive. I told him and he was upset, I'm still upset and I feel sad and hollow and lots of shame. I know what I did was wrong and I regret it. I need advice on how to approach the situation because he hasn't called it quits yet --  I don't even know if that's on his mind, he has not spoken to me since I told him. I have been working really hard to prove to him that I still love him and want to be with him. We've talked about our future together especially since I will be finishing college soon and will have to decide whether or not I want to return to the big city. 

Any advice would be helpful -- I keep beating myself up about because I know I was wrong."

So after hanging out in this sub for a while now, I don’t understand what we’re doing or why we’re trying so hard. I feel like we keep hurting ourselves and keep making things harder for ourselves.

I feel like we work harder in our field than anybody else in any other field to progress, move up, and even get a job. I acknowledge that I think the sub is a little biased in that I think most people that come here are the more competitive ones that are looking to get jobs with the big Silicon Valley (and Seattle) based companies or just trying to get ahead of the pack. But where else do you hear about people having to work on personal projects almost all the time, spend so much of their own time and money to learn and progress in their career, or people so willingly or having to work more than just a 40 hour work week? Do lawyers and doctors do anything like this? Do other STEM majors?

I also feel like we are making it harder on ourselves and everybody else now by being complacent to the demands of employers. There’s plenty of threads with people applying to dozens of jobs over the course of months or even over a year, yet they aren’t landing anything. Then, I see these threads where people are just jumping through some hoops for interviews. I remember one thread where people were saying that they are actually okay with doing a full day of dozens of interviews or working on multi-day projects just to get a chance at an interview or offer without getting compensated. I think the good news for now is that not all companies have such insane standards and interview processes. It always gets me when I interviewed with Google back in the day they asked about dynamic programming. I never had to use that at my job, and I don’t think Google’s newest employees are having to deal with dynamic programming. It’s just standards like these that I don’t get, yet so many people are willing to play along. It's learnable, but is it really necessary?

I think all of this is just creating bad precedences for our field. You give them an inch, and these employers will take a mile. Employers keep complaining about a need for STEM graduates to fill their jobs. They claim it’s because there aren’t enough people in the talent pool, but now I’m starting to think, in CS at least, it’s because they keep moving the goal posts and expect more out of every employee because they can. I mean look in this sub. You don’t have an internship under your belt by the time you graduate, and people are freaking out and in some cases are actually having a hard time getting employed. Based on that, sounds like lots of employers are getting choosy and only want new graduates that have experience.

Full disclosure: I’ve been working for about two years now at a small local tech company. No internships or other experience by the time I graduated. I didn’t have to jump through any crazy hoops to get my job. I met them at a job fair and got the job. It’s a pretty relaxed environment, and I just work my 8 hours a day. I like to think I’m a pretty average or even below average developer. The thought of what's out there and the requirements kind of scare me.

Now, this isn’t to say that if you’re trying to work at Google et al, that you shouldn’t. If that’s where your aspirations are, then more power to you. I just don’t think for a lot of places that the amount effort spent is proportional to the reward earned. Maybe we need a union or something…"

Another related question: When do most companies do hiring for their summer internships?

One thing I did notice was when I asked what most companies were looking for and the most common answer was someone who would work well with their current team. I'm getting the idea that most CS jobs are working in groups and collaborating on various projects."

I need to have a day off and blow off some steam.  I would do all my class and lab work on Friday and Saturday and go rock climbing on Sunday.  Friday night I did as much as I could, but on Saturday I woke up with the flu.  I still went to school to work on my classes, but I wasn't productive. It took me 2 hours to understand 3 Circuits problem and 3 more hours to almost finish a lab in another class.  By the end I could't speak or eat whole foods so I went home.  Before I could get into my car, my girlfriend call me and we ended up arguing about why I am never around.  I ended up breaking up with her before I got home.  I was wracked and didn't finish what I needed to do.  I knew that I would be to sick to go climbing tomorrow.  I went straight to the shower and curled up and cried for 40 minutes.  All the stress came to the surface.  I told myself I was to stupid for the EE program, that I wasn't spending enough time at my internship due to class overload, that I didn't finish all my school work, that I needed to find extra actives on my resume or I would get a good job,that I failed a test 2 weeks, about my now ex-girlfirend, and about that I wasn't able to go climbing.  Yes I cried about not climbing.  I had been planing this for 10 days to be my stress free day where I would finally have fun and here I was sick, on the floor of the shower crying while hot hit my head.  I feel better today but i am upset that this weekend was a total failure in every way.  Sorry for the long rate.  If you read this far then thank you"

Being that I'm an EE, most of the job search help/info I get is geared towards engineering/software jobs. However, I do have a really strong interest in finance, etc. and feel that I'm much more informed on the industry than most of my peers. I also know that hedge funds are becoming increasingly more quantitative, which is why I believe my engineering background/skillset is applicable to the industry.


I'm just not sure where to start, and what the typical approach is for finding a hedge fund internship (if they even exist). For example, I've spoken with recruiters from many IB and consulting firms, and even applied for positions with them. Hedge funds, however, seem to be more ""elusive"" (or I'm just not looking in the right places).


From what I've gathered, it seems that I'd need to find a specific hedge fund, and inquire directly on my own, cold-calling if you will.


FWIW, I have no preference on location, but I am from Northern NJ, so I'm aware of the fact that a lot of hedge funds are in NYC/tri-state area.


Anyways, I'm really just looking for someone to explain to me the process for actually finding a hedge fund internship.


Thanks!

To make a long story short: graduated from college in 2013 with a B.S. in psychology/ minor in philosophy. Halfway my junior year, I realized that I didn’t want to pursue psych in grad school, so I attempted to pivot by getting a marketing internship at my college. Upon graduating, I got a digital marketing position at a local tech startup. The pay was decent but the work environment was terrible. I won’t get into details, but suffice it to say that although the work itself was generally okay, I was very unhappy there.

After three years, I finally worked up the nerve to quit. I paid off my student and car loans. I had enough money saved up to last me for a while. I job hunted for months, but no jobs came. I realized that, although I had done much for my company (everything from sales operations to graphic design to video production), management generally had such a lack of direction that I left without knowing much more than when I had joined.

Now, I’m at a crossroads. I’m not that passionate about marketing/ sales. I would rather create something than sell it. I don’t feel like I’m living up to my potential. I’m currently trying to decide between two options, and it’s driving me crazy:

* **Option 1:** I double down on the marketing job hunt. Jobs around here seem to pay $35k salary. One of my best friends suggested that I look in Boston, which I have, but it’s extremely difficult to get callbacks when I live in NY and the pay doesn’t seem to be much higher (problematic when the cost of living is significantly higher there). You could say I feel ambivalent.

* **Option 2:** I go back to school for CS. I’ve read a lot of opinions on here suggesting that this would be a waste of money, and that if a person isn’t willing to teach themselves CS, they wouldn’t cut it in the real world. Although I’ve taught myself a lot – Photoshop, photography, video production, some web design, etc. – I’m not the best self-directed learner, and I sincerely doubt my ability to self-teach calculus. An Associate’s would take roughly two years (my previous degree eliminates my need to take any courses outside of math and CS courses). I have the option to live at home with my family, greatly reducing my financial burden. Of course, there’s an opportunity cost to that which I’ve also been considering.

Why I decided against a boot camp: I’ve read tons of threads about boot camps on Reddit, and there doesn’t seem to be a consensus as to whether or not they’re good or bad. They’re for-profit and non-accredited. They all seem to cost more than an Associate’s or Bachelor’s from an accredited college. They would also likely require me to move to a hub city for a couple months.

Why I don’t think a Master’s is viable: With the exception of one stats course in college, I haven’t taken a math class in ten years. Based on programs I’ve looked at seems like I’d have to build that foundation first before I attempted to dive into a Master’s in CS.

55qcmk,1,2016-10-03,Almost graduated with little formal experience. Conflicted on what to do next. Would love some input! [long text but written with love],illegibleKey46,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/55qcmk/almost_graduated_with_little_formal_experience/,"Good evening guys.

I wanted to share something there's on my mind with you and hopefully get some feedback. I'm 21 years old and I'm one semester away of getting my major in Computer Science.

I don't work formally since I wanted to have the time to graduate right. That means I did really well thought most of college and, since I love programming, I used all my free time learning stuff.

Of course that lead me to web. I learned by myself and used in at least a personal project most of the stuff we like: Meteor, React, Vue, Redux, Webpack, Gulp, Docker, Mongo, Rethink, etc... I did some freelance jobs on the side too. In the mean time, I also learned a lot of clojure, machine learning, swift, ios programming, etc (this part isn't 'freelance tested' tho, although I wish it was).

The freelance jobs were mostly to test the waters. I really liked doing them and despite only getting small jobs the clients seem to really like me. I really like the freelancing mindset. I'm really really organized (OCD stuff) and I have no problem managing myself, and these experiences only confirmed that.

Now the part that troubles me. Most of my college friends are getting intern jobs now. Internships aren't mandatory for my course, just clarifying. Here in my country the salary is low for 6hr a day and conditions are bad. Most of them are only doing it to add to the resume (since most are pretty empty, like mine).

So, if I were to follow the flow I should get one too. The problem is I hate this idea. I hate the idea that I should lose my flexibility and 'free' time in my last semester to get a shitty salary and some 'resume experience'. I'd really prefer to try to freelance for real, build up a portfolio, host it somewhere. Look for webdev and iOS jobs from everywhere in the world and get some real money (in my 'testing the waters job' I got far more I would get in some internship here, since the currency conversion helped).

Anyway, I'm conflicted. I know exactly what I wanted to do. But if I do it, I lose the internship opportunity that seems so important to everyone, since it's my last semester. Most of the people I talk to tell me to just suck it up and do like everyone else.

I'm afraid I'll have problems getting a job if I skip the internship phase, but that's based on nothing really. My college is one of the best ones in my country and I'm one of the youngest graduating this year, so sometimes I think I should be ahead just for having a major.

Well... anyway. I think that's all.
It's been long couple of weeks thinking about that.
Wanted to share and get some input.
Sorry for the wall of text.

What do you guys think I should do?

55r7vx,33,2016-10-03,Noisy,earthquakeglued,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/55r7vx/noisy/,"There are somewhere in the neighborhood of 400,000 species of plants throughout the world, and every single one is toxic to some extent. Sometimes it’s the roots or bulbs that hold the potent poison safely underground, but more often the toxins are flaunted for all to see – tucked inside of a juicy looking berry or inside the fleshy leaves and flowers.  The appearance of the plant doesn’t indicate the danger lurking within; venom hides in the innocuous green leaves of the Elephant Ear plant and in the sweet, colorful blooms of the oleander, so toxic that even inhaling the smoke of a burning bush could be fatal.

Even the plants that we eat can harm us. Swallow too many apple seeds (or peach pits) and you’re actually ingesting a derivative of cyanide.   Too many grapes or onions could kill your dog. Too much nutmeg can make you stop sweating and think you’re seeing dancing spiders. Even tomatoes are in the nightshade family, and if you eat enough of the leaves or stems you’re probably going to spend a considerable amount of time in the bathroom, if the hallucinations don’t kick in first.

Luckily for us, most of the toxic plants aren’t fatal, just damaging enough to teach the consumer a lesson about the pecking order.  Toxicity is the only defense that most plants have against consumption. In the wild they’re immobile and vulnerable to predators looking for a quick meal. 

And then there are the carnivorous plants, the meat eaters, the ones that are actively predatory. You’ve probably heard of the Venus Fly Trap, *Dionaea muscipula*, native to the Carolinas and actually more likely to eat a beetle or a spider than a fly.  When an insect wanders too close to the trap, a tiny cilia-like hair senses its presence and moves to gobble it up at an incredibly fast speed.  The cobra lily, *Darlingtonia californica*, controls the amount of rain water that falls into its pitcher-like shape.  After luring insects inside, it then secrets a lubrication to make escape almost impossible; as an added security for a tasty meal, the plant will actually physically curl itself to block the only existing exit hole until the insect is too weak to try anymore and digestion begins. This penchant for live food is more than just a means of protection, it’s survival through evolution – the native soil in which it grows is too poor to provide proper nutrients, and so catching and digesting prey is necessary.

Plants have always fascinated me. Their role in our ecosystem, our diets, our habitats, our culture, and the birth of our civilizations is so often overlooked - even among those in the scientific community. That’s one of the reasons I wanted to go into teaching – so that I could share a little bit of my knowledge and love of plants with others. I teach at a magnet high school that focuses on STEM education – Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. Our students choose a career path at the end of their freshman year and take classes that focus on giving them an internship opportunity their senior year. 

My Botany class is required for all juniors in a Science career path, and I know that when they see it on their schedules they’re not immediately enthused.  Compared to classes like Animal Bioscience, Forensic Chemistry, and Anatomy (complete with partial cadaver dissection), a class about plants seems like a total bore. But I like to think that once they get into the class and see what it’s about that they start to enjoy it. I run a greenhouse and outdoor garden that supplies some seasonal vegetables to the cafeteria, and the kids really love working in the dirt and seeing their hard work blossom into something they can eat. We take some cool field trips and learn about the role that plants have played in everything from medicine to influencing immigration patterns.  

Since I’m the only plant person that many of our staff members and students know, I’m often called on to diagnose issues like “Why is this African violet dying?” (probably too much water or direct light) , “What should I plant in a bed with cucumbers?” (generally, anything but sage and potatoes) , or “What are these little bugs on my plants?” (aphids, nearly 100% of the time).

That’s why I wasn’t surprised when Mr. Lopes, a Computer Drafting teacher, appeared in the doorway of my classroom a few minutes after the bell rang one day last month.

“Knock, knock,” he said, already walking through the threshold. “Got a second, Amanda? I have a plant question for you.”

I was at my desk entering grades and really wanted to get done as soon as possible, but I smiled and said, “Of course, what’s up?”

Lopes let out a low chuckle and looked over his shoulder at the empty doorway, as if he was checking to make sure we were alone. “Let me preface this by saying that I’m pretty sure I know the answer to this already, but… can plants make noise? I mean, maybe that’s the wrong term to use, but is it possible to hear something coming from a plant?”

Now I was intrigued. I shut my laptop to give him my full attention.

“Well, that’s an interesting question, and the simple answer is yes, they do.” I thought I detected a look of relief fall over Lopes’s face. “In fact, there’s been a lot of research lately about the way that the sound of tiny air bubbles forming and popping works as a kind of signal for pollination. And it’s suspected that some plants actually communicate with each other through sound vibrations in their roots – that they can discern the sound of a predator and actually warn each other. I don’t know too much about it, to be honest, but an old professor of mine has done some work on the topic.”

“Okay,” he replied,  “that makes me feel a lot better, thank you. Enjoy the rest of your afternoon.” 

“Any time,” I offered, as he turned to leave. But something wasn’t sitting right with me. I wasn’t sure if I’d provided the answer he really needed, or if I’d misunderstood the intent behind his question.  And, frankly, I wanted to know why he asked. He was halfway down the hall when I called after him. 

“Wait, Lopes? I feel like I have to add to my answer, and forgive me if it seems like I’m being condescending but – those sounds that plants make? They’re not discernible to the human ear. We only know they exist because of really powerful audio equipment that detects the vibrations. They’re just super tiny noises.”

He swallowed hard and took a moment before he replied, “Yeah, of course.  But I mean, isn’t it possible that maybe someone with really sharp hearing or something could get a little hint of a sound? Like a really quiet static, maybe?”

I shook my head. “No, not those sounds.  But, a large enough plant may have some sort of bug infestation that could be audible depending on what kind of bug it is. Do you think you might be having a bug problem?”

Lopes considered his answer, “It’s my mother-in-law,” he finally replied, “who thinks that she is hearing a sound in her plant. It’s just this tiny little thing that she picked up at the Sunday Market a couple of weeks ago. Maybe an orchid or something?  Anyway, you know how everyone says you should talk to a plant to help it grow? Like, the sound and chemicals in our breath can actually help it? ” 

“Yeah,” I replied. “There’s probably some truth to that, but not for the reason we used to think. Plants thrive on carbon dioxide, which we emit when we talk, but there’s such a small amount that it probably doesn’t make a difference. The vibrations of sound are a stimulus, so that’s helpful. But what probably makes it most true is that when we’re talking to our plants we’re paying closer attention to them so we notice when it needs water or light and so on.”

“Well, she definitely pays this plant a lot of attention. She, uh… well, she’s older, and maybe sometimes she’s not completely all together. And she seems to think that this plant is making noises. Making words. And she’s started to obsess over it a bit, trying to figure out what it’s saying to her.” I wondered if his mother in law was the only one thinking she heard sounds coming from an orchid, but Lopes shifted his weight uncomfortably from one leg to another and I knew not to press the subject.

“I understand. Maybe if you brought the plant into me I could take a look at it? Just make sure there aren’t any creepy crawlies like a burrowing spider or an egg sac about to burst?” The thought of encountering either one of those things make my skin crawl, but something about Lopes’s embarrassed look made me want to help.

He smiled broadly, “That would be great!” he replied. “I mean, just to give my wife some peace of mind, you know? How about tomorrow?”

I nodded. “Sure, no problem. I’m happy to help.” 

That was my first of many mistakes.

The plant was delivered the next morning as promised. It was a common fuchsia colored *Phaelaelopsis* – a moth orchid. Moth orchids are as standard as orchids come, and their hearty nature makes them a popular florist shop purchase. Orchids are delicate by nature, but the moth orchid is hearty and resistant to many of the pitfalls that effect other species.

It sat on my desk until my planning period, when I took it into our horticulture lab..  I pulled on a thin pair of gloves, even though I knew I was being overly cautious. I pulled the plant from the simple terrcotta pot that it sat in and examined the roots. They looked healthy, with no sign of predators. I gently shook out some of the moss, bark, and soil looking for evidence of a burrowing insect like a spider or beetle, but I didn’t find that either. The plant seemed to be healthy, maybe a little on the dry side, but certainly not suffering from anything that could even remotely cause an issue like Lopes was describing. Puzzled, I carefully packed the orchid back in its pot, gave it a couple droppers of water, and chalked it up to an old woman’s imagination.

I walked the orchid back down to Mr. Lopes at the end of the day and reported my findings.

“Nothing?” he asked, “I mean, nothing at all?” He seemed genuinely surprised.

“Nope,” I replied, “Just your average, run of the mill orchid. I gave it a little water because it had dried out, so tell you mother-in-law to wet the roots for maybe 20- 30 seconds in about a week. Oh, and non-chlorinated water is best, if you can.”

“Uh-uh,” Lopes said, shaking his head vigorously. “I’m not taking it back. It’s not coming back in my house. I don’t care what you do with it, but I’m not bringing it home. “

He couldn’t be serious, I thought, but he was. He refused to even touch the orchid, so I picked it up and shrugged my shoulders. “I could put it in the greenhouse, if you want?”

“That’s fine, I just… I know this sounds insane, but I don’t want to be near it. The way that my mother-in-law has changed since she got that thing scares the shit out of me. And I’m not saying that the plant talks or that there’s anything spooky going on here, but I am saying that no matter what’s causing it, I’m scared about what it’s doing to her, and I’m not bringing it back with me.”

“I understand,” I replied, even though I didn’t. “I’ll keep it with me, no worries.”

That was my second mistake.
My third mistake occurred a week later, when I went into the greenhouse to water. I figured it was time to give the orchid a bit more water, if for no other reason than the leaves were starting to collect a bit of residue.  I picked up the pot and moved it over to a utility sink, loaded a spray bottle with distilled water, and gave a few squirts.

“There, doesn’t that feel better?” I asked, putting the orchid back on the shelf. And that’s when it happened. Right before my hand left the pot, I thought that I heard a tiny sound – a shuffling really, something like a low buzz – coming from the orchid. “Was that you?” I asked, hesitantly, towards the direction of the plant, even though I felt foolish doing so. 

Silence. 

I remember laughing to myself for letting my mind play tricks on me, convincing myself that what I’d heard was simply the sound of the water settling down into the moss. I remember thinking that I was no better than Lopes’s mother-in-law, that it was so easy to let your imagination run away.

Until it happened again the next week.

This time, I hadn’t even watered the plant yet, so there was so simple explanation that I could come up with. In fact, my fingers had just barely brushed the surface of the medium to feel the soil when I heard – no, felt -  the shuffling again. This time it seemed to be louder and cleared than before, and there was no doubt in my mind that it was coming from the plant itself.

I was more curious than scared at that point. I actually felt excited, like I may have been on the cusp of some great new discovery about plant cognition and communication. So I set about to gather evidence the only way knew how – through an experiment, although admittedly not a very good one.  I bought a beautiful white moth orchid to use as my constant, and then isolated both in separate parts of the lab. I borrowed a couple of high powered digital recording devices from the school’s audio lab, and set up microphones next to both plants.  I turned on each of the recorders right before I left for the day.

I wish I could say that I didn’t arrive early to work the next morning, but I did, eager with anticipation and nervous about the implications. I wish I could say that I didn’t close my classroom door for the next four days during my planning period so that I could and hunch in a quiet corner of the lab wearing headphones, listening to the . But I did. I did all of those things. 

And I didn’t hear a damn thing.

So, I did what any self-respecting woman who just spent sixteen hours listening to blank recordings trying to hear a plant talking. I laughed at myself, returned the recording equipment, and tried to forget about how foolish I’d been. And then I took the orchid home with me. As you can see, I may as well have gotten my PhD in mistake making.

Within a few days, I was hearing the orchid again, and this time the noises seemed even louder.  And it seemed like – and I know this sounds batshit crazy- it seemed like the noises were forming into some sort of word or sentence. It was almost as if I could make out the patterns just like I would be able to if someone was speaking another language. I knew the stops and starts, I knew the change in tone and nuances. This lasted for a few weeks, on and off, and so I went out and bought some motion sensor recording equipment of my own. I even bought a new laptop so that I could run the recording program and isolate any sounds it picked up. I wish I could say that I didn’t drain most of my meager savings on it, but I did. 

I still thought that I was on the cusp of discovering something amazing and new about plants and they way they use frequencies to communicate. I imagined my research gracing the cover of Scientific American. I imagined myself winning the Nobel Prize and joining the ranks of so many great scientists before me. Imagine – me, a high school teacher! 

I knew that plants didn’t have brains. I knew they weren’t intelligent creatures. I knew that everything they did was a biochemical reaction related to their survival. At least, that’s what I thought I knew.

Two days went by and I could never seem to record anything, no matter what I did. I tried talking to the orchid, moving it from one area to another, changing its pot, changing its moss medium, watering it. Still silence. I introduced it to the white orchid – the one that was the constant in my experiment. I thought that maybe being near another in its species would prompt it to communicate. And then I went away overnight, a trip I’d planned long in advance with my sister to see a play on Broadway.

When I returned yesterday morning, my laptop was full of recordings – 162 of them, to be exact, all between 1.6 and 2.4 seconds long. I ecstatic. Even though I couldn’t make out any sound, this was proof that I wasn’t going crazy. This was proof that there was some of process taking place unlike anything we’d ever seen before, and I could hardly wait to get them to school and beg someone from the audio department to clarify it and see if they could isolate each sound a little better than I could. I was on top of the world.

 Until I noticed the control orchid was missing. 

I searched for a good twenty minutes for it, until I finally found it – underneath my kitchen sink, behind some cleaning products in the corner. Like it was trying not to be seen; like it was trying to hide. If it wasn’t for the fact that I’d marked the pot for the experiment, I may not have recognized it. It’s beautiful white leaves were now streaked with the deep fuchsia color of the variable orchid, and it was missing half of its leaves.

I called in a favor to Mr. Houston in Audio Tech and asked if I could send him the 162 recordings to see if he could discern anything from the noise. I knew it was a big job, and that he’d rather not spend the last few hours of his weekend doing it, but I didn’t feel guilty – not after all the Poinsettia Sale fundraisers I’ve helped run to send his students to tech competitions every year. I told him it was urgent.

While I was waiting for Houston to call, I decided to pay a visit to the market where the orchid came from. It didn’t take me long to find a stall selling a dozen or so different kinds of plants, all in terracotta pots. There was kalanchoe, gardenia, miniature roses, gerbera, mini sunflowers… and, of course, fuchsia moth orchids. An older couple was standing under a pop-up tent, observing me as I walked over. They looked like your run of the mill middle aged couple. He wore a baseball cap and a windbreaker, she had on an apron on not unlike what I wear in the greenhouse. Behind them was an older model camper with out of state license plates and two folding chairs out in front of it.

The woman smiled, warmly. “Is there any particular kind you’re interested in?

“I’m mostly interested in the orchids. I have one that was given to me as a gift, and I think it was purchased from here.”

“Oh? How lovely,” she replied. “I hope you’re enjoying it?” Her question was more of a statement.

“I was just wondering where your plants come from?” I asked, boldly. “Do you purchase them wholesale?”

“No, no. We grow them. They all start off with us,” her husband replied, walking up to join her. “We’ve been growing plants for a very long time.” He smiled, a little too broadly. It made me uncomfortable. 

“And is there ever anything…different about your plants? About your orchids, maybe?” My brazen questioning apparently knew no limits.

The man and woman looked at each other as the smiles disappeared from their faces. “Why do you ask?” they both said, almost in unison.

“Because, I think that maybe the orchid I got is…different in some way. Maybe it’s a little *noisier* than other plants?” 

Suddenly the woman lunged forward. “Get rid of it now!” she said, in a panicked whisper. “Give it to someone else, quickly.  Sell it, gift it, do whatever you have to do to get it out of your life. Find another person to care for it. Do it today, don’t wait!"" Her eyes stared at me, urgently.

The husband put a hand on her shoulder and clucked his tongue in a calming fashion. “We’re really sorry that you ended up with one, we really are. But you have to understand that this is the only way out for us.  This is the only way to try and keep ahead of it. You can’t just leave them somewhere. We’ve tried it. They find their way back.” He motioned to the menagerie of plants.

“I don’t understand what you mean,” I said, meekly, even though I was starting to do just that. “It’s just a plant.”

The woman let out a low, pained laugh. “There is no such thing as *just a plant*.”

“Are all of those,” I pointed to the plants, “I mean, are they all *noisy*?” 

She shook her head and raised her shoulders as if to say she didn’t know. “Once you hear it, it’s impossible not to notice it all the time. And after a while the things they *say*, my God. It’s horrific. It’s hard to tell now which ones are talking and which ones are just listening…. and learning.” Her reply chilled me, and I turned to leave without so much as a word of thanks to them. 

As I walked away, I heard the man’s voice call after me, “Get rid of it!  It will ruin your life! And keep it away from other plants, no matter what!” I thought of the broken, pink tinged orchid hiding under my sink, and I realized it was too late for that.

Houston called as I was walking home. He’d finished with the sounds and wanted to know if I was playing some sort of joke on him. He seemed agitated and told me that if he found out that he’d wasted the past four hours of his life because of a prank he’d smash in all the windows of my greenhouse. I was pretty sure he was at least partially joking.  I assured him that I honestly needed to know what the recordings said.

“Okay, well, then get ready to be weirded out. I’ll play it for you. Ready?” 

There was a split second of the shuffling noise that I’d come to know so well, amplified into a crisp, deep intonation. And then, a voice that was unlike any I’ve ever heard, one that was simultaneously gnarled and childlike, came like a whisper:

*A-maaaaaaaaaaan-daaaaaaa*.

I almost dropped the phone and had to sit on the curb to collect myself. I could hear Houston calling me from the other end. “Amanda? You there?”

“I’m here,” I replied, my mouth suddenly dry. “What do the rest of them say?”

“The same thing. Same voice, whispering your name, over and over again, except for the very last one. Did you want to hear that one?” I must have made a sound of agreement, because the same shuffling sound filled the receiver, followed by the intense, childlike whisper. 

*Hello.*

I think I understand why the couple at the Sunday Market sells the plants, knowing that they’re noisy. Orchids, like most flowering plants, are essentially hermaphrodites. They contain both male and female sex organs and can reproduce both sexually and asexually. It’s the perfect survival mechanism to propagate their species indefinitely. 

I spent the night with my sister and haven’t been back to my apartment since. I called out of work this morning – the thought of all the plants I have in the lab and greenhouse that might have heard – might have *learned* was just too overwhelming. I have to figure out what to do next. If I go back, what will I hear? What will I find?

After all, there are somewhere in the neighborhood of 400,000 species of plants throughout the world, and every single one is toxic to some extent.

1. This is pretty much the only time in my life that I will have the opportunity to do research like this.
2.  Although not certain, grad school is still on the table for me.
3.  I have just recently realized I want to work in software, not hardware, so my software/coding skills aren't quite good enough for a lot of internship software jobs.

I know I can get an internship in manufacturing pretty easily, however, that is not at all what I want to do with my life.  Right now, I think I would like to work in software/embedded systems or be doing some sort of R and D work.

If it makes a difference, the research is in computational electromagnetics so I will be gaining a lot of programming skills during it.  I also plan on seeking an internship the following summer after my junior year.

So am I limiting myself by not seeking an internship?  "

It's fall semester of junior year in my school's CS department... and that means recruiting season. It sucks. A lot.

This past summer I interned at a Big 4 and learned a lot; I really enjoyed it, but since it was a large corporation I want to try a smaller company that is quickly growing and has the archetypal ""fast-paced startup environment"".

I've been firing my resume off to many companies, and have been getting in the interview process with some (like Quora, Google, Facebook, Bloomberg, Apple, Palantir, Box, and Uber). They usually start off with coding challenges--which I usually pass.

But then comes the technical phone interview. I have so much anxiety when I have a technical phone interview coming up; there's so much BS to deal with like poor call quality, not being able to literally draw out your ideas on a whiteboard (which I love doing and 100% prefer), etc.

I don't really understand how well representative phone interviews are of a candidate's potential to succeed at the company. They ask you some behavioral questions, which is reasonable, but then comes a random coding question that could involve any data structure used in any way, or any random coding paradigm like recursion or dynamic programming.

I get it--interviews are supposed to explore how candidates think about problems. I agree that it's super important to see how a candidate thinks, it's truly representative of how good of an engineer they are.

But these random coding questions... they're just so iffy on phone interviews. I don't get what I'm supposed to prioritize; thinking out loud or pounding out code to get a working solution. I've experimented with both and have gotten mixed results.

In the interviews I've failed, it usually starts off with some behavior questions. Then, I usually solve 1 problem without much help, then get a 2nd problem where I struggle through and usually take 1-2 hints from the interviewer to solve. Then it's time for questions to ask the interviewer--at this point, if I didn't answer 2 questions without any help, is there any point in this? It's quite obvious that they'd fail me (given that I'm interviewing with a company with a competitive applicant pool).

I've also passed interviews where I only solve 1 problem without help, or I solve 1 problem and get through the 2nd problem with a lot of help.

I just don't know what they're looking for in these damn phone interviews. I've gotten an offer from all companies that interviewed me exclusively on campus or on site. Ugh.

/endrant

TLDR: What do you guys do to stand out during phone interviews? Bust through the technical problems? Show amiable-ness during the behavioral parts? I just don't get it anymore and it's super frustrating.

Also, just want to drop a quick thanks to this sub. Without you guys, I wouldn't be in this position to have gotten an internship with the big 4 my sophomore summer and to be interviewing with top companies. Keep up with the stuff you guys do :)

But seriously, fuck this process..."

But it seems like the culture of IT jobs has really changed, because everywhere i look it seems super competitive, often intertwined with gamer culture, and everywhere recommends you to do internships, outside projects, networking, etc. just to get a job. I just want somewhere low-key, diverse, with a good work-life balance with none of the whole fast-paced tech-crunch vibe. Also, I deal with a lot of mental health issues and it's all I can do to eke out a degree with a minimum course load (not because I find the material too difficult but because of mental health stuff), so I really need something that's not too intense, if that even exists. It would also be cool to do some sort of fulfilling work or work on something exciting -- I do have a dream company in mind that's a small gaming company that makes empowering games and is relaxed and everything like I was saying, but I don't know if there's any other place like that. Is there any sort of job title, types of jobs that I should be looking for? Any great companies? I'm not looking for any sort of fancy job, but I do hope there would be something I could do that's not just straight up blue collar. :/ I would be graduating with no work experience, internships or personal projects, so..."

My friend happens to be in the exact same situation as me and we were now wondering what the next best step could be for two people graduating with CS degrees from UIUC but with unimpressive resumes. We figured that someone on r/uiuc has had a similar experience at some point. 
We both worked together for an air conditioning company in the suburbs last summer, but that is all we have going for us.
Although we have ample time for finding a job by May, I have heard that companies stop recruiting after the fall. We both reasoned that we would have to at least find some sort of lower tier type of work to financially support ourselves if we don't find anything by graduation. However, we think it would be a waste of our degree to go into a completely unrelated minimum wage job and instead were hoping that people on here might have some pointers on easier-to-get work that could put our CS degrees from UIUC to good use."

From the very beginning we had issues. Her and her friends were part of a modeling troupe and they were for lack of a better word filthy. 

Her sister was sleeping in our living room, something she never told me about so I was unable to enjoy my own living room. When I switched bedrooms (but was still in the same room), I left the door open for her sister to use and one night I set off the fire alarm by accident and the cops searched the empty room and found the alcohol and weed she had just laying around.

From there it got worse. They were very disgusting and my roommate, became mean to me. She began accusing me of stealing her food, something I suspect they did because I was overweight and they were all skinny models. 

She was also very quiet when I was around. I would try to have conversations and she would just remain silent and not say anything, even when I was blatantly talking to her.

She started taking offense to stuff I said, like one night I was in the room and they were all talking and calling each other bitch. I asked why they called each other that and one of the models explained it was just a phrase, SHE gets offended and starts asking why I'm asking stuff like that and how she only called her friend a bitch once and was asking what I was trying to say. 

I apologized to the others and they said I wasn't doing anything wrong. 

A big thing that bothered me was one night after I got off from work they broke out in a fight that lasted three fucking hours. I was in my room most of the time but I walked out later to go pee, not even bothering to look at them and all of a sudden I hear ""Hold up! Brittany's standing there watching at the door"" and they all got quiet just because of me.

She insulted me with that and when I left for eight weeks for an internship she seemed almost happy I was leaving like I was the problem in all of it. 

It hurt me and I still think about it to this day because I never did anything to her. I tried to help out, I tried being nice, I made a mistake setting off the fire alarm and complaining about the trash in the room they left because after that I just started being treated like shit for no reason. 

I just wished she had liked me is all. I have low self esteem as it is and people just take advantage of me and when I stand up for myself people laugh in my face or just ignore me like she did. 

I can' let it go and its been bugging me for months. Why didn't she like me? Was I really that annoying?

There would be days when I wouldn't even want to go back to my own room because I knew she would be there and I knew how much she disliked me, I just never could figure out the reason why."

55sq55,1,2016-10-04,Kinda lost,table732,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/55sq55/kinda_lost/,"Hey,


I've been struggling to understand myself lately and, I don't know, I thought I should talk to someone about it. 

Firstly, I think I gotta tell you a little about my backstory. I'm a 19 years old male, soon to be 20, living with my dad and my step-mother. My parents are divorced and my mom lives in a different city. 

I'm currently at one of the very best Law Schools in the country, but not really feeling it as much as many of my colleagues seem to do. I don't exactly know where things got off-track, but I guess it goes somewhat like this.

I had always been a really good/great student. Lots of friends, national debater, played tennis at a high level and all of that. That was, however, until my last year in high school (2013). I started partying compulsively, going out with friends and drinking heavily during the weekend.
 
At the end of the year, I was accepted at the best School of Economics in the country, having passed the exams and all of that stuff. The thing is: I hadn't thought it through. I had no idea of what I wanted to do with my life and had put no thought into it whatsoever. I soon realized that something was wrong and dropped out almost immediately. Then again, same fucking mistake, another rushed move. Nowadays, I realize that I did this probably due to my own sloth, and not for some deeper reason. 

By that time, I was totally lost. No college, no idea of which kind of life I wanted to pursue, living with my dad and drinking heavily with my friends during the weekend for God knows which reason. So it popped up in my mind the idea of applying for Law School at the very next opportunity that showed up, which I successfully did.

So I started my graduation and during the first semester everything went smoothly. I liked my new friends, I enjoyed my classes, things were better at home and all of that. However, as soon as the second semester started, I lost interest. Many friends applied for internships and scored them big time. I did not even apply. 

I began to think about moving overseas to look for a new kind of life, one that didn't revolve around college. This is one thing that, to this day, I still fantasize about, although I can see that this could be a way of me blaming the environment when what really needs to be improved is myself. Around this time, I realized that my attention span had severely decreased and that my ability to associate ideas had been completely messed up.

Skip forward to a month ago (late August/2016). I had an unprocteted one night stand (condom fucking broke) and I went kinda nuts. It was a low risk situation (vaginal sex), but still, I decided that it would be better for me to get on PEP for the sake of my peace of mind. 

This led me to a whole free-alcohol month, which induced me into thinking of how long it had been since the last time that I had stayed a whole month without a drink. It'd been a long time. It also made me realize that, nowadays, there is not a thing that makes me excited. I used to be excited to watch my Steelers or my soccer team, to go out with girls, to get on with new projects and stuff. Right now, I just feel overwhelmed by the intricacy that the real world presents me, it honestly seems that I'm not up for it. Nearly all of my colleagues have nice internships and seem to be happy to be working towards their future. On the other hand, I don't feel involved with things. I feel the urge to go get a job, or look for a nice internship, but honestly, I feel kinda empty. 

My grades, although still good, are not nearly what it once was, my attention span is significantly smaller and my ability to associate ideas is completely fucked up, probably my biggest worry. I wanna get these things back. Most importantly, I seem to readily lose my interest on things and projects. What do you guys think I should do about it?

I tried to learn a new language, but I quickly lost interest. I went back to the gym, but I quickly lost interest. 

Right now, the only thing that I have going for me is a small project that is being funded by the university. But, then again, I've lost interest recently. 

Keep in mind that the binge-drinking on weekends, almost always with my high school friends, has always been steadfast.

I would really like to move out of the country to start over, but probably this whish is just a way of me avoiding the inevitability of responsability.


Today I sent my curriculum to a few places looking for an internship and I contacted a psychiatrist. I really feel like I need to talk to someone about all of this. I'm not feeling well about the burden that I'm causing on my dad. He is a great father who has done everything he can for me to have the best opportunities. 

Sorry for the long post, I probably needed it to clear my mind. Truly appreciate those who have read it.

(edit: just to keep the focus on one country)

I've been searching for positions in companies like Amazon and Intel that have offices in Madrid. I used to work for Intel (intern) so I have a few connections there, but no leads in Europe. Spain's economy isn't great (most young people are unemployed) so I always thought my chances of finding any job there were slim. I'm also finding mostly marketing and sales positions are available instead of engineering. 

Is it possible to find a company that will sponsor a work visa? Are there any software engineer types out there in similar situation? Should I build my career in the US first and then move? (I'd really love to move now, I have a crazy itch) Can you get a work visa for Europe without being sponsored?

Thanks guys (first reddit post, go easy on me)

Want to take winter break just to study and practice doing interview questions, but offer deadline is before winter break for doing automation QA internship at a Fortune 500 company, though I don't like it and I don't think I can learn anything. Risk giving it up for possibility of getting a better swe internship in spring?**

So some background information, I'm a junior studying CS at a really good university (top 10). I love computer science and its concepts. However I fucked up somewhere in my life. I somehow have decent grades, but probably because of good memorization, taking a really long time to think, and previous experience programming in high school. Therefore, I'm horrible at interview questions and quickly doing problem solving. Example: Find if there is a path between two nodes. Easy, BFS! Oh return the path. Somehow mind is stuck, even with hints. Really?

Obviously I need to do a lot of problems and review, easy ones on modifying implementations, and leetcode quickly. Biggest problem? Classwork is really taking its toll. There's just so much homework and class to go to and I'm afraid if I spend too much time on interview prep, I get too behind on classes. I usually do maybe 1 leetcode problem every 2 days (just started doing this a week or 2 ago, hence why I'm so bad). 

I want to take winter break to do interview prep, but the biggest problem is I had internships beforehand and even a return offer with a really good company. But, I hated the work and didn't really learn much at all. Therefore, I don't really want the offer. And during internships I tend to be too tired from work plus having fun with roommates, internship events, and my own alone time to do prep.  But I'm not sure how many more interviews I will get and there's a chance I won't get an internship for the summer. Would that look weird to companies?

Also, I gave a lot of background info because I'm looking for advice on how I fucked myself up and what I can do to stop fucking up. Bit more on myself, I attend every class, try to pay attention, get all my homework done. Probably the one thing I need to work on is distractions
 My time spent on reddit, anime, and hearthstone is probably 2-3 hours a day, which is a lot cause I don't have a lot of night time after class."

A little background, I am a junior in Software engineering. I currently have 2 offers for internships. One for the company I worked at last summer and one for a more local smaller company. The more local one does not pay for my housing but pays 1.50 an hour more than my old one which included housing, I am leaning towards this company but I only have 2 more weeks to accept the offer. Here's where the real twist comes in I have an interview with Microsoft in a week and they are my ideal company. I doubt I would get an offer a week after. I would not like to cancel an accepted offer at the local place. I plan on waiting to see how the Microsoft interview goes before taking or declining the offer to the local company.   
  
Also my old companies offer expires in December so I would have that to fall back on if I turn down the local one and don't get one from Microsoft. Any advice or input? I am in a bit of a pickle right now...

I'm currently going to school in Washington for computer science to get my Associate's degree. In nine months, I'll have the opportunity to take the summer off if I can get an internship by then. Hoping to get one in software development. We've got a strong focus in C# (Microsoft being kiddie corner to my house and whatnot). To give an idea of my qualifications without posting my resumé, I'm getting good grades (3.99 average) and have a decent, if unrelated career history (5 years as a security dispatcher, 3 in customer service). I'm also acting as DBA for the school tutoring center's free-for-students computer repair service. 

I'm looking for any advice folks feel like giving to someone who doesn't know anybody in the industry, but I'm also specifically looking for ideas on some projects I could work on for the time being to show off once I start interviewing for X position. I want to do EVERYTHING I can right now to maximize my appeal to future employers, and I really have no idea what kind of project would qualify as impressive enough to show off in an interview. 

But as I said, I'll take any advice I can get. And if more info is needed, I'll gladly provide it. 

Edit: I know a Bachelor's is ideal, but it took me seven years to save up the money just to do this much; without getting on with a company that's willing to help with my education, getting my BAS is unlikely at best :-\"

55xkrp,79,2016-10-04,My job hunting experience,AwkwardPixel,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/55xkrp/my_job_hunting_experience/,"Hey all, first time poster. I thought I would share my experience about my recent software development job search in the US:

My Qualifications:

  - Bachelors Computer Science Degree from an average university
  - 3 month internship developing software (mostly writing automation scripts really) for company that eventually offered me my first job after graduating
  - 2 years working as a software engineer at a well-known company (not big 4, but in the Fortune 500), but working with older technologies, so wasn't the best for jobs that were looking for more current languages/skillsets

Where I was looking: 
  Western States (Utah, Oregon, Washington)

Was I looking to relocate?:

  Yes. I was living in a smaller town, and based on preferences for where I wanted to work, would require a move out of state. I did however save up the funds necessary to relocate, so I didn't explicitly ask companies to help me move during the screening process.

Number of applications submitted: 100-150
  
  * I mostly applied through openings in LinkedIn, which was ultimately where I found my current job. To be more specific, I browsed through LinkedIn's job postings for the areas that I was interested in and applied for most of the jobs there on the company websites.
  * A lot of these applications were mostly shotgunned. Usually I would not adapt the resume to the company I was applying for; just relied on a generic catch-all resume.

Number of phone screens: Around 15-20

Number of onsite interviews: 2 (no offer from either)
  
  1st onsite interview: About 3 months into my job search, got through the screening phone call and a video interview that involved test driven development. Company then flew me out and also set up a nice hotel reservation. Only did interview questions with a team lead, was a straightforward fibonacci algorithm. The rest of the time was spent actually working with employees on site, which I thought was pretty cool. Hiring manager told me at the end that they had too many inexperienced people already and that I would take too long to learn their technology stack and get up to speed. Was pretty disappointed, but I felt I had been pretty clear with my lack of experience, so potentially dodged a bullet if the hiring manager wasn't being honest with me.

  2nd onsite interview: About 5 months into my job search, Got through the screening phone call and did a phone interview that involved coding using a shared code editor. The problem given to solve was a tricky string parsing algorithm. Company flew me out, reserved a hotel, and also paid for meal expenses. On-site Interview process was much more rigorous:

  * 1st Interview: Met with team manager, asked behavioral questions and had chance to ask questions about company
  * 2nd Interview: Asked to write an algorithm that would check if a given sudoku board was valid or not. I definitely choked on this one, and regret not having worked on algorithms, including ones involving two dimensional arrays, a lot more.
  * Lunch with a member of one of the teams (no questions, just a good lunch :] )
  * 3nd Interview: Asked to solve a problem of finding the best time to sell and buy stocks given the prices of stocks on each day of a month. Best time meaning what would yield the greatest profits
  * 4th Interview: Asked basic questions about polymorphism and other OO concepts. Asked to solve a problem that would reverse a string. After writing the function, was asked to change the function to support inverting individual words in a sentence
  * 5th Interview: Asked to design an object oriented application involving making reservations at restaurants
  * Looking back on the experience, I could have studied more algorithms and data structures to prepare for my onsite interviews. Shortly after receiving my rejection for the positions, I ordered a copy of Cracking the Coding Interview

Ultimately, after about 8 months of searching, I got a job offer. It started with the usual phone screening, and was followed by sort of a technical phone interview that ended with them asking me for a sample of some code I had written. Luckily I had done a little bit of work on a small project recently, so I had something available. I then did a video interview. I first talked to a manager a bit about my expectations and was asked some behavioral questions. I was then asked some OO concept questions, an algorithm question about how to get a word count of all words in a large string, and a design question for a program similar to MS paint. Got the job offer the next day, and was ecstatic!

My thoughts/feelings on the process
  Let's just say that I am definitely glad to have finished my 8-month search. It was a lot of work and it was difficult at times to take time off work (PTO) to go do interviews. One thing that I would definitely emphasize, but is probably obvious, is to know your algorithms and data structures. Beyond that, it's also really helpful to know the basics of other areas (databases/SQL, OOP, etc) and to have a good idea of how to answer behavioral questions.

  I didn't really have much in the way of projects, as most of my time was spent looking for jobs anyway, but I did invest a little time in a small android project for a couple of weeks, mostly to brush up on Java so that I could use it effectively for coding problems in interviews. I would say that it only played a small part in my job search overall.

Hopefully this breakdown is enough to give some perspective to people currently looking for a job as a software developer. I feel like ultimately I got pretty lucky with my current job, especially since I didn't do hardly any networking at all. I'm not the greatest at software development, but I'm definitely willing to learn and improve my abilities as needed.

If there's any interest in my experience, feel free to ask me questions, and I'll try to answer them as best as I can, and good luck to all on the job hunt. It's tough but definitely worth it in the end.

Edit: Formatting issues and added more information about where I was looking, how I used LinkedIn, and about my circumstances with relocating."

I have a career decision that I am confused about. I have been working as an intern at a software company on their iOS team for the last 5 months and feel I have become very familiar with iOS coding concepts. 

I am also working on my own application after work hours to build on an idea that I had during a hackathon which involves writing extremely basic backend code.

My question to you all is, considering I have 2.5 months left in my internship, is it better if I learn backend working with the backend team at my work place or stick with iOS? I want to know what employers tend to prefer more- people who have more experience on one particular field or some experience in all fields. 

The mobile department head has agreed to move me to the mobile api team if I want to, but I am worried if I move and not learn backend coding well enough, I will end up wasting 2.5 months.

As a reference, I already know core Java and the team has the backend service built on Java.

I am really confused right now and any help would be greatly appreciated.

There's just one problem I've had thusfar- almost all of the jobs in my area are related to telecom, networking, or database management. These are topics I've taken advanced classes on during my undergrad degree, but they are completely different from the projects I've worked on professionally (C++/Python applications to operate, analyze, and test advanced hardware).

From my experience, learning whatever specific library/language a project requires of me only takes a matter of days give that I am at least familiar/educated on the topics involved. However, it seems like the professional world has an opposite view of potential hires - ""You've either worked with something and are equipped to do it again, or you've never worked with it and aren't worth hiring"". 

Given this, what are ways I can show that I'm able to use a specific language, that 

**A)** I can do on my own at home

**B)** Companies will actually respect the work and consider it valid proof that I am competent in some technical skill. 

My guess is to just find some kind of pet project to work on and upload it to my github account or something similar, but I'd like to hear from someone with more industry experience before I embark on some random project that I have no interest in actually utilizing (kind of a motivation killer).

Specifically, the skillset I'd be showing off would involve things like php, javascript, RESTful interfaces, AWS, and all of the other hip modern web technologies. Would making some pet project actually be worth it, given the hundreds of hours delivering a full fleshed out project would take?"

I'm really trying to separate myself from the IT side of things and get a real engineering internship this summer (a guy at my last job recommended embedded systems), but interviews have been much harder to come by. I had my Microsoft interviewer tell me that my early experience could actually work against me, as it wasn't particularly technical.

So I'm about half way through my third year of a 5-year double-degree program (mechanical engineering and computer science) and I have a question for those of you in software engineering that have had internships/coop placements.

The city I live in has hundreds of postings for tech industry software engineering interns, but almost nothing for positions in mechanical/industrial/mechatronic/robotics engineering (the field I want to be in) due to the fact that we have three universities and a booming tech sector.  Looking through the postings that were there, almost all of them require some form of web development experience.  Having learned some Java through school, and a lot more on my own time (plus I am currently teaching myself Python and C++) I do have some programming/coding experience however I know almost nothing about web design.  I'm thinking if I could get some experience in that field I may be able to land one of those software development internships, which is at least a step in the right direction (plus I love coding and anything to do with electronics).

This is where my problem starts.  Having nothing in terms of web design experience, I have no idea where to start.  I have no problem learning new languages (in fact it's pretty much what I do in my spare time) but what do I start with?  HTML, CSS, Ruby, JavaScript?

- The other one is a relatively small company (&lt;100 person) which offer me position for creating some sort of dashboard in my favorite language, Java. It would involve quite some research, but also implementation.


The problem I have is that I like the first company better; it looks better on my resume, and I learn from the ""big company"" culture that I did not have in my previous internship.
However, I like the second position better; I've done a lot on mobile already and this seems nice to broaden my knowledge and experience more.


How do I choose the right one? Would you choose for the best suitable company or the best suitable position?

Just looking for some perspective between the careers above. Let me start with myself, I'm 24, Two and a half years out of college with a bio degree and chemistry minor. Graduated with a 3.45 GPA, got placed in the 89th percentile for the PCAT. Planned to become a pharmacist but after 2 years of being a pharmacy tech I realized it was just not the job for me. I also have maybe 7-8 months of experience as working as a medical scribe in case I decided to go for a physicians route.

Now, while I've been on the health care track since college, I've always had an affinity for computers and technology. I've learning some very basic coding and studying the CCNA books recently to get my feet wet with IT, but I'm unsure how else to immerse myself to get a feel for the field. Internships and entry level jobs are difficult to find with my lack of experience so far. What type of personality would you say would thrive in as a network admin or consultant?

The main reason I'm thinking about switching fields is that I feel that interacting with unfavorable patients would drain me quickly. I'm introverted, somewhat shy, but I do not have much issue meeting people or making conversation. What other aspects being a PA do you think are important to consider beforehand?

So as of now, I'm hoping to get some input from maybe people who've been in the same shoes or perhaps those who already work in the fields above. Your likes, dislikes, the kind of passions that keep you going. Thanks in advanced for any replies.

562kf2,1,2016-10-05,Should I take a lower paying job while a student with a better title?,slapstrap,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/562kf2/should_i_take_a_lower_paying_job_while_a_student/,"I've been interning at a small non-profit in a low COL area from around July until now.

They were paying peanuts but I was between transferring schools and needed some cash and experience on my resume. Their computer department only has about 6 guys in it.

They only paid me $10/hr but since it was a ten minute drive from where I'm living with my parents, it wasn't terrible as I had most of my living expenses paid for. I've also learned a ton about development and working with industry tools.

I'm currently in my Junior year of college, and I will be attending a relatively solid CS program to finish my Bachelor's degree. I will likely graduate fall of 2018.

This week, my company offered me a full-time position, with accommodations being made for allowing me to take a class or two during the day throughout the work week. It is the expectation that I would have the majority of my classes in the evening/outside the work hours.

The job gives me a title change to ""Jr. Developer"" and a raise to ~13/hr. I get to work with PHP, C#, JS, Jquery, plus a bunch of random stuff involved with working with LAMP servers.

I live about an hour from my school and the major metropolitan area it is located in is where I could likely find a job paying twice this. The nice things about this current job would be flexibility, practically non-existent deadlines, and the commute(or lack thereof). 

I see listings for jobs paying 60-80k all the time in the city I'm near for Jr. Devs. I don't think I have the resume to apply for these quite yet, but I would anticipate after taking this position at my current company and working there for ~1 year, I would have the qualifications. Is that reasonable? One of the stipulations they are putting on me is a verbal agreement that I would work for them at least until next fall. Obviously nothing would legally bind me to this, it would just be a matter of ethics and principle which I don't think I could compromise if I felt like leaving/got a better offer while there.

I interviewed at a company in the nearby major city, and that would pay 15-20/hr, but it would be much less development and far more databasing. If I were offered this job(which I think is a good possibility, I did well on the interview), it would be more convenient since it would be closer to my school. They also stated during the interview for that position that they could make accommodations for my class schedule if necessary.

I had lunch with my current boss today, and even he was saying he was surprised I took my current job as he believed I could easily get an internship with a larger company paying easily twice what I currently made.

### Pros of staying
- Better title
- Slightly better pay than I currently am receiving
- More opportunity to learn about development
- Low cost of living

### Cons of staying
- Not much room for advancement within company
- Non-existent networking
- If I want to move closer to my school, commute back would be annoying
- Low relative pay
- Company doesn't follow many industry standards(unit testing, code review, etc.)
- A lot of web dev, and I'm hoping to work in software dev (python, java &gt; php, sql, js) = my personal preference



So bottom line / tl;dr: is this:

Is it better for my career to take the poorly compensated job with the better title that would possibly look better on a resume, or would it be better to take a better paid job in a less development-related tech without being bound to a time commitment in an area where I would likely meet industry professionals/make connections with potential dev jobs down the road?
&amp;nbsp;
--------

EDIT: Sorry for wall of text, but also I guess I would eventually like to move closer to the city/out of my parents house, and this would be more feasible if I were making more. Moving closer would also make interviews for other jobs easier.

So a little background about me. I graduated this summer with a Bachelor in CS. During college, I spent most of my free time doing side projects and I didn't look for any internship. Another mistake was that I didn't start applying for a job until a month or two before graduation. 

Back in late April, I did an on-site interview with **company#1** for a software dev. position. Afterwards, the company's recruiter told me the feedback was ""very positive"" but unfortunately, they are in a holding mode atm and said that we should keep in touch.

Since then, I have had another on-site interview that I didn't get. And recently, I was suppose to get be set up with an on-site after a phone screening, but the HR person hasn't called back or response to my email *sign...*

Fast forward to today, the recruiter from **company#1** emailed me and offered me a Dev Ops &amp; IT Support Intern position. It pays $12/hr. I know, it's shitty. But at this point, I so tired of the whole process. Should I try to negotiate for a bit higher pay and take the offer so I have something to do and something to add to my resume? And while at that position, I would keep on searching for a full-time or, if am lucky, they would offer me one after a while. 

I appreciate any insights or suggestions.

I feel ""unqualified"" and need harsh advice.",AmatureProgrammer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/562lx8/university_is_having_a_career_expo_i_feel/,"So my university is having a career expo this Friday where a bunch of recruiters will be visiting the school hoping (I think) to hire people for internships and/or jobs. 


A little bit about me. I'm currently a junior. I recently transferred to this university a year ago. Before coming here, I attended community college where I was enrolled for a total of 6 semester (fall, spring, summer, and fall, spring, summer). During my 2 years at a community college I was uncertain what career to pursue. I wanted to do something related to the medical field, but after taking a few courses related to the medical field, I began to lose interest. To make a long story short, I was in my last semester (summer), and I somehow became friends with a guy who was pursuing an associates degree in game development. He pretty much sparked my interest in coding and I decided to teach myself the basics of C (Thanks CS50!). After the summer semester, I transferred to a university and I'm currently pursuing a B.S. in CS. 


During my 2 years at a community college my grades slowly started to slip and it continue to slip till I hit a brick wall last year during my spring semester. Hitting the brick wall made me realized that I needed to get my sh*t together or else. Right now I feel different. I'm more focused, and overall, I'm getting pretty good grades. 


So my concern is this: I currently know 3 programming languages so far. I'm not an expert or a coding prodigy in these 3 languages. All I know is the basics on how these languages work. I know that Algorithms and Data Structures is key part of an undergrads CS curriculum, but I haven't taken that course yet. I will next semester. Also, I don't have any work experience^I^have^helicopter^parents nor a decent GPA (my GPA is 2.50ish) and I'm 21 :p The only positive thing I have worth mentioning on my resume is volunteering hours that I accumulated this semester. I don't have any amazing projects that will blow these recruiters mind. I just have small projects (just 3) and I posted them on my github.


So r/cscareerquestions what are my chances in getting an internship? 


Do recruiters care about gpa?


Do they care how long it takes you to get your degree?


What are some tips/advice/criticism can you give me on talking to recruiters? 


Once again, thanks for your feed back!

I think the biggest things that are holding me back is my lack of internships (I worked crappy jobs over the summer because they gave me more hours so that I could pay for school) and my programming skills (I'm not horrible but I can't code a topological sort on the spot).

Since I don't want to be homeless after college, do you think I should just try to apply for an internship since they would be easier to get into and then hope they offer me a conversion?

I also emailed him to ask when I would expect to get an offer or not yesterday and he still hasn't replied back. At this point I have a good feeling I'm just being ghosted.

This was my only hope for getting a job. If I don't get it, I'm back at square one. There doesn't seem to be many new graduate/internship positions opening. Many internship positions won't even consider me because I've already graduated.

I feel like I'm at such a low point in my life right now. I feel like complete shit wasting my time day in and day out staying at home and not doing much. I honestly don't know what to do. At around 6 months in, I said okay,  I'm going to work on a personal project and practice some algorithms. I got a couple phone screens/interviews and they seemed to be going better but nothing seemed to be a good fit and it was down time with job openings. Now that jobs have ""opened"" I still wasn't really able to get many interviews because I've already applied and got rejected by most companies or they never reached out to me.

What should I even do? If I don't get this job, finding another opportunity could easily take 2-3 more months. My mom wants me to find work somewhere temporarily until I can get an actual software engineering job. But I honestly don't know what kind of job I can get at this point. It also looks as if I pursue this path, it might be even harder to get into software engineering in the future.

Ive been spending all my free time programming and reading books and trawling through all the reddit boards to find answers as well as working on a portfolio and a linkedin.

I just want to know anyones experience/opinion/ideas on open university without a secured job in the first place and whether it is widely recognised by all employers and holds the same value as a physical university such as Bournemouth,Portsmouth, Brighton, London etc those types of universities.

22, making $48k, soon going to be married. Early for some, I know. Not the point of discussion.

I held various IT roles since 17. First was an intern and helped with deploying workstations. Then moved up to being a tech at one of the schools. Worked for 3 years for the district. During the 3 years, I worked part time at local small business doing helpdesk items. Most I made was $25k/yr

Then I got invited to work at an MSP. Worked there for 2 years. Learned basic server administration, got A+ cert, Apple certs (since I’m more specialized on Macs). Started with $32k/yr then went up to $38k/yr

Then, I got invited to help launch a startup with a friend. There I did a little of software quality assurance. Mostly manually testing. I started taking courses to learn to automate but we ran out of funding and I was let go. Overall, spent 6 months there. I was paid $45k/yr

Now, I’m helping with marketing. I create email campaigns. I honestly don’t like what I’m doing here. I thought I did but it’s stressing me out beyond hell. I work from 5AM to 2PM, then spend an hour at 9PM prepping for the next day. Plus, with the fact that aren’t doing as good now as we did before in terms of revenue, it’s scary to think that I might be out of a job soon. I am being paid currently $48k/yr plus bonuses. 

I want to go back to IT. I’m done playing the startup game and living in uncertainty. Plus with the marriage soon, I need to be more stable financially. 

Apart of me wants to just go to school part time to get a BS of IT at WGU. I got a call scheduled with a enrollment next week to see if I can start in November. 

Then, a part of me wants to go back to IT. It’s safe, pretty stable. I hired a professional resume maker to rebuild my resume, cover letter, and LinkedIn profile. Hopefully it’ll help because I’m not getting call backs. 

How do I get out of this hole? I honestly don’t know what I’m doing at this point and it’s starting to suck. 

One positive is that I’m having dinner with my old boss from the MSP tonight and I know they are still hiring but I don’t want to go back to making $32k/year."

So on monday this week i started working again after 2 months of being unemployed. I make an internship as a janitor (better version of the job here in Switzerland) in a retirement home. The works I have to do are usually cleaning, mowing lawn or picking up leaves. 

I worked on myself alot during the last 2 months and ""put myself out there"" and generally improved overall! :D

So I go there and I'm usually in the same shifts as the cleaning women. They're about 10 women, all in their 30's or 40's, married and have children. They're also all very nice people.

Past me would be sitting alone at a table waiting for somebody to sit next to me and iniciate a conversation.

But I thought fuck it and tried to make another first-impression, not the past shy-nerd guy.
So I got myself a coffee and sat to the table where the cleaning women were. I didn't had a reason to do so, but I just did. I first talked with the only girl in my age. She's 23 and I'm 20. She's the youngest. We made smalltalk and I asked her how and where I had to write-in for lunch. She explained it to me. Then we had some more smalltalk and our break was over. She seems pretty interested in me but I can't really tell. I got to know that she also lives in the same city as me (we work in another one, I arrive by train and she does too). I asked her how long her shift exactly was and wich train she wants to take and asked if she would mind if I joined her. She accepted and we drove home after work and talked more. She was also really interested in getting to know me and what I've done before. She said she had a boyfriend and is now single again and enjoying it.
We continued talking in the breaks for the whole week again. Let's see where this is going :D

Also, when the cleaning ladies break is over I could stay a bit longer because I had to wait for my boss. I was sitting alone in the break-room which has an attached balcony. Some people were out there smoking cigarettes. Personally I don't smoke cigarettes but I thought again that an extrovert person would not spend the break alone. So I went outside and again talked to a few people. Even thought I was not smoking, they threated me alright.

Also when I met two of the cleaning women again on another floor later today they chatted me up and told me about their daughters. They also told me I'm very sympathetic / pleasant, they also appreciate my outgoing personality. Of course it was a huge confidence boost and it really made my day. Because I was always really unsure if people even notice my improvements and all. But at this new workplace I made a good first-impression.

Also the old people who work there like me too, I always chat with them when I see them walking around aimlessly or generally being bored. I even got some tip-money from an older lady for fixing her TV and being so nice to her.

It's really going very good right now. At first I was really not motivated for going to work because I was afraid I guess.
But now I'm working there and seeing other people enjoying my presence I'm kinda looking forward to going to work again.

So yeah, thanks for everybody who posts advice or helpful articles / videos on here. You're really helping and feedback is always appreciated :)

Just wanted to share my new work-life impressions with you all because without your help I probably would still be in my shell haha

Have a nice day everybody :-)

5689mj,1,2016-10-06,What is happening to me? Is it depression or anxiety?,Firefallon,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/5689mj/what_is_happening_to_me_is_it_depression_or/,"I have been worried about my mental health for a little while and just blew up on my roommates a couple of hours ago.

Let me first explain about my living situation. I go to university and I am living in a new city through a study abroad program until the end of the year. I go back to the main campus in January. I have already planned when I get home to get a cat, which I have always wanted but was never allowed to have living in my parents' home. I am really excited about getting the cat. In my current apartment, I have seven suitemates and of them, one roommate. I like three of them, including my roommate, and am starting to hate the other four. Unfortunately there's really nothing I can do about for the next three months. The other four never clean up after themselves and they use our stuff without even asking. These four all live in the same room. First, one or more of them clogged the toilet four times in our firstt two weeks of living together. Instead of plunging it or asking for help, they just filled the toilet with toilet paper and left it for days. They went away for a few days a couple of weeks ago and right before, they clogged our sink. I told them to fix it before they left, but they just left it there for someone else to clean. Then this past weekend, my roommate was gone and when she came back, she told me that the other four (it had to be one or multiple of them, because the other three of us were also away on separate trips) had used a quarter of her bottle of body wash and ate three of her hotdogs. They treat us like we're complete idiots, like we won't notice that our stuff is gone. Or maybe because there's so many of us living here they believe that we will never be able to guess who did it. Yesterday they cooked something and our two pots are really dirty. They just put them both in the dishwasher. I took them out and left a note saying that stainless steel pots are not dishwasher safe and they have to clean them by hand. A day later, the pots and my note have been pushed off into the corner of our counter. After seeing that, I just blew up on my roommate and other suitemate. I told them how I was feeling about these four and that I hate how they treat us like idiots or as if we're their maids and live to clean up after them. I was about to go yell at the four of them but I have been telling my mom about this and she says that if I do that they'll hate me and, because we go to the same university, they'll tell other people that I have anger problems or that I'm just a huge bitch (bc I asked them to clean up after themselves like adults).

Currently at my university, I go to a school that is notorious for its students being assholes. I love my school because until this semester, I have had friends who aren't assholes, but the people from my school who are here with me act like selfish children. They just support this stereotype of everyone from my school being assholes and when other people find out I'm from the same school, they're surprised. It just gets me so angry because I want to feel pride for my school, but right now I just can't.

In addition to all of this, I am in the middle of recruiting for a summer internship and am under a lot of pressure for that. Last year my internship was not very good and so I really need a good one this year. I am so scared that I am too mediocre, so because I haven't started taking classes for my computer science minor, I am trying to learn Java myself and am in the middle of programming a text-based game. Of course, I haven't taken a real comp sci class, so my game is pretty simple. I am also trying to learn how to program an app, but cannot figure it out. That's just making me feel stupid. I have a lot of aspirations for life and I feel like I'm slipping behind the expectations that I set for myself.

Right now, the thought that I keep having is that ""I want to go home."" I have this thought at least 10 times a day and I don't even know what it means because I don't want to go to my childhood home and I don't want to be in this apartment anymore. My suitemate was telling me about how exciting it was to be living in this new city, but I told her I couldn't wait to go back to our main campus (which is actually in a much bigger city, so it's not being in a city that I dislike). I told her that I just look back on memories of good times than actually experience the good times. She said that wasn't how I should feel about life and I believe that she is right. I think that I am just unhappy with how my life is right now and hope that it will be better in the future. Is this depression or anxiety? I don't think it's normal.

.

tl;dr I am studying in a new city and my roommates and classmates are driving me crazy. I am also under pressure to find a job and feel like I am not meeting expectations set for myself. I would rather look back on memories than experience the moments and I don't think that is how you're supposed to live life. Do I have depression or anxiety?"

Intended major(s): for Stanford, CS+English or Symbolic Systems or Political Science. if I ED Penn, I'd apply to the computer and cognitive science program with CS engineering as the backup. 


Academics: 

ACT: 36 (34 science, 36 essay) 
SAT: just took it last week for national merit purposes, probably won't send it unless they require all test scores or whatever or I get 1600
SAT II: 780 math II, 800 physics
Class rank: N/A
UW/W GPA: 3.954 UW, 4.954 W - roughly the hardest course load available, graduating class of maybe 750ish
Coursework: APs - APUSH, Macro, Am. Gov't, Lang, Calc BC, Chinese, Physics 2. (All 5s except Chinese, which was a 3 but it was the highest score that anyone in my class got other than the ethnically Chinese kids) 
Currently in Physics C, Multivariable Calc, Chem, Lit, CS. All other courses have been honors with the exception of creative comp, which I'm in right now (no honors version exists).

Awards: Scholastic Art and Writing National Gold Medalist and further selected for publication in their anthology (like 60 pieces out of a total 300,000 are chosen for the book), also a local writing contest, some Model UN stuff, National Merit, some other minor awards I may or may not include (so basically Scholastic &gt;&gt;&gt; everything else) 


Extracurriculars:
NSLI-y (a fully funded merit based scholarship by the US Department of State/Defense that sent me abroad for 2 months to focus on language and culture - I went to China, which is pretty much the only reason I even passed the AP test, since my school's program is so trash)
Co-President of MUN
Fencing  - not good enough to get recruited at any school I'd want to go to, but good enough to compete nationally
Intern at a congressional campaign 
Boy Scouts - working on eagle, been in it since 1st grade
Founded a robotics team at my school but it kinda died so I might not put this on apps
Percussion stuff - I'm in band and winter drumline and have been involved in a few rock bands (I think I might leave this off the activity section but write a supplement about the punk side of me since I think that might be kinda unique for these kinds of schools)
Writer for the newspaper (might tie this into creative writing or maybe not)


Schools: **Stanford REA or UPenn ED** and then Duke, Brown, Princeton, Northwestern, USC, Berkeley/UCLA(also in state in California), UIUC and maybe Yale and my parents want me to just try Harvard just because, so I might do that as well, although I don't really like Harvard tbh

Questions: Am I competitive enough at Stanford to warrant REA there? I don't really want to give up my chance at Penn ED if I'm a clear reject at Stanford, so I'd rather do Penn ED since Penn RD is a lot harder. I prefer Stanford to Penn but basically I'd rather go to Penn than my safeties, so if it makes sense to do Penn ED, I might do that. "

Recently I was extended an offer for Bloomberg's Summer 2017 SDE internship. There's not really anything for me to complain about - the compensation is excellent, I'm very excited about NYC, and the atmosphere seems quite good as well.


The thing that makes me hesitate is the weight of having ""Bloomberg"" on your resume, as opposed to Google, Microsoft, or something else. Bloomberg doesn't seem to be talked about much in this sub, or really, in tech in general. It's not even on Glassdoor's ""Top 25 tech companies to intern for 2015"". Most of the classmates that I've talked to *know* what it is, and that it's a good place to intern, but overall I'm wondering if an actual ""Big 4"" would end up carrying more weight and lead to more/better job offers after graduating.


Does anyone have any experience with this? Recruiters, is Bloomberg a tier below Amazon, Facebook, etc, on a new grad's resume? SDEs, is there extra prestige to those who come from ""Big 4"" internships as opposed to a place like Bloomberg? I'd really like to spend my summer in NYC, but if going somewhere like Microsoft would be more helpful further on down my career, then I'm not entirely sure. 


I am a junior, so this would be my last internship, hence my dilemma. It is one or the other (I haven't had any Big 4 internships yet, either)."
568q1n,1,2016-10-06,Taking an Internship Unrelated to Your Field?,SoleSoulSeoul,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/568q1n/taking_an_internship_unrelated_to_your_field/,"Hello everybody, 

I just attended my school's rather large annual STEM career fair, and was fortunate enough to get a call from a company the very next day. Normally this would be very exciting news, but the offer is somewhat unrelated to my major.

I'm a junior in CompE, and the offer is from [company] asking me to un-box and set-up PCs for new expansion buildings in the city where my university is located.

This seems more like an IT kind of thing, not to sound condescending to people who work IT, but it isn't exactly correlated with CompE whatsoever.

So my question is: what would you do in a situation like this? Is it too early to commit to an internship for next summer? Should I try to keep this offer on the back burner as long as possible? Being a junior and all, I would strongly prefer an internship more directly related to software/hardware engineering. 

Thanks in advance for any advice/stories of your own. :)"
569dg2,6,2016-10-06,"Let's talk about career growth, promotions and raises",bizzard4,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/569dg2/lets_talk_about_career_growth_promotions_and/,"I am from Canada, I did decent CS schools, got 7 internships in total (that a lot I know) and worked as a dev for 2 years.

For all my life, I was told that if you work hard you will get raises and promotions. After all of these different companies (5 in total), I never ever saw/hear a promotion or a proper raise (raise for new functions or because you do 80h a week). Annual raise are based on the average 4% + an Excel sheet from HR. Salary seem to be more and more standardized. Now, I don't believe in these concepts anymore.

But let me go further. The company I worked for 2 years closed because they weren't able to do a quality product on a hard market. I had 4 seniors colleagues, 2 with more than 20 years of experience in programming. I read often that there is a lot of demand for high experience. From their experience, it was true, but the problem is salary, they are just plain bad for people with experience. They all got away with around 15-20% salary drop. Now it will take again 5 years to get back to a competitive senior level salary.

This is all bad and sad, but here is the good. I saw numerous peoples getting better conditions or better salary by moving. I saw a lot of moving. When my company wan't going well, the betters left first and even got better condition. Now, this is what I believe in.

So, all of this make me think about when I was told to work hard. When I see a job offer with ""potential career growth"", in my head it is now categorized as ""bulls**t"". I don't believe in promotion and raise, they are just bait to make you work more for less. The real opportunities come from outside and that why it is so important to do good networking and keep in touch with your peers.

What do you think? Any experience? I want to hear your story."

I have an internship offer from company A and today is the deadline. I interned at company A last summer. Here are its pros:

* Company A is offering me a incredible salary for an internship (especially now that I'd be a 2nd year intern) that very few companies can match.
* Company A has an amazing internship program that I'd have no problem with doing again.
* Company A is not a tech company but I'd still be doing CS related work.
* Company A is my only internship offer.

However, here are my problems:

* I would NEVER work at company A full time, or the industry company A is in.
* I despise the location of company A.
* Interning at company A again would not make me any closer to my career goals, which is very important to me.

I am absolutely stumped. I've had interviews for internships at all the big 4, though haven't been able to get through the tough technical interviews and company A remains my only offer. I can't get another extension from company A - I have to make a decision today.

While it seems obvious that I should reject company A off the bat, it very well could be my only internship offer. Having no internship next summer would be absolutely detrimental to me. Any suggestions would be appreciated! "
56aku0,835,2016-10-07,"My partner &amp; I just crossed $100,000 in t-shirt sales – while working full-time jobs! Here's 10 things we've learned.",NO_LAH_WHERE_GOT,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/56aku0/my_partner_i_just_crossed_100000_in_tshirt_sales/,"This is the story of how [me](http://www.twitter.com/visakanv) and my partner Desmond created a six-figure ecommerce store entirely in our spare time while working full-time jobs. We did it by tapping into 2010's Singaporean pop culture just as it was beginning to emerge. 

**[Statement](http://www.statement.sg)** began as doodles in a notebook, and has since done some pretty cool things – showcases at design festivals, [regular features in local media](http://www.statement.sg/pages/about-us/) and a nice passive income stream for the two of us, as well as the opportunity to do all sorts of cool experiments we wouldn’t otherwise be able to do.

###Here are the lessons we’ve learnt along the way.

# Lesson #1: Start quickly by testing the smallest version of your idea

I’ve always been a little too perfectionist about most of my ideas, but in this case I was happy to mess around because I didn’t seriously think I had any chance of going anywhere with it.

So one day when I was a little bored, I decided to [post the ideas on Facebook to see what my friends thought of them](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150340477698915.356918.650823914&amp;type=1&amp;l=eab8a039f1).

On hindsight, this was a very important step, for several reasons:

* “Writing down” my idea to share it with others forced me to make it “real”.  Putting something out puts a stake in the ground for you to subsequently rework with. A crappy draft of an idea is more actionable than a perfect-but-imaginary one.
* Learning that people were interested in my idea motivated me to move forward. I didn’t have ANY of the skills needed to build or run a t-shirt company, and I definitely wouldn’t have felt motivated to learn them unless I knew that people were interested in buying what I had to offer.
* I got buy-in from the guy who’d become my partner. Having somebody else who’s also interested in driving your project forward makes it feel much, much more real.

# Lesson #2 – Get feedback and buy-in from customers ASAP

So great, now I had someone who wanted to help, and he had some visual design skills. He could help me do [mockups in things that weren’t MS Paint](https://www.facebook.com/visakan.veerasamy/media_set?set=a.10150540170793915.387113.650823914&amp;type=3).

These got us from “hey, those are pretty cool ideas, I’d probably wear something like that” to **“How much is this t-shirt and when can I get it?”**

Knowing that people wanted to actually buy these theoretical t-shirts got us motivated to figure out the t-shirt printing process. I don’t think we’d have bothered to go through all the hassle otherwise (and it would’ve been tragic if we did that, only to then print t-shirts that nobody wanted.)

# Lesson #3 – Learn from others in your field – they know more than you and can help you out.

**Ask, ask, ask.**

How do you go from an idea to having actual t-shirts printed? We didn’t know, so we decided to ask someone. Specifically, we sought out an older acquaintance who already had some experience selling t-shirts, and bought him dinner in exchange for his thoughts. He not only shared his experiences (successes and missteps), he gave us the contact to his t-shirt printer!

Note: Please don’t be self-obsessed when you do this. What’s in it for them? How much time will you need? What exactly do you want to ask them about? What questions do you need answered? Show that you’ve done your research. And pay for the drinks or food.

**Be visible**

This would happen again and again in the history of our business: We’d be selling t-shirts at some flea market and have someone approach us offering to re-sell our products, or feature us in some publication. Some of these folks have gone on to become critical partners in our business – our best resellers and our current printers were all people we met in person while selling t-shirts at some event or another.

So ask people out to coffee. Talk to suppliers, vendors, event organizers – and get to know them personally, ask them for their opinions, be genuinely curious. They will have all sorts of interesting information for you. One of our resellers opened our eyes to the wonders of courier shipping, saving us a ton of trouble.

# Lesson #4 – Start exchanging product for cash as quickly as you can

**We literally started out selling t-shirts directly through messages on a Facebook page.** We didn’t have nice pictures or a “Shop” segment when we were starting out, but still managed to sell hundreds of t-shirts.

We would get messages from people on Facebook and we would track their orders in a Google Sheet. It took us a while to figure out the concept of an SKU – we just used different rows and columns for different sizes!

This worked fine when we were selling a few t-shirts a week, and it was possible to respond to everybody on Facebook. But once we started getting dozens of t-shirts a week, we realized it wasn’t going to be sustainable, and so we set up a “proper” ecommerce store on Storenvy.

Getting cash from your first sale is a huge rush, and the sooner you get it the better – because it’ll compel you to do more. The longer you defer this, the likelier you are to get bogged down with details.

# Lesson #5 – Focus on a niche

I never set out to be a “Singaporean” brand – I just wanted to make t-shirts that I liked. But it just so happened that some of the t-shirts I wanted had a local flavor to them, and those were the t-shirts that resonated resoundingly with people.

So we followed the money and doubled down on that, making more and more t-shirts in the style that our customers wanted (while continuing to establish our overall brand),

The litmus test is this: **what can I say to one person about my t-shirts that would get them excited enough to tell somebody else about it?**

# Lesson #6 – Celebrate your customers and they’ll adore you for it

This came very naturally to us – we were very excited to see that people liked our t-shirts enough to post pictures of themselves wearing them, so we were eager to share and celebrate that success with the rest of our page, as well as on Instagram.

We started getting a lot of word-of-mouth. People would literally ask their friends on Facebook “Hey, where’d you get that shirt?”, and the wearer would tag us in the comments, and we’d get an order (or five) from the friend.

# Lesson #7 – Prioritize a few essential things

You DON’T need to do EVERYTHING. There are a lot of extensive guides available online with a massive list of all the possible things that you could do. But it’s entirely possible to make several thousand bucks with just Facebook messages and a Google spreadsheet.

You don’t need to be on all the channels – it’s much better to focus on one or two channels and really build great relationships with customers there, than to try and be everywhere all at once.

One thing we did always prioritize was giving our customers the best experience we could. In the early days, we’d  often go out of our way to help people with replacements and urgent deliveries if possible. We couldn’t sustainably scale that, but it definitely made an impression on our earliest customers and got us a lot of positive word-of-mouth.

# Lesson #8 – Value your time, pay for useful services.

We also setup a proper ecommerce store to save us the trouble of having to manually enter sales data – we started out on StoreEnvy because it’s free, and then moved to Shopify because we wanted more features and functionality.

With the benefit of hindsight, we’d have gotten onto Shopify earlier – we were uncertain and broke so we were very skeptical of spending any sort of money, but the time and energy it would’ve saved us would’ve been worth the cost. Having all the customer data managed for you in an accessible way ALONE is more than worth the cost. Having “proper” business expenses also has a psychological effect of making it “serious”.

Things we’re glad we paid for, and wish we paid for sooner: Shopify, WaveApps, Receiptful.

# Lesson #9 – Delegate! Figure out tasks that other people can do for you, and compensate them for it.

When we started getting more orders than we could handle, we ended up hiring interns to help us out. We felt awkward at first – are we employers? Do we know how to manage other people? We basically copied what the best practices were at work – we used a Trello board to keep track of all the tasks we wanted to do, and we had fortnightly 1-1s with our interns.

Different interns brought different things to the table. One helped us do photoshoots with their friends as models. Another helped to codify our processes and customer service protocol into Google docs.

# Lesson #10 – Write down your partnership agreement, and manage all your bills and paperwork properly, and do weekly or monthly reviews.

**Seriously, write down all your shit**

This is something we DIDN’T do, and regret. Just because you’re running a side-business doesn’t mean you can be totally lazy about it. We each put in a couple of hundred dollars to pay for the first round of t-shirts, and thought it would probably make us a couple of thousand bucks – negligible amounts we could write off. So we didn’t bother much with keeping track of the paperwork. But it’s grown to over $100,000, and figuring out all the accounting inconsistencies was a nightmare. We've actually lost several thousands this way (paying for things we didn't need and so on). Painful lesson learned! 

**Have good meetings regularly**

We also didn’t meet as often as we should’ve, which meant that our business grew more slowly than we’d have liked. Having regular meetings also helps you get re-aligned on multiple things – why does your company exist? How are you making progress towards your goals? Asking these questions is a great way to stay focused and motivated. You don’t need to have meetings that go on for hours – a quick 20 minutes catchup with your co-founder can make all the difference.

# Questions I got from friends on Facebook:

## When should you set up a formal business entity?

You don’t need to set this up from day 1 – that’s just a tedious distraction from the most important thing, which is making sure that people want to give you money for whatever you’re making. 

My recommendation is that you start thinking about it once you’ve made about a thousand dollars. In our case, we didn’t bother until we needed a company bank account to receive payment from some particular vendor.

## Should you use accounting software, apps, etc?

Yes! It took us way too long to bother with this because we were trying to keep our costs low, but this is a bad place to try to cut costs. 

Keeping rigorous track of your invoices is crucial – it gives you peace of mind, it helps you understand your business better, etc.

## How do you run meetings?

There’s a lot of meeting hate in the world, but it’s really bad meetings that are bad. Effective meetings can be short, snappy, energizing and even exciting. We resolve things together and we have new ‘next actions’ to drive the business forward.

## How do you move forward when you don’t know what you’re doing?

Seriously – just try something. Ideally you'd have a list of ideas, and a framework for prioritizing those, but if you're feeling stuck, just go with whatever you feel like doing! **Do what you're curious about and excited by, it's a critical part of staying motivated.** 

We never really bothered doing any serious marketing – we took a lot of pride in spending as little time and energy as possible on the project. But looking back, we could’ve done more even with the little time that we spent, by being a little more focused. 

Now we have to figure out what the next wave of products will be – which is a fascinating intellectual challenge – but we could’ve extracted more value, which would’ve given us more $$ – which we can then deploy towards interesting projects of our choosing.

## What did you learn from your customers?

**IRL:**

When we were selling t-shirts at flea markets, we initially tried to persuade people to buy t-shirts for themselves. Those people rarely needed much persuading – they either immediately noticed something they wanted, or they’d just scan everything idly and move on. We noticed, however, that quite a few groups of friends would point at some t-shirt or other and say, “Haha, that’s so John!”, or “This is totally Sally!”

We realized that people liked buying gifts for friends, and so we changed our pitch from “See anything you like?” to “Do any of these remind you of our friends?” We started converting people much better, and this influenced how we sell.

**Online:**

We'd often get emails saying things like, ""Can I get this within this week? It's for my brother's birthday party on Saturday"", or ""It's to wear to my class reunion on X date"" – which gave us a much better sense of the ""Jobs-to-be-done"" aspect.

I am talking to my advisor about changing into IST or Data Science and she told me that I would have to take 110, 210, and 220 and I can be accepted into the IST Development major.

I am able to take all 3 next semester but I am not sure how difficult it will be. I passed all the CS ETM classes with flying colors and have already had a software development internship last summer if that helps gauge how much I understand the CS curriculum.. I didn't get into CS because I had bad grades in Calc1 and 2 and physics 211 and 212..

Any advice or has anyone been in my shoes before??"

56cnby,45,2016-10-07,"[NC] My wife was fired, probably legally, but then given a large severance package",help_me_throw123,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/56cnby/nc_my_wife_was_fired_probably_legally_but_then/,"I apologize for the wall of text, I just want to make sure that all the important details are captured.

My wife, Jen (not her real name), worked for a small non-profit owned by a husband and wife. I think they employed 8 people. It fluctuated a bit over the years but it was definitely less than 10. My wife was their director of operations, thus in charge of most of the logistics of the non-profit. The only reason I mention this is because a lot of what happened was during off-hours, so not during the regular working day. I don't know if this matters.

In June, the couple hired an unpaid intern from a local college. After a fundraiser in July, my wife went back to the office to drop off some things. When she got to the office, she found the male owner sitting in his office with the intern. Jen thought it was strange, but she didn't say anything to them other than wish them a good night. The only reason it was odd to her is because she commonly would be in the office after hours but it was not common for the owner, and there was no reason for the intern to be there.

At the end of July, Jen did walk in on the owner and the intern behaving inappropriately. The intern tried to talk to my wife about it later but Jen told her in no uncertain terms it was none of her business and she didn't want to know about it. I know my wife struggled with this, she wanted to talk to the intern and tell her it might be better not to start an office romance with her boss but at the same time, my wife is not the kind of person to stick her nose into these kinds of things. 

A few days later, the owner approached Jen and denied that what she saw was inappropriate, it was a misunderstanding, and implored her not to say anything about the incident to anyone. She reiterated it was none of her business. This is when Jen started to feel uncomfortable because if there was nothing going on, why would it matter, right? Anyway, again, she's not the kind of person to gossip in the first place.

In August, they (the owners) hired the intern on as part-time staff.

In mid-September, they have a big fundraiser. The night before, Jen locked up the office and had left when someone called for a last minute emergency. She turned her car around to go back to the office and found the now part-time employee and her boss in a very inappropriate situation.

She was disturbed but she followed through with the fundraiser. She was planning on handing in her 2 weeks notice that Monday but before she could, her boss called on Sunday and fired her. I think that's all on the up-and-up, correct? He didn't give her a reason for the firing and Jen didn't ask. I think she was a bit shell shocked. Even if he did fire Jen for catching him in the act with the former intern/now employee, that's still legal, correct?

The part that makes us uncomfortable is that the owner sent Jen a check for ""severance"" earlier this week. It's a good chunk of money and it's from his personal account, not the business account. To me, this feels like hush money. We haven't cashed it and I am not sure if we even should.

Should I be looking for a lawyer? I don't even know what I would do with a lawyer. Check to make sure the ""severance"" pay is actually what it is?"

I have done a few programming courses, python for business purposes and R from JHU in Coursera. I have done several information technology courses too as well as statistics, applied linear programming models and quantitative methods(mostly SPSS and linear regression).

 I had an interest in Data Science, hence the R from Coursera, and i've a one month internship in a big4 in their data &amp; analytics department. It was a small department, about 5 people (the building had about 500 hundred people, mostly auditors), and they used SAS so i was not able to help them and do something big enough. 

Anyway, i understood that my CS knowledge was lacking big time and i decided to do a masters degree. I want to do it distance learning because i dont want to live my country and i dont really like the programs they offer here. I found the Georgia Tech masters which seems legit and good but i dont know what i should do to accept me since i dont have a good enough programming background. I will choose their ML specialization which is mostly python and java as i have been told and i could do some MOOCs on them to be ready, but my background is still lacking and i might not get accepted for that. 

Is there anything short-term i could do, maybe MOOCs or distance learning diploma/associates ? Maybe a semester or two at the worst case scenario. Doing a full bachelors in CS is not viable.

Thank you if you have read this!

tl;dr i want a CS background for a masters, anything i can do to get a CS background without a bachelors. preferably distance learning or MOOCs "
56dfzz,2,2016-10-07,"Recent MS grad considering major career shift, what are my options? Is my plan reasonable?",FedorianGray,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/56dfzz/recent_ms_grad_considering_major_career_shift/,"Hi all,
I recently graduated in May with my MS in Clinical Mental Health Counseling. I majored in psych for my under grad, and realized that I loved the idea of doing research and teaching at a university level, so I applied to several Ph.D programs in the area. Not wanting to leave the area severely limited my options, and I was reject from all of the schools to which I applied. As a back-up, I applied to the counseling program at my school, thinking if all else failed, I could get my MS in counseling, work as a counselor for a few years, and then go back for my Ph.D with more work and life experience (keep in mind, I was a naive 21 year old when I was thinking this through).
Despite some glaring signs that this program may not be right for me (feeling like i was wasting my potential, lack of interest in a lot of the course material, utter disdain for others in my program, etc.), I progressed through this masters program, and did exceptionally well. I interned at my school's counseling center, where I had established great relationships during my time as a student aide there. My internship allowed me to work with a lot of independence, so I took on a heavy caseload of clients, and was met with moderate success. All of this led to me being offered a position in the center, pending my graduation. Dream come true, right?

I graduated in May and began working. It did not take long for me to begin feeling very lost and anxious. Working with a new supervisor proved to be far more difficult than I thought. We had some unfortunate interactions, and I quickly lost all confidence in my ability to be successful as a counselor in this environment. I left this position a few weeks ago, and have been doing some serious soul searching since. Truth be told, although I love the mental health field and believe it to be incredibly worthwhile, I do not know if I am the right person to be working in it. I have mental health issues of my own, and I question my own ability to patient and compassionate in the long-run. I am now looking at my options, both short and long term.

As of right now, I do not want to return to clinical counseling. I do like working in higher education, and have applied to several positions in the local universities. I have applied to things like admissions counselor, academic support, disability coordinator, and even a handful of administrative positions, just to secure some employment. I worry as to whether or not any of these will come to fruition. I have very limited work experience: I worked in retail as an undergrad, then worked in an inpatient addiction treatment facility during grad school. I also have my internship experience, which I also count as work experience because part of my time as an intern was paid. I guess my first question is, are there things I am missing regarding my current job search? I would love to work in higher ed, and I believe I am qualified for student support services given my counseling background and experience in working with students. Outside of working at a university, can anyone offer other suggestions? I have considered HR, but all of those positions seem to require prior HR experience.

Second, has anyone else been in a similar situation? It absolutely kills me that I spent years in master's program for something that I may not actually want to do. The sad thing is, so many people have told me that I am good at clinical counseling work and that I have a bright future. I just do not feel like my heart is in it. I am buried in student debt right now (about 80k), and I feel sick that I took so much on and now have these feelings. Has anyone else gone through something similar with regard to graduate work?

Finally, I am giving some thought to entering another field of study. This may be more a question for r/askacademia, but I will throw it in here as well. I mentioned that research was my original passion. While a Ph.D seems like a bit much given my life situation, I have given some thought to a career in statistics. I have always loved working with numbers and data, and I have been told that a career in institutional research and advancement within higher ed would not be out of the realm of possibility. Does anyone have any thoughts about that? My concern is my very limited math background. I took Calc I, Stats for Psych, and Intro to Educational Research (graduate course).

I know there are a lot of questions packed into this post. I have read a lot of other posts in this sub and am amazed at how thoughtful and supportive other posters can be. Any perspective, advice, or insight into any part of my situation would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all so much!"

I know it's a prestigious field and everything, but I still hear stories about how extracurricular/experience is just as important, if not more important than your academics. I was pretty lazy my first year + some personal issues I had, so I had 0 experience in anything outside of academics that first year.

This school year, I want to start changing that. I want to start with club experience/projects then try to get into an internship. I have been presented many opportunities so far, but almost all of them, I feel as if I don't qualify. There was a South California Edison open house fair nearby, but I felt discouraged to go because I'm barely into my ECE courses. They were offering internships in summer 2017, but I don't think I know enough stuff to start working in the field (I only started taking core classes this year because I was originally a mechanical engineering major, but changed into ECE). There is also the IEEE micromouse competitions, but again, I feel like it is too advanced for me. 

I feel like if I keep holding back like this, by the time I do finally go out to do something because I have the ""experience"" and academic knowledge for it, it might be too late. 

So, I was just wondering r/ECE, what was/is your extracurricular life like? For those who already graduated, how helpful was extracurricular in helping you find and work in the field? And how many projects/internships/competitions/etc do you think will make a student ""stand out""? Thanks!

What should I do?",-puss-in-boots-,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/56hpy4/i_want_to_continue_my_education_but_my_ideal_job/,"My education and work background - 

I graduated from my university with an Associate’s degree in laboratory science last year. I wanted to continue and receive a Bachelor’s but there were several circumstances (money etc) so I couldn’t continue school since then. I’ve been in between jobs for a while, and I've been searching for a job for months. Now, it’s a total of about a year with no employment, aside from a 3-month contract. Most of the hundreds of job applications I’ve submitted required at least a high school diploma or an Associate’s degree, but I’ve had no luck despite the fact that I have work experience in a laboratory for a total of about a year (internship and one temporary laboratory job). 

My fiance is a second-year student at one of the best universities in the state we reside in to study a science major. There are many colleges and universities in our area, and I’m interested in attending one of them. I’m planning to study environmental engineering or environmental science, depending on the major each university has, starting hopefully next fall. When I researched the universities, I realized that they only offer day classes for my major. I might have no choice but to take day classes here.

Because I don’t have a Bachelor’s and have been unemployed for so long, I will be having two trainings related to my career at a community college starting soon. The first training will take a couple weeks and the second training will be several weeks. The second training will be completed by the end of the year. I will finish both trainings and receive certifications. That’d help me to have more job opportunities.

What I feel conflicted about -

I will be starting one job soon, since this is the only offer I’ve gotten so far, but this job is not related to my career goal. I would be a relief counselor for the disabled. Although, there are a few reasons why I’m considering this job. For one, the schedule is flexible such that I can make my own schedule, which will easily accommodate my academic schedule when I start school. I also can control my hours. Plus, this company would reimburse a portion of the tuition every semester. I’m wondering if taking this job can hurt my career path because I won’t be gaining experience in a laboratory and in science concepts because I might have this job for a few years as I complete my bachelor's.

He is extremely smart, but a lot of the stuff he says is often not very relevant to a problem in trying to solve, or something I know already or can figure out on my own. On top of that his voice is very monotone, he always stands uncomfortably close, doesn't like to shower, and sounds very patronizing. I'm not a jr dev, but I feel treated like an intern, I'm worried this will impact my chances of getting promoted here.

On top of that I usually ask a question on the system while I'm 'in the zone' coding, and his 40 minutes of monologue completely interrupt that work, i forget where I've left off and what i was doing in the first place.

So, this summer I did an internship at one of the top companies(one of Google, Facebook, Amazon, Uber, Palantir) and they recently told me they won't be extending an offer for an internship next year.

The feedback was that I did well, my project was completed and I'm a fast learner but I've been unenthusiastic about my project and I had been actively avoiding networking events.

And I have to mention something. I killed myself at that job. My life for 3 months was literally just work and giving my best, staying overtime to make sure I do a good job and do whatever it takes to make them want me back.

My manager told me I was doing great, my mentor in the end told me the project turned out really well, another member of the team was raving about it to a colleague and told me several times that he really liked it and that I had a talent for building stuff.

And getting a rejection left me in absolute frustration, self doubt, anger and I'm also getting depressed.

And the thing is, I didn't expect a rejection at all. Every two weeks I met with my manager and every single time I was asking him how I'm doing and if I should work on improving anything. I was ready to do whatever it takes since I really wanted the job.

On every meeting my manager basically said ""just keep on doing what you're doing"". Noone ever pointed out to me there was a problem and I should adjust. I just took my manager's word for it and kept on working hard and making sure my project was rock solid.

One thing I did bring up, though, was that they gave me a project that used technologies I was least interested in (we had to submit a survey with preferences) as an unfortunate turn of events. My manager was also an obvious Python fanboy and several times I showed my lack of interest in it. Nonetheless, I picked it up and wrote some cool working scripts in a couple of days and fulfilled all of my manager's given Python tasks.

Overall, I'm still mad noone ever told me there was a problem when apparently there was. I feel kinda betrayed by my manager as I thought he appeared to be a nice guy and cared at least a lil' bit about me and my future. Once in a conversation he mentioned that he ""doesn't care"" whether we, the interns, in his team will work at [company name] or not, so that moment struck me quite heavily.

When the recruiter told me the feedback was that I was unenthusiastic I was mentally like ""WTF is this bullshit?!?! This project was my life, WTF?!"". I also attended 90%+ of the intern events/parties and had a blast, yet they tell me I was ""actively avoiding networking events"". Like, that's not even true. WTF?!?!?!

As a summary, I feel betrayed by my manager who never told me there was anything wrong, by my mentor (they agreed to give me a recommendation and after my internship it's been a radio silence, like why say yes to me only to ignore me after? I thought their word meant something :( ), also that I'm no good since I gave my best and still didn't make the cut :(.

Could you give me some advice that I can take? Something to releave my frustration? I'm seriously burning out and going into a downward spiral, my mind is going crazy over how and why I fucked up :/

I have a strong desire to go to grad school for mathematics and I aspire to earn a professorship or some kind of job in academia. My current program offers co-op rotations, where you alternate semesters of academic classes and paid internships with a company related to your major. The money I earn from this is essentially keeping me from committing to a major switch to pure math as it pretty much pays for all of my living expenses. 

In essence, what sort of steps should I take now as someone halfway through my coursework for a BS in CompSci looking to go all the way with math? I'm taking time during my co-op rotations to self-study math courses outside my major in order to prepare myself better, but I'm kind of riding blind here. My academic adviser sort of laughed me off for asking about grad school this early on, so I'm really looking for any advice. 

What sort of things should I study? What are my chances of getting into a good mathematics program as a CS major?

If I pass all of my classes this quarter, I should have my Computer Science degree by December. At this point I am somewhat anxious and uncertain about what it is going to be like finding a job. I had an internship last year for something that was more electrical engineering related. My supervisor called me and the other intern (EE major) in afterwards and offered possible employment after college. I haven't heard from him since so am a bit doubtful of that. The other intern also took another job. They might be offering the internship program again so I might go for that if possible. One intern participated in the program twice and believe he was hired after the second time.

I have also worked on websites (developed and manage one on my campus as well) for about 7 years now or so. A big part of me really likes programming even though I have classmates who are better than me at it. Most jobs I look at require 5+ of experience with Java and such. Does this most likely mean that they do not want recent grads to apply?

It also seems like my friend who graduated from the same school as me can possibly get me into where he works. However, it is quite far away so I would have to move.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated."

I have been having an internal dialogue with myself the past few days and thought you all could offer some valuable insight to my situation.   
  
I am currently a CS student getting ready to transfer out of my local CC to (hopefully) Cal Poly SLO next year. I have some technical work experience that's a bit scattered - UX Design assistant, Apple Genius Bar, Geek Squad - and I am currently working at a local software company assuming an IT role. My official title is ""Technical Support Specialist"" but I am pretty much the IT department for this small company. Based on my work experience this seems a logical path for me, however, being a CS student I am a bit conflicted that I will get stuck in the Sysadmin/IT role during and after my education.  
I want to ease into Software Development and I am at a point in my position that I either continue to put in increased effort to be the best I can in this role, or I put my energy into looking for internships that are actually related to software development.  
  
  
The company I currently work for mentioned they are open to having me shadow or intern for their full time software developer over the summers - but this has changed because staffing changed. The full time software developer was let go and they have since hired intern(s). I like the company I work for, but I just don't want to get stuck doing IT/sysadmin work when I want to be in software development. The company has let me know they are willing to pay for necessary training for me (currently going through AWS certification process - paid for by company) in relation to my current role, but I don't know if I want to put all of my energy into this type of work when I could be working on getting a software dev internship elsewhere. I understand this type of experience can be valuable in the tech field and even in relation to software development, but I don't want supplemental experience...I want experience in what I am studying.  
  
I have been thinking about bringing this concern up to my employer, but I don't even think I am qualified for an internship position in software development should they suggest that as an option. I am a quick learner, but have only had one class in C++, one in Java, and my most recent was Game Programming (using Visual C#) - our software is built using Visual Studio C#. I suppose it's worth mentioning I passed each course with an A. In the event my company says ""sure! great idea! you can apply for software dev intern"" i don't think i would be a suitable candidate. I would require a lot of training and patience.  
  
Do you guys think I should bring this up to my employer? Should I just keep on keepin' on? Should I look outside of my company for an internship? 
 
TL;DR: CS student at CC currently IT/Sysadmin at local software company. Want to assume a role more relevant to my education (Software dev intern, etc). What should I do?"

Here goes my stories. Two weeks ago I was interviewed for a 2D artist position. They asked me to do a test and I passed it. However, they are currently recruiting for a cartoon-ish style game and I am more about realism. After considering, the 2D director did not hire me but the other guy, a 3D director hired me. @@ (That's bloody weird)

I have no background in 3D modelling except for a bit simple structure design using an ultra simple program. So it was weird that they design to hire me for a 3D position.

I feel really bad and always want to go home at soon as I get to the company, sit down and stare at an object for 10 hours long. My previous job was teaching so I had a lot of time and freedom. Now, I am almost locked inside an office for a whole day.

I don't know if I am risking and wasting all my time to do this job which will takes me a lot more time to be good and ready for the job. I like art and all but 3D modelling is more like to repeat some one else concept into an object than being creative on your own. And the best thing I can do for now is concept design. 

Throw me a "" Give me 10 characters in 2 days"" I'm happy to draw them. But for modelling every line, point, shape carefully to very detail, nah I can't.  

So, yesterday, the assistant talked to me personally and explained that at the end of October, they will evaluate me. If I pass, more training to do. If I fail, they will likely transfer me to another place where I will receive basic training with NO payment. Which is WORST than being fired. Why? You can move on, find a new job and have more time to do it. But if you get transferred, you will stuck there full time anyway. 

The training in the other place does not appear on the contract but the contract does require me to work for them for 3 years including training time. 

One more thing, the 2D director still says that he might need me in the future so when time come, he will ask the HR to transfer me to his department. But until then, I will stuck with 3D training.

TL;DR:

- Got interview a 2D job, get a 3D position which I have zero experience
- Require me to do training course, long and stressful.
- I feel like I'm up for drawing, not making 3D sculpture
- If I fail to impress them in 1 month, I would likely be transfer to another place to train without payment for 4 months.

Pros:

- I get paid to learn something new
- First full time job I ever have
- Some new connection in the art/game field
- Good company and benefit

Cons:

- Low intro salary
- Lose my usual freedom
- Things I learn not suitable for me and my characteristic (I asked my art tutor and other experienced artists, they said yeah not suit ya mate)
- Lose time with my family because I usually go home at 10PM and start again at 7AM
- Contract requires me 3 years
- Feeling kinda depressed while others 3,4 years artist get yelled at by the supervisor. I don't know how long it would take me to master it. 
- If got transfer, I have to train without payment for at least 4 months

Question:
 I am awaiting the 1 month deadline so they reevaluate me. Scenarios are:

- They agree I have what it take:

+ Should I pick up and continue training, intern? Or tell them I am not up to it and quit? (Which may get me some fine over terminating the contract)

- They told me go hang out with the less cool group without payment.

+ Because this not in contract, should I told them I can't do it and process to leave?

The irony is if I quit and the 2D director needs me, it would look bad that I give up early. But I feel like I'm not up for the job so I really want to take off and return to my happy old self too. Should I wait for an opportunity in 2D or I just process to quit if they transfer me? And if I continue training/intern, it would take me maybe 6-12 months to be good at it. And thinking about it kills me inside. 

Please HELP 

Cheers guys

I was looking at the list the other day and got really scared so I started looking for some safety schools. I am applying for computer science and my list right now has schools like Cornell, Georgia Tech, UIUC, UCs, etc. Anyway, here is my profile. (I'm from India BTW)



SCORES



-ACT = 34 (Eng=35,Math=35,Reading=34,Science=30)

-TOEFL = 113 (Reading=29,Listening=29,Speaking=28,Writing=27)

-I have also given 2 subject tests (Math 2 and Physics) . I haven't received their scores yet though.



INTERNSHIPS




-I did an internship with Mccann. Worked with a designer there and made various prototype web designs for companies 
like Samsung, Hero, etc. Also went to the Google office with one of the representatives at Mccann for the Web Rangers Initiative

-Interned at Rashtrapati Bhavan ( The presidential estate of India, equivalent to the White House? ) while they were 
setting up their smart city plan with IBM



COMMUNITY SERVICE



-Worked with Helpage India for 30 hours doing field and office work for them

-Helped out at Samagam ( a community of aged people at Rashtrapati Bhavan ). Also conducted a survey there about how they interact with technology and wrote an article about it which was published online in 2 nationally recognized news websites.

-Went on the Shodh Yatra. It's a journey on foot which spanned from Ayee to G0a, which is about 132 km or 82 miles. We went from village to village looking for innovations at the grassroots level and gave various presentations and everything throughout. Prof. Anil Gupta (a famous professor from IIM Ahmedabad) was the supervisor of the trip and we went along with him.



OTHER STUFF



-Played various percussion instruments in school assemblies

-Like to perform magic tricks for my friends and family (put on little shows for them once in a while)

-Took singing lesson for 4 years but was super shy so never performed anywhere

-Was the head of the organizing committee of MODEM (a computer science symposium held out my school) for 2 years

-Also created the modem website with a few friends (modem16.com)

-Used to play basketball for the school team in grades 4 and 5 (I know that was a long time back) but had to leave the team as my parents moved away from school and it was tough for me to go early in the morning for practices. I still play basketball though and follow the NBA and stuff

-I also write a tech blog with 2 other friends but it's not very famous (zamkato.com)



GRADES (this section is really bad)



-Class 9 CGPA (out of 10) = 8.8
-Class 10 CGPA (out of 10) = 9.4
this is where it gets bad
-Class 11 percentage = 82%
-Class 12 percentage = 74%

I have no explanation for this fall in my grades other than the fact that I am a lazy POS.


Anyway, that's my stuff. Do you have any safeties in mind for me? 
I really appreciate your help, please add any other universities that you think that I might have a good chance for.
Financial aid would be great but it is not necessary.

Thanks :D

I have been in school since February, my previous employer of 8 years downsized and I decided to take advantage and chase my passion. I just want a chance to get in but I keep finding work that requires previous experience for a an entry level position.

I feel confident I can handle plenty of entry positions because I have troubleshooted PCs all my life (33 yrs old) using Windows 98, Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 10 and Love being on Server 2012 R2 because that's all we used in school. I also currently finished a 4 month internship at school in which they offered upon completion a program to choose, I selected Sec+ but it's a boot camp and I currently work a temp job to pay the bills and have no time for it. 

As for Active Directory experience, in my two MSCA/MSCE courses we create VMs everyday, we create users and give them specific access using group policies. I'm also in the process of building a pretty nice computer in which I plan on creating a separate boot for server 2012 in which i look to practice different labs like using Linux and Ubuntu.

I got myself certified in A+ thinking it would open up a chance but in Miami, the competition is huge. It seems I need my N+ and be working on MCSA to get a entry position.

I'm a sophomore in CS, and like everyone else, I'm looking to get some experience before graduation. I had an internship lined up this summer, but the employer reneged and left me without an internship in the middle of the summer. I ended up teaching myself Swift and made an iOS app with some friends. 

However, this time around I won't have that kind of freedom, because I'm studying abroad in Japan this summer (our summer in the US is their spring semester) so I'll have to take a semester off here in the States. During this time (Jan. to about the end of March) is there anything I can do (presuming internships aren't offered around this time because I haven't seen any?) I'll be mostly free during this time except for the fact that I'm taking a course at my local CC to keep busy. 

In short, can I do anything with this? If not, is there anything else I can teach myself/ do myself that would have the same educational/wow factor to show off to potential employers? 

Thanks everyone, and good luck. "

Are there any tips for Canadians that did the move to the US? Some facts about me:


- Degree from a not well-known school and a low overall GPA. Although my last year 10 courses GPA is around 3.15
- Had internships during school
- Been working since I graduated
- In total, 1.5 years of experience doing software development
- All startup positions. This means I got a breadth of knowledge. But not necessarily learned the best practices from senior engineers.


I want to move because Seattle seems like a very lucrative city for software developers. In Canada, the major cities would pay me about 50000-65000. This includes Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, and Ottawa. 


I'm also looking to experience a new lifestyle. Currently really bored of living in a small city. I want to meet a wide variety of people and live the city life for a while.


Some specific questions:
-  What type of Visa should I apply for? From what I understand there is the H1-B class which is more versatile but takes longer to get. Then there's the NAFTA designated Visa that is less versatile but easier to get.
- Should I look at just getting a software job in Seattle? Do I have any right to be picky?  


All advice is welcome. "
56oesb,8,2016-10-09,Personal info along with accusations of stealing posted on Facebook. Now people are messaging potential employers and threatening my brother.,JustTryingToHelp1234,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/56oesb/personal_info_along_with_accusations_of_stealing/,"Hello,

Today a member of my family posted a story accusing my brother of stealing and trespassing to a group dedicated to ""exposing theft"". The post contained 2 pictures of my brother (Taken from a deer cam) as well as a screen shot of his personal facebook page.    

The deer cam pics were taken at an airsoft event held on our property 2 years ago. (There is even a date on the bottom right corner of the picture). Due to it being an airsoft event my brother is dressed accordingly. (Camo, some airsoft gun etc.)    

The post bascially said 'This trespasser stole from me twice! I busted him once, but im sure he got me a second time. He will steal from anyone!!!'


Please keep in mind that my brother is currently trying to become a firefighter, and just landed a really nice internship at a pretty big fire department.     

Soon after the post was made, people started to threaten my brother via messanger, and even message fire departments all around our area and tell them about how he is ""unfit to serve"" and how they should not hire him.   

Now my brother has to go to the fire department tomorrow to meet with the chief and explain everything thats going on.    

This post was made because my family is currently having a feud with each other over property. (Stupid I know.. But it has gotten out of hand)


I was wondering what we could do, or if there is some sort of legal action we could take because this has the possibility to ruin his career.     

Thank you in advance for your help! I appreciate it.

I have a BSEE... but it seems they only want applicants pursuing a Masters degree/PHD. I've been toying with the thought of learning some of this but it seems like a ton to learn.. especially in 2 years back at a university. 

Did anyone here get a Masters / PHD and fully understand any of this? The only job I'm somewhat knowledgeable about is the RF ENGINEERING TECHNICIAN. Analog Design was definitely not my strong suit. Neither was RF. But then again I work with RF as a technician currently which made me think about getting back into design.  

It just seems like a lot to know for an entry level job. Or do people come out school knowing all this?

YAY!! However, I have some questions as this is my first job and a start to my career. 

One question I have is how do I negotiate my salary or should I not?
When they offer you a salary, is it before or after taxes?
Furthermore, I hear that when other jobs try to hire you, they based your new salary on your old salary (or am I wrong? Does it differ for different roles); therefore, is being paid 65K a good start? 
Lastly, will being a software tester negatively or positively effect my career path if I am to change/pursue a different position, such as software developer or UX/UI developer?

Help?",RBHAirG,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/56oxj7/dont_know_how_to_title_this_would_like_to_start/,"So I'm lost about how to apply for a job (specifically for IT), maybe I've forgotten.  Would like to get back into the field.  
  TL;DR at bottom.
  
Back story : I've always loved tech and computers, I would dismantle and rebuild gadgets in middle/high school, but failed in everything else/other subjects. D's &amp; F's, but As in my high school computer elective courses.  
  
 This would then translate badly when entering a community college, stayed for around 6 months then had to drop out because nothing ever really clicked in my head. My dreams of having some sort of computer science degree crushed me because I can never really learn the basics of math, English, etc.  
  
Back in high school I've developed mental instabilities, extreme anxiety (Doctors say I have it worse for the kind of anxiety i have), depression, anger (heh, almost funny thing where I almost threw my desk at my cousin in high school for being an annoying prick after I told him to stop several times.) Other than that, really destroyed my motivation after my attempt at college...  
  
After a year or so, being 21, I sought for mental help, they recommended a job training program called ""Year Up"" in Boston with IT training/finance training that provided paid internship great! I passed the first 6th months of training with flying colors, A+s. Then the next 6 months was an internship my IT instructor( I love them to the bottom of my heart because they got me through tough times while being in the program). They paired me up at a internship at Fidelity investments, seaport, Boston, MA. As a 'test environment service desk', okay, was skeptical, but didn't want to disappoint my IT instructors.  
  But then I did, after working for 4 months with excel sheets and doing 2 hour phone meetings, I had an emotional breakdown, cried in front of my boss, etc. This situation made me feel so hopeless, I didn't want to go back, called it quits, was a slim chance I could get into another internship, but couldn't, got fired from program. No program graduation, no certifications, no company recommendations? Or whatever those are called( where a a person hiring can call, and person responding can give you the thumbs up) lost. then I proceeded to sit in my room in depression for the next year or so and had various thoughts/regrets, I find it a miracle I didn't have any suicidal tendencies after that, but I'm glad a few family members supported me with a few friends playing games. 
  
After a year of visiting the doctor's again, 4th round of antidepressants and anxiety pills, I'm finding the motivation again after an old friend questioned about me having the odds of working in their hotel a few years back and I was interested again and decided I would fill out an application just to see if I can get anything that makes money after being on food stamps and staying at parents. I wondered if hotels even have IT centric jobs.  
  
Then that bought up even if I remember how to apply for a job and do the interview process, how to do etiquette, what kind of questions I should ask or mentality for it. 
  
Now I'm here, on this subreddit.  Sorry, this suddenly turned into a life/sob story.  Think I would have liked a desktop help desk job or W.e.
  
TL;DR, I love computers, I've had a terrible mental life? I would like to start again... Think I need a crash course on IT basics again but don't know where to find a summary of resources.  
  
Also any life advice is welcomed.  
  
After writing this, felt like I didn't have to write it all out and not really help with my question, but fuck it, I wrote it all anyways. Guess it was good to get it all out...   if there is a better subreddit to post this in, I'll delete this and try there I guess."

I am new to this subreddit, but it seems like you guys have some great advice and thoughts! So I recently got hired as an intern with a wonderful company. The office has a business casual dress code, but IT gets to wear tennis shoes and jeans, and a blouse or a collared shirt. Now, I am a woman, and a lot of women's jeans and leggings do not have adequate pockets. I don't want to have to run around with a full size purse or backpack, and I do mean run around (I work for a public transportation company that houses the repair facility as well. I usually clock in about 3 miles of step a day at work). My question is this; what sort of bag/pack/other would be professional enough to carry around, but not ridiculously large or silly looking?

3+ years ago, my life was going great. I was getting ready to graduate high school. I'd been accepted into one the best colleges, into a program that was exactly what I wanted. I had a loving whole family that were supporting me and my parents had saved enough that with the scholarships I'd received, they could completely pay for college.

But now, nothing has changed. I'm exactly where I should be. I'm 3 years in and my academic record is noteworthy, if not laudable. Financially I'm in a great place after getting some in industry internships. I'm on track for great success.

Except I'm probably going to kill myself any day now.

Somehow over the past 3+ years, my entire life became lifeless. Nothing has changed on the surface, but everything is tainted, tinted grey, like the opening scenes of the Wizard of Oz. I don't find joy in anything anymore, and I don't get sad either. Sometimes I feel like crying or screaming, but I just can't. Sometimes it seems like everything sort of goes back to normal for a little while, like if I'm super busy or something. But then it always comes back. I've been trying to keep as busy as possible, but I'm just wearing myself out. Then I end up sleeping too much and wallowing in it.

I scare myself sometimes too. I know everyone has those invasive thoughts of random things they would never do, but mine really freak me out. Sometimes I'll find myself planing out elaborate suicide schemes, methods and notes and such. Nothing written down. Sometimes it's just random self harm, like stabbing myself over and over again, but I know I'm too much of a pussy to actually do anything. But that's not the worst. Sometimes I find myself looking around at the people around me, thinking about how many people I could kill before the police showed up, or what would happen if I stabbed this person or where the best place to put a bomb would be. It makes me sick to my stomach and I want to kill myself because of it. Especially because I know that I could do it. I have nothing on file that would disqualify me from buying a gun. I have enough technical knowledge to build a bomb. Knifes are pretty much everywhere. I wish that I'd get run over by a cement truck.

I don't want to tell anyone about this because I'd probably be put into a psych ward. Then my chance to kill myself really goes out the window. And I don't want to put my family through that. My sister just got out after trying to kill herself, but she had an actual reason. She was in severe physical pain for months and was doped up on who knows what barely distinguishable from heroin pain meds she was on. I don't think my parents could take that. And this was only within the last months.

I've been feeling this way for years. There was no trigger or trauma I went through. No rhyme or reason as to why I'm like this. I guess I'm just fucked up.

I'm not going to do anything tonight, but I guess I want some help since I'm here."

56sjp5,3,2016-10-10,Personalized Career Advice,Selucidian,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/56sjp5/personalized_career_advice/,"Hi All,

I'm a second year undergraduate in Biochemistry/Molecular Biology. 

I've been doing some molecular biology research for around a year now. Last summer I noticed that some bioinformatics/machine learning would be helpful for some florescence imaging analysis that I was doing all by hand. I started learning more about all that, and am very interested (albeit still very novice). I am still leaning towards MD/PhD and bench-heavy molecular biology research.

Anyways, I'm starting to get more familiar with Python &amp; Matlab and have gotten some self-learning suggestions from faculty members at my university.

It's also normal at my school (Northeastern University) to go on 3, 6-month full time internships between classes (I'll start applying to the first of my three around February to start in July). So that gives me a few chances to try subject fields out before committing to anything. 

For you all, two questions:

1. It seems to me that bioinformatics is complementary to my eventual career goals. Am I mistaken? I will also consider doing an MS and/or doing bioinformatics in a gap year before MD/PhD, assuming I continue to enjoy everything--would you suggest that?

2. My university doesn't offer many bioinformatics courses. How can I still make myself competitive for jobs/internships in bioinformatics?

Thanks,
J"

-Also, I took multivariable calculus at UCI. I got an A+.


****AP************************
-5's on World History, Computer Science, Calculus BC, Biology.
-4 on US History.
-I self-studied Environmental science too and received a 4 also.

*****Extra Curriculars**************
-Delegate in YMCA Youth and Government 10-12. It's a model legislature and court based off california's. I passed a proposal through the board of education as a panel member. I also won an award of 'pollster of the year' in my own delegation (150 members) for outstanding polling of the program's members (approx. 4000 students)
-Cross Country and Track and Field, did it 9-11 and was JV. I was alright.

-Academic Decathlon 11-12. This year, I'm the treasurer. Our team kind of sucks since we don't have it as a class and we don't really have anyone that is an expert on the subject(s), but we have some kids that score pretty high individually.

-FBLA 10-12. just a regular member.

-Internship at a local tech company 11-12. They're a security app that's on a bunch of HS campuses nation-wide. I can't say much but they're also partnered with a fortune 500 company to keep workers safe and a very large (multinational) governmental organization. I do quality assurance there and work with the software engineers. I've created a master QA checklist for the company that the whole development department uses. I also help a little with customer interaction (calls and email checkups).

-League of Legends: since forever. Not sure how relevant this is, but I'm good at it. (peaked diamond IV/top 2% of North America). It's also the subject of my CommonApp Essay, which I think is pretty good.

-Internship/Shadow under two different neurosurgeons 12: Both are/were head of their departments in their respective hospitals. I don't think I'll be getting a recommendation letter, but It was a great experience nonetheless. I get to take call and also help around the clinics and sit in on some surgeries.

2) I'd optimally be looking for a Network Engineer or Network Admin position, but most ""entry-level"" ones in my area want 5 years of experience. How flexible are employers on this? Or am I better off leaving the area to find zero experience jobs?

As the title says, I am a junior  studying computer science, and I am looking to work for a competitive tech company next fall (September). Somewhere like Jane Street, Citadel,  Facebook etc. One of the reasons being that they pay so much better than local companies, and others because they work with more interesting tech (OCaml with Jane Street).


I have 2 internships under my belt (at the same small company) doing lots of dev, working on backend stuff. It was a great role, but I want to move on to cooler stuff. Thing is though, I got that job simply because of such a small application pool, and I just got along really well with my interviewers.


When I look at my resume now, it's 8 months of dev at some no-name company, and some tiny projects I worked on a year or two ago. My resume would go straight from the printer to the trash so to speak - but I have 3ish months to work on building up my resume. So what do you guys think?

56uzk5,19,2016-10-10,How hard is it to get an internship as an international student,mopott,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/56uzk5/how_hard_is_it_to_get_an_internship_as_an/,"Issue: I seem to be rejected at the resume screen and I want to know why so I can cut my losses short. 

Background: I'm from the UK, I have an undergraduate degree from a good university in the UK, and I received good grades. I've just begun a MS CS degree in the US at a not-top but respected-enough university (universities like GaTech, USC, UCLA, and Purdue). I previously did an internship at a bank in the UK where I did some software engineering work. I'm now trying to apply for internships in the US but it seems like I'm being rejected at the resume screening phase. I don't have a GitHub (well, I do but it doesn't have anything on it so I don't mention it on my resume) and I don't have a personal website. (You might question whether I enjoy programming at this point but I do truly enjoy it.)

I'm starting to get worried and I'm now trying to figure out why I'm being rejected at the resume screening phase. I know that no one besides the actual person reviewing my resume can say for sure but I want to figure out likely causes. Do I need to really stand out much more in order to get past the resume screen if I'm an international student? I've applied to 30 companies and I've only heard back from one. Would a local student with a similar background also face a similar resume rejection rate? 

Note: the companies I'm applying to are some of the bigger ones (including banks with tech internships) and so I believe they're more likely to be able to sponsor visas compared to companies I'm not looking at.

The reason why I'm asking is because if it's really this hard, it might be more financially responsible of me to discontinue this MS CS degree and get a job back in the UK. I do prefer to work in the US but I have to also be mature about my financial situation. I don't want to spend so much money on a degree here only to go back to the UK getting a job that I already could've gotten straight out of undergrad.

The company i work in is actually really good, they are starting to use Docker, their main product is software so they value their developers and encourage training, they are really efficient and focused, but it's B2B with an existing software so i will not progress that much in development, what i learned so far was practical git, writing tests, the business itself and some programming + sql.

Besides the Technologies that i already mentioned, there is also a big part of code in Java. 

What would be the smart move for me? I'm still an intern, should i keep learning and specializing in PHP? And JavaScript, hml, etc?  
Should i try to shift my focus to Java?
Should i stay here or should i seek for other Jobs?

I have an AP Scholar award, but I hear this one isn't too mindblowing. 

EXTRACURRICULARS:

I've played soccer in my local soccer league for 8 years. 

I'm heading into my second year in the school newspaper after being promoted from a writer to head copy editor and Editor-in-Chief. 

Internship at a photography studio in a neighboring city. 

I've spent about 70 hours total setting up the soccer fields for my local league the day before games for all 4 years of high school. 

I have about 15 hours last year as a snack shack cashier at home football games.

Next I worked about 100 hours last year with the adult transition program in a nearby school district (not my own) where I worked with mentally and physically disabled students to get their post secondary degrees.

MISC. INFO:

I'm confident I can write some good essays (I have some people to help me edit them) and I have some awesome recommendations from my counselor and my teachers but also my former instructor during my internship and my former commissioner of my regional soccer league. 

I was born in and currently live in California.

I am a first generation college applicant and first generation American. I'm a Hispanic male with my mother completing high school and my father never finishing. Our household income is $200,000+ a year (my father worked in construction and bought properties). I am fluent in both Spanish and English.

Thank you for your help!from real people and not just numbers to help me better understand my chances. I was thinking of applying to UC Berkeley, UCLA, UC Irvine first and foremost. I'm also applying ED to Cornell and RD to Harvard (you don't know until you try I suppose) as extremely high reaches. Can someone help me gauge my chances? Also as a side note, if its possible can someone recommend any other schools I have a shot at getting into with my stats and a cold climate in an urban area?

56wisl,7,2016-10-11,Am I being promoted too soon?,honeyonarazor,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/56wisl/am_i_being_promoted_too_soon/,"I'm in my second year of college, taking 13.5 credits this semester and studying construction management.  I was hired on with a construction company 7 months ago as a summer intern expected to work 30 hours a week.  Everything was going great.

Then the operations manager for our Hawaii division put her two weeks in about a month ago.  They had nobody to fill the position so my boss said I will take over Hawaii operations temporarily until they can find somebody to fill the spot.  So she trained me to the best of her ability (not very well) for 2 weeks and I've been doing operations since then - 1 month total of operations experience.

Since then, the lead estimator for Hawaii put his two weeks in and he trained me to the best of his ability while I was trying to figure out how to run operations.  Boss told me this is also temporary as he is reviewing resumes for an estimator or office engineer to help me out.  

I have come to learn the previous Hawaii operations manager had no clue what she was doing, probably because she was so overworked.  She would routinely work 10-12 hour days.  So on top of all this new responsibility I am trying to clean up the mess she made.  We have jobs over the allotted working days so my company is being charged liquidated damages everyday.  One is $5000 a day, the other is $3,000 a day.  So between those two, the company is losing $8,000 a day.  The lead estimator was dealing with all the litigation involved so now I might have to deal with that as well?

So basically I have no clue what I'm doing in this position.  I feel like I've been set up to fail.  I'm getting waaaay behind in school and now have been taking days off to catch up.  As well as trying to do homework on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights even though that rarely works out because I am so stressed out from this job.  I've started to lose a lot sleep over this job, increasing my stress level even more.  

I have made it very clear to the owner and his wife that I can't be doing this job and going to school full time.  They say it's temporary but their actions speak otherwise.  I really don't know how to get through to them besides giving them an ultimatum.  Maybe hire somebody who isn't going to school full time and have them take on all this responsibility and I will help with whatever I can.  

Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

Need my bretheren to advice me",razor_highwind,pcmasterrace,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/56wiuc/joined_the_pcmr_on_2012_having_issues_right_now/,"Hello comrades, this is my first post in PCMR, i am sad about it falling in the help category.

On 2012 i was a college student, going trough Lawschool and being an intern in a good law firm, i saved and bought the following parts:

* ASRock 880GM-LE FX MoBo
* AMD SAPPHIRE HD 7770 Vapor-X OC Ed GPU 1GB GDDR5
* CM Silent Pro M2 800W
* 2x 4 GB's of Kingston Hyper X Blu Ram 1333 mhz
* AMD FX 6100 CPU 3.3 GHZ

Not counting case and monitor because i already had some

Two months ago, after saving a bit i got a new GPU and PSU (since the cooler master one died after a long fight with cancer) i got the following:

* ASUS GTX 950 Mini (Low power GPU, no extra power from PSU required), 768 cuda cores, 1026 base core clock 
* EVGA 600B 600W 80+

Recently, ive noticed some weird stuff my technological knowledge is not able to understand: im getting really weird frame drops on games where i should see no frame drops

I used to play tons of Dota 2, and even with my old GPU i used to get 50+ frames per second with everyhing set to max. I also play Overwatch and get really good frame rates, the issue is the following; when im static i get 60 frames at OW and Dota 2, but whenever i get into the action the framerte goes down to 50/40, i want to think that's kinda normal, but sometimes i get dips to the sub-30 frames hell.

Also, in Dota 2 i almost see no difference between my 3 and half years old card and a brand new gtx 950

Could this be due to my old processor? the old-ass MoBo?
Does the GPU not requiring power from the PSU affect performance?

I want to know whats the issue, so i can upgrade either the CPU, Mobo, or both.

Just a little note, before anyone says that i've should have bought a 1060 or something like that, i live in Mérida, Yucatan, Mexico, and pc components here are much, much more expensive than in the USA, so getting a 18,000 pesos GPU is out of the question until i can be economically independent

I will really appreciate the input!"
56x1kp,4,2016-10-11,[Serious] I could have prevented his relapse.,Jazminlol12,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/56x1kp/serious_i_could_have_prevented_his_relapse/,"I've been recently interning at a treatment center, and I'm pretty young so they had me working with the adolescents. The kids are great, I love them and they love me. I'm not too much older than that (maybe three to five years older depending on the kid) so I've been able to really connect with them. 

My problem is I get way too emotionally connected to people quickly. One of the kids is the awesome guy. He's always cracking jokes and lighting up the whole environment. He's been there the longest so he helps with giving advice with the younger kids, so a lot of the teens look up to him. Shit, even I looked up to him.

Recently he had been sharing in group that he hasn't been feeling all that himself and has been sleeping in everyday. He explained how he would sleep for about 16 hours get up just to eat, go to the bathroom, and go back to sleep. He was very depressed which is scary when you are also dealing with drug addiction.

I'm not allowed to give out my phone number or have any contact with patients outside of the facility, but I was very worried for this kid, so I gave him my SnapChat and told him to message me if he ever needed anyone to talk to. Because I feel like we got along very well, and all anyone ever needs is someone to talk to. 

He messaged me the very next day asking me if I had time to talk to him, I was about to go to my second job so I told him , no I'm sorry but I'll get back to you as soon as possible whatsup? HE said that he wanted to tell me something personal, but he'd prefer face to face. I explained to him how I'm already jeopardizing my internship by giving him my snapchat, a one on one meeting outside of group would be the end of my career, that the only way I would meet up with I'm is if it were a life or death situation, then I would think ""fuck the rules"". I was still pretty hesitant about it, so I asked a couple of my friends, because wouldn't it be worth it if it's the right thing to do? I kept on telling myself that but all of my friends kept on telling me, don't risk your job like that and don't be a hero. My still best friend told me that I'm still an intern and not qualified to give advice so anything I could say outside of group could potentially be the wrong thing to say and I don't want to be responsible for that. So I left it at that, I told him that I'm sorry but he can always just message me or speak to me privately in group. 
and I just found out to day that he relapsed that same night that I messaged him. I can't help but think if I had gone down to talk to him, maybe he could've stayed sober. He had over 100 days clean. And one conversation could have prevented him from ruining that. I'm not sure what sort of advice I'm asking for but I need advice. "
56y6o4,19,2016-10-11,Finally offered a (temp) job after almost 5 months...,chenosmith,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/56y6o4/finally_offered_a_temp_job_after_almost_5_months/,"I graduated in May with two Bachelor degrees, four internships, a 3.8 GPA living in the NYC area. 

I applied to well over 200 positions, had 25+ phone/in-person interviews, went to two staffing companies, and was finally offered a full time position last Thursday. It's kind of related to my field, but the hours/pay/perks are pretty good.

Some advice for recent grads who feel stuck:

-Settle if you have to, don't if you can help it: I was offered a retail job about two weeks ago but asked for a little time while I waited for another interview to get back to me. They were surprisingly kind about it, and I was glad to have that job as a back up. 

-Staffing companies: if you are in a field that is very office-heavy, are a great way to get your foot in the door: temp/perm and everything in between, some staffing companies even spruce up your resume for you. They are a great way to get hands on experience, and it may be easier to job hunt through them because they will get job listings asking for recent grads specifically.

-Make connections and keep them: don't burn any bridges if you are rejected from a company. I had a very unprofessional rejection email (the interviewer addressed it to the wrong person and then apologized very casually about it), but you just gotta move on. On the flip side, i had one interviewer offer to connect me professionally with their family member who works related to my field of things didn't work out.

Good luck, fellow recent grads!"

* Any personal advice you have to offer to those interested in your career?

* What would you have done differently to have an even better career?

* Why is it that I hear a lot about mobile development growing but find that there's a lack of well-paid positions or positions at all in some cities?

Namely, I'm not a green card holder, a citizen nor authorized to work in the States, as I am here on a J-1 visa doing R&amp;D in Texas Medical.
I graduated from an European university that's got a fairly good CS/CE program and during my university, I did internships as a Java developer, got a job as a course instructor teaching robotics, and then moved to the US , working as a robotics engineer, under ""Research Assistant"" (probably a really stupid move by me, but at the time I wanted some international experience). 

During my studies in the uni I did quite a lot of projects though, namely robotics (Computer vision programming, microcontrollers, autonomous movement logic), so my skillset includes MCUs and some EE in addition to just CS (Computer engineering major). The best one ended with me and my teammate going to China to compete in the international robotics competition RoboCup 2015.

Recently, however, I have found that I do not like working with this lab anymore - the people don't speak English, and as much as I want to work on the project, it's crushing me mentally. Getting excluded from team activities, left out from meetings and so on.

So I decided that I'd start looking for an actual job. Be it software development or embedded software development, I'm pretty sure I can take it on. But the question I have now is - do I actually have a chance in landing a job? I've prepped a neat CV and sent it out to ~30-40 companies, but I'm trying to find out if it's even wise for me to hope for something, as I don't have a US degree."

Now I'm getting a flood of recruitment email from companies both small and large. I'm not sure what to do with them. I'm happy where I'm working. I'd like to stay at least another year when I'm expecting a pretty standard promotion and my company match vests. That said, if the money was good enough, it may be worth switching.

However, I don't want to relocate and not many of these companies have offices nearby. This is of utmost importance. I don't want to burn any bridges by interviewing with companies that don't have near by offices because later in life I may be in a position to move, but I cannot right now. In fact, I will definitely be looking for something either remote or available in a specific other location in a year (current company has an office there too, which I'll stick with of my search in a year doesn't yield anything better).

How do I respond to these emails in light of the above?"
570dd8,2,2016-10-11,Seeking Life Advice,OrangeAPeel,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/570dd8/seeking_life_advice/,"I'm one of those people who, if I were to kill myself, would probably generate the reaction of ""he had everything going for him,"" which, on the surface, is somewhat true. I grew up without a financial care in the world and went to a top private university. As an adult, I'm in perfect health, decent physical shape, I'm close with my family, have a few really good friendships, and have dated and continue to date accomplished, attractive women.

The problem is that I'm in my early 30s and completely financially dependent on my parents. I dropped out of law school a decade ago to pursue my passion of a career in the arts. I have received a few legitimate positive notices for my work, but it has not generated meaningful commercial interest and after 10 years of honing my craft and putting myself out there, I have not made a penny and seem no closer to doing so anytime soon.

In the meantime, I've held down low-paying and unpaid jobs and internships. I recently quit my job of 3 years at a small non-profit that paid me very little to do clerical tasks. I eventually took over a marketing position there when someone else left, but knew nothing about marketing, was relatively terrible at it, and ended up quitting after a year of it with poor performance reviews. I'm very shy/sensitive, feel highly unsuited to office jobs, and don't seem to fit in with co-workers. I discovered towards the end of my time there that I was being mocked behind my back as though I were still in middle school.

My degree is in a useless liberal arts field, and despite hundreds of job applications, I haven't received any responses to the positions I've been interested in applying to, probably because of a lack of experience. I don't even know what I should be applying to anymore. My only true passion is my creative pursuits, and while I continue to hold out some hope that eventually people will take interest in my creative work, it feels like a pipe dream.

I have no ""network"" to draw upon to find good jobs. I can't identify a practical graduate degree that I would be interested in attaining. At best, I can take yet another clerical position somewhere, but that just seems like a ticking time bomb.

I feel horrible guilt and shame at living in a nice apartment that I can't afford. I've been in therapy for years and various prescription medications have done little to help. I also feel guilty for even having these feelings, because other people have had real traumatic experiences in their lives and want to die; my suffering pales in comparison and I still think about killing myself all the time. I don't want to live a life of a failed dreams with zero passions. I don't want to be an office drone. I want some kind of recognition of my intelligence and creativity and to use it in a way that earns me a decent living. Earning money doing something I hate isn't enough. My creative pursuits don't satisfy me as just a hobby.

I know killing myself would hurt those who care about me, but I obviously wouldn't feel guilt (or anything!) after I died, so is that reason enough to stay alive? Should one choose to stay alive for the sole purpose of preventing others from unbearable grief?

I feel like I'm failing at life and there is no guidance of what to do and I am a disappointment to my well-adjusted family. I often go sleep wishing I won't wake up. Life just feels incredibly disappointing and unfulfilling and if I had been given the choice of whether or not to exist, I wouldn't have picked this.

As I said before, I know my problems are very ""first world,"" but does anybody have any advice on how to move forward from this kind of situation? Is there a way to trick my brain into not caring about my passions and finding meaning in a bland existence?

Thanks for any help/advice!

So I've done about six internships, both at small and large companies. I've tried to steer my experience doing infra/os/distributed systems type work and it's worked out so far. This is the direction that I want steer my career. Now I feel as if I have little bits of experience with a variety of languages and frameworks from my internships and also personal work. I'm not quite confident with any specific area or language.

Does anyone on here have any advice regarding how to structure my learning and development as I move forward? Specifically in the distributed systems realm.

Also - I'm trying to figure out which language to take a deep dive with ...golang? cpp? java? c? I'm not sure. I've worked full work terms in all of them and I have a very shallow understanding of all of it. I'm also looking for an open source project that I can get involved with...maybe mesos? or one of the many golang distributed systems projects.

Thanks."

The company I previously worked was also on a completely unrelated field.

So far (a week into the job) they have been pretty nice to me. They want me to learn a new framework, so they give me some training videos, and told me to study them and code along.

Now this week looks like I'm already going to start on some small (but really important to the company) projects. Due to how much these new projects (that I and another four guys will be working on) seem to be important to the company, and how small our team is, I'm kind of worried that I will be asked too much.

I would like to know, in your experience what is and what is not usual or acceptable for a company to ask from an intern? I am really excited to learn new stuff, but I really don't want to upset my gastritis over an internship. And if I feel like they're asking things way beyond my pay grade I think I'll just look for another internship opportunity."

571nvf,1,2016-10-11,How do I get out of my own head? [21M],you-cant-connect,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/571nvf/how_do_i_get_out_of_my_own_head_21m/,"Hi guys! I've dealt with this issue for a very long time now, and I've asked about snippets of it on here before... but now that I've gone to therapy and the doctors and stuff... all of my problems are in my head. The issue with that is, is i can't get out of my head... hence the title. I suffer from anxiety and depression, which are both caused by negative thinking. With this negativity, comes a lot of things that need to be done... yet can't/won't be done due to one form or another. Here are a few examples:

Talking to people:

* I've always had issues talking to people... from required conversations to even small talk. For instance, there's this extremely cute girl i sit next to in class, and I want to talk to her and get her number and stuff. I've sent a friend request to her on facebook, which took A LOT of psyching myself up to do, which she hasn't responded to. I just want to be able to ask her for her number, and hope she is actually single! My thought process, however, prevents me from just asking. Questions that run through my head can look like ""what if she finds me creepy?"" or ""what if she says no?"". I don't deal with rejection well, so that last one would hit like a mac truck being pulled by a bullet train. The first one comes from always feeling like im being creepy somehow, despite trying really hard not to, due to not being very good looking. That may be from a lack of self-esteem, but its still what goes through my head. I want to be able to talk to people without worrying about what they're thinking of me.

Internships//groups/important stuff in general:

* On the topic of internships, its kind of the same deal as above. I'm afraid of what people think of me, and don't handle rejection/being wrong well. I always clamor over what to say, and stumble upon my words. It's like a treadmill going 9 MPH... i can go for a little while just fine but one wrong move and there's a rather large pileup off to the side. One good thing about my career choice, though, is there are many opportunities for internships. I'm an Mechanical Engineering Technology major, which means that my skills are in rather high demand (at least that's what ive been told)... But still, I would rather be confident, and not worry about not getting into something for one reason or another. As for groups, I feel like I'm the only one with my specific hobbies, which makes it hard to find a group of people to hang out with. Surprisingly, I have yet to find any other WoW players at my university, and I sure as hell haven't found any Transformers fans. One issue I run across with this, is I feel like I can only have fun with my specific hobbies, and don't want to branch off and find other things. I mean, i can do band (i can play about 90% of the brass section), but i have poor time judgement, and therefore don't think I have time to do anything. What I want out of this, is people I have things in common with.


Self-esteem/willpower:

* As mentioned above, I have super bad self-esteem issues... and no willpower. Both of these cause me to be very self-conscience (or however its spelled... one word i can never remember). As for the willpower part... that's probably 90% of the reason I can't change. I don't feel like I *can* change. I feel like everything returns right back to where it began... with being negative. It also makes it hard to even try to think positive, because something in my brain immediately screams ""NO, THIS IS NEGATIVE"" and causes me to draw right back into myself. I always think I'm the conduit of everyone's bad everything, and everything that happens to me is bad. I always get the short end of the stick, if you will. I blame depression on that one, and I want to figure out a way to permanently tell that voice in there to can it.

Love Interests:

* So you guys already know about the one girl i want to talk to... But I have a tendency to... be a hopeless romantic. I daydream about the girl and I being together, and doing cute things, and stuff like that. Then, when it doesn't go as planned (kinda like the last love interest), I get super depressed and immediately think I shouldn't have even tried... because that stuff always happens that way. I want to be able to see a girl, and either not immediately think of us being cute together, or at least make it so i don't spiral into a depression when something goes wrong.

I apologize for this seriously long, not-very-organized post... It was more of a way to convey different thoughts into one spot, rather than try to tackle different problems at different times. I also apologize for any formatting issues that may come up... That part i really cant avoid until I see how the post comes out. If I think of other things to add, I will definitely add them!

TL;DR: Ain't no TLDR that gonna fit this one, bub. Gonna have to take the long way around.

EDIT: just realized i put the wrong age up top... I'm 20, but my birthday is 5 months away... so i guess I just rounded up hahaha.

EDIT II: scratch anything having to do with the girl... pretty much got rejected without a single word said, so now thats got me down."

Pay: $3900, or about $23 hourly? 
Location: Warren, Michigan. I do live in Michigan, and they might be able to provide me an apartment for free. Not 100% sure yet though.

2. Honeywell Aerospace

Position: Integrated Supply Chain internship. So I'm not completely sure what I would be doing, but I'm guessing since it is integrated I will get different aspects?
Pay: $19 an hour
Location: Arizona Phoenix - Housing will be paid for, and all my travel expense from Michigan to Phoenix and back will be paid for. 

I am seeking a full time position possibly following the internship, so please let me know if anyone has any advice. If you have worked at either one, please let me know your experience as well!

Help!,ThePaulitician,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/572m94/need_to_transfer_but_parents_are_not_approving_of/,"I am currently enrolled in an in-state institution away from home and am in the process of applying as a transfer student to another in-state institution that is within commuting distance from my home.

I am doing exceptionally well and have no academic concerns for myself. However, I feel my school is struggling with leadership and finding new people to replace those nearing retirement and it is showing to be detrimental to students such as myself. There are many scheduling conflicts that are not being resolved throughout all departments and activities.

Apart from that concern, I am concerned as to my parents' ability to afford school for me away from home after this year due to only having paid for dormitory for one year. I am not homesick, but just parts of living on campus are inconvenient to myself in terms of time (like I have to spend 20 minutes walking back and forth to the dining place if I ever want food and wait in a line if there is one) and to me it is becoming a problem that is escalating.

I don't have a job now because I don't have a car to work off campus and I refuse to work on-campus because the only option is to work in the dining hall right now and I refuse to work there due to previous experiences and positions in the food/restaurant industry.

Transferring home, I see that I will have a job with a sports team and future internship options with local news/radio stations (my intended major is radio/tv/broadcast and I think these opportunities are better than here as I do not have a car).

My parents are just refusing to allow me to transfer for some reason and I don't know why. The only reason they should even be remotely acting this way is because I received a 15% scholarship to be here at my current school which I theoretically would no longer need if I transferred back home. I think they have some pride/pressure to sending me away to school or something that they are not telling me. They owe a significant amount of money to my brother and I feel that it will be very unfair for my parents to borrow money from my brother to pay for my education when I did not pay for his. (If you are wondering my concern for this, my father lost his $100,000+ job in 2010 post-recession and has never made half of that since).

My parents said that they would be ok transferring if I was homesick and/or miserable. So I am thinking of just telling them I am homesick to let them have me go through with this. I have already begun the application process for transferring for Fall 2017 and will be eligible for a transfer scholarship that I could potentially receive.

If I go back home, I will only need to buy a car which I could afford with my scholarship money that I got back this year.

I have not been on good terms with my parents since my father cheated on my mom in 2013 and began a long term of domestic violence that had finally come to a close in my senior and is now on-and-off. I mostly went away to school because they wanted me to and I would be able to escape that domestic instability. I originally wanted to go to community college for 1 year because I had a significant amount of AP credits which have shortened my general education coursework and I did not want to decide on an institution until I was ready to pursue my major. However, my father choked me out for wanting to go to community college and threatened to kick me out of the house right then and there. I did not have a car to get out of the house then and I was very out-of-place in my high school and have obviously graduated now but now I am able to afford a car if I were to go back home.

Please help."

I recently graduated from law school and I have been job hunting. I just found a clerk job at a firm in criminal law. I did a clinic in law school related to the work they do, which is why I think they hired me. The work they do is compelling, high-level stuff and I am grateful for the opportunity. I've been there for a couple of weeks now.
Here's the catch-I am not interested in criminal law. At all. Even at this firm, which is great, I really don't have the stomach for it and I don't see a future myself here at all.

My question is this-should I stay on at this firm for now? I get bar results next month. If I do not pass, I would want to go back to full time studying. If I do pass, I figure it'll be easier to find a job in an area I am interested. The areas I am interested in are family law and employment law (I have clinical experience in the former and internship experience in the latter).

Will the fact that my most recent experience (even for only a couple of months) is in criminal law hinder my abilities to find a job in the areas of law I like? Or is it better to do this for now rather than having a gap on my resume? Thanks in advance, guys!

My major is IE, I have had 3 internships in Manufacturing Engineering, worked as a Manufacturing Technician for a few months- GPA is under 3.0, I am supposed to graduate next May but I don't know if it is gonna happen, so I am hitting everything I see right now, including full time positions, co-op's and internships.

So far, after about 50 applications, I have had one phone interview for a Manufacturing Management Training position and one e-mail from a recruiter for a Production Intern position, they wanted someone to start right away which I can't because I am in a different state.

My resume is far from being crap, besides a low GPA, I think I have a pretty decent resume, so the ratio has been about 1 callback or phone interview for every 25-30 applications.

I think this is probably better than average, still I have spent a ridiculous amount of time applying to jobs- I am 7 months away from graduation(If I graduate in May) or 14 months away(if I stay until December 2017).

Please, start looking for something WAY ahead of time. I have a friend who is going to graduate with a Chem E degree next May- I have told them 100 times to start looking for a job NOW, he does not get it- if you don't have something lined up by the time you graduate, the longer you go without an Engineering job, co-op or internship, the harder it will be for you to find your first job. The way I see the difficulty of finding a job is:


- One or more internships, GPA 3.0 or higher, other experiences- A little hard

- One or more internships, GPA lower than 3.0, other experiences- Hard

- No internships, GPA 3.0 or higher- Very hard

- No internships, GPA lower than 3.0- Extremely hard- You better get on it RIGHT NOW or you are not gonna find anything for several months after you graduate.


Sorry, just want to help people, more of a wake up call, this whole job search process is very frustrating.

Background: I am a senior industrial engineer student, graduating in may, and Ive worked as an intern during school for the past 2 years at 2 different companys. 

I applied for a full time position and a week later I got called for a phone interview. Interview went really well I felt, but the only problem was they wanted someone asap. So at the end of the interview the hr rep said that they would talk to one of the managers that I would have worked with to see if they would consider bringing me on as a part time engineer. An hour later I got a call to come in for an in-person interview with the hr rep and one of the managers. Interview went well, I felt the manager and i really clicked. At the end of the interview the manager said that he wanted to bring me back in ASAP for a facility tour so he could show me whats going on. So I scheduled the tour for tomorrow.  

Pumped now for my questions:

I am not sure how they are going to offer a position to me, whether it be an internship position or a part time engineering position. My fear is that if they put me into a internship position I'm going to be doing intern work. I an not sure if I want to go back to that. 

To anyone who has been offered a full time position while still in school how did a potential salary work after making hourly? Ex. Did they give you a date and after that date you no longer make x an hour you make y a year? 

Kinda in the same lines of the previous two questions, if they offer me a position at what price point should I put myself at? Should I put it more towards local industry for an IE or normal internship average. Either way I'm probably not going to take less than what I am at now... 

Lets hope I atleast get an offer.  I really just want talking points if these discussions come up and other peoples experiences.

573x0t,69,2016-10-12,Should you list skills (languages and technologies) or include them in descriptions when applying [pros/cons]?,welc0meToTheMachine,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/573x0t/should_you_list_skills_languages_and_technologies/,"I've heard conflicting things from actual recruiters.

This has been my experience:

1. When I list skills, people reading my resume almost never read the descriptions of my projects or internships. They find a buzzword like SQL, or Python (things that are sometimes in the 'familiar with' section, not even in proficient) and spend minutes discussing it. Which is fine if that's what you want, but I'd want them to be interested in my projects and internships. 

2. Not listing skills sometimes leads to recruiters looking for a skills section, not finding it, and losing interest soon anyways. Some machines might not pick up all descriptions of technologies and frameworks you used in projects and job (although they mostly do). I think one big problem is that there are some things I have skills in, such as C++ which I did in my data structures class, but haven't used in any projects or job. So they aren't there on the resume. Then again, without much recent practice I doubt I'll be able to answer any of the questions that go deep into these. But not mentioning it implies I don't know that at all I guess.

What are your opinions on mentioning skills explicitly?"

When you began to become more isolated?

I always struggled with social situations but I noticed my isolation really began after I graduated high school. It was then that I stopped communicating with the few friends I did have and didn't bother to make new friends in college because I only went in 2 days a week. I also was fortunate enough to find a part-time job I could do from home and therefore, barely left the house. My mom goes to work all day, so it's just me in the house alone with my cats. In fact, the only time I do leave the house is either to go to school or because my mom wants me to help her with a grocery shopping.

Now, I'm almost 22 and realizing I'm gonna have to find a job eventually when I graduate. I feel like I haven't accomplished anything in the 4 years since high school and I can't get an internship because of my anxiety. I also don't have a driver's license so I depend on my mom to still drive me around places. I just feel like a loser compared to my graduating class. I majored in accounting and I always thought that would be an introvert's job but now I'm beginning to realize it actually takes a lot more social skills than I thought.

5751fu,1,2016-10-12,[TX] Found my mother years after her psychotic break and disappearance. She is homeless and I don't know how to help her.,pandapadawan,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5751fu/tx_found_my_mother_years_after_her_psychotic/,"X-post from r/schizophrenia at their suggestion.

The backstory for this is a bit complicated, so bear with me:
I was just notified from my dad that he has received a letter from a stranger who kept passing a homeless woman on her commute. She had pity and decided to talk to her, and this homeless woman asked her to write a letter to my dad's address so he can pick her up. Included in the letter is a garbled little handwritten note from my mother. This stranger goes on to say that my mother lives on a street corner downtown (quite close to where I live), and that she hopes someone will be able to come take care of her. The stranger also provided her phone number to contact her if I have any questions.
I have not called this lady yet, and it will probably be good to have my thoughts in order anyway, because I'm at a loss of how to help my mother.

1) My dad is not going to take her in. Not only has he remarried, but she also ruined his life in their divorce and kind of damaged the psyche of my younger siblings due to her neglect so I can understand why he wouldn't want her under his roof. He said it is up to me how to address the situation. 

2) I can't take care of her. I'm a student who is working under a low paid internship; I don't have the financial (and frankly, emotional) resources to take care of her needs. 

3) On my mother's side, the only relatives are my aunt, who lives far away and has a family to take care of, and my uncle, who refused to take care of her. 

4) She has refused treatment many times in the past, because she didn't believe she was ill. I'm trying to look up involuntary commitment laws in Texas but it's rather confusing as to whether it's even possible.

5) I don't have great health insurance or money to pay for her stay at an institution or costly legal fees.

I really don't know what to do here. If anyone's gone through a similar situation or has some advice, please let me know."

My boss knew he couldn't get the company to bring on a full time permanent creative but had all kinds of creative plans. Marketing was the easier sell.

Come to find out, the company has no desire to truly utilize marketing so I've been largely wasted in that role aside from menial busy work no one else wants to do. Instead, my boss has given me lots of design/creative opportunities (that is why he hired me, after all). I've redesigned the company identity, designed websites and forms, and found myself on a new career path that I simply adore: User Experience Design (""UX"").

My boss has me doing a lot of UX, about 75% of my work week is spent doing design work, including a huge UX project that is taking most of my time. However, on my desk still lands marketing items and I've been asked to present a new marketing plan for 2017. I made and presented to the owners a plan for 2016 that never saw the light of day and was a tremendous, stressful waste of my time. I am looking for a new job doing UX full time but having ""Marketing Manager"" as my title has made it very difficult to get past HR's desk. My cover letter explains my responsibilities in detail, that has helped a bit but not enough.

While I am at my job however, I want nothing to do with marketing any longer. I crave and excel at design work, especially UX. There is no room to advance at my company in that capacity, they don't know what it is nor do they think it's worth its salary, however they keep giving me UX work to do. 

I have a burning desire to tell my boss that there is little reason to distinguish marketing as a legitimate job, even though that's why he hired me. They can absolutely get away with an intern doing the level of marketing work they need and have. Therefore, they are getting a UX designer for about $25K less than the going industry rate. 

Is there any point in relaying any of this to my boss and suggesting a part time or intern to handle the marketing? Or should I just keep looking for a UX job and shut up? My boss and I have an excellent relationship, I considered telling him that I'm looking for UX work elsewhere since my extraction will cause some serious delays, but I know that can seriously backfire.

*Dr. Sandy Rieve (now deceased) was a clinical psychologist with over thirty years of experience working with patients suffering from extreme psychological disorders.  She was renowned and respected in her field.  After retirement, Sandy published a series of bestselling books, detailing anecdotes concerning some of her most interesting case studies.  What you are about to read here is a chapter from her book, “The Mad, Mad Mind: My Most Dangerous Patients”, that was left on the cutting room floor.  I was given the manuscript by a former intern at the publishing company.  The story relayed to me was that Sandy was insistent on printing the chapter exactly as you’ll read here, but after a lengthy back and forth was eventually dissuaded by her publisher.  It was believed by those in the company that if published, this anecdote, The Curious Case of Stephen Haim, may have hurt her credibility in the medical world, which would have in turn affected book sales.*

***


I had been working at Sequoya State Mental Health Center, a psychiatric hospital located in northern California, for three years when Stephen Haim was admitted under my care.  He was a shy man with a soft voice and a gentle disposition.  An avid reader, Stephen would spend much of his free time – of which there was plenty at Sequoya – losing himself in any book he could get his hands on, especially science fiction novels.

Stephen was a ward of the state.  When I first met him, he was struggling with mild depression and a crippling drug addiction, but one thing he most certainly was not struggling with was his sanity.  Aside from his dependence on illegal narcotics, the young man was as lucid and rational as any nurse, guard, or doctor in the facility.  

So why had he been committed to Sequoya – for a mandatory six years no less – a hospital that housed criminals so mentally unstable that they had been deemed unfit for general lock-up at state penitentiaries?  One might assume it was to get his drug habit under control, but the answer is a bit more complicated than that.  

In the fall of 1989, Stephen murdered his older sister, Janice Haim, while under the influence of a dissociative hallucinogenic drug known as PCP.  By the time he came down from his high, a full day had passed and he was locked inside of a holding cell at the county jail.  His new surroundings had come as a huge shock to his now sober mind, but even more troubling for Stephen were the circumstances involving his incarceration.  

He maintained to have no recollection of the entire event and was horrified when he heard that he had murdered Janice, his only remaining family member, in cold blood.  Stephen’s claim of memory loss was not a new precedent.  There have been many well-documented instances of people suffering blackouts while abusing powerful hallucinogenic drugs.  After a series of long, rigorous police interrogations, hypnotherapy sessions, and multiple injections of sodium amytal it was determined that Stephen was in fact telling the truth.  He was not lying about memory lapses nor was his memory somehow being repressed by a guilty subconscious.  Stephen was dealing with full-blown amnesia and had completely forgotten everything that had happened.

It was concluded that he had lost complete control of his faculties while under the influence of the drug and was therefore not fully responsible for Janice’s death.  Similarly, people suffering form temporal lobe seizures have at times been known to perform extreme acts of violence without even realizing it.  In these instances, they are not considered culpable, but are still handled by the state and sometimes committed to mental health facilities for the benefit of their own well-being.

To make matters trickier, Janice was killed in such a gruesome manner that the psychologist overseeing the case advised the court not to inform Stephen of the horrific details unless he insisted on disputing the accusations levied against him.  He did not, which was probably for the best since the evidence was overwhelming anyway.  His hearing was held in-camera.  This was done for two reasons.  Firstly, to protect Stephen, already grieving the loss of a loved one, from learning the macabre truth about his sister’s final moments.  And secondly, to prevent the press from catching wind of the event and sparking up a media circus around a man who was already suffering a great deal.  

The entire matter was taken care of swiftly and Stephen was sent to Sequoya where I would work with him for the next six years.  In that time, I would get to know him quite well.  As the primary psychologist treating him at the hospital, I was privy to all the details of Janice Haim’s murder, but I made sure never to bring them up with Stephen, who had elected to remain ignorant to the grisly specifics involving his sister’s death.  My main focus was to help him battle his addiction and to aid him in overcoming the guilt he felt for killing her.  My strategy was a success.  Within a few months Stephen had put the drugs behind him and by the Spring of 1990 he had seemed to make peace with his dubious past.

Still, I couldn’t help but feel sorry for Stephen – one of the few patients at the center not dealing with a debilitating mental illness, yet forced to mingle and interact with schizophrenics, manic-depressives, and people suffering from dissociative identity disorder.  In my opinion, he was ready to leave the facility after a year, but because his stay at the hospital was court mandated he was forced to wait out the entirety of his sentence.  To his credit, he had accepted the hand he was dealt, often telling me during our one on one sessions that he was merely thankful the judge’s ruling hadn’t been more severe.  Nevertheless, once his mandatory time at the clinic was up, I was happy to proclaim to the board overseeing his release that Stephen was of sound mind and ready to reintegrate into society.

He was released on November 14th, 1995, still a relatively young man with his whole life ahead of him.  I remember feeling a sense of accomplishment as he walked out the door – one stronger than I had felt with any of the other patients I had treated at that hospital.  Often my job is to teach the people under my care how to manage their illnesses without becoming a danger to themselves and others.  Stephen on the other hand was cured, his drug habit long-gone and his self-loathing no longer an issue.  I felt confident that he would turn his life around and not slip back into the drug habit that had flipped his entire world upside-down.  Two years later, after his probation lifted, I heard he moved up north and rented a house in a sleepy little town out of state.

In the summer of ’99, I received a letter that Stephen had sent to my office requesting a telephone consultation.  He needed advice about some recent problems he’d been experiencing and had written a phone number at the bottom of the page where I could reach him.  If it were anyone else, I probably would have written them back with a recommendation for a clinician in their area that could help them.  It goes against my code of ethics to give professional advice to patients no longer under my care, but I felt a sort of irrational sense of guilt after watching Stephen spend so many unnecessary years locked away at Sequoya so against my better judgment I picked up the phone and dialed his number.  

I was a bit disturbed when I heard how nervous and panicky Stephen sounded when he picked up the line.  Right away I began to wonder if he was using again.  I asked him if that was the case and he assured me it was not – he had even deliberately chosen an employer that drug tested so he wouldn’t be tempted to revert back to his old ways.  It was a relief to hear, but his reason for writing me was disconcerting nonetheless.   Stephen Haim, a man I had never felt truly belonged in a mental institution, was beginning to grow concerned with the status of his own mental health.

He explained that the trouble was stemming from a strong, putrid odor, that he could detect whenever he was inside the house he was renting.  Stephen said the smell was akin to raw sewage.  At first he thought there was a problem with his plumbing, but when his landlord sent a maintenance crew to his home to investigate, nobody but Stephen seemed to be able to detect the stink.  He invited friends and neighbors over to get a second opinion, but still the phantom stench appeared to only be perceivable to him.  It had gotten far worse in recent days.  The odor was now more powerful than ever and yet no one else, no matter who he asked, seemed to smell it at all.  He had decided that the whole thing was in his head so he contacted me for an opinion.

I told him that the odor could very well be in his head, but that I didn’t think it meant he was losing his mind.  To me, the most plausible likelihood was that Stephen was experiencing some sort of olfactory hallucination induced by flashbacks from his days using PCP.  These hallucinations, referred to in the medical field as Phantosmia, are known to sometimes spring up in people with a history of abusing hallucinogenic drugs, even if they’ve been sober for years.  I then explained to him, that the smell was probably harmless and would go away with time.  However, Phantosmia can also occur in people suffering from seizures so I gave him the number of a nearby neurologist and asked him to set up an appointment to get checked out.  He thanked me for easing his concerns and told me he would call the doctor later that week.

Stephen Haim would then drift from my mind until a second letter arrived at my office a few days later.  The return address was identical to Stephen’s, but to my surprise it had been written by a woman named Colette who claimed to be his fiancé.  I was startled to learn that her reason for writing was to inform me that Stephen had recently committed suicide.  His funeral would be held over the weekend and she very much hoped that I would be able to make it.  I was extremely saddened to hear about Stephen’s tragic death.  I even felt as if I deserved some of the blame.  We had spoken so recently; If only I had been able to recognize the signs.  Perhaps it was this same guilt that spurred me to cancel my plans and make my way up north for the weekend to pay my respects.

I arrived in town the morning of the funeral.  The ceremony was scheduled for early afternoon, but Colette’s letter had requested I stop by to speak to her beforehand.  I wasn’t sure what it was she wanted to discuss, but I rented a car at the airport and headed straight over to the house to meet her. 

I was greeted at the front door by a young woman with a sharp jaw and striking blue eyes.  She introduced herself as Colette and invited me inside.  We sat down at the kitchen table and made some small-talk for a bit, mostly about the time I spent working with Stephen at Sequoya, before she confessed the reason why she had asked me to come over.  She told me that the last few days had raised a lot of questions about Stephen’s past, questions that she knew I had the answers to and she was hoping to talk about them with me.

Stephen’s hallucinations had gotten worse after our conversation on the phone.  It wasn’t long before the horrible phantom odor he had complained to me about was accompanied by an equally foul taste that he couldn’t get out of his mouth.  Colette explained that he would go through half a bottle of mouthwash every day, but no matter how often he rinsed, gargled, and spit, the taste always remained.  It had gotten so bad in fact that he had stopped eating.  As I listened to her speak, I wondered if this too could have been a hallucination induced by his prior drug use, but when Colette started on the topic of Stephen’s nightmares my mind began to formulate another, much more fascinating theory.

This is where I detail the night Stephen Haim killed his sister.

On October 22, 1989, Stephen was alone smoking PCP in the apartment he and Janice shared.  For whatever reason, the drug sent him into a frenzy.  As luck would have it, Janice arrived home just in time to catch him at the height of his drug fueled rage.  Stephen strangled her on the living room floor.  As he choked the life from her, he gnawed on her face, tearing flesh away, and mangling her features until her corpse was completely unrecognizable.  The brutality did not end there.  Stephen would take a pocket knife to Janice, making an incision in her body that ran from her lower abdomen all the way up to her sternum.  He would then proceed to devour much of her organs, including her stomach, liver, and large intestines.  By the time police arrived at the apartment, they found a wild-eyed Stephen, covered in blood and excrement, still chewing on his sister’s entrails.  

This was the memory that was believed to have been erased from Stephen Haim’s mind, yet years later, according to Colette’s story, it had somehow resurfaced in his nightmares.  Every night he dreamt the same detailed, disgusting scene exactly as it had really happened.  I theorized that the phantom smell and taste that had been tormenting him may have also been memories of the incident, manifesting themselves in his brain by dominating his sensory stimuli.  The constant aroma of raw sewage lingering in his mouth and nose was actually Stephen’s mind remembering the flavor of his sister’s bowels.

It seemed as though Stephen realized this as well and couldn’t bear the burden of guilt his newly returned memories had placed on his shoulders.  He used a razorblade to slice his wrists.  His body wouldn’t be discovered until hours later when the landlord stopped by the house for some scheduled repairs.

Colette finished her story abruptly, thanked me for stopping by, then ushered me quickly to the door before I really had a chance to weigh in on what she had said.  She promised me we would talk more at the funeral, but that she had to take care of a few more arrangements before the ceremony got underway.  Before I left, she asked if Stephen ever expressed remorse to me during his time at Sequoya before he knew the details about that terrible night.  I told her that in my opinion he loved his sister very dearly and wished more than anything that she was still alive.  Colette then thanked me again for my time and sent me on my way.

I spent the next few hours in a daze.  Never before, in my professional career, had I heard of memories manifesting themselves in such peculiar ways.  The entire situation was so bizarre and I wanted to hear more about it.

I arrived at the funeral later that afternoon.  A small group had turned out to mourn the loss of Stephen.  Most of the people there had only known him for a short period of time, but it was clear that he had made a favorable impression on all of them, just as he had me when I first started working with him.  Curiously absent from the ceremony was Colette.  Given her relationship with Stephen, I would have assumed she’d have been the one greeting everybody at the door.  I found it odd that she wasn’t around, but I imagined that perhaps seeing her fiancé inside a casket might have been too trying for her.  I expected to catch up with her later, but even at the wake she was nowhere to be seen.  

It was during the wake that I met Rami, the only person there who had known Stephen before he was committed.  They had been friends since they were kids, but I was surprised when Rami told me that he had been the one who had organized the funeral.  Again, I had expected it would have been Colette, especially since she had made it seem that way when she hurried me out of the house earlier that day.  He asked me how I had heard about the funeral and I told him about the letter Stephen’s fiancé had sent me after he committed suicide.

My comment left him perplexed.  He was certain Stephen had never been engaged.  Even stranger, when I mentioned Colette by name he told me he had never heard of her before.  There was a memorial wreath near us that had been decorated with old photographs taken of Stephen throughout the years.  One of the pictures caught my eye.  The photo couldn’t have been taken long before Stephen was committed to Sequoya because he was the spitting image of when I had first met him.  Standing next to him was a woman with a sharp jaw and an unmistakable pair of striking blue eyes.  It was Colette.  She looked exactly the same in the photo as she did when she greeted me at the door.

I showed Rami the picture triumphantly, explaining to him that this was the woman whom I had just spoken to, but he became very quiet once he realized who I was talking about.  We stood in awkward silence for a long time before he finally spoke.

“I can’t tell if you’re joking or not,” he said.  “But I was the one who snapped the picture you’re holding.  That girl’s name isn’t Colette.  It’s Janice, Stephen’s sister, and that photo was taken just a few days before she was killed."""

Obligatory ""Long time lurker, first time poster""

------------------

A woman in HR at my company had been having repeated hard drive failures for a few months. Other techs had replaced hard drives, instructed her to save things on the network drive, and eventually fitted her with a simple RAID 1 setup (HR gets what HR wants, standards be damned).

With the hard drive issues being stabilized for a few months, I get the task to upgrade a piece of software that is only used by her and her assistant. I later found out that the assistant had never even launched it before I updated it. There was no real reason for the upgrade, but this user knows just enough about computers to always need the shiny new toy, and as stated: HR gets what HR wants.

So after struggling through a non-standard installer that only worked by running the .exe from an elevated command prompt while logged in as the user on one machine, and only worked when logged in as the local computer admin user account on the other, I am finished. Or so I thought.

&gt;""So I normally open my projects from the recent projects list here... Where can I find them now?"" *It was blank because it didn't carry over the recent list from the previous version*

This is kind of out of character for this user. She tends to be computer savvy enough to not have simple issues like this, and instead have complex issues caused by the danger of ""just enough"" knowledge. We proceed to search her whole local drive and network drive by file extension for her project files, on her suggestion. 

Nothing. Only the template files built into the program itself.

&gt;""Did the install do this?""

Once again, this user knows enough to be excited about a RAID 1 array in their computer, and suggested to search by file type to find the missing files. This odd question would be expected from another user, but once again it seems out of character. On the off chance it could have been the installer, I google it. The program is popular enough that I would definitely find angry forum posts if this was an issue with the it.

Nothing.

At this point I'm scrambling. This woman is high enough up that a rumor that she suspects me to be at fault for the missing files would cost me my internship.

I check the old version of the program (it was one of those special programs that doesn't automatically uninstall older versions), the recent files list is blank there too.

I download a file recovery tool and do a desperate search. It scans the local drive for deleted files. I'm seeing the file names of files deleted up to 3 months ago (I can't recover the oldest ones, but I can at least see the old locations and file names). I search the results for anything of the right file type.

Nothing.

&gt;""Could they have been lost when $OtherTech or $AnotherTech were working with my hard drive?"" *She says this with an accusatory tone. She's looking for someone to blame.*

I can't throw them under the bus, but I can't lie to this user. The penalty would be too severe. I tell her that it's possible but unlikely, that the files may have been lost in the hard drive failures that prompted them to work on the hard drive(s). It's obvious that all she got out of it was ""Yes it was them"". I tell her that I'll have to consult with them and that I'll keep her updated on any potential solutions.

I talk with the other techs. The last time her hard drive was touched was around 3 months ago. Through some discussion, we realize that the only way this could have happened is if she hadn't even attempted to access these projects, which are supposedly the core of her job responsibilities, in at least 3 months.

One of my seniors handles letting the user down softly, suggests that she try to find old versions she may have sent out through email, and says that we will try to find the old drive but it is almost certainly lost forever due to our company's stringent policies on hard drive disposal.

For the next month we get asked at least once a week if we've found the old drive. Eventually she admits that she can recreate the projects by manually recreating the finalized editions, but that it would be a lot of work.

And so we all break out the world's tiniest violins and play a sad, sad song for our poor user."
576c1s,1,2016-10-12,I'm graduating December 2016 and trying to decide whether going into Research or Software Engineering would be best for my long-term career/goals. Looking for pros/cons/experience.,SIRHAMY,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/576c1s/im_graduating_december_2016_and_trying_to_decide/,"I'll be graduating this December with a BS in Computer Science from a top 25 (at least, depending on ranking algorithm/source) school in the major. I love building things and solving new, hard problems. I've got six internships under my belt, so have an okay grasp of how the corporate world works. 

**Edit: Guess I should add some career goals for context**

* Next five years: put myself in best position possible to be optimally effective when new direction/goals set
* What this means: getting a solid understanding of software/computer science, the role of software engineering in the industry and world, and diving into different computing domains (data science, machine learning, vision, etc.) to have a better idea of how it all connects to the rest of the industry/world/future. 

I have an offer for a software engineering role within IBM Research where I'd be working on a team of researchers to, well, do research. From my understanding, this means seeking out, defining, and solving problems then implementing said solutions to prototype/MVP/proof of concept completion (read: not production-ready) to hand off to other teams to turn into products/take next steps.

I also have several other offers in more traditional software engineering roles that would be more product/business oriented. What I'm trying to decide is what's best for my career in the long-term.

I think the research might provide an awesome chance to experiment with new technologies, learn about new domains, and gain experience with open-ended problem solving. I haven't done much searching, but it doesn't seem like an opportunity like this pops up very often. The team seems cool, smart, and driven and their current focus deals with alot of the areas I've been focused on for the past few years.

However, by taking the research route, I fear I may miss out on core software engineering principles that may be acquired through a more traditional engineering role: understanding product life cycles, real-world problem-solving (reliability and scalability for instance), and other intangibles that are sure to be acquired through regular code reviews and development with engineers more experienced than I on production code.

I think I may eventually want to move back to software engineering and was wondering how a stint doing research would look to team leads when I make that jump.

I'm curious what the pros/cons of doing research at such an early, volatile stage of my career may be:

* How would future hiring managers look at my experience if I decide to go back to a traditional SWE role?
* What skills/areas would I be missing out on if I do research vs SWE?
* What are the major pros/cons of doing one over the other?

Also, if you have any experience doing CS research, I'd love to hear about it - what you liked, what you didn't. Anything really."

Some context:

- Senior graduating in May

- 3 internships, currently interning

- Received offer and accepted job after graduation

- Female at no name private college


I'm having trouble communicating and being motivated with my school project. My classmates and I come from very different backgrounds and I feel that this one student, who assumed the role of ""manager"", is strongly influencing the project by choosing the environments and tools he's familiar with. I feel very lost and when I ask for help he's very condescending towards me. It's really bringing me down and I'm not sure what to do.

I believe that I'm a very hard worker in a real world setting. Every internship experience has been very positive and I have good relationships with my managers. At my current job I continuously receive good feedback. I thoroughly enjoy working in this field. I enjoy working with people of all ages and backgrounds but I seem to struggle with communicating with my classmates.

It is known that many people from my school demonstrate poor social skills. Would this be an example of that? Or should I be communicating more with my team and professors?

To be honest, I could try harder communicating my concerns, but I continuously feel inadequate because I'm working on something I'm unfamiliar with. I'm not the best at programming and my experience has been QA and as a systems analyst. I feel that it is difficult to showcase my skills when my classmates are very pro-programing and dive into the project. As a result, the project is disorganized. I've offered my help to organize but as mentioned, the student who thinks he's a ""manager"" is stubborn and refuses to let me help.

Has anyone been in this situation?

Any thoughts or comments are appreciated.

I'm hoping you could help me with a rather unpleasant situation I'm dealing with. 

The previous summer I interned with EY in their PI program in New York, getting pegged in their Analytics affiliation. I did pretty well, got an offer and even received a small bonus from a principal. 

I ended up accepting the offer but moving to San Francisco, and am currently in training. I've since learned that I've now been switched into a SAP affiliation. 

I'm far more interested in their Analytics and Digital affiliations. I really don't want to tagged with SAP, had I known I would have accepted another offer. I was given no heads up about this till today. 

Unfortunately my offer letter only says their Tech Advisor Program, though last fall HR had assured me on the phone I ought to be given a similar affiliation as before. 

How would you go about pivoting? At the ACP training meeting I noticed a few other people had been switched as well. Our engagement manager implied the only time to switch affiliations are during the bi-annual ACP survey, which is definitely something I don't want to wait for. I will be meeting with my engagement manager after training (as will everyone), but I have my doubts I'll be able to get out. 


How would you guys go about this?

My thoughts so far:

1) I need to frame this such that it appears beneficial for the firm for me to switch again. In my opinion this is actually the truth - I did well in Analytics, and my internships beforehand were at an SaaS and IoT company, both in which I did analytics sort of work. 

Just in case, I will be submitting an updated EY CV where I will remove all mentions of Oracle, SAP and maybe even SQL. I told my Engagement Manager at the meeting that I may have submitted an old one.


2) I've reached out to my old manager in NY, unfortunately he's since joined an analytics start up (lol). Right now I'm drafting an email to send to the Principal who was attached to the project, I had met with him a few times during the internship. 


I could also reach out to the lower level staff and seniors I had met during the internship, but not sure if that'd be effective. 

Is there anything you would suggest? Any and all help is appreciated. "
576wp6,15,2016-10-12,So I volunteered for a study but uh. it didn't exactly go as planned?,slimyfawn,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/576wp6/so_i_volunteered_for_a_study_but_uh_it_didnt/,"The lobby was a diamond formed out of white walls and grey stone tiles, the whole room sort of dreamlike in its starkness. The fluorescents in the ceiling didn't help that sensation in the least - nor did the large, blank, flat screen TV mounted at the front corner of the room. Behind the TV was a staircase, hooking down to the lower levels of the building. I could not remember what it looked like down there, but I knew it didn’t feel as strange as this little alcove.

My memory was fuzzy, like I’d dissociated up until the point I sat down in the chair, but I wasn’t concerned. Everything was going just fine so far, and I’d certainly be taken back to where my test was soon.

I had volunteered to come, that much was true. I wasn't exactly doing great in the funds department and I'd been volunteering for various studies on and off for about a year. Usually it wasn't anything too strange; let myself be put in an MRI scanner, taste different kinds of beverages, etcetera.

The sign-up sheet for this place had been pinned up atop years’ worth of other fliers in the dining hall at my school, paper as pristine and white as the room I now sat in. It was your average, run of the mill flyer: a neat font, a title proclaiming ""Volunteers Needed!"" and all the other relevant information. Address, requirements, compensation. It seemed pretty sweet, even if the details were sort of vague. Something about reaction analysis. I assumed they'd probably be tapping my knee with a hammer to see how fast I'd flinch or something along those lines. Sort of just reflex shit. Easy.

And now here I was, in the lobby of a building that I couldn't quite remember walking into, or what it had looked like on the outside, or even precisely where in town it was located. I didn't know how long I'd been sitting there alone, but it wasn't too bad, really. It was quiet but I could hear signs of life - office doors opening and closing, footsteps, idle conversation. And, people would walk by, occasionally. 

All of them looked like they fit so well in this place – backs straight, clothes pressed and tidy, confident and ready to perform their duties. They reminded me of interns, although I couldn't quite place why that was. Maybe there was something subtle in the way they walked, like they were proud of themselves but trying a little too hard to be impressive, to wrestle their way up some ladder.

As I sat, sort of fiddling with my phone, time seemed to progress as usual. Nothing changed for me - I would sit, I would wait. Sip my drink. Look up as someone walked by. Feel out of place for a moment. Check my phone. Sip my drink. Wash, rinse, repeat. 

The repetition took a while to notice, but after a while I became more aware of how often things seemed to happen, how rhythmically the people would enter and exit the room. This time they were blond and pretty, wearing a grey muted blouse. Professional. Confident. Glowing with life. Then they’d be gone and I’d feel inferior for a moment before the feeling passed and I was back to being alone.

Door slams down the hall. Idle, distant chatter. Footsteps. Door slam. Chatter. Footsteps. A new person - brown hair in a ponytail, wearing a work-appropriate dress. Footsteps. Door slam. Chatter. Footsteps. Door. Chatter. Footsteps. Person - blond, grey blouse, pretty. Footsteps. Door.

I felt something like uneasiness settle in my gut as I started to fixate on this pattern. It had to be mostly my mind fucking with me, the solitude beginning to work me up. Even still, I counted it out on my fingers. Noticed where it would loop, how each door slams sounded exactly the same, the voices, the footsteps. Like they were recorded. Like someone was playing a soundbite. 
Oh. Oh, maybe this was it? Maybe this was the experiment. Sort of unconventional but I guessed I could pass it off. Was I supposed to say something to stop it, to let them know I had realized what was going on?

I stood up slowly, listened to my knees pop, adjusted the legs of my shorts as they started to ride up. Surely I had been there for the better part of an hour, and I felt sort of embarrassed that I hadn't noticed the patterns sooner. I hoped the people running the test weren't laughing at me.

""Uh..."" I started, picked at my knuckles a bit. ""I get it now, yeah. It’s a cycle, right? Is that what I was, um. Supposed to notice?"" I shuffled in place, expecting someone to step into the room soon to pay me and tell me about the results.

It was quiet. Door. Footsteps. Chatter. Door. Footsteps. Person.

This one was a man, one I had seen three times at least, I realized as I walked towards him hesitantly. ""Uh, excuse me? I figured it out.""

He looked at me with confusion, raised an eyebrow, and continued his path down the hall.

I was getting fairly unnerved at this point - that guy had been rude to not answer but this had to be the test, right? The repetition? 

Maybe there were phases or something. Maybe I just had to sit until they told me I was done. This didn’t exactly fit the description on the paper but that was okay. This was weird but it was fine and I'd have enough cash to get myself a nice dinner to compensate.

So I moved back to my seat, settled in, and waited for the cycle to pick up again.

Things had, I realized after a second, fallen eerily silent. It was like they had turned off the recording from earlier and withheld their actors. I smiled a little, confident that I was right, that it must be over now. I had arrived around three thirty, I thought, and when I checked my phone it was already four twenty. Had to be wrapping up.

After a few more minutes passed and I was still alone there, in total silence, I was starting to get sort of antsy. It was fine, I assured myself. I just needed to stay patient, get my money, and leave. I always got nervous towards the ends of these things, even at the MRI center, and I had gone there a half a dozen times now. 

Everything was alright.

But as time stretched on the minutes seemed to come slower, and the silence seemed to grow more all-encompassing. I could hear my own heartbeat. There wasn’t even the quiet buzz of light fixtures and background equipment that usually punctuates most quiet rooms, it was just… Nothingness. Not the sound of distant people talking in other rooms, or even cars going by outside. I was completely and utterly alone with myself, the only sounds being those coming from inside me. 

Thump. Thump. Thump. 

Inhale. Exhale.

The rush of blood in my ears felt frantic, my heart starting to race faster as my vision blurred, focused hazily on the black square of the tv screen. I felt like I was suffocating, like the silence was working its way into my body, filling up my lungs, weighing me down. 

I wanted to open my mouth, to say something, to break the silence. How long had I sat there? How long had it been this horribly quiet? It had to have been almost twenty minutes, right? I couldn’t have lost my cool so thoroughly in just a few moments.

I picked up my phone, fingers cold and trembling, and pressed the home button. Three thirty. 

I blinked a few times, felt like the world was trying to crash around my ears. That was wrong, wasn’t it? I had checked a few minutes ago and it was almost four thirty. 

Maybe I was wrong, though. Maybe I had just thought it was four? I’d misinterpreted the time before, looked at my phone screen and not processed the things I saw, but… I exhaled slowly, dropped my phone in my lap, my eyes drifting back up to the tv screen. 

I was blowing things out of proportion.

I felt a sense of calm return to me, despite how quiet it still remained. I exhaled, shut my burning eyes. My head spun a little when I did, like vertigo. Nonsense patterns swirled behind the darkness of my eyelids, as if I’d been eyeballing an optical illusion. It made me uneasy, for a moment, but the second I opened them once more the feeling was gone. 

I was swinging back and forth between anxiety and calm seemingly at whim now, but for whatever reason, I didn’t notice or didn’t care. It was only when I finally escaped that room that I would come to realize just how irrational my emotions were at the time.

When the TV turned on, it nearly scared me out of my skin.

I had fallen very still, had lulled myself into a kind of calm listening to my own breathing when the sharp, sudden sound of static filled the room, echoed off the tiles. 

The screen had lit up, static, then blue, then the smiling face of a young woman. She had a mess of pretty brown curls tied back in a bun behind her, and her eyes were full of light. She made me happy, just seeing her. 

She spoke a moment after she appeared, as if waiting to ensure she had my attention. “Hello! My name is Violet!” Her voice was crystal clear and full of joy, like she really enjoyed her job. “We really appreciate you joining us, Samantha. We are always in need of new volunteers, and you showed up so punctually, we very, very much appreciate it.” She shuffled through something on her desk – a thin black folder – and came to rest her hand on an open page. 

I was totally enraptured, my heart fluttering in my chest. I felt in tune with everything, with my own body, with the room, and it was like I was totally and completely smitten with the girl on the screen. The kind of weird, fairytale lovestruck stuff that poets are always going on about. Without care that I was speaking to what I assumed was a recording, I murmured, “You’re welcome. It, uh. Wasn’t a problem.” 

She smiled, like she heard me, and I felt my heart swell up in my throat. She read over the paper for a moment before looking back up at the camera, hummed. “You did very well during your test. You saw the simulation for what it was in near record time! That’s exciting! We really thought we had this one down.” The corner of her lips twitched, and then there was something else in her tone, like she was angry with the results.

My heart sank immediately. I felt like I was drowning, suddenly so overwhelmed with grief and heartbreak that I thought the pain might burst out of my ribcage and kill me. Tears welled up in my eyes. 

“You will find your compensation in your wallet.” She continued, tapped one short, pink-painted fingernail against her notes. “Now, if you would please remain seated as we wrap up the duration of this experiment.” 

And then she was gone, just as she’d come, and the grief was still settled so fully in my stomach that I thought I might die. I wanted to die. I wanted to cast myself down the stairs and crack my head open at the bottom.

I didn’t even check my wallet, just sat limply in my seat, waited for my instruction to leave. I felt like a failure. Like I would never amount to anything, like I had lost something incredibly important and would never recover. I have never felt anything so world-endingly desolate in my entire life.

And then.

The sound of a door slamming. People talking. Footsteps echoing down the long hallways off either side of the lobby.
The grief was washed away as instantly as it had occurred, a bewildered kind of fear filling up its place. I was done. I had finished. The—The person—they had said I was done, right? 

But did they? 

And who was it, exactly? Had someone stepped in and spoken to me? Had they made an announcement? Used the TV? I didn’t have a clue what they had looked or sounded like, or even really what they had said besides that I had been compensated and that I could leave soon. 

This whole thing was weird and awful and unsettling, and I wanted to leave immediately. I didn’t like that I was having so many memory issues, and I didn’t like that the fucking repeating audio was back on, and I wanted to leave this awful lobby and get dinner. It had to be almost five now. 

I gathered up my phone and wallet, took a quick peek inside to make sure I had the $50, and took a few steps towards the stairs. Just before I did, though, I glanced down to check the time on my phone. 

Four thirty. 

Feeling a mounting sense of panic, I headed for the top of the stairs, took a quick glance to my left as I went. 
The footsteps… it appeared that they were real, this time. 

The hall was just as stark as the lobby, grey tiles, white walls, and coming up the center of the aisle was a person in my clothes. 
That was my first impression, anyway, the first thing I noticed. They were wearing the same outfit as me, the same glasses, even had the same haircut. I stiffened up, the panic in my gut coming to a head, turning into a frantic irrational scream of WRONG WRONG WRONG. 

They were not in a hurry to approach me, but as they advanced, I could make out every intimate detail of them. My ears, my nose, my mouth, hell, even the acne adorning my chubby cheeks. My heart stopped, eyes filling up with tears. A scream was locked in my throat. 

Have you ever had a nightmare where you see a copy of someone you love, or yourself? Maybe the feeling would be familiar to you. Abject terror. The thought that this is very, very bad, very wrong, even if the other person isn’t outwardly threatening. 

It took me a terrible amount of time to force my legs to move, but I managed, casting one last glance back at my doppelganger before I cascaded down the staircase. Still approaching, quiet, calm, eyes glittering with life. My life. That was me. I nearly broke my neck on the way down, and didn’t spare a glance at the downstairs area before I exploded out of the double doors at the front of the building. 

In my panic to get my car unlocked, I did manage to cast a glance at the front of the building. 

It was one story, squat and somewhat dark, like a private practice doctor’s office. The front of the building was emblazoned with the name, “C.U.P.I.D.” and a friendly looking blond cherub was the logo just beside it. 

As I sped away, the memory of my experience remained fresh in my mind, the parts that I had forgotten earlier quickly returning to me. The parts that didn’t make sense, the horrible swing between emotions, the time issues. I felt sick, cold sweat on my brow and the threat of vomit in my throat as I hurried back to my apartment to write all this down before I forgot any details. It occurred to me to contact the police but, what would I report? Time travel? Weird experiments? That I had seen someone who looked just like me? 

I didn’t bother, although I did try looking up the company name. Unfortunately, I really didn’t get much out of it, so I thought, why not try posting my experience here? Has anyone had a similar experience, or heard of the place? I still, for the life of me, can’t remember exactly where it’s located.

I do still feel very ill. I’ve locked my doors and windows, made sure my dogs are in the house. Currently it is 6:23 and I’ve sort of holed myself up in my bedroom with some instant ramen and my laptop. Any advice or comments would be appreciated, maybe I can relax a little if I feel less crazy.

I need your input. I graduated in August with my BSEE and I've applied for a ton of jobs since then. I've either been rejected, or I haven't heard back from companies at all. It's probably because of my below average GPA and zero internship experience. 

I went to a career fair two weeks ago and today I got an email from a company that I talked to at the fair, saying that they think I'm a good fit and that they want me to get back to them so they can forward my resume to the hiring team. It's a technician position but it involves EE-related tasks so I'm not that bothered. At this point hearing back from a company itself is great news for me.

The biggest drawback is that the position is for their 12 hour night shift, 6pm to 6am. This makes me very queasy. I was not prepared to work so many hours especially at night. It will cause a massive shift in my lifestyle, i.e. my personal and social life, health, working out, etc. will all suffer as a result.

What would you do? Should I forcus on the money and the experience and just go for it? Or hold on to my idea of work and keep searching for other jobs?"

578uk2,2,2016-10-13,[UPDATE] Taught myself Rails from scratch. Enjoying the fruits of my effort. (No college degree),_FlyingGeese,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/578uk2/update_taught_myself_rails_from_scratch_enjoying/,"In May 2015, I shared [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/368gek/how_i_learned_rails_from_absolute_scratch_and_got/) about how I taught myself Ruby on Rails from absolute scratch and I was already getting several people asking me to do projects for them, as well as offers for paid developer internships. Reading that post, you'll be able to get where I was in about half the time it took me.

I've been asked a number of times about where I am as a developer and I always tell them that I'll do an update, but I haven't remembered to do it until now, so here we go!

At this point in time, I had the opportunity last month to be hired for a developer position in New York City. The job offer was contingent upon me switching to ReactJS. I ended up deciding not to go with it, simply because at that time I wasn't interested in React. I plan to add React to my repertoire because I know how popular it is (JS in general is popular, of course), but for now, it's not aligning with my personal goals. All that to say, I am not employed full-time as a developer right now, but through side gigs I am paying a good portion of my rent. 

Why not work as a developer, you ask?

It's more of a *not yet*. At this point, I've made so much progress with building my own 2 startups that I want to take them as far as they'll go before I commit to a developer role, where a whole team is relying on me. Should my own ventures fail, then I'll be able to fully focus on a traditional job.

Side note: I forgot to mention in last year's post that I documented the first month I spent learning programming on a spreadsheet. There were very few days I missed, but a lot of days where I put in a minimum of 4 hours of practice. Some days where as high as 17 straight hours. I was able to do this because I was living frugally and working as a gymnastics/cheerleading coach (kids don't get out of school til 3ish, so I spent the days practicing). I wanted to mention that now because it turns out that this is the kind of attitude people are looking for.



Now to elaborate on the above ...

I honestly cannot believe how far I've come since I started coding 2.6 years ago. As I mentioned last year, there were times that I really wanted to give up, if only to assuage my mental anguish. There are a lot of things I can build, or easily learn to build. I gauge myself now, by writing up a plan for a project on a whiteboard, and rating myself by how closely the actual programming goes to my hand-written plan. There are always some frustrating moments, but I've learned that the only way to overcome difficulty is with desperation. For example, if I don't understand a complex problem, then at some point I will resort to reading entire books, cover-to-cover, obsessing over every detail to ensure total understanding. In programming, lack of understanding in your current problem is usually actually a lack of understanding in something more fundamental.

****TO THE POINT****

If you found yourself here because you're trying to learn programming, and want to be able to compete for jobs out there, then I hope that this story will be able to give you guidance, because I'm out here doing it now. I have no college degree (I don't even have college credits, I think) and my most recent developer interview, (which included questions by a more experienced dev to test my actual understanding) went great. If I can do this, then I have to say anyone can do this.

So here are my 5 most important points to remember when becoming a hireable developer.


1) **This is one of the hardest things you'll ever do**. Be ready to cry and bitch about how things aren't dumbed down enough for you. I know I did. Getting ebooks to read is will help a lot, but I found it even better to have a physical copy because you can highlight, underline, and take notes super-easy. Although I don't do Java at all anymore, I still crack open my old copy of ""Teach Yourself Java in 21 Days"" to skim through old notes I took for my future self. It's going to be very difficult, but as I said earlier, difficulty can always be overcome with desperation.


2) **Get close to technical people in startups**. This is probably the most important item on this list. I attribute my small success thus far to the fact that I was able to connect with other developers. Startups are usually small companies, so it's much easier to interact with people close to the ""top"" if there is a top. Having close interactions with these people caused a reputation about me to build, which is what led to my internship offers. People who have active startups do have at least some influence, and are often eager to make things happen for you if they see you're already working toward that end. These references will serve you well in getting hired later.


3) **Learn how to deploy**. Any dev will tell you that just because you have something working in your development environment doesn't mean it will work the same live. Being able to deploy things gives your clients the confidence to say ""I can leave this to her."" Which is the reason they're talking to you, after all.


4) **Don't be afraid to ask questions**. Asking questions is the fastest way to learn something. For me, I just couldn't seem to understand implementing Stripe Connect in my app. It ended up being one of those things I had to see, study, and then watch again in order to figure out how to do it. I got blasted by a senior dev in the Rails subreddit who told me I should not be a developer, and I frequently get discouraging comments by another guy (who I can only assume is a troll). There will always be those people, but listen to me: If you find you have a programming question and see that it hasn't been asked yet, please fucking ask it! Get the answer, thank the people, and fuck pretentious douchebags. You are never going to know what you don't know. Small people fear that. Great people embrace it, or at the very least get over it.


5) **What technology/language you use matters, but don't get too caught up in it**. People say use this for that, and that for this, but what you really want to be able to do is **start**. If you're like me, the thought of picking a single language is terrifying. I mean, what if you pick something and later you read an article about how hot a language you aren't using is?

Guess what? The fear of choosing the wrong tech will melt away as your project starts coming to life in front of you.

At the end of the day, what matters most is having an understanding the core concepts of computer science, and there are plenty of videos and books to ensure you get that. Keep in mind that there's nothing binding you to a language or framework. You can switch at any time. And if you're serious about becoming an employed developer, you shouldn't really be that fixed on the idea of using one kind of tech for your career. 


6) **Put your Git on your resume**. Who can argue with actual, viewable code? Even better if you have contributed to an open source project or have a project of your own that's live on the web for them to tinker with. During my 2nd interview for the developer position in NY, I was asked to tell about a particular feature I coded that I was proud of. Since I had 2 live projects at the time, I was able to direct the interview to my live site, show him what it was, and explain what was going on in the background, and then show the code in my repository.

Don't have a Github account? Stop what you're doing, stop all learning. Take the next hour to learn and understand source control. Do not make this optional.




So what now?

Now I get ready for a tech expo that's apparently a big deal here where I've moved to. I plan to present my startups and demo them there, I'm really excited about that, because I learned to code for the sole purpose of building one of them. I can't express in words how it feels to think about how I had an idea back in February 2014, and now I have the actual thing right before me for the world to use--and I can alter it any way I wish. 



I will only say this here because all of the people reading this are in or appreciate software:

Several years ago, I saw several of my friends going to college and swearing that it was worth it just because it was college. They were history majors, liberal arts, and dance majors, etc, but they all were so sure that just having a degree is the start to a great career. I have to admit that as the semesters went by I started to think they were right — I still wasn't going to take out student loans, but I thought they were right. Well, now I've found my thing, and had I gotten the job last month I would be making much more than all of them who graduated, which is incredibly ironic. I'm not saying that software is a dropout's safehaven at all -- it's not. In fact, that's the same attitude my friends had: college is a safeguard against real life &amp; rejection -- it's not. I'm saying that my example is the very reason you should do something because you want to do it, right now — not because you're trying to escape failure. I may change the world with my startups, and I may not. But at least my future is looking damn good.

I hope this helps someone!"

The pay and perks are great, but I don't really like the work I'm doing or the team I'm on.

The project I'm on feels incredibly pointless - we're building an internal ""tool"" that already exists in multiple forms and might not ever even be used. Projects I have done during internships have been higher impact than this. I haven't written any actual code besides scripts and queries, and most of my job involves sending emails and waiting for responses. I feel more like a PM than an engineer. I've asked for other work and if there's stuff I can help with, but I've just been told to focus on the project. I also don't have access to a lot of code.

The team has a few other new grads who joined around the same time as me. They seem to be much better at showing (feigning?) interest in the work and team. They also ask lots of questions (which I feel they probably know the answers to, since they're pretty obvious) and talk to the managers/senior devs more. Lots of times they also get credit for my work because of this. Social skills like these are admittedly my weak point. It might be in my head, but I get the feeling people see me as the weak link among the new hires. 

I would gladly put in tons of extra hours to get work done, but that's really hard when I have zero interest in what I'm doing - not to mention, there isn't any actual work to do most of the time. I feel like this team is just a terrible fit for me, and none of my skillset or passion is being used. I'm also stressed out about being fired - how much time do I have to make an impact or build a good reputation?"

* What is the average difficulty of the upper division classes? I was wondering if it was possible to do 4 upper division classes or 3 upper division classes and 1 projects class in a quarter.
* Would only finishing up to ICS 33 be a proficient amount of programming knowledge to get an internship? (This is assuming I wouldn't have done any outside learning to put on my resume by the time I apply for one)
* Who is a good professor to take ICS 139W?
* What are some of the fun and interesting (or what you think is fun and interesting) upper division and project courses?
* How is your specialization path going? I'm thinking to pursue the General CS specialization but I was wondering if it would be better to do an actual specialization. 
* Are the summer classes more laid back than normal classes?

57agse,1,2016-10-13,What is to expect if I join a relatively new and small start up? And how should I negotiate my starting pay with them?,chongccino,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/57agse/what_is_to_expect_if_i_join_a_relatively_new_and/,"I recently got a reply from a small and relatively new (about 2 years) I applied to, arranging to meet me at Starbucks for a chat (an informal interview I presume). 

Conducted further research on the company and found out that there're only 3 people in the management team (2 directors and 1 employee) and they don't even have an actual office -- they work from a privately rented apartment. But they do extremely meaningful work that's in line with my personal beliefs and what I'm looking for in a career in this industry. Plus, the directors are pretty established within the scene and their network is also quite extensive.

However, I have a few concerns:

1. How much will I really be able to learn from a relatively young company like this? I'm a fresh graduate (with a BA and an MA) who recently took up an internship to pass time while searching for a job and quit after 2 days because the company was really dodgy and exploitative (didn't even give me a contract and when I asked for it, they said they'll draft one out and let me sign it in the upcoming weeks without specifying a date). I foresee that it can go two ways: I end up dabbling in everything they do and get very involved in the work OR I end up doing grunt work with a terrible below-living-standards pay like my internship. I'm worried that things might turn out like the latter and they use the excuse of ""we don't have enough funds to pay you"". Are these worries justified? Should/How can I bring this up during the interview?

2. What's life at a small and new start up generally like? How are the OT hours? Do small and new companies generally have some kind of structure? I'm asking this because the company I was interning with told me I had fixed hours during the interview but when I showed up they told me to OT every day in the week until I was spending 12 hours in the office doing NOTHING but being on standby for the past two days without prior notice or even an ""end time"" given, which was just poor organisation and borderline exploitation. I know it's difficult to say since it would differ across industries and whatnot but just any general input would be helpful so I know what to expect.

3. I'm hoping to get a minimum starting pay of $2200 (USD) because of my qualifications and the fact that during my college years I'd already spent my holidays doing internships so I'm not entering the industry with zero experience. Should I bring this up during the interview or wait for them to bring it up? If they say they can't afford to pay me this much, what should I do? Do I ask for their offer? What's the best way to go about starting pay negotiations in general? (The lowest I'm willing to go is $2000 because living costs in my city are pretty high). 

Thanks for reading through this wall of text; any advice is very much appreciated! :)"
57alfn,1,2016-10-13,I think I'm in the wrong field. I don't want to be in human resources. I want to be a teacher.,SoftRedDoge,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/57alfn/i_think_im_in_the_wrong_field_i_dont_want_to_be/,"I feel really lost and sad. 

A little background. I graduated the end of last year with my bachelor's in Org Com.  I went to a very good college where I switched majors constantly because I felt I had to declare one, and I took a career test my junior year that said I would be good at Human Resources. The following semester I got an HR internship where I would phone screen people and go to colleges and interview people. 
After about five months, I left my little retail job and started working for the company full time as a receptionist because they wanted to keep me, but didn't have HR jobs available. I got fired for performance. This hit my self esteem a lot. I then got a temp job as an HR assistant somewhere, and got let go early because apparently they didn't need me anymore. A couple months later I became a temp recruiter at a great engineering firm, but left them this May for the same reason. From May to August was rough because I'd get temp jobs and be let go from them immediately. It was making it really hard on me to help my boyfriend with bills (I live with him but only he is on the lease) and really stressing me out and making me feel useless.

Cut to today, I finally found a job where I have a lot of responsibilities, and I'm permanent. I feel like it's my first REAL job.  It is my second month here. I am doing HR and also Office Coordination. I sit in the front office away from everyone so I don't really get to interact with anyone. I am responsible for ordering supplies for the kitchen and basic office supplies. Also welcoming new hires into the company and having them sign things, and helping them get seated and logged in and introducing them to everyone. 
Here and there I make mistakes, sometimes I come in late, and I find myself wondering what I'm doing here. I don't enjoy my job, and I feel stuck. I got this job because of my mom's friends, a lot of them work here. I walked in with so much motivation and now I find myself contemplating making a U-turn and going back home because I feel like I can't show my face. I am not fulfilling the potential that my hiring manager saw in me. She now has a disappointed expression on her face whenever I'm around. 

Since I've graduated high school, I've wanted to teach. I have always volunteered to look after kids at my local churches. I am very good with kids. I love explaining and teaching things. But because of pressure from my family and people such as my doctor, I've pursued more ""professional"" work. The advice against teaching always is centered around money and how teachers don't get paid enough. 

The reason I stuck with HR is because it was people oriented and it was kind of like management in that I am a source of information and support for employees. But this just isn't fulfilling at all. I am afraid that I am going to get fired any second. I want to get my teacher's certification. I don't care about the money.  I really feel like teaching is my calling. 

What should I do? I know I can make a good living off of HR but it is becoming hard to stay motivated. Is becoming a teacher a good idea? Any advice would be great. "

The majority of the work is reading and interpreting spreadsheets, copying the relevant data into a master spreadsheet, and classifying or organizing the data.

It's simple work, but requires an ability to interpret some detailed information. It is probably suited for an IT-oriented engineering intern or new grad.

I feel like it's too complex to outsource and too simple to hire a professional freelancer, so it's in a kind of middleground.

I don't have a company office, so the work would have to be remote, but I would like to meet in person to ensure I can trust them with my valuable data and explain the details of the work.

I'm also not sure how to pay; whether hourly makes sense, or if I can get better value paying by the task. I can afford to pay $2k per month for 3 months, but the right person might only take 1 month to do the work.

I appreciate any help and tips from anyone with experience in this sort of hiring.

I'll try to keep it short and sweet. Graduating from network/systems admin program this week, where we touched a bit of everything - and as a result I've been offered 2 paid internships, are 2 very different companies.

What's most important to me, is what opportunities/work this will open in the future - especially 5+ years from now


**1. Linux Systems Admin / DevOps**
3 month internship, small office (no guarantee of work afterwords), relaxed environment. Working with 3 very knowledgeable Linux Sys Admins/DevOps guys. Will get experience with: CentOS, Python, Go, Thrift, RabbitMQ, Redis, ElasticSearch, Puppet, ZooKeeper, Graphite, Kibana, Jenkins. They live and breathe AWS.


**2. Microsoft World**
2 month internship, medium sized business (almost guaranteed work after), business casual environment (damnit). It's for one of the ""top"" Microsoft MSPs (Managed Service Providers) in the area - top tier Gold partner. Start helpdesk, with growth to projects. Lots of company supported training. Their clientele list is unreal - universities, school districts, large insurance companies, health services, city districts, banks, mining/gold corporations. I can't think of a better place to start for the MS world. Would lead to becoming IT Consultant. Not a huge fan of wearing dress shirts forever, but if it's worth it, then I'd accept my fate.


If you were in my shoes, which path would you take? I have a few days left to decide, and both sound fantastic"
57be45,1,2016-10-13,Advice: Taking a FT return offer w/o completion of CS degree?,degree404,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/57be45/advice_taking_a_ft_return_offer_wo_completion_of/,"I previously interned at one of the Big 4 companies this summer - I enjoyed working on my team and I received a very competitive offer to return back for full-time employment starting in 2017. However, I do not anticipate that I will complete my CS degree by my start date. By my start date, I will have taken Data Structures, Programming 1-3, Databases, Software Engineering, but missing some upper-level Statistics/Calculus.

1. If I **reject** the offer and focus on finishing school, I'm afraid I might not pass the rigorous interviewing process for FT employees.
2. If I **accept** the offer, and **DO NOT** tell my recruiter, I am worried they will rescind my employment at any moment, since I technically broke the offer contract where the given salary is contingent on a degree (not actual employment). I also find this to be a little dishonest and I don't want to be blacklisted from this company.
3. If I **accept** the offer, and **tell** my recruiter my expected graduation timeline, I am worried my salary would be negatively adjusted and I will be stuck within that company without a way of moving up as a SDE/SWE. I am also worried that I will not be able to move from that company to a prestigious start-up or another big company.

I have the opportunity to finish my degree online, but should I let my recruiter know that I will not have a CS diploma for my start date? I will have the core fundamentals of my CS curriculum completed.

I'm attending a non-target school, my GPA is extremely average, but I have A LOT of personal projects and relevant work experience (4 internships)."

I am currently a sophomore computer science major at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and I have been actively seeking internship opportunities for the upcoming summer. I just got an offer from GE Healthcare for their DTLP program and I am just wondering on the general consensus on GE as a whole as well as the pros and possible cons of taking this internship.

They're currently offering what I think is a fairly competitive salary ($1040 a week) along with a bunch of relocation bonuses. My question for you all is your thoughts on GE, the DTLP (Digital Technology Leader Program) internship, and what I should do or think?

I'm pretty new with posting here, so feel free to criticize anything like that too."

Should I take a month off when I graduate and live at home and just apply everywhere and get really good at Rails, or iOS or something? Should I delay applications until I have another resumé piece and I'm a much better dev? What should I work on in my extended free time now (from dropping the course)?

I want to go deep in rails, but I'm pretty good at iOS. Should I focus on both? Go hard on one? Is it harder getting an internship than getting a full time position? Did I fuck up by not doing 4 years of school? "
57d49o,98,2016-10-13,Tips for College Students [Especially New Ones],Arrow_Riddari,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/57d49o/tips_for_college_students_especially_new_ones/,"Okay, so you have just been applied to some awesome university. However, you have no clue what to expect. This is meant to be a few tips for college.

**1. Utilize your resources. It will help you in the long run.** Obviously, on campus tutoring is an amazing thing, especially if the tutor took the same professor as you [and especially if your professor isn't very good]. Also, utilize Amazon Prime or form a Chegg account. When I first found out about Chegg, I was skeptical with the idea of renting a book. However, Chegg's online features is very useful [you can rent the textbook online, get instant access, and set how long you want to keep it].

**2. Don't skip class, unless absolutely necessary.** Obviously, this has been repeated over and over. However, skipping class becomes repetitive. Honestly, you can stay home and play games. However, you will eventually start to skip class all the time. Your grade will drop. Try to head to class [even if you have to go late].

**3. If your professor does not teach well, still attend his/her class. However, utilize class time effectively.** Some professors will read word-for-word off the Powerpoint lectures. Honestly, you will feel like your are wasting time. You will ask yourself 'why am I here'. Utilize this time. If you have homework for another class, do it. You have a test coming up, just study.

**4. Be polite to your professors [even if they make a mistake] and call them by their proper title.** Be polite. You may need references and recommendations. If you were rude, your professor will not like you and may give a negative recommendation. Also, if your professor has a PhD, call them doctor. While most professors will not care, some are very particular about being called doctor and WILL get angry.

**5. Actually try to sharpen up your study skills.** Going from high school to college is tough. Going from ridiculously easy community college to regular colleges is even more tough. You will have study skills of oh read the book, do the review, ace the test. That does not work in college. Actually taking notes is the something that you must do. The review is a tool, but professors will still slip in things that are not on the review.


Adding some more tips.

**6. Know the difference between a bad professor, a good professor, an easy professor, and a hard professor.** This is important because a hard professor CAN be a good professor. An easy professor can be a terrible professor. A bad professor is usually someone who reads off the Powerpoint and does not give thorough instructions about assignments. It is hard to figure out what they exactly want from you and these professors tend to be very unhelpful when it comes down to asking questions. A good professor is the opposite- one who ACTUALLY teaches and gives instructions on assignments [especially large projects]. You know exactly what they want and they are helpful when it comes to asking questions. However, on some occasions, their exams can be tricky as they want you to actually apply what you learn in class.
An easy professor has very easily, basic tests. You do not have to do much work for their assignments and it is simply a matter of memorization. Some easy professors' tests may be an exact copy of the review, with different numbers. A hard professor requires more thinking and work in their class. Their classes can help bring forth good study habits.
Obviously, an easy professor means an easy A. However, you may not want that all the time. Let's take the fact that you are studying to be an accountant. You go to an intro to accounting class and the class is easy. You can bring in a formula sheet to the test and the test is basically a copied-and-pasted review sheet. However, you later go to advanced accounting and it is MUCH more difficult. You realize that you barely learned anything in your intro class and will struggle with the advanced class.
Now, for elective courses and for CORE classes that are university required, but do not pertain to your major, find easy professors. Like if you are an accounting student and need to take a science course, take something easy like astronomy. You need an easy A and something more difficult, like chemistry, will not really help much with your degree. So take an easy course.

**7. When using RatemyProfessor, make sure that you read the comments about the professor.** This is important because the comments give vital information about how the professor teaches. A professor with plenty of reviews that are positive tend to be good professors. However, a professor with only 5 reviews that are positive could still be a terrible professor. Also, you have to take into context of why someone would say a certain professor is terrible. If this individual failed but did not attend class, it is their own fault. If this individual attended every lecture/review/class/office hour session but still failed, it is probably how the class is taught and how the professor is.

*Disclaimer: As stated below, RatemyProfessor is not completely accurate [credit to /u/coffeelover859]. You can also figure out which professors are teaching and ask around in your major about if said professors are good/bad. You can also just ask for recommendations from fellow students on which professors to take.* 

**8. Try to do things as early as possible when it comes to college.** By this, figure out when early registration is. Register early for the best classes. Get your parking permits early to avoid any issues [like it getting lost in the mail and you have to pay for the visitor parking]. Pay tuition early or you can risk losing your classes [my own college charges an extra fee for late payments]. Also, for any online exams/quizzes, do them early. Technology can fail at any time, you can get kicked out of said exam/test [it will automatically submit], and the professor will not reopen the exam/quiz if you contact them on the time that it is due to reopen it. However, if this happened say two days before the due date, the professor will gladly help you.

**9. Always watch for the confirmation page when submitting assignments and enrolling in classes.** I made a mistake once and had my classes, but forgot to enroll in them. One class got completely full and I could not enroll in it later on. Another time, I logged out of Blackboard in the middle of submitting a major assignment. I never realized that it did not submit and had to later on show proof to the professor that I DID submit it.

**10. Keep a screenshot/picture of when you are submitting assignments or taking an online assessment.** It serves as proof that you completed said assignment. Also, when it comes to online quizzes and exams, you CAN get kicked off said exam/quiz. You can contact your professor and send them the image to have them reopen it.

**11. Try to look up questions before attending class [credit to /u/El_chupacabruh].** If it is a relatively obvious question, search it up. If not [or if you cannot find the answer/do not understand the answer], ask away. 

**12. Use a schedule/tracker to help with study times and due dates [credit to /u/KingKontinuum].** This is absolutely useful for time management. I usually use my Calendar app on my smartphone to let me know about upcoming due dates, exams, projects, university events, and so on. It was recommended to use something like iStudiez Pro as well.

**13. Do not buy textbooks until your professor specifically tells you which textbook to get [with the ISBN number] or shows you a picture of it.** You do not want to get the wrong book and then realize that you cannot refund it as you have passed the date or opened the test book [university custom edition books are loose leaf and are initially wrapped with Saran wrap. Breaking the Saran wrap means that it is un-refundable]. Trust me. Go to your first class before getting the book.

**14. Don't be THAT person in the classroom.** By THAT person, I mean the one who is very obnoxious. People are trying to learn and then you have THAT person chewing on food loudly or playing on their electronics with their volume on [no earbuds]. If a person MUST eat, try to be inconspicuous or eat soft foods. If a person has their phone out, put it on silent and have it on your lap in case of an emergency.

**15. For online classes, make sure to check every couple of days to make sure no new assignments are issued.** Online classes are awesome. You can do your work without having to drive to campus [if campus is really far]. However, anyone can get very easily off track with an online class. It is VERY easy to miss a due date, forget about a quiz, or even miss an exam. So check frequently and make a note of all due dates BEFORE the first week of school ends.

**16. NEVER take any math-related class online. Or any class that has calculations in it.** Basically, don't take any math courses, business courses that involve calculations, science courses that involve math, or any other course that involves math online. In an online class, most professors will simply post a PowerPoint with the main concepts and formulas, but they usually do not go into details about how to implement said formula. Very few will offer videos and the student cannot really ask questions to the professor directly [you CAN email but you have to wait for a response or you can go to office hours and may forget your question]. Any calculation-based courses are EXTREMELY DIFFICULT to do online [not saying it is impossible as some people may thrive in doing these courses].

**17. Don't drink/party during the week [credit to /u/iamirishpat].** Pretty obvious. You don't want a hangover before class. Weekends are better for this.

**18. Try to utilize weekends to study/finish assignments.** Pretty obvious as well. Most people do not want Saturday classes. Or Sunday classes. Use it wisely.

**19. If you are trying to register into a class that is closed, visit your counselor/academic adviser/professor of that class.** In some cases, the adviser CAN put you into said class. Also, at times, the professor may reopen the class to add in more students if you talk to them. Keep in mind that this is generally for online classes. However, the adviser is willing to let you know if people dropped out of the class, so you can still sign up for that one.

**20. Even if you are in your freshman year, try visiting the career fairs, internship mixers, and other events on campus.** It can help with networking opportunities and you will know who to contact for job opportunities/internship opportunities later on. Plus, you can make a good impression on them and they may eventually contact you."
57d8bd,246,2016-10-13,Anyone here feel privileged to be able to write code for a living?,walking_pineapple,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/57d8bd/anyone_here_feel_privileged_to_be_able_to_write/,"A couple for disclaimers before I get into this. First of all I'm still just a junior who knows nothing about life and whose only work experience amounts to an internship at a tiny and laid back startup. Second is that I am absolutely aware, that there are plenty of people who get to write code but in terrible conditions - angry managers, the deadline for everything is ""yesterday"", clients that don't know what they want, managers that don't know what they want etc. I have the utmost respect for these people, but I am not asking about the people in this situation. I'm talking about programmers who get to mostly just program from 9 to 5 and are treated well enough most of the time.

So I personally feel that being able to write code for a living is the best job in the world. During my internship all I could think of is ""man, am I glad with my career choice"". I really cannot come up with another job that I would like to do that comes close to being a programmer.

As an intern I got paid slightly below minimum wage, and I'm located in London. The pay covered my rent, food and transport and I even had some leftovers. Now, I find it ludicrous that someone like me - a student with no job experience, could fairly easily find a job that paid this much. I do not come from a wealthy family and this was good money to me. And yet, whenever I mentioned my salary, almost always people told me that ""I'm being taken advantage of"" or that I should ""find a better job"". To me this made no sense because all I could think of is **I AM BEING PAID ENOUGH NOT TO STARVE JUST FOR WRITING CODE, IS THAT NOT FKING AMAZING?!**. I still find this fact difficult to comprehend.

On this sub, and other places where devs talk and hang out, people often talk about salary negotiations. About how much value a programmer provides and that you should negotiate harder. About how programmers are still underpaid and it's unreasonable to expect people to keep learning to stay employed. And again all I can think of is DUDE YOU GET TO WRITE CODE FOR A LIVING.

All this talk does make rational sense, but I just find it difficult to participate in any of it because it seems to completely ignore job satisfaction. I mean it feels almost like saying that because I provide value to my parents I should demand more compensation. Yes, technically I do provide value to them but I fkin love my parents and those sorts of thoughts just seem, weird.

I would love to work at some fancy big 4 type company, not because they pay a lot (don't get me wrong, I won't deny a high salary if it's offered) but because they have interesting challenges to work on and cool people work with (or at least that's my impression from friends that worked there, could be totally false).

Sorry if this came off as a bit of a rant since I am not sure exactly how to structure all of this, but I suppose in the end the questions are - am I the only one who feels this way, and should I try to do something about it? I mean I like the idea of getting high pay, but this attitude of mine completely blocks any sort of ability to negotiate or to strive for higher pay, simply because I feel like I am the one being done a favour by being presented with such an opportunity."

The being said, its location is less than ideal. I am a huge fan of the city, having grown up in one, and the company I am currently working at is a very small city (think Detroit without the fear of dying). 

This company also really likes me back. I have been told I can except an offer to return as a intern during the Summer '17 and I would not be surprised if a full time offer came from it as well. Due to that, I do not want to burn any bridges with this company. They have all been incredibly nice to me, and I would love to keep them as a ""backup plan"".

The being said, it is now the middle of ground zero for summer internship interviews. I've already had a few companies reach out to me for interviews in NYC, Chicago, and Pittsburg. These interviews will require travel and, as such, I would have to miss work. I have about 5 days of personal time left at my current company, but I will most likely need more than that in order to attend the interviews I have been offered thus far.

So my question is simple. Is it selfish of me to ask my current company to give me more time off (unpaid obviously) to attend these interviews? Will it look like I'm ""betraying"" the current company by attending these interviews? They have to know their Co-Op students would still be looking other places, especially since I have yet to receive a formal offer from them.

I thought about telling them about the interviews, but my fear is they will expedite an offer to me and make me choose. That is the last thing I want right now because I want to see if the other opportunities pan out before deciding.

Any advice helps!"

*Which area/country in Europe has most opportunities to get an internship?
 
*If I applied and wrote a cover letter in English, is it a immediate no?

I'm also applying to Canadian cities, such as Vancouver and Montreal. These are the only Canadian cities I'm interested in.


All the advice I receive tells me to quit AFTER securing a job. This means move after securing the job. But if location is limiting me, would it be worth it to just move to the city? 


I could potentially get a job at Starbucks or somewhere temporary. Airbnb a couple spots until I secure a job. At which point I'd look for a place.

My stats (GPA, test scores) are all at the level they need to be to apply to very selective schools, but I'm a bit worried I'm lacking the extracurricular ""spikes"" a lot of students in this sub have. I don't have any internship experience as I live in an area without a major tech sector. I also never really knew about the possibility of helping with research until it was too late. I've spent countless hours programming various projects - but nothing that can really be displayed on an application. I don't have a killer app with thousands of downloads or a website with thousands of weekly hits.

I have, however, displayed a strong academic aptitude in Computer Science. I was one of 66(?) students to achieve a perfect score on the AP CompSci test when I took it, and I've been taking computer science classes at the state university near me through a dual enrollment program. I've taken an Algorithms and Data Structures class and gotten an A, and am hoping to get As in the Machine Architecture and Discrete Math/CS classes I'm taking right now, which have a reputation for being tougher (weed-out) classes. Next semester I'm enrolling in 2-3 more CS classes. Will my performance in these classes (and the fact that I'm taking them) give me a boost? I know many students here have taken advanced math or hard science courses, but I feel like this is more rare for Computer Science.

As a side note - I was employed last summer helping to teach programming and have founded/planned/instructed an after-school programming class at the local middle school. Are these activities at all notable, or more par-the-course for top students?"

This is going to be a long post so bear with me.

I am a 16 year old from Pakistan currently in A-1(Junior Year). I will be applying next year to US universities and am requesting a little evaluation. So I'm go to share the details now:

I study in a semi-private school in Pakistan; its name is Aitchison College. You can google it. It's one of the best schools in Pakistan. The only reason I'm sharing this is because I've heard that the opportunities you are provided in school play an important role and I had no shortage of those. I'd hate to come across as arrogant so please don't assume that!

I gave my Ordinary Level Exams (equivalent to IGCSE, I don't know what the American equivalent is) in May-June 2016 and I recieved the following result:

English-A*

Maths-A*

Physics-A*

Chemistry-A*

Computer Science-A*

Additional Maths-A (This is a hard subject)

Pakistan Studies-A

Islamiat-A

Urdu-B (My native language :( )

Here are some of my extra-curriculars(they're only OK):

- Runner-Up in the Brain of Aitchison competition

- 2nd Best Chess Player in my school

- Won 1st prize in an inter-school Environmental Summit

- Won 2nd prize in an inter-school Photography competition

- A 2 year affiliation with Door Of Awareness(An NGO dedicated to eradicating illiteracy). I've done for them:Social Media Promotion, Teaching, Collecting funds, advertisement campaigns, organising charity drives

- Went on a 2 week French course to France in 2013. I've dropped French since then

- Executive Member of Chess Society 

- Executive Member of Quiz Society (will become General Secretary at the end of this year, I think)

- Internship at Baaghi.TV, a web based newspaper, for a period of 3 months as an article writer. Had to write one article per day 6 days a week. Best Article gained over 120,000 views. 

- Internship at Rising Sun, a disabled children institute for 2 months

My current A-level subjects are:

- Maths

- Physics

- Chemistry

- Computer Science

I want to become an mechanical or chemical engineer so I've been thinking of applying to these schools:

1. Princeton

2. GeorgiaTech

3. Cornell

4. University of Illinois-UC

5. University of Michigan

6. UC Berkeley

7. UC Los Angelos

I've been studying for the SAT and am scheduled to take it on the 5th of November. I got a 1460 on the most recent diagnostic I took; I believe I will be able to push it over the 1500 mark by the time the exam takes place. Please note that this is my first try. My aim is 1530 and above and if I reach that I most likely won't retake it.

Recent Diagnostic Scores:

Math-770

English 690

I want you to be brutally honest, what are my chances to get into each university? Also, please guide as to what would be helpful in my university admissions that I can do this year. Any tips or suggestions would be hugely appreciated!

Thankyou everyone (in advance)!

57gvl6,2,2016-10-14,I was accepted in Georgia Tech's graduate program for Computer Science. Will it help me in my long-term career goals? Should I ever leave my full-time job for a graduate internship?,dtoc_tick_tock,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/57gvl6/i_was_accepted_in_georgia_techs_graduate_program/,"Hi all. As you may already know, GT's OMCS program is very affordable and a top-ten program. When all is said and done, it'll cost me around $6000 to $7000 to complete the degree. 

So cost-wise and reputation-wise, it's a no brainer. But will it help me with my long-term goals? My career goals are as follows:

1) Stick with my current role as a software engineer at a cool tech company until my stock vests. Primarily so I can get more experience and use the income to invest into real estate. 

2) If possible, get a senior role at a top tech company while continuing to invest in real estate.

3) Start working on my app idea (web app or mobile app, not sure yet) and if it works out, start my own business. 

As you can see, my ultimate goal is to maximize my income from my full-time job by going up the ranks. The reason for that is so I can invest into real estate for relatively passive income. And the reason I want the real estate is so that I can more easily quit my full-time job if my app idea(s) actually pan out into something that generates enough income for me to live off of.

I can see how the degree can help me get more senior roles at other tech companies. It would also help me to get graduate internships at top companies. But should I leave a full-time job for a graduate internship? I've left a full-time job at a small company before, to go intern at two hot companies in California (which is what ultimately let to me being fortunate enough to land a new-grad role I'm really happy with) but something tells me that doing that again, even if it's for a graduate internship at something like Google or Facebook, would lead to employers questioning my abilities. (Being that it'd look like I'm a serial intern or something)

And there's the time investment - what if the time I spend on the very difficult degree could be better spent on my app idea(s)? But then again, what if the stuff I'd learn from the degree enables me to make better apps? More performant and scalable apps? What if the knowledge from the curriculum is a hidden prerequisite to having a strong foundation of knowledge for my long-term goals? Maybe the network of people I can acquire will also help with my long-term goals?

Or should I just forget about the master's degree, since I'm getting competitive pay...and just focus on investing in real estate and spending my free time actually working on my app idea(s) rather than delaying to learn more theory? Thanks for any input, I apologize for the scattered thoughts. I didn't actually expect to get accepted into the program, so I've only recently begun thinking about these things at a deeper level. Would appreciate any feedback from managers, senior engineers, and people who have had some modicum of success with their own software companies or app ideas."

I worked last summer at a very large, prestigious financial company. Its culture is pretty relaxed, but very corporate. I will be invited back for this summer, but when I first got back to school I received a minor consumption charge, which I am currently going through a pre trial diversion program for. 

HR emailed me asking to set up a time for a call (I'm sure the reason being them extending an offer for the summer, they almost always make return offers to former interns). I'm wondering if I should tell them during the call about this, or wait until we are further along the process? 

I am concerned because as such a big corporation they may have policies that are not very flexible on things like this, but I can't say with any certainty. Even though they are very minor. I just want to make sure that I don't ruin this opportunity with poor timing, etc. I already know I was an idiot and made a dumb choice, I don't know how to phrase that exactly or when to bring it up. If they do a background check (they will) they will see something that says something like minor consumption - deferred dismissal). 

Any guidance would be really appreciated!

57i0mm,6,2016-10-14,Please help! Go back to wildlife biology?,PapayaNuevo,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/57i0mm/please_help_go_back_to_wildlife_biology/,"Dear Reddit,

I am basically struggling with a decision. 

I graduated from a top US public university in 2012. I had dreamed of becoming a wildlife biologist, but could not pass a math class due to a later-discovered learning disability (that, had I known about, I could have gotten special accommodations with). I had spent my three years engrossed in research outside of class and was fine in statistics, but was having difficulty passing pre-calculus. I was kicked out of the major in my third year and basically graduated depressed and with no idea what I was going to do.  My entire resume was based on the idea that I would go to graduate school for wildlife biology, with research outside of class, internships at the park service, etc every summer. 

Basically, my life was destroyed. I ended up graduating with a BA in Environmental studies and a minor in conservation biology. My major advisors told me that because I was unable to pass the series needed for the BS, I would have 0 chance at ever becoming a wildlife biologist, and I should just give up my dream completely, because I would NEVER be able to enter a master’s program. I was so depressed and I just lied and told everyone I had just lost interest in the field, because I was so embarrassed about my difficulties passing this class and so tired of people telling me I was “just lazy” and if I just “Tried harder” I could have passed.

My research advisors were furious, and disowned me, and told me I was making a huge mistake, and never wanted to talk to me again. 

The next four years were awful. I couldn’t get employed for 7 months after graduation beyond tutoring, and was  depressed enough to go to some very dark places because I had no idea what I was going to do, thinking that I was hopeless and just hating myself for having failed on my dream, and feeling deep despair.  I taught English in Europe for a year and a half, and basically ended up doing communications and marketing in nonprofits. I’m a talented writer and graphic designer, so it was easy for me to learn this occupation, but it is definitely not my passion. It was basically the only thing I could learn quickly enough on my own to get a job. 

I am now almost 27, and after my three years of communications and marketing experience at nonprofits being pretty awful, I ‘m applying for normal businesses. The salaries I’m getting quoted now in interviews are lucrative, in the 70k-80k range.

HOWEVER, I don’t like what I’m doing. I know how to do it, but it’s not my passion. After so many years of barely scraping by and having to rely on my parents, the idea of actually making a living is a godsend.

By chance last year, I found out that basically what my advisors told me at my school was not correct. I was looking at master’s degrees in Europe (where I would like to go), and I found out that actually, I WOULD have been able to apply straight to a master’s and then a PhD with my degree, despite not having taken the pre-determinded BS path that all the pre-med students at my universities took. When I found this out, my heart broke, because I felt like at that point…based on some very bad advice, I had wasted the last 4 years of my life. I tried so hard to convince myself that I didn’t want to be a wildlife biologist because I was told it was impossible. So I just convinced myself and everyone around me that I just didn’t want to do that path anymore. 

Now I just don’t know what to do. My dream job would be to be researcher at an NGO directing a project, living in a major European city, traveling a lot.. I would love to go back and get that master’s and PhD, but now I am almost 27. Had I not received that horrible advice back in undergrad, I would have gone straight to grad school. I know that pay in wildlife bio is really bad, and I will most likely have to bounce around, moving from place to place, with really low paid seasonal jobs until I am able to get my dream job at an NGO or nonprofit, or working at some sort of institute. I would like to live in or near a major city.

When I was fresh out of college, no problem! Now I am almost 27 and I am just very worried about this prospect. Getting a masters, and then living on minimum wage, never being in the same place for too long.. I do want to get married, start a family at some point. I have been so stressed out being so poor for so long. I feel like whichever choice I make, I lose. I’m trying to get a Polish passport at the moment through my grandparents but it’s a very long and complicated process. My other plan was to do a master’s in Europe and try to get married there for a visa. 

These are my choices:
1.	Stick in my current career, marketing and communications. Try to develop some skills in an area I like better (more creative stuff, video, design, etc). I am a very talented writer when I am working professionally and also a talented and passionate artist/visual designer. Make good money, not worry about money, be able to live in a major city, move back to Europe. Basically have the life I want, but not pursue my passion that I’ve had since childhood and engulfs me..animals, and the environment, and travel…
I thought maybe what I could do was switch to some sort of media production and try to make media about the environment or wildlife. But maybe I would regret that I wasn’t doing science for the rest of my life?? I don’t know. 

2.	Apply for a master’s in something related to wildlife or environmental studies (since I highly doubt I would be accepted into a PhD program straight, having been out of the field for so long). I would probably be 27 or 28 by the time I started. Since, from what I understand, the types of jobs I would want are only attainable with a phd, I would go to a European PhD program By the time my schooling would be done, I would be 33. I might not get the job I want (and pay beyond minimum wage) until I’m 40. 

I honestly can’t figure out what route to decide. Please help. I have been getting panic attacks over this.  I feel so confused, I don't even know what I want anymore, because I've spent so long trying to force myself to do stuff I don't like."

At first I was excited about the perspective of working alongside more senior devs and learning from them but all I see is people that don't really care about what they are doing.

Based on what I read here on Reddit and other forums, Twitter, etc., I was under the impression that the average software developer is WAY better than what I've encountered in my workplace or even in my school. I keep reading reports of people reading The Pragmatic Programmer, interviewing at Google and Amazon, doing whiteboard coding with complex algorythms, and most of my classmates don't even come close to that. They struggle with the basics and the few that can actually deliver are extremely sloppy, write unreadable/unmaintainable code, have no idea what KISS and DRY mean, etc.

At work, when I talk to the other devs about some Node app I did, they mock it because ""Node is single threaded"". If I mention other languages like Javascript (they're mostly Java folks), they complain about ""never knowing the sequence of stuff in Javascript code"" (because of async). Code reviews are a distant dream. System architects are more worried about font sizes than good underlying design. My QA lead not only does not know what a HTTP request is, but also keeps asking me questions about how to use his test tools. And the other day I had a nice opportunity to visit the headquarters of a company that supply us with a famous Java framework and the consultant I talked to resorted to just walk me through the online tutorials that they have on their own website.

I'm by no means a senior dev, but I strive to be good at what I do. Last year I was offered a full-time job less than two months into an internship, and my managers are raving about the stuff I'm shipping. I am constantly worried about stuff nobody seems to care like code style, readability, automation, performance, etc. So, where are all good devs at? Is my perception distorted somehow? Am I feeling entitled by the stuff I know, or just being a plain old jackass? What about your workplaces, are you guys able to exchange knowledge with other peers? Were all the good devs hired by Google/Facebook/Amazon/etc?

Any input is welcome, thanks in advance."

The only thing I might have going for me is that I have attended a ""occupational"" school in conjunction with my traditional high school for my Junior and Senior year. This allows me to take my core (Math, Science, Social Studies, English) classes at my traditional high school but after lunch I go to the occupational school for 4 hours to study just CS (last year) and Cybersecurity this year.

**Intended major(s):** Computer Science with either a dual major or minor/certificate in Cognitive Science.

**ACT:** 31 Composite but I'm retaking it next Saturday. (27 English, 29 Math, 32 Reading, 36 Science).

**Class rank:** 1st Quintile

**UW/W GPA:** 3.55/3.96

**Coursework:** I've taken/am taking 7 AP classes (US History (3), European History (3), Computer Science Python and Java, English Lang and Lit, Biology). I've also taken 3 honors classes.

**Awards:** Top of Class for Computer Science (1 of 2 in whole school of 1200). Honor Roll all of high school. 3.8+ GPA for 5 semesters straight.

**Extracurriculars:** Marching Band 8th grade - 11th grade (4 years). I'm also a part of something which is basically the same as National Honor Society for both my Junior and Senior year (Not available to under classmen). I also attended Lockheed Martin's CodeQuest Competition but didn't place. I've made my own little website business which currently has 4 clients and I've created 2 iOS apps. I also have received 3 **very** basic certifications related to computer science and I will have earned 2 or 3 more by the end of the school year. I also worked at my local grocery store for 1 year, and now I'm working for the Department of the Interior as a Computer Science Intern and should be through hopefully April.

**Schools:** I'm applying/already been accepted to CU Boulder/Denver/Colorado Springs, Colorado School of Mines, and CSU. Right now I'm looking at CU Boulder or Denver but I'm also going to apply to RPI, CMU, and UC Berkeley for my (very long) reaches. These colleges are the reason for this post because I feel like I'm nowhere near qualified to attend any of these except maybe RPI and everyone (aka my mom and my teacher) keep telling me to apply to CMU and UC Berkeley.

**Questions:** Any college suggestions? I'm very interested in machine learning/artificial intelligence (hence the Cognitive Science/CS Combo). Does anyone think I have an actual chance at CMU or UC Berkeley??

Thank you for the help! I greatly appreciate any (constructive) input!"
57jr3o,1,2016-10-14,Former Teacher--My Life Self-Imploded,divnadjevojka,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/57jr3o/former_teachermy_life_selfimploded/,"I'm going to try to do this without revealing any personal info about how my life has seemingly self-imploded at the age of 23.

I was always very driven and successful in high school and college, and ALWAYS wanted to be a history teacher. I grew up in the US in a state we'll call State A, and I went to a pretty fancy and well-regarded college in State B that was well-known for their history program (not so much for their education program--more on that later). Most of my focus / extracurriculars / internships in college were focused on teaching, specifically teaching ESL. My school had a 5-year pathway to do an MA in Teaching, and since I knew that I wanted to do that from the beginning and out of state tuition was expensive, I finished undergrad in 3 years and did my MA in my fourth year. At 21, I had my MA and teacher certification in Social Studies and ESL in State B. My parents helped me significantly with my education, and what they couldn't cover, I was able to cover myself by being a resident assistant / graduate assistant / thrifty with savings from my summer job, so when I graduated I was doing pretty well. I also had a long-term boyfriend from the first week of undergrad who I was (and still am) pretty sure that I was going to marry from basically the first date. 

Most of the people I graduated with took jobs in the public schools in State B. I had spent a summer teaching overseas and really enjoyed it (and even though student teaching went well, I was really intimidated by the thought of going into a classroom at 22 and staying there for the rest of my life), so I applied for a scholarship to teach overseas. I received it, and I spent the 2015-2016 school year teaching in the same city that I had taught in when I was in college. I was teaching university students, doing many education-related activities in the community outside of formal teaching, and I absolutely loved my job and being in my community--it was completely stress-free compared to teaching in the US, I felt very effective in the classroom (and I had data to prove it!), I learned so much about the community I was in, I had so many opportunities to travel throughout the region, I had really amazing friends, and I felt really loved and appreciated by the community I was in. Although my scholarship program is only one year, I offered an opportunity to stay in my placement for a second year. I declined in order to come back to the US and be with my now-fiance (we became engaged when he visited me), who was at that point working on his PhD in a state we'll call State C.

State C requires the edTPA (a teaching test that you have to do in the classroom during student teaching) to be certified. You can be hired on a provisional certification without taking this test, but you have to pass it in a year. I applied for teaching jobs in State C near my fiance, but most districts seemed reluctant to take on a teacher who was interviewing over Skype didn't have the full certification, for rather obvious reasons. I panicked at the thought of not having a job, and in May, I accepted a job to start that August at a charter school in a city in State C that was two hours drive from my fiance. The only reason I took the job was because there was a chance I could earn my full certification in State C working for that school. I'd never been to that city before, I was uncomfortable with some of the discipline procedures / ideology behind ""no excuse"" charter schools, and I was teaching out of field (ELA instead of Social Studies or ESL). I moved to this new city less than a week after returning to the US from my magical year abroad.

Teaching at that school in that new city went about as well as you would expect. I was miserable living by myself, miserable being back in the US after such an enriching year abroad, miserable enforcing an oppressive discipline system that I didn't believe in with my students, miserable giving to the minute scripted lessons that I had zero input in. I cried to my mom about how poor my classroom management was, in the eyes of my school, on the very first day. My mom asked me ""What were they doing, running around the classroom?"" ""No!"" I sobbed, ""They didn't all have their hands above their desk always."" Under any other school my classroom management would be considered fine, but I was struggling more than the other first year teachers and my supervisors let me know this in no uncertain terms. I always had pretty high anxiety, but I found myself unable to sleep because of the stress of work--I once woke up on my couch with the suicide prevention hotline up on my phone and no idea how I had gotten there. I made it through three weeks of training and two weeks of teaching, and then I came home to my parents in State A for a long weekend break. My parents and fiance were all concerned about my mental health living alone and dealing with the stress of work, and I decided then to give my two weeks notice. My school let me go with very little regrets, which was the last thing that my completely bruised ego needed. Everything was handled very professionally on both ends--the school chalked it up to a bad fit--but obviously I'm not getting a recommendation from them. I packed up and moved back home to State A with my mom and dad. It doesn't justify my situation, but almost every teacher that I talk to about the conditions at my school agrees that there were some really ridiculous things going on there and that I did the right thing by getting out before my students got attached to me. 

This was a month ago. I've submitted countless applications for non-teaching jobs, and have had a handful of interviews, but nothing full time yet. Right now I'm living with my parents in State A, and I am waiting for paperwork to go through to get my certification for State A. I'm working part-time at a medical administration company (and making more than I did while teaching doing so!) and part-time tutoring with a test prep company. Overall, financially, I'm making about the same as I am while teaching. 

I'm very lucky to have these opportunities, but I feel absolutely miserable and like a total failure all of the time.  I miss everything about teaching--the kids, being able to interact with rich material, being able to help students-- (like I did in student teaching and like I did when I was overseas, not the scripted robot ""teaching"" in the charter school) so much and I have no idea how I will get back in the classroom ever with my track record now. I have pretty much given up on getting a teaching job or certification in State C, where my fiance lives, and quite honestly I'm not sure I'll ever get any job that I'll find interesting or satisfying near him. His graduate school is in a very rural area, so job prospects are few. I have no idea what my bigger plan / career prospects are. I bit a lot of time when I was abroad thinking of what I would do if I decided not to teach in the US, and I found a career path that seemed interesting to me--working in international education advising and administration. Even though I do have a background to be competitive in that field, there are very few openings in State C where my fiance lives, so even having that dream seems like a moot point. I'm being treated for anxiety and depression right now, and my therapist thinks it's good that I'm only working part-time and living at home, but quite honestly without having a full time job that's in a field that's meaningful to me or a way of somehow living near my fiance, I don't think I will ever feel better about myself. I debated doing Americorps to be near him and get into nonprofit work, and was accepted to two mildly-interesting Americorps positions near him doing community nutrition education and workforce development, but my parents were strongly opposed to me living on such a low stipend so I turned down those offers. I know I'm lucky to have options even though I went completely nuclear, but I don't feel very lucky most of the time. 

I've thought of making a plan, especially now that I've stopped freefalling and have these two part-time jobs, but I don't know what to do because I've never considered any paths outside teaching. I can do a low-residency graduate certificate (or even a second master's) in International Education, which is the path I really wanted to do, but I know I have very few career prospects in State C near my fiance if I do that. I also am interested in working in higher ed, but folks keep telling me that I'll need another Master's in Higher Ed Administration or Student Affairs to get any positions there. I've already been accepted to a Student Affairs MS program in State B near my fiance, but I'm not sure how I can justify taking out all that debt to get a second master's after not using my first. At this rate, I'll be turning 25 or 26 with a ton of potential, two master's degrees in education-related fields, and no real work experience.

tl:dr- I'm an entitled millennial who quit my first real job in my field after five weeks and I have no idea where to go from here. 

Any advice?"

Recently I got two interviews, one dealing with testing Java code, the other was a Web Development gig(Both of which involved languages I have programmed a ton of leisure projects with). 

I don't want to brag, but I feel confident in my abilities as a Java programmer and Web Developer, enough that when it came to the technical questions(i.e. Explain difference in Polymorphism and Abstraction, What's the difference in Javascript Frameworks versus Javascript, the infamous WhiteBoard test) I felt like I nailed each question.

Both of these organizations have sent me a response back saying that, while they were impressed with me, they felt I needed to provide stronger answers in the technical portion.

The first time this happened I initially thought it was because I answered too many of the questions incorrectly. So I cracked open my textbooks and studied for months. After a good while reviewing the material and going over my answers to their questions, I realized that most of my answers were correct.

The second time this happened I did the same thing, and again, I didn't find anything incorrect about my responses.

So I'm extremely confused about what I did wrong in these interviews. When an interviewer is looking for ""Stronger Answers"" what are they looking for?"

I have no idea what I qualify for. where should I look?",schnoodly,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/57ka8m/graduating_with_an_associates_in_programming_but/,"Howdy,

So basically, next semester I'm set to graduate with an Associate's degree in ""IT - Programming"", which basically just covers most everything programming, from JavaScript/HTML/jQuery to mySQL, C# to Java, and even Android. I have a decent amount of experience now in all of these, but any jobs I can find ask for 5+ years and a Master's degree to intern in a Junior Programming job, etc(this is an exaggeration, but also a real example)... But I can't afford to continue on to a Bachelor's, financially/emotionally/mentally at this point. It would take way too long to explain why, but basically since I can't guarantee a job, I'm not going to go into a ton of debt for something that could fail, leaving me worse off.

I live in southern Illinois, and despite all my searching, (the closest cities being Champaign and Effingham that are techy) I can't find very much ""Junior-rated"" stuff, especially in what I'm qualified for. At the same time, I have no idea what I'm doing. I've been working my way from high school throughout college, for Verizon for nearly 2 years as Sales in person, and a local hospital for a little over half a year now just as  material distribution (fancy for stocking storerooms). 

I don't know what else I can be doing besides applying for jobs that I have no idea what they're even actually about, and just working on personal projects in what little spare time I have.

Does anyone have suggestions for what I could be looking into? Or maybe a nearby-ish location to look around? I don't even actually know what job titles I'd be qualified for. Would I know enough to work in Big Data? Mobile dev? .NET dev? Am I making sense? I've been looking for so long just trying to put my name out there that I feel like I'm flopping in a large, dark, empty warehouse."
57kjpr,12,2016-10-15,My depression/anxiety are causing me to procrastinate on something that could ruin my future.,FelineFupa,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/57kjpr/my_depressionanxiety_are_causing_me_to/,"I'm a 21 year old woman who is currently a senior at an Art school. My degree is a BFA in animation. For this major I must complete a senior film by the end of the year. The lack of immediate deadline is causing me to put things off like it's my job. 

My problem is that I cannot stop procrastinating and I am quickly destroying my chances of creating something that will get me an internship or job after graduation. 

Quick background: 
My childhood was bad. I had parents who shouldn't have gotten married or had kids. When they divorced my mom was always angry (bipolar). This led to me using books, games, etc to escape from her and my life. I did great in school but began to develop bad procrastination habits and poor social skills. 

Current situation: 
The same methods I used to escape my mom have crept their way into my workload this year. I have done really well in school and I'm a *great* artist, but the fear of falling short has caused me to retreat inward. I lost motivation and kept putting things off until now. I have lost so much time already and am worried that I cannot come back from this. I'm mad at myself for not reaching my full potential but I don't know how to turn it around. I feel like I'm addicted to procrastinating due to my fear of failure. 

I don't really have anyone to talk to about this. I am unable to receive medication because of financial and familial reasons. I will one day, but right now I HAVE to figure out how to get trough this myself. 
If I don't get my shit together I'm going to destroy my future and that *terrifies* me. 

Tl;dr: I am addicted to escaping my responsibilities via procrastination and it has worked up until now. How do I break this before it breaks me? "

I feel like it's elementary school again and we're picking teams for football, and no one wants me on their team. One of the the things that bugs me the most about this is I can't even pinpoint a reason; if I had a reason, I'd at least know what to improve, but it seems like I'm not getting a job because of something intrinsic to my existence. Grades slightly better than average (3.6), experience worse but still there (I had 2 internships which combined lasted about 10 months). I have a masters degree in electrical engineering. US citizen (I have an ethnic last name though). I was fairly average for my graduating class, which some consider to be a bad thing, but average people get jobs. All my classmates have jobs. My friend and classmate who would get Cs on exams that I would get As on got a job a week after graduation. But here I am 10 months and hundreds of applications later and the job market is giving me the cold shoulder.

People try to comfort me, telling me ""Don't worry, you'll get a job eventually"". Ok, but then what? I'll still be weak, demoralized, humiliated, knowing that it took me 10+ months to get a job, and my boss will too - he'll know he can get away with underpaying me and I'll just have to accept it, because I won't be able to get another job since I'm the one that no one wants. And when I do get laid off or fired (it's inevitable that before I retire at 70 I will get laid off or fired at some point), I will probably be so devastated that I will kill myself, since I know how difficult it is for me to get a job.

It really bugs me that it seems to only be ME who can't get a job or interviews. Other people get jobs after looking for a few weeks. In fact, many husband and wife couples decide they want to move and they BOTH end up getting jobs IN THE SAME CITY. It utterly baffles me how it's possible for people to do this. How can you just choose you want to live in a certain city, and just get a job there? I feel like I've done things as good as I can to this point, so if it's hard for me to get a job now, it will be hard for me to get a job forever - once I get a job, I'm going to be permanently stuck with it until I get fired."

**TL;DR: Freshmen won a hackathon, prize is a paid internship. I haven't been able to stick to learning one language, and am looking for advice on how to stay focused on one language and ignore distractions to learn other things. Also, any internship advice stuff?**

I recently won a paid internship at a software/it company in the area. Internship-wise it is a great opportunity, though from what I hear/read, it isn't a place to have a career because they pay pretty low. However, they have higher-tier clients, they partner you with people with experience, and you do actual work on actual projects, and it pays more than my current IT position with the school. Not trying to go in detail on the company simply because it distracts from the question, but I'm just making it clear that it is a good opportunity that I want to take. Especially since I am a Freshmen coming off a 2-year gap year after high school, and I have always had a lot of drive.

My problem is, is that I have taken zero Comp Sci classes (first one is next semester), I have very basic knowledge in HTML/CSS, C, Python, and a couple Linux distros. When I say basic knowledge, I mean I got 30% through the HTML/CSS CodeAcademy lessons, 40% through my Python Udemy course, 45% through my C book (The Absolute Beginner's Guide to C), and my Bash/Powershell knowledge is doing maybe 15 total commands in Learn Python the Hard Way's Command Line Crash Course. I kept jumping to further understand what I was doing. By that I mean HTML/CSS didn't feel like ""programming"", Python felt too simple (stopped right before OOP), C is fine but I kept getting distracted by people wanting me to learn this or that. 

Basically I am struggling to stick with one thing, and could really use advice on how to stick to and follow through one language even when I have so many different distractions going on. For example, one time I switched from C to Python because the founder of a cybersecurity company in the area wanted me to do Python projects (he never sent me the projects). Or I began learning Linux systems to set up the right environment for Athena MHD simulations for my undergraduate research.

Really just looking for guidance on this. Generally I am fairly good about managing my time and prioritizing, but right now I am definitely struggling and could use some clarity. I do not yet know what exactly my tasks would be with the internship, but the competition dealt with C#.

57rkxg,1,2016-10-16,When does persistency become annoying? Really want a job with this institution!,dendr0id,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/57rkxg/when_does_persistency_become_annoying_really_want/,"I apologize for the wall of text below. I want to give as much useful information as possible but I also do need to be a little vague for sake of privacy. 

A few months ago, I applied for a part-time position within the education department of a local, mid-sized institution. I have a BA in a very relevant field study and a Master's in education, so I am well qualified for the position. I went ahead and applied even though it’s just a part time position because it's a great way to get my foot in the door and financially I'd be okay. Plus, you gotta start somewhere! It’s a well-known joke that the institution is slow-moving with their interview/hiring processes and it was about a month before I was contacted for a phone interview. I was then asked to come in for an in person presentation (basically to do an example of a task I would do in the position). This would be in front of the education team and I’d have a panel interview with the team afterwards. I honestly thought the position had been filled because it was no longer online but the HR person confirmed that hiring practices are slow moving and that they were very interested in interviewing me.
I was a little shaky on the presentation portion but it did not go poorly. I felt like I killed the interview. I had 9 current team members asking me questions and more than anything, it felt like a conversation with peers -- not an interview. We all seemed to jive well and the tasks required in the position were similar to those I have completed in previous volunteer and intern positions. I was asked about my degrees and why I was applying for a part time job so I told the truth: foot in the door, something I'm passionate about, have to start somewhere and this is the department/field/institution I want to work in, etc. A few of the members asked about my interest in moving up to a full time position if one came available later and I of course expressed my interest in doing so, if the opportunity arose. The interview wrapped up, the HR person walked me out and we had a nice conversation on our way out. He let me know their practice is to let interviewees know either way, which I know, is uncommon and I expressed my gratitude for that. Sent a follow up thank you email within 48 hours to thank HR person and the team.


A few weeks went by and I heard nothing, but a full time position came open online in the same department - a step up from the position I just interviewed for. I know I am qualified education and skills wise, but I do not have much resume work experience. I went straight from undergrad to graduate school, but I have volunteered and done internships in relevant areas that have helped me acquire skills that would be beneficial in the position. Since I knew the same HR person and team would do interviews for the position, I used my same resume and took the opportunity to use my cover letter* to allude to points in our conversation during the interview. Applying for this position wasn't exactly a long shot, but it wasn't a guarantee either. I wanted to relay my desire to work within that department and show my persistence, so I applied.


A few days after applying for the full time position, I got an automated email telling me when compared with other applicants, my resume was lacking and they did not want to pursue me further in the hiring process for the full time position. A week after that, the position was taken off the website. A little disappointing but again, not too surprising to me since I have not had work experience in that department before. Another part-timer could have moved up and that could be why they had to post the job online, knowing someone within the department would probably fill it. Or there were just better applicants. I don’t know, but I am grateful to have gotten the email so I’m not on my toes 24/7. 


Now, it has been about a month and a half since my interview and I still have not heard anything back. As mentioned several times earlier, I do know the company’s hiring practices are slow but they did not give me a timeframe or any kind of a reference to when they would deliberate over the applicants and it’s been radio silence from the HR contact. At 6 weeks out, I just want to assume they’ve hired someone else but HR did assure me I would hear “yes” or “no” back. The part-time position has not been listed online since I first applied, but the full-time position is still listed and I believe it is the same position I applied for and heard “no thanks” back from. I’m at a loss of what to do. I would really like to email the HR person but at this point, I feel like it would be annoying and way overdoing things. I am incredibly interested in working at this institution in general, but especially in this department/position. There are other positions in other departments I meet the qualifications to apply for, but I really have my heart set on this one. 

I’m looking for advice on whether or not I should contact HR and if so, what I should say. I’d also love to hear any stories/situations/additional advice you Redditors have for me in this situation. Thanks in advance!

Whenever I practice by myself and verbalize my thoughts I'm fine.

But when the real interview comes around, I get really nervous and  can hear my heart beating fast as I wait for the call. This only happens for technical interviews, behaviorals are totally fine for me.

The reason it seems is because the actual interview really counts and I'm nervous at the fact that I only have usually 2 shots (for interns) at not messing them up. (Messing up meaning I don't solve their ds/algo question in time)

TL;DR: Do you guys have any rituals/things you do before technical interviews to calm down and have thought clarity?"

I'm not sure if there's a way to do this, but I'm looking for any line of CS work I can steer myself towards that would involve a large amount of (international) travel.

For context: 27 years old, freshly earned undergraduate degree, looking at grad school. Already financially comfortable due to some family stuff (not retirement comfortable, but enough money and property that I can take some time sorting out my income stream). I did very well in school and had a good internship, so I feel like I've got a lot of options planning my life going forward.

I've also come to realize a couple things about myself: One is that I love travel, and another is that I hate vacations. I tend not to do well when I don't have obligations, stress and structure around me.

So, I'm considering the possiblity of seeking out a career that would want me to move around a lot, work in foreign cultures, etc. Unfortunately, I don't know if such a thing exists in the world of CS, because it's so much easier to just telecommute, and we don't have a lot of super location-dependent stuff, at least not for software.

Anyone know if there are exceptions to that, maybe some cross-discipline thing that requires both CS knowledge and field work? I feel like I have a lot of flexibility in terms of where I end up, even if it means picking up another field of study during my grad school years... just need to know where to aim."

So, my concern is: Is CS 173 worth my time taking it or should I just study it till the proficieny exam level (or somewhat beyond that) and take its proficienty exam?

If I were not goint to take CS 173, is there any other CS courses recommended?

My mental health has gone down the toilet. Thanks.,tired_duck,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/57wx84/started_a_new_job_that_isnt_at_all_what_they/,"I have a BA in German, French and Linguistics. 3.89 GPA, Magna Cum Laude. I was working as a bartender for a few years before I moved to Germany with my husband because I didn't know what I wanted to do. I am positive I could leave this position and work as a bartender until another job pops up. My husband and I also have a very comfortable amount of savings to live off of for up to a year if I needed to. I now want to start working in business translation, language specialization or English editing and copywriting. There seems to be a high demand for native English speakers in my city, so I have started applying this weekend. On to my issue:

Basically, I just got married and moved to Germany. Got hired pretty quickly as an English teacher at a bilingual Kindergarten.  They said they had a hard time keeping the native English speaking teacher and were eager to hire me. Now I know WHY. The job advertisements, interviews with the bosses, etc all indicated that I would be teaching in a structured environment. They even had me do lesson plans and teach during the interview process. To be honest, I don't even like kids and only took the job because it's well paid and decided I would do it until I got a job in a corporate environment doing translation, English language specialization, copywriting, etc.

Anyways, they basically told me, after I signed the contract, that there as no chance the kids in my class would learn English. They're too rowdy and have since asked me to just work as a teacher's assistant to control the children all day long. I've already gotten really sick, had to visit the doctor multiple times and have been vomited on. They've asked me to wipe runny noses and comfort kids when they cried and told me to forget about lesson planning.

Since then, I have come home almost every night this month in tears of frustration. I'm really upset. I can't sleep at night and wake up with my heart racing. I can barely eat and I'm really embarrassed by how they've changed since they interviewed me. My husband told me to quit and just full time job search, enjoy decorating our apartment and that we can afford it financially if I want to.

However, I am worried hat I won't have a chance to find another job if I have another long gap in my resume. That being said, I only finished up my degree in August (remaining credits). I also have experience (a few internships) along with my degrees. I sent out a few applications this weekend, waiting to hear back. These positions all require native speakers of English with linguistic experience. 

My husband and I are fairly confident I will be able to get an entry level position. Until then, we have the savings that could hold us over until I found something. If I can't find anything by the end of the year, I wouldn't mind going back to school next fall for a Master's degree. 

I'm sorry for the word vomit in this post. I'm so anxious. My question is, if I leave this job that I've only been at for a month, is that foolish? I hate to live off of savings long term if I can't find anything, but my mental health is deteriorating. 

Do you think I could leave? I applied to a ton of places this weekend and was planning on giving notice the end of this week until I saw that this subreddit advises against leaving jobs until I have another secured.

I just can't imagine even another month here. This is the worst job I've ever had and was NOT advertised accurately. I can't stand it. I'm tearing up writing this post.

Any advice? Can I leave if I can afford living off of savings and even returning to school next fall? Or would that look really bad? 

Thanks in advance!"

I'm a junior computer science major. I've loved all of my programming courses so far, especially data structures, because most of the assignments have been interesting puzzles that require me to think of interesting solutions, sort of like what you find on r/dailyprogrammer.

This hasn't been my experience in the work place. I've had a programming job on campus for over a year and I also did an internship this summer. In both of these cases I've been doing web programming as well as some basic IT work. I've found both of these experiences to be profoundly boring and uninteresting because they lack the programming challenges that I enjoy in class. Everything is just subtle variations on moving data around in a database.

Is this something other people have experienced? Am I setting myself up for a career full of boring programming challenges, or is this just something every junior programmer goes through? Do I need to go to grad school if I want to qualify myself for the more challenging and interesting stuff?

**TLDR**: The programming I do at work isn't as interesting as what I've done in class. Am I going to have a dull career?"

I'm planning to change my laptop this year before leaving for internship abroad. I'm looking for something easy to travel with long battery life.

* **Total budget and country of purchase:** 
France - 1300€. Can go higher if justified.

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
2-in-1 if possible (Would prefer 2 in 1 over classic even if it means to go 100€ higher).
I'd like to be able to use it a whole day, i.e. ~7-8H of web-browsing/programming, ~5-6H of video streaming

* **How important is weight to you?**
Weigh will be a deciding factor. Between 1 and 1.5kg would be ideal. I won't consider anything above 2kg.

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac.**
Windows 10, I'll add a dual boot later.

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
13""-14""

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. If you have no requirements, put N/A.** 
I'm doing a bit of gaming and photo editing.
However, my biggest deal here is that I don't know if I really need a dedicated GPU. As a student in computer science, I'm currently doing a project using theano (a python library for deep learning) which I run on GPU. I have access to a professional GPU in the laboratory of my school but I still use my own laptop GPU (GT920M) to run some small scripts. Starting next semester, I'll be doing an internship in signal processing where I'll need to use matlab and python. I don't know if I'll have access to a GPU in my new laboratory so I think it can be useful to have one on my new laptop.
The ultrabooks with GPU I've seen so far are most of the time heavier, with low battery life and cooling problems. I'd rather have an ultrabook portable with long autonomy. So for now, I’m focusing on models without dedicated GPU.

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**
Since I will probably have to give up on the GPU, I want to at least have a good CPU (i7-6500U or a Kaby Lake).
I would like to know if the Kaby Lake really overwhelms the Skylake. And are the Y versions of Kaby Lake performing enough for my usages?

Right now, the models that seems to fit me the most are :

Dell Inspirion 13 5000 2in1 (i7-7500U, 16GB, 256GB SSD) - 950€

HP spectre pro x360 G2 (i7-6600U, 8GB, 512GB SSD) - 1350€ (I have nearly 20% discount on most of HP store)

Aside from not going to a top-tier school, I feel like I should be a pretty good candidate for a SWE position.

I'm roughly about a month into my job search and fortunately have been getting good responses and the opportunity to interview at a few places. My issue is, I fucking suck at the technical questions during interviews. I know that I'm fairly personable and can answer behavioral questions quite well. I know that I can even answer CS theory questions quite well. But when tasked to actually implement something I blow it. I know that I'm a fairly good programmer because I've been told so by past advisers. However, when solving problems I typically do a lot of trial and error and research, I don't do stuff on the spot.

I had a phone interview 2 days ago where the only question I was asked was to implement a linked list. The interviewer had to hold my hand through the whole thing. I felt (and still feel) like a complete dumbass who's not going to ever get an offer (Looking specifically in NYC and NJ). Implement quick sort? Can't do it. Print the paths in a binary tree? Can't do it. I honestly don't even have a desire to work at a huge company that'd make me tons of money; I'm perfectly fine working at a mid-tier company where I'll make $60,000 a year. I'd even be fine doing IT/SysAdmin type stuff.

Does this really just come down to practice? Once I solve x amount of LeetCode questions is something going to just magically click? I feel so discouraged because I feel as though I can't even answer the simplest of questions.

I already feel like I kind of shot myself in the foot because I sent out *way* too many applications and have been bombing interview after interview. I feel like I'm screwing myself over because I should have applied to these companies later on and instead used my time to study. Should I stop applying to places and just focus on studying these next couple of months?

I would like to be a professor, but am not particularly interested in doing research or anything other than teaching. This leads me to believe that a Community College job would be a good fit for me.

Are tenure-track engineering jobs at community colleges hard to come by? If no, then should I pursue a masters in mathematics instead?

Is a masters sufficient for teaching at a CC? I do not particularly want to commit to a phD.

Is research expected of CC teachers?

Does prestige of the school matter for a masters? I can get into a good school, but I would prefer to stay at the state school I go to that is significantly cheaper.


I am considering enrolling a masters program for Mechanical Engineering at my school that would allow me to teach courses both during my masters, as well as after. It would not be a tenure track position, and wouldn't pay great. Is this experience worth it? If there is no market for mechanical engineering at Community Colleges then I may just go for a masters in math instead.

Every ""big city"" around this area is about 2 hours from my college town, and practically every CS grad ends up working in the closest major city and usually at the company that I have an internship with next summer. I don't want to be like the rest. I want to move out of the Midwest to a location with more culture, history, things to do, etc. I want to live in a big city that isn't in the middle of nowhere. I'm not thinking of Silicon Valley jobs(although not opposed) I mainly just want to move to a big city-very interested in DC, Boston, Philly(are these good for tech?). I have no boyfriend and absolutely nothing that makes me want to stay in this area besides proximity to my family. I'm just worried that going to a small state school with subpar academics will hold me back from being recognized by companies in bigger cities that are not in the Midwest if that makes sense.

Basically just wondering if hoping to move to a big city across the country and score a decent entry level job is being too optimistic? Also if anyone has suggestions on cities that are good for tech that aren't in the Midwest, that'd be cool. 

Thanks!"

I am a third-year Biomedical Science undergraduate student, minoring in Computer and Information Science. I have a great GPA at a non-target state school, and a strong computational data science research background. I recently completed a Machine Learning/Data Science internship with the Max Planck Society in Munich, Germany.

I realized my passion for coding too late; I'm already far into my major. I've noticed that employers aren't too interested in hiring me as an intern because I don't have a CS degree. I'm hoping to minimize the damage by attending an elite CS grad school, but will I even be admitted to one of these school without a CS degree? Is it worth me trying to double-major in CS?

I do love programming as I have done a lot of it during my degree years. However, the job that I got is very different from what I expected and wished it to be. Not to mention, I can't really ask questions around, as they are very busy with their jobs.
Now, I'm feeling useless in office, unmotivated whenever I have to wake up in the morning for work, and feeling depress every time. currently, to me one hour is like a day, it just feels so long. my reason to apply for this job is to enhance my programming skills, but now I have lost those reasons.
Now, I have only two choices, whether to move to another department as an IDM (or technical implementation, includes software testing) or stay as IOS programmer. Quitting the job and move to another company is definitely not a choice to me. Frankly, I have no idea what IDM/Tester is all about, as this is my first job in my entire life. but I hope it could makes me feel better.

I'm 27,  I have:
A BA in Journalism
6 years in the army reserve, ended as a sergeant but never deployed or anything.
2-3 years working security
2-3 years doing electrical construction work
no idea what the hell I even want to do with myself.  Basically my only goals at this point are to have health insurance and be able to take time off occasionally, oh and not abhor the work/people (which is what disqualifies my current job)

So the abbreviated life story:  Out of high school I didn't know what I wanted to do besides join the army.  I also wanted to go to college so I joined the reserves, they paid for it but otherwise I kind of hated it.  I couldn't really figure out what I wanted to do in college, but as the military was paying for it I just kept going, eventually getting my BA in journalism, which was at least interesting to me, though by the end the prospect of a career in it seemed pretty distasteful, I also hadn't done any oh so valuable internships because I couldn't stop working.  My last year, with my GI bill and bonus money drying up I needed a full time job (I'd been working part time at a dairy queen), a friend suggested security because it was easy, so off I went.  I stayed there probably far too long (it was VERY easy) but eventually decided to 'make something of myself' and went to a short 3 month night school to learn a trade.  

I've been doing electrical work for a few years now, and while at first I was pretty happy to be out working with my hands.  Working outdoors in the winter and having an aching back/knee/wrist all the time apparently gets to me faster than the old timers.  

Right as I was about to quit about 8 months ago however I finally got accepted into the union, at last, benefits and decent pay!  Well obviously I don't like this either, the pay is better but everyone is a dick, and it's really a commitment to a career (5 years of night school...)  I've just recently finally decided for sure I don't see myself making a career of this.  Which finally brings us to my problem.

I am still more or less where I was when I started college... I don't really have an interest, and certainly not experience in anything that could feasibly be a career, I just know I don't want to be where I am.  The only thing I do that someone would feasibly pay for is drawing but... damn it's a competitive field and I got a really late start, frankly I'm just nowhere near good enough.  Maybe if I could find the time to really hunker down and study, in a few years I'd have something workable,  but its tough to get more than one or two hours a night most of the time.  I'm doing my best to improve but it really doesn't feel like enough, it doesn't feel like it would ever be a viable career.

The only things I think I have working for me right now are a pretty cheap living situation, which stands to remain so as long as I stay in this city.  I could probably work 3-4 days a week and still easily afford rent and food at my current rate (though I'd barely be able to save if at all)  That and my boyfriend/family could act as a bit of a safety net. Though it would really pain me to have to rely on them like that, it does allow me at least some degree of freedom to take risks.

I realize I've vomited a lot of words into this post now without really having any specific question beyond ""help pls?""  I guess I'm just wondering if there are any obvious avenues I'm missing, or if anyone can point me to somewhere where  I can figure out what the hell I want to do.  Anyway, thanks for reading."

I want to gain experience with AI, distributed system, and scalability from next co-op.
I think that it is likely to involve those types of work as an infrastructure software engineer in a good software driven company. That's why I applied for the job.

The description of responsibility is like

- Implement code fixes under the direction of software architects and senior developers 

- Develop well-tuned code that may be included as part of our next software release 

- Contribute to our suite of automated tests and testing infrastructure

From the description above, I am kind of worried that if this internship is just going to be just fixing bugs and writing unit tests.

I understand that, in general, Infrastructure Software Engineer job is going to be like developing tools/framework with best practices and making products scalable so that other software engineers can work more efficiently. But I still can't imagine what I will be working on.
Can somebody share more specific insights as a Software Engineer in Infrastructure in general? Possibly at Salesforce?
What did you do while working as Infrastructure Software Engineer?

I suppose that the automated test and testing infrastructure is gotta be more than just writing unit tests / UI tests associated with CI. What is it actually like?"

In high school, I was anticipating college as an ideal time to find a girlfriend, but after coming here and deciding to study Computer Science, it's beginning to dawn on me that I'm going to have to choose between doing that or failing my classes. 

My coursework is extremely heavy, and adding that with the necessity of finding an internship for the summer (vital for my future career), I find I am spending my entire week waking up, going to the library, going to classes in between, and then returning back to the library to work until late. I have not had an entire day off this entire semester, and I spend the little free time I have on Friday nights relaxing on my own, playing music, and going to bed early because I am so exhausted from the week. And the worst part is I've found that my intense studying is the only way I'll even pass the classes I'm in, because I'm not the smartest student in my major, and it generally takes me significantly longer than others to learn the same material. 

There are girls I am interested all over the place. I flirt with cute girls in class all the time. Beyond class time, however, I find I have almost no time to spend with them, if I want to ask them out. Example: I was talking to a cute girl in one of my language classes the other week, got her number, and asked if she wanted to study sometime. She told me yes, and listed off the times she was free. I had an interview during the first time, I had class during the second, and I had an exam the day after the third, so I couldn't. Another example is with a girl I've been friends with for like a year now. She recently invited me to an overnight retreat with her organization and really made it seem like she wanted me there. I had an exam coming up in two days whose material I was extremely behind on, so I told her I couldn't go. 

Things like these are what's making me so depressed. My entire social and love life is getting fucked over by school and there's absolutely nothing I can do about it unless I want to fail my classes. And some of you may think its possible for me to take some time off from studying to hang out with girls and still not fail, but I want to emphasize how much of a slow learner I am. It is hardly as feasible for me as it might be for someone more intelligent. I'm beginning to regret choosing Computer Science as a major for this reason, but at this point I'm in too deep to change anything. I'm sad and I don't know what to do, and I need your advice.

I work at a small, privately owned veterinary clinic.  I started there in mid 2014 as an intern for a program I was enrolled in at the local community college.  After my internship hours were over and I passed the test for my approval title, the doctor gave me a full-time job as a veterinary assistant.  After about a year I was trained upwards as a technician (I live in a state where you don't have to be a CVT to be a VT if that makes sense).  A few months later, I had a rather unexpected change in my life and I had no choice but to relocate for another job since I had to move to drastically different area.  It was a dark time in my life but I got through it.  Once my schedule became more manageable, I reached out to the doctor and he offered me a part-time position again.

While I was gone he had hired Penny to pick up some of the slack since he was short a tech.  Penny was a former client of the practice.  She had worked at doggy-daycare centers for a few years before, so he offered her a job as a kennel tech/tech assistant.  The job was meant to be temporary until my boss was no longer short-staffed.

Anyways, when I got hired back on unnoticed immediately that Penny had a little bit of a different vibe to her than the other girls.  The day I met her she immediately asked me about my experience in the vet field and tried to show me around the clinic.   I understood she was trying to be helpful, so I kindly let her know that I had been working there for 2 years before.  She seemed surprised that I was the person that my coworkers had mentioned.  I am several years younger than her and I am also very petite, short, and baby-faced.  Let's just say that even though I'm an adult, I look like a fifteen year old at best.  I get ID'd fucking everywhere.  It was an understandable mistake.

Until it kept on happening.  Penny continued to be incredibly patronizing to me and oftentimes tried to correct me on things I was doing.  These were things that I had learned in school.  I was doing them correctly and my other coworkers verified that.  She tried to teach me what certain terms and abbreviations meant.  She claimed that she had more experience than me because she had worked at a doggy daycare for 5+ years.  One day she tried to explain to me why it was important to use a 20g needle instead of a 22g for a certain injection. She was then corrected by the doctor and told to use a 22g.  She implies that I have no idea what I'm doing.  I was patient at first, but I am slowly beginning to get more and more fucking angry about it.  There were several instances where she would leave messes and then tell me to go clean up after her.  Many times she would see literal piles of SHIT in kennels, and then call me to come clean it even if I was busy in an exam room or doing a treatment.  I have a hard time saying no to people, especially people older than me even if it's by a few years.  I also know that she won't end up doing it at all if I don't, and I think it's unfair to the patients to leave their kennels filled with waste.  So I do as she tells me.  I'm never happy about it.

Aside from the petty, personal jabs she shoves at me, Penny has been a terrible employee lately even by professional standards.  It isn't just me nitpicking because I think she's a piece of shit.
She shows up late to work all the time, and usually isn't ready.  She'll show up, clock in, and go to the restroom to brush her teeth and hair and what not.  She eats in front of clients and leaves her garbage everywhere.  She decides to take the day off for random reasons and asks people to cover her shifts all the time but outright refuses to cover anyone else's shift when they genuinely need a day off.  She gives her father-in-law employee discounts by claiming that the dog is hers.  She leaves her personal items all over the treatment tables and gets upset when we move them.  She sometimes goes into the front lobby just to lay on the benches to ""rest her back"" (she's literally sleeping).  She leaves kennels dirty at the end of her shift and the morning staff has to clean up after her so they can check in surgical patients.  She never does her callbacks and blames a lot of her fuck-ups on me because I'm the youngest.

My boss has blamed everyone except for Penny for the messes she makes, the dirty kennels, etc.  We are all extremely frustrated and hurt.  Penny is the only one who has not been to any sort of schooling.  Everyone else have spent money, time, and effort to make this their career.  It is our entire life.  We bust our asses off for minimal pay (since this is a very small practice our pay isn't that substantial in comparison to corporate clinics) just because we love the work and love the small business environment.  Penny was given a job without a lick of real veterinary experience.  It's like a preschool teacher saying they can be a pediatric nurse because of their preschool experience.  It's not the same.  Everyone is deeply angry and offended that Penny gets away with her behavior.  It is an insult to those of us who have dedicated our lives to veterinary medicine.  She honestly shouldn't have been hired in the first place.  The problem is that she is a massive kiss-ass and my boss is very non-confrontational.  He is very afraid to treat anyone unfairly so he overcompensates by punishing us all instead of the actual problem.  He feels bad for Penny because she gushes all the time about how depressed and anxious she is all the time.

Nobody knows what to do.  They are all looking for other jobs, the only reason I'm not looking is because I have two jobs already, this one and one at another more professional clinic at a high-end university.  I can fall back on it if it gets bad enough, but I really don't want to.  Everyone there who isn't Penny are amazing.  They are my family and working at that clinic is the highlight of my week aside from dealing with Penny.

I have no idea what to do.  I've never dealt with something like this before."

585113,4,2016-10-18,Developers: Electives You Wish You Took in College?,Faelor,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/585113/developers_electives_you_wish_you_took_in_college/,"Hi everyone,

I’m a returning student who previously worked in the world of insurance. After the last year and a half a few bums, I somehow made it as a junior in computer science with a fairly meaningful internship and a part-time tutor teaching introductory programming concepts. So the skinny is that since I quit a job where I made decent money to go back to school, I am trying to get the most out of my education.

I’m at a point where I’m about to select classes for spring semester. Due to debt and other obligations, I am really needing to graduate by December 2018. I don’t think the world will end if I don’t, but that’s the goal. So classes I select now honestly need to fit into that graduation deadline. I’ll worry about that as that’s not what the post is about. Just a bit of a disclaimer for my point of view.

Anyways! For those who went through college in some sort of STEM/CS based degree, **what are some electives you are glad you took, and what are some electives you wish you took?** Granted, just about anything can be learned from the Internet if you have enough discipline and find a halfway decent resource. But what’s something you (wish you) learned **in a formal, academia setting with a mentor or teacher there to grade your understanding?**

Just to paint a picture, I am currently at looking at completing “Internet Technologies” concentration the school recently revamped. But at the end of the day, it’s just a title that gets stuck under my degree. There’s no real bonus besides being about to say you completed what the school thought was appropriate – not including side projects where you may have a great understanding on the topic.

For example, I really want to take *Introduction to Algorithms* and *Foundations of Web Search Technologies*, but I hear from former students, current students, and RateMyProfessor the teacher is not great. It's a very dry lecture, and while the concepts may be interesting, it's not a great experience. That said, if I find myself in those classes I can at least dedicate some time researching similar material. So while I may be graded over A, B, and C, I can spend time getting a grasp on D and E,  which employers may want. And more bluntly put, they may look great on a resume. Eh?

Other classes I'm personally thinking about to fulfill the concentration are things like *Human-Computer Interaction* which seems like a really broad but useful. *Database Management Systems* is something I hear a lot from former students / now developers, because as long as the class talks about set theory and the relationships built between things, you'll walk away with knowledge employers want. The last two are a bit more mathy, but *graph theory* and *pattern recognition*. The former is actually taught by our school's dean and, from what I've gathered, super useful. Some poster on Quora went as far as saying that every problem can technically be broken down to a graph theory question. Whoa. And last but not least, *Natural Language Processing*. I really like the professor and there's a handful of former students who said the class wasn't extremely challenging but it really opened up some new ideas on things like NLP and algorithms (in general) work.

**TL;DR:** Returning student wanting the most out of education. Only a junior, but pretty enthralled by software engineering and algorithms (efficiency). Not sure what electives to take. Trying to not be swayed by a concentration because it's just a title. Help.

*edit* In case it interests anyone, rather than talking in general terms, here's the concentration which will also give you an idea of some of the classes the school offers: http://unomaha.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2016-2017/Undergraduate-Catalog/Undergraduate-Degree-Programs-and-Certificates/Information-Science-and-Technology/Computer-Science/Internet-Technologies-iT-Concentration"

I have one direct question concerning SATA cables. The mainboard comes with 2, but I guess I need an additional one for the disc drive, am I right?

So I got a callback for a programming internship next semester and got to the assessment phase. The application called for C# experience, which I don't have, but I am proficient in C++ and very proficient in Java (They know this but are giving me a chance). 

They have provided two C# VS projects that I need to debug and input a bit of code, but they sent it in a ****.z__ file that I had to rename to ***.zip. I was able to change the name of the file and unzip the folder, but when I try to open the VS project in the folder I get ""The project file or web cannot be found."" I can see the files in the separate project folder but when I try to open the solution file in VS it throws errors like above. 

Anyone seen this or know how to get the project to open?

Keep in mind: I have intermediate experience in Visual Studio, and have only used it for C/C++. Also, I am running VS 2013."

Facebook and Google, however, only bother to give the intern candidate two phone interviews, 45 minutes each?

I then proceed to email the recruiter, attaching my resume and personal website and expressing interest about an interview.

This is went the recruiter flipped. They asked how I got the email in the first place and I responded that I would rather not say (because they seemed pissed off). They then replied by saying they were not the right person for this email in a very rude way. I asked them if they could give me the recruiter for my university's email address and they said they don't ""solicit emails of colleagues."" That's when I stopped responding.

5874fu,2,2016-10-18,I have a question about quitting a big tech company before a year,paranoidvideo01,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5874fu/i_have_a_question_about_quitting_a_big_tech/,"My last year as a CS major was pretty busy. I was so focused on finishing my courses and graduating at the top of my class that I never put aside the time I should have to do the real digging on what sort of company I wanted to work for after graduating. Long story short, I graduated from a top 10 program with honors and was approached by one of the ""big"" companies (think NASDAQ) before graduating. I felt so grateful for their consideration that I sort of jumped at the opportunity as soon as I could, thinking that because of their reputation it would be a really great place for me to learn from people smarter than me and to get better as an engineer. 

However, my initial impression of this company has been completely changed. The ONLY explanation that I can come up with is that I just ended up in a useless organization/department- the kind that makes me wonder if it's going to get gutted and we'll all get laid off sooner or later. I'm uninspired, uninterested, and all the usual things that happen when you have a job that you feel ultimately serves no purpose to your employer or to yourself. On a day to day basis, I feel that what I do has zero business value. I feel that this department's engineering standards are so poor that continuing to work there would literally only give me experience in keeping a seat warm. I don't see any opportunity for real growth as engineer, to work on hard problems, to show up and contribute to a valuable team, or to simply get up and feel happy about going to work every day. I've had other software engineering internships before this, but never felt this way. Considering how much you can learn as an engineer in just a year of really hard work, I don't feel like I have time to waste.

But I'm worried other employers won't see it this way. Here's what it looks like on the surface: I quit, gave the company back a large (&gt; $5k) bonus, and now the first job on my resume is at ""top"" tech company I worked at for less than a year.

It's been close to a year since I've started working there- including internship/full-time. What should I do? It's such a large company that I could ask about trying to move to a position in another department, but I'm honestly too scared to take the risk that it may be exactly like my current department. What I've thought about doing is putting in my notice, and then spending 4-5 months talking to different companies that are doing thing I'm interested in, working on my own projects/doing interview prep, but I'm worried this again looks like too big of an employment gap. Is my only credible way out to get a job offer from somewhere before putting in notice at my current company?"

I'm ready to move onto bigger and better things. I am looking for working at a known software company. Not necessarily big 4 since I'm not sure I have what it takes. But something that will guarantee me a very good software team, with experienced people who will guide me to develop great software.

I know that because I'm really far from those locations, I'm going to be overlooked. Hell, I'm a Canadian from a non UW university. 


So, given that I want to move, should I take the first opportunity given to me? Once I secure any type of job, can I shop around?
Or should I try and get in with the more reputable companies first?

588gh0,3,2016-10-19,The program chairperson won't allow me to take internship this semester,CookiesDisney,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/588gh0/the_program_chairperson_wont_allow_me_to_take/,"I've been in and out of the university for a few years now but i'm supposed to be on my final year. Internship is offered this semester so I was getting everything ready. 

There are no such requirements for the internship such as that being in your final year and not taking more than 18 units of courses. But just to be sure, I went to the program chairperson to show her my remaining classes and told her that I'll be taking internship with 17 units, 6 units of summer classes and then 12 units with feasibility studies and other courses then I'll be off to graduation. However, she told me that internship should be taken at the very last semester so that there's the chance that the company could absorb me and hire me. I told her that if I follow that I'll be graduating march 2018 instead of october 2017. Work is no problem for me I just want to graduate soon because I've been going to university for six years now. I told her I'm just trying to maximize my time. She just told me no. 

Now as much as want to believe that this rule is true, it's not. There are some students who took internship but are still going to school now. So obviously when they took internship they were not on their last semester. I've never heard of such a rule. 

I'm also opening up to the possibility of the program chairperson being biased. She allowed another student, who has the same load and courses remaining as me, to take internship this semester. She also had a history of doing the same to me when I was asking if I could cross enroll or petition for a class. Basically, she just ""blocks"" anything I would want to take. My aunt then went to uni and talked to her but she ended up being disrespected. The chairperson said ""Do you not know who I am?"". So as much as I want my aunt to talk to her again, she'll probably end up getting disrespected once again.

I'm such in a dilemma because taking the internship this semester would be the only way for me to graduate on my target time. I don't know if I should keep on pushing the program chair, or to complain to the university. The dean is also on leave so she's the one taking care of everything right now. If this does not work out, i don't know if I can continue with school knowing she'll be just around the corner terrorizing me. I already extended my stay because she didn't allow me to cross enroll but now she's doing it again. 

I need some advice I am really down right now thank you"

From the Creators of EECSEECS.com:

We originally created this website to parody a specific subculture within the EECS undergraduate community of our university. It is much to our dismay that (1) the ironic language we included in the original website was claimed (quite lamentably) by the aforementioned subculture to further its circlejerking, and that (2) the University fought to take the website down by using the excuse that by including its name we were infringing upon certain trademarks. We hope that this memo elucidates our original intent.

Too often have we overheard conversations around campus that, for hours on end, are about and solely about the perks and high salaries of jobs, bragging about internship offers, the prestige of being an EECS major (especially how it's ""better"" than all other majors), the endless and endless circlejerking. We are sick and tired of this. There is so much more to studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science: discussions about so many great untapped theoretical and applied ideas to explore (as opposed to this widespread circlejerking), how to be more inclusive towards diversity (to this day, EECS is predominantly male, upper-middle-class, and white/Asian American), how to keep a check on each other from cheating in classes (there have been countless cases in recent semesters). So, to those who identify with the aforementioned EECS undergraduate subculture: please learn to think for yourself, be considerate of others, and do things for the sake of actual enjoyment. You have the power to change the culture around you.

We encourage you to spread this memo by sharing on social media and posting printed paper copies.

Sincerely,

The firt semester I had 0 GPA, because I just got in. But then my GPA after the first semester was not so great, but since then I have been managing to get B's and my GPA is good. I have a lot of extracurricular activities. I am also doing a VIP (and my role in this project is very huge/important). My leadership skills are also amazing. I have been to all the CS career fairs, the online career fair, and still could not get an internship. And from next semester I have to start my search for full time. Do you guys think it is possible to get a full time job without any internship experience?

On all the US applications, I get asked some form of the question ""Are you legally permitted to work in the US?"" or ""Will you require VISA sponsorship to work in the US?"". Up until now, I have been responding no to the former and yes to the latter, but I'm not entirely sure this is correct. AFAIK, there are 2 ways of me getting a working VISA in the US:

1. Applying for a J1 summer visa, doesn't require sponsorship but I think there are some restrictions on the type of work you can do.
2. Get sponsorhip from the company that hires me (H1-B visa)

So basically, the questions I have are:

1. Is me answering as above hindering my chances of getting an internship? I certainly don't want to lie on my application, but I feel I'm getting automatically filtered out just because of this.
2. Is it worth applying for a J1 visa now so that I can say I'm legally permitted to work in the US?
3. How common is it for US companies to sponsor foreign students for internships? Am I being completely unrealistic expecting them to hire/sponsor me?

It's a 1 year diversion so the I can't get the arrest expunged until next May.

1. How likely is this arrest record to keep me from getting the position? I know that nobody can give me a sure answer I'm just trying to gauge my odds. 

2. My interview with the hiring manager led me to believe that he is the type of person to be sympathetic about mistake and this kind of stuff. Should I inform him of the arrest before the background check or try to let it slip passed and call him if/when they tell me it's a problem?

3. How valuable are internships? If I fail to get an internship this summer, would it be worth it to stay an extra semester so I can get a summer internship in before I graduate? (I currently have none)"

I have 8 months of full time internship experience in a bay area game dev company and I'm looking at getting more from them. They don't typically hire interns who lack college degrees and I'm not planning on getting a degree so they aren't someone I will work for.

the title says most of it, but I'll give some context.

I am a Canadian citizen studying in my 3rd year of university for a computer science degree. Last summer, I had my first internship at a foreign company (Canadian branch local to my hometown).

Anyways, the internship went well enough. The technology used was a bit outdated and left me feeling bored some of the time. However, towards the end of the summer, I started learning Java with one of the lead developers (My ""main"" language is C++). So this sparked a lot more interest.

At the end of the summer, they offered me a job for the following summer in this foreign country (sorry I can't be specific) with a raise, 2 weeks of vacation and my appartment would be paid for. I was thinking it was the deal of a lifetime (especially for a 2nd internship) but there are a few cons:
- They expect me to work A LOT and are being very upfront about it (atleast theres that). Lots of working nights. That is the norm over there.
- It is more or less expected I will take language classes while I am there.
- I believe I will most likely still be using atleast some of that older technology.

Personal cons:
- I will have to leave my friends and girlfriend behind for the summer. For me personally, this is a big deal.
- I would prefer to be using C++ (although Java isn't awful).

My main questions are the following:
- Does the fact that I would be working in a foreign country help me professionally (does it look good on my resume) ?
- Is the ammount of work they are asking of me considered to be a lot? Normally it would be 8 - 5, but sometimes working until up to 10 or even 12 depending on the task / who I am working with.
- In your personal, non professional opinion. Is the whole thing worth it? Especially considered against leaving my friends behind, which is the biggest con for me (even if its only 4 months).

If you need to know the country I would be working in, you can PM me as I would prefer not to publicly post it here.

I've been working for a very small non profit for a few months now, there are 3 employees (including me) and a revolving door of interns.

There's the CEO, the manager, and myself. The ceo has quite a busy schedule and isn't there all the time, but she's often out doing things for the company (networking, fundraising)

The manager has a pretty sweet life, only works 4 days a week and basically keeps track of all the regulations and administrative stuff while the boss is out. Over the past few months, the manager has been coming in less and less. From missing every Friday, to being ""sick"" other days, working from home, and taking a 2 week vacation, he's missed 49% of eligible work days for the past 4 months (I kept track)

Since his absence, I've been being thrown more work that's not within my job description and I've been getting criticized for letting things fall through the cracks. I don't wanna sell out one of my colleagues, but I'm one person and I can only do so much. I'm the least senior employee, make the least amount of money, yet I'm asked to do the bulk of the work that keeps the company afloat.

I want to quit, the stress and pressure has become Unbearable for a job that I was already unhappy in. I guess my question is what should One do with this information? What would be the best way to approach either the CEO or the manager about one of the senior employees at the company showing up for work half of the time. There's like this unspoke understanding that I'm not to tell her whenever the manager skips work, but it's starting to impact my performance and general well being.

What does one do with this information and how should I confront the people above me about this problem?

Thanks for your help"

Which didn't bother me as I was just excited to have a job. However, the work here seems to involve more computer science than mechanical engineering and that is something that I am just not good at. I am a glorified software beta tester. Especially in the last few weeks I have felt belittled and inadequate due to my boss. I am legitimately fearful anytime he comes to me.

58j0p9,8,2016-10-20,TIFU By being an oblivious intern for a small startup buisness,Jigoogly,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/58j0p9/tifu_by_being_an_oblivious_intern_for_a_small/,"As with all TIFU this happened about 2 years ago however I only found out the repercussions recently.

So as part of a program I was partaking in we would spend time as unpaid interns for businesses in exchange for connections, valuable resume additions, potential future job prospects, etc. The person in charge of assigning internships would spend roughly 15 minutes with each of us asking us where we wanted to intern and what our passions were. While they certainly did find great internships for many of the people in the program I was not one of them. They saw how I spent a lot of my time on my laptop and how I was more or less the class IT person and they decided that I would best be suited in computer repair and maintenance type internship. This is where more of the my own fuck up comes into play because it was honestly the last thing I wanted to do for an internship and thus I was sloppy and more or less put myself on autopilot through the whole thing. However they just wanted me to ""try it out and if you don't like it we can change it"".

So they find an internship for me at a brand-spanking-new computer repair startup. When I say brand-spanking-new I mean spent the first 2 weeks of the internship helping them move into their location. I use the word their and them reflexively and I feel it implies multiple people, it was not. It was a one man operation. This guy was the genuine american dream in the making. He had all the classic novel tropes of having not gone to college, having taught himself everything and passed all the certifications with no assistance from anyone, started his business out of his parents dining room in their duplex, gave the most incredible customer experience to the most assholish people who didn't deserve it, all while being a single father of 2. This guy was incredible. Not only did he give extremely good rates for repairs massively undercutting the competition but when long time customers couldn't pay he would do it completely pro bono and even refuse to accept payment if he knew they were on hard times. I had and in someway still do have an enormous amount of respect for this man and what he did.

But when you are a singular successful businessman who has an extremely popular service you get overwhelmed with work. When I asked him why he hadn't hired people to help he claimed that is was because he was having to use most of the money he earned to pay for his mothers breast cancer treatment and that it really left nothing for him to be able to hire more people. I had met her on occasions and can more or less verify this part of his story was legitimate. 

As a product of being over worked and understaffed chaos brewed in the form of clutter and in some cases literal trash strewn around the work area. We had 8 party sized plastic folding tables (the big ones that need 2 people to carry) utterly covered in parts, work in progress jobs, old lunches, etc. It didn't help that he was somewhat of a hoarder and would buy tons of excess parts off ebay because ""they were a great deal"". Within 3 months of my internship and of him moving into this new space you had to carefully navigate the space to get to where ever it was you needed to go in the already small 350 square foots space. we are talking floor to 9ft ceiling piles and stacks of stuff.

Now that we have the back drop for our scene lets get into the shit. He wasn't good with records, and when I say he wasn't good I mean he kept manually input records of all transactions in notepad text files and later (when I ""upgraded"" it) Microsoft word documents. I spent most of my time imputing everything into these documents. In hindsight I should have been taken aback by how he had me log all the customers data in the way that we did. Everything from the CV code to the bank it was with. However I also logged the nature of the job and the steps we took to preform it down to the finest detail. This included where we purchased parts, how much we paid for them, how long they took to arrive, how long the job sat in the backlog, what time we called them to let them know it was ready for pickup, what time they arrived to pick it up, etc. An endless tedium of detail that he was hell bent on keeping ""in case something happens"". At the time when he was having me including the credit card info in it all it just seemed realistic to include it given the scope of all the other data we kept.

I interned my 6 months with him and while during that entire time he went on and on about how I would be his first employ after the program concluded. When that day came and I showed up he sat me down and said he was sorry and that he just couldn't take anyone on as his mother had taken a turn for the worse. I can pretty confidently verify this as being legit because several days prior to the end of the program he had to leave work to take her to the hospital and I road with him to pick her up simply because we were out on a job when she had called him for help and she really did look awful. So I didn't get the job he had been promising me all those six months -not that I cared all that much. While work is work and I needed them money what I was doing for him was agony and while he may have been a great person, he was not a great person to work with.

Time goes by and about a month ago I was applying for a job when my would be employer went to follow up on my references I was called saying I didn't meet the required number of recommendations because one of them didn't reply - you guessed it, computer repair guy. So I do some digging and find his business page on yelp and one thing struck me immediately was his once 5 star rating with a mountain of recommendations was now a 2 and a half star rating. Not only that but the most ""liked"" review was by a woman who filed a police report because after she left her computer to get repaired by him he disappeared shortly there after she then had numerous charges placed on her card. The brutal part for me was seeing tons of customers names I recognized all telling more or less the same story about how awesome he was and how recently tons of charges had been racked up on their cards. Were talking 50+ reviews mentioning card charges and even more mentioning how he stopped responding to all calls even though they still had computers in his shop. I did a little more digging and found that he is indeed wanted by the police.

**tl;dr** I think I helped a down on his luck businessman succeed in massive amounts of credit card fraud and identity theft."

So I Graduated this last spring semester with an EE degree. Right out of school I had a few job offers in the area, but I decided to go work for a small family owned company thinking it would provide more experience and opportunity than some of the bigger companies that offered me a job.

Now I've been there almost 6 months and it is a nightmare. I work long hours, it is high stress, there is no training or anyone to offer any kind of training or mentorship. I don't particularly like the people I work with who are all very openly homophobic and borderline racist (at the very least very vocally prejudiced against certain ethnic groups). 

  I have no idea what I'm doing and most of my time is spent trying to put out one fire after another. There are fewer than ten engineers working there and a few of them are very new and are also not trained in any capacity. So everything is on fire all the time and the owner and the manager don't understand why everybody can't just ""figure it out"" and ""get it right the first time."" As a group we get seriously chewed out about once every few weeks by the owner.

   Now that I am here I realize that this place has an very large turn over rate. More engineers have left in the past 18-24 months than are currently on staff. They seem to hire an engineer or two, work them to death for a year or so until they leave, and then repeat the process.

Here is my question. How do I get out without looking like a flake or an incompetent engineer? I desperately want to go work somewhere else, but I am afraid that it will look bad that I have only been here for 6 months. Prior to this I had an internship with a large international company for 7-8 months, but this is my first real engineering job. If I get an interview and they ask ""why are you leaving your current position after such a short time?"" How do I explain my situation without sounding whiny or incompetent? 

Any advice would be appreciated.

 TLDR: Graduated in spring, went to work for a small company. Been there about 6 months and it is terrible place to work. Since this is my first real engineering job out of school, how bad does it look to other employers  if I am applying to new jobs after 6 months in my current position? How do I sound good in an interview for a new position after only having been in my current one such a short time without sounding like I am a flakey engineer or unable to cut it?"

After working for a year or so I discovered I really enjoyed programming, particularly in Java. 

I self-taught myself using resources online. As I looked for jobs (in Orange County, CA) I found it difficult to be considered. After much consideration I decided to go back to school in order to get a BS in Computer Science and pick up some internships along the way.

I started at a community college and it's treated me very well. I was hoping to transfer to a 4 year in the spring and get an internship over the summer. Nevertheless I didn't get into any 4-year programs. What to do now?

My biggest problem was my original plan involved me being a student to get an internship, but that plan has hit a bump.

Do I try to drag out my stay at the JC next semester? Perhaps this will give me a second shot at the 4-year and/or more to put on a resume.

Do I try and get a junior developer role now that I have some classes (5; C, C++, Java, Assembly, and Data Structures) taken?

Do I try something like OSU online?

I had a lot of fun there, some of the most fun I've ever had in IT, and we had a good group of people.

We also brought people in for internships. The owner was especially cheap, didn't pay us much, and loved the idea of bringing kids in with college learnin for even cheaper to do stuff. One of these was a young woman from the local community college. Pretty knowledgeable, if a bit new to the whole IT thing.

So cast of charecters:

$Me - Your friendly neighborhood GhostDan

$Intern - So very new to the world

$Webmaster - Technically the manager of the whole thing, he just liked the title. 

So one of the issues that happened with many small ISPs in the late 90s was the v.92 56K standard. In order to provide this service the ISPs needed to invest in additional lines (T1s, OC3s, etc) new hardware, etc or be stuck just doing 33.6k modems. The owner wasn't a fan of this idea as it meant spending money. 

One of his more interesting moves to get around this was partner with a company that provided a modem that would combine 2 33.6k lines, making a total of 67k. Being able to advertise we offered a higher speed connection than anyone else in the area (with the fine print of the special modem, and 2 lines having to be available). 

So I'm talking to $Webmaster about some stuff I'm doing on the server side, and $Intern gets a call transferred to her:

$Intern: Thank you for calling $smallisp, how can I help you.... Oh you know what, I'm not sure let me ask.

$Me to $Webmaster: So I'm going to do the thing, with the stuff, and then we'll get the end result

$Intern, interrupting: I have a user on the phone who is asking what the difference between 67 and 56k

$Me: 11k

$Webmaster: *laugh*

$Intern, back to the phone: Sir, it's 11k. *dawns on intern what she just said* please hold Sir.


At the time I was sitting on a rolling chair next to $Webmaster, she hit me with such force I went across the office. She learned quickly though, after that she thought about my answers when I gave them to her :)"

And I have no idea what I want to do when I graduate. I understand that maybe it's a little early to worry about this, but I have to do an internship this summer anyway, so I thought it's a good time to see what you guys do.

A little background: I chose EE because I had read that it is the most math intensive and requires the most math courses of all engineering. I love math. I also really love learning the physics behind EE. Too me it's currently my favorite part, but I don't see how I can get a job in that. As for the subdivisions of EE: 

I love both analog and digital circuits, but both bother me at times as well. 

For my analog classes, I cannot stand having to use multisim to simulate. Granted I don't know it well thought, maybe that'll change if I learn it better. I also hate having to use multisim when actually building a circuit, through things like the NI Elvis board. They just cause me more grief than building the circuit on a normal bread board and using a scope to measure stuff and generate waveforms (I learned how to use a scope over the course of 2 labs. 2 years in MultiSim and the Elvis boards still boggle me... they never work!). 

On the digital side: there's nothing I enjoyed more than analyzing digital circuits. And designing simple ones. But once we started using VHDL, my brain broke. Again, this is something we weren't taught, but were just expected to randomly learn. We used Altera/Quartus equipment, which was always finicky. Idk if my experience with VHDL would've changed if we used other equipment/a more complete ide for VHDL. I also really enjoy embedded programming/micro controllers, but it's another thing that we're expected to learn on our own. My professors don't really... teach... they even avoid questions when asked.

So to wrap it up. Idk what I want to do, and would like insight from those of you who have gone through this before me!"

I liked chemistry in highschool and my dad graduated college in chemical engineering, so that's what I decided to go into. 

But after my freshman year my dad got diagnosed with cancer and past away last year. Everything has seemed like a blur and I feel like I haven't had any time to think about whether or not I really want to be a Chem E.

In my time at college I have enjoyed a few classes, like Materials and Energy Balance and Optimization, but I haven't liked any of the classes I've recently taken.

“So Calla. What do you think about this apartment I found?” Winston showed me a rental page for a one bedroom, one bathroom, kitchen, penthouse-esque apartment in downtown. The screen of the tablet got in the way of my coffee making so I pushed it aside. “It’d make a great place for the invader, wouldn’t it?”

“Last I checked, you’re the only freeloader here, Mr. Burnhart,” Niex commented, flipping the page in his paper. Winston glared over my shoulder at him, but said nothing.

“Has anyone seen my phone?” I asked, skillfully evading the topic. 

“On the table.” They answered. And proceeded to glare.

“Ah, thanks.” I ducked under their vicious staring contest and snagged my cellular device off of the table. 

Since the day after Winston’s abrupt arrival, the two alpha males had been having spitting contests over who gets to stay in the house. It probably would’ve stayed genial, had Winston not found out about the movement of all my mother’s bins and his subsequent fit about it. For being off planet for five years he was really taking personal offence to the displacement of things. Niex, on the other hand, relished in taking all the opportunities to get on Winston’s bad side. My brother kept trying to appeal to my better nature and kick Niex out, saying that his “character was disingenuous and dastardly, and no stuck up, pretentious, butt-munch deserved to be staying in our childhood home”. Niex played his cards better and offered to pay utilities for the next year. I strategically avoided being in a room alone with either of them, as if they were in together they’d likely start arguing. I came home one night to find the two of them tussling over what show to watch on the television like the children they are. Overall I was counting down the days until one of them killed the other. 

“What’re you plans for today?” Winston asked, following me over to the table to eat breakfast. “Same as usual? What show do you have to watch? I thought you exhausted Netflix to its extreme.”

“Not really,” I answered, sipping my coffee. “I’ve got some work I need to do, and I figured I’d do some decorating.”

Niex snorted but us Burnharts had mastered the art of appearing to not giving a shit.

“The normal course of your Thursdays typically involved you never leaving the couch unless it’s for food,” My brother responded. I saw Niex agreeing with a small head nod.

“Don’t you have a job to get to?” I snapped. The convict chuckled from across the table and invoked my rage. “The both of you?”

Winston rolled his eyes and Niex sighed. 

“The office clearly can’t handle me being gone for one measly day to spend with my beloved little sister,” Winston said, slinging an arm around my shoulder. 

“Don’t tell me that the ever straight Winston Burnhart is considering skipping a day of hard, honest work?” Niex quipped, folding up the paper. 

“Unlike those of us who make a dishonest pay,” Winston glared, “I am a respected member of my company and hardly take a sick day. They would gladly allow me to spend some time with my family due to an emergency of lack of fun.”

“I happen to make my own hours, being my own boss.”

Winston stood straighter and stepped forward. “At least I don’t lie to people for a living.”

“I provide happiness to those with none,” Niex snarled. “What’s so wrong about that?”

Before they could rip each other’s faces off I placed my coffee down and snapped my fingers at them. “Boys, boys. Don’t make me get the spray bottle. The both of you will go to your respective jobs and have a genial Thursday, otherwise I won’t be making the steaks I promised for tonight.”

One thing they had in common that I could use against them was the love of red meat, and in particular the one of three meals I could cook more than decently. It had come about in college, when I had less than a hundred bucks to my name and two roommates who knew next to nothing about food. I learned the hard way that year how to make food at least edible at a cheap price. 

Winston slipped over to the fridge in order to grab the lunch he had packed as Niex gathered his papers and placed them in the briefcase he had taken to carrying around. Scotty saw them both getting ready and waited patiently by the front door to receive good-bye pets. Where Winston adored and thoroughly scratched behind the ears of the white fluff ball, Niex simple gave a quick pat to avoid any backlash. At least they were on better terms than the start of this. I watched from the window as my brother hopped into his dinky little Prius and Niex revved the engine of the Camaro. 

*I swear to god, if they start a street race while school is starting,* I thought bitterly. Thankfully nothing of the sort happened and the middle-schoolers on the street would have to start their day in the disappointment of a lack of road-violence. 

I moved to the couch and booted up my laptop, scrolling through my calendar to try and plan out the next couple of weeks. My laptop chimed it’s completion as Scotty hopped up onto the couch with me. The line on the other end of my phone rang as I attempted to contact my boss. 

""Kristop Caper speaking,"" he answered. 

My keyboard clicked as I logged in. ""Kristoph - I'm calling about the new items. Under no circumstances are you to let-""

“In approximately two seconds you might want to consider leaving a message. Im a bit busy.""

The voice switched to the answering female. ""To leave a message press one. To leave a callback number press five. To hear more options, press zero.""

The high pitched tone of utter doom assaulted my ears. 

""Caper, whatever bullshit you're knee deep in you better haul yourself out of in order to call me back or you will regret it,"" I snarled into the phone, angrily hanging up. A halloween decoration went off in the next room and shouted out ""Beware all who enter here"". Thank god for the small things. 

Placing my laptop on the coffee table, I stood up and went over to the two tubs full of halloween decorations. Dead witches, bloody handprints, spiderwebs and flashing lights were all packed in. I'd found the old paper window decorations my mom loved to use and spruced them up with some black light paint and made sure to put them under the front porch window. Granted, I was more of a Christmas person myself (snow, trees, and the little adorable decorations I could litter the inside of the house with made my day), but I felt that I owed it to the kids seeing as everyone else on the street's version of decorating involved no more than two pumpkins and the occasional creepy candy bowl. I splurged and transformed my house into a place of wonders - figured out how to make those projection lights work too and all.

Niex didn't really understand what I was doing the day I came home with the two sharpie marked bins, but Winston lit up immediately. For a good three hours he was imperturbable as he went around setting up the little tchotchke decorations that he loved so much. Niex pretended to know what he was doing, ignoring it all except for the occasional goading and calling Winston childish. A couple of texts explained the holiday in its entirety, but all I got in return was a scathing comment on the ridiculous of it all and ""why celebrate something with no religious or political significance"". 

I responded by sending him a picture of an escaped convict costume and telling him to dress as that.

Scotty was in the same boat as Niex though; completely confused by all the different buzzes and noises, and he spent hours at a time staring down the motion activated ghost that ""haunted"" our entrance. 

My phone buzzed twice. 

*George: You got any plans for halloween?*

*work, why?*

*George:meant the weekend. And some friends and I were thinking of hosting a halloween party. Maybe going to a zombie walk or a parade for fun. You interested?*

Halloween party away from the two morons now inhabiting my house - hell yes I was in. *Yes to the party, would have to know the dates for the walks* 

*George: Cool. The Saturday before Halloween good for you?*

*yup. This a themed party or...?* 

*George: haven't decided yet. Will let you know*

I dropped the event into my digital calendar and dayminder, and then tried my boss again. 

""I was going to call you back, I'm just busy working on invitations for the bi annual shareholders dinner,"" Kristoph answered. 

""Is that coming up?"" I asked, sorting through cans to try and locate some non-lentil soup. 

""Mhm. Early November. I can expect you, right?"" 

""Do I have to? It's nothing they haven't heard before."" These dinners were full of the big wigs. The rich old people and the young rising stars that wanted to seem significant through having the brick on the walkway of a wing named after them. Kristoph may be making bank with this building, but he still had people who had invested into it as a business. The dinners were his over exuberant way of presenting all the financial aspects I didn't care about. The food was all I wanted - sometimes I got to bring the leftovers home. 

""Yes. We've got some new members, and special guests coming. They'll want to be given a tour of the locker and you know how touchy you are about that stuff."" Kristoph answered. 

I sighed. ""Fine. How much of a black tie event is it?""

""You might want to invest in something other than your high school prom dress to wear.""

“I seriously need to put that much effort into this thing?” I asked, finding a can of chicken noodle soup and pouring it into a pot. The stove clicked to live and I went back into the living room to move my laptop to the table. 

“Ever been to an opera on opening night?” He asked. He sounded ticked off and I heard the crumpling of paper in the background.

“Not really. Even with the pay-boost I have from working with you, opera’s not really my thing. I’d pass out.”

He sighed. “Look, I get that you’re socially uncultured, but at least go watch some show or movie that shows that. You don’t have to go grammy level dress on me, but something other than a pantsuit, please. We’ve got new shareholders, from off-planet, and we really need to give it the old college try, alright?”

*Didn’t realize he liked idioms so much.* “Yeah, fine. I’ll see if I can’t find something off-”

“If you buy a dress offline I will personally burn it. I’ll have someone take you shopping. Dip into those savings I know you have stashed away under the mattress.”

“Sorry for being raised off a cheap ass dining set,” I snapped. “Didn’t realize it would effect your public image.”

“I own and operate the third most visited museum attraction on the planet,” Kristoph snapped at me. “I’m going to do everything in my power to impress these new immigrants and maybe work on opening a branch on the intergalactic space station.”

“Fine, fine,” I stirred my soup and turned down the heat. “Can we get to why I called you originally?”

“The new arrivals right?”

“Yeah, don’t let the interns do anymore than label the items. I gotta get more shelving units, so I don’t want them intermixed with other categories until I get the chance to look at them myself.” I opened up the bookmarked site. Three storage units were already in the cart, just needed Kristoph’s approval before I went ahead. 

“Company card?” He asked. “While you’re there go ahead and order some new display cases. Five or seven of them. Regular ones.”

I did a quick search and found what we needed. “Done. Have you looked at any of the applications, ‘cause I’m kinda of losing my mind down there.”

“I’ve selected some for you to look at and decide who you want to interview. They’ll be in your inbox tomorrow.” I placed the order and turned off my soup.

“Thanks.”

“Don’t call again.”

“Wouldn’t dream of it.”

We hung up and I started a google search of halloween costume ideas.

Winston came home to me nearly burning off my eyebrows due to an oil mishap with my fried noodles. He dropped his backpack and rushed to wave a towel in front of the crazed smoke alarm that was making Scotty howl. 

“What made you think that lighting the noodles on fire would be a good idea?” Winston asked once everything calmed down.

“Hey, look at it this way,” I tilted the pan in his direction. “The noodles aren’t burnt but will have a nice crunchy outside.”

He shook his head. “I have never seen you fuck up steak and noodles so bad.”

“Shaddup and enjoy it,” I said, plating the noodles. We ate in silence for a couple of minutes. 

“So I found this apartment?”

“For the guy who actually pays double in rent what he should or yourself?” I immediately asked. 

“Me,” Winston admitted. “It’s close to the office and I’ve got some buddies who are willing to split rent.”

“Mm. That’s nice.” I observed him over my steak. “So when you moving out?”

“Was actually gonna see if you wanted to come too. There’s another, smaller and cheaper one a few flights down in the same building. You could just turn this whole house into a rent-out for new couples or post-college kids. Businessmen who move  around a lot and such.”

I raised an eyebrow at his pleading look. “What makes you think I want to do that?”

“Oh come on,” he nearly slammed his fork down. “We both know that you never wanted to stay here. You wanted the city life, with a nice big penthouse top-floor apartment where you could host parties with your overly rich husband while you had your side job for pocket money.”

“Shit happens,” I snapped back. “You just upped and left the planet. You literally abandoned the girlfriend you’d had for two years. Next time you want to talk to me about shit not going as planned, try looking her in the face and telling her that even your family has no way of contacting you.”

Winston physically looked sick. “Are you seriously going to hold this over my head?”

“I watched mom wither away in a hospital bed by myself and had no way of inviting you to a funeral,” I said. “In fact, I’m surprised that you haven’t even asked about her in all this time. Or were you too busy with your exciting IT job?”

I was too angry to eat. Winston looked too sick to eat anymore. He bowed his head and pushed the noodles around with the steak on his fork. “I meant to come back. I just… Got held up. I kept tabs on you guys. Communication between Earth and everywhere else was just so rudimentary and expensive at the time that I was unable to talk to you guys.”

“Well, next time you get held up, at least send a letter. I heard that intergalactic space shipping these days is a steal.”

Winston rolled his eyes. “So I saw that our cousin has a wedding?”

“Yeah, you were invited.” I told him. “I told her to not bother saving you a seat.”

“Eh, probably for the best. I wouldn’t be able to get off that day anyway,” he shrugged. He was about to say something else when Scotty started barking and the door opened. I turned in my seat to see Siet supporting a half lucid Niex and sporting a resigned look. 

“I apologize for the inconvenience,” Siet said when he saw us staring and deposited Niex on the couch. “He may have let his instinct get the better of him and ended up in a drinking contest with a younger fellow.”

“Which, I won,” Niex stated, lurching forward on the couch. He narrowed his eyes at us. “What’re you two deliberating on? You look as though you have secrets to share.”

Siet sighed. “Under normal circumstances I wouldn’t have allowed him to come home, but… He insisted.”

I stood up, “It’s fine.” I grabbed the plate and took it to Niex. “Eat this.”

“What were you talking about?” Niex asked, resting the plate in his lap and glaring at Winston, who was busy hiding a smirk.

“Just our cousin’s upcoming wedding,” Winston answered. 

“Ah, that human bonding ritual which stunts a man’s freedom,” Niex slurred, turning to a thoroughly distraught Siet. “Did you know that they willingly sign away their lives to one person until they die? It’s pathetic.”

“Human ritual?” Winston raised a brow. “You mean to tell me you’re not human.”

I stiffened but Siet seemed prepared for the question. “We’re Aestian, with the government of course. Your sister has kindly allowed us to set up a base here while we work undercover to disband the illegal drug sales that have been happening between Earth and other species.”

Winston didn’t seem convinced, and Siet produced official looking papers and identifications. “If you need more convincing, you’re welcome to contact our chief.”

“No, No. It’s just hard to believe that an officer of the law would allow himself to get in such a state,” Winston said. 

“Like I said, he got carried away.”

“Explains his attitude though,” Winston winked at me. “And look at you, helping to fight intergalactic crime. She better get a badge when all this is through.”

I chuckled nervously while Siet just smiled. “I’ll be sure to put in a good word. Now if you’ll excuse me.” He ducked out of the door before I could beg for an escape route. 

Niex supported himself and somehow managed to glide into the kitchen and sit between my brother and I. “So, this wedding. Has she told you who she’s going with?”

“No, do tell?” Winston was sucking up every second of this for blackmail later. 

“The idiot who challenged me to a drinking competition,” Niex smirked. “Poor human nearly puked once we got to twenty shots, but insisted we keep going. ‘Is name is George, in case you were wondering. George O’Neil, working on the escaped convict case but is stuck with that straight edge Drien.”

Winston gave me an amused look. “You didn’t tell me you had a boyfriend.”

“Friend who may or may not hate the world as much as I do,” I clarified.

“And I suppose you’ll get hitched to each other if by 35 you’re both single and broke?”

Niex snarled and his eyes flashed to this amber. “She could do better.”

I raised an eyebrow. “Wow, guess I can’t even decide my own fate.”

I expected a witty or drunk comment, but everything got upturned when Niex slammed his head on the table and promptly passed out. 

Winston let out a laugh. “Guess we better move him to the couch.”

“I hope he gets a hangover tomorrow.”

“Me too.”

We smiled at each other before dragging his Aestian ass and dropping it on the couch.

58lnxs,4,2016-10-21,Judge my learning curriculum,Travro,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/58lnxs/judge_my_learning_curriculum/,"Where I'm at now:
Currently Enrolled to get an A.S. degree in Programming and Analysis at my community college, sfcollege.edu. You can view the curriculum on their website.

So far I've learned: 
Intro to Programming: C++
Logic
Web Authoring: HTML5/CSS3
OOP1: C++
Data Structures: C++.
Web Authoring 2: HTML5/CSS3/Intro to JavaScript
All the C++ classes have only involved making small console programs. No real apps yet.

What I have left:
Two Databases classes: SQL
OOP2: Java
Internet Programming: JavaScript, PHP
Advanced Internet: Adobe Photoshop and Dreamweaver for all the web development stuff learned up to that point
Intro to Mobile: Android (I think - it doesn't say).

There's an internship class at the end, and the CLAIM from my professors is that the college has a rapport with IT recruiters and could get my foot in the door for what ultimately would be a salary position.

Here's my concern: 
I'm not interested in web development. (I want to do Java and make apps for android, and also possibly enterprise). I feel like the course work is good, but a bit broad and shallow. Also it's going rather slow because I won't be done with the A.S. degree until summer of 2018 (There's some electives that I haven't listed). And I got the bachelor afterwards. 

My questions are: 
1. Do you think my curriculum is formidable? 
2. Given my interests, what self-study supplementation would you recommend for learning android and Java (I'm looking into PACKT books by John Horton). 
3. Going that route, and I ask this because I'm a novice, are any of these classes like the databases one still relevant for a Java/Android developer and would self-study probably be faster?

Also, yes, I know I need to make ""things.""

OK, so I rent an airbnb.  I'm looking for a place.  This is in April or may.

I find a spot in a nice town.  It's not amazing, definitely dilpidated, but it's cheap, and what I was looking for.

One day the landlord puts defoggers in the house

Now I am coughing up a storm, I didn't know why till I go out and see defoggers in the living room

I am ALLERGIC to any kind of roach spray.

I let the landlord know, I am allergic coughing, please do not spray it, you literally can kill me

My throat closes, can't breath, hospital, the whole 9

Now, the airbnb comes to an end, I ask him if I can stay and pay rent without fees, he says cool.  We do not sign any lease agreements just verbal, and monthly payment with receipts

I start to feel like he is entering my room without me there.  I did feel I lost some money but this is not the issue.

I begin to get very sick, now I was already dealing with some kind of sickness, so this is the crazy part of part 1 I haven't told you about, re member, this is part 2.

At night I begin to call the police.

Now, no racism, my landlord is a Chinese man, and we have a new roommate, coincidentally, around the time I start to get sick. A Chinese roommate moves in.  1 roommate is permananent, the other is airbnb

Now this kid said he came from Texas for an internship in NY.  I believe.  If this kid is a awyer, he's the best dressed lawyer I've ever seen, one of the best dressed people I've seen period.  I mean this kid wore 3 piece suits.  Purple and what not, looking like yakuza.  I got an awkward vibe when I met him

He would come home around 11:30, at around 12:30, I instantly start to get sick

Get this metallic taste in my mouth, my body would start to overheard felt like I was on fire and could not breathe.  I'd run to the window.

Now a normal person may be affected by roach spray or rat poison, but not have insane effects.  One time a friend of mine sprayed it who didn't know of my allergy and I was on the floor gasping for air crying writhing

911 was called I said I felt I was being poisoned

I would hear a sound in the room then it would start


I have a flight to LA I booked tomorrow, because I'm tired of the guessing games

The room became unbearable to stay in

Laying down I feel blood rushing to my head I can't even sleep.  Lights are beginning to affect me.  In a car with the windows closed I can hardly breathe.  Turn on the heat and the effects multiply

Now when I called 911, paramedics say, oh you're probably having a panic attack.  Officers wanted to go in my roomph and check, but I didn't want them to see the Mary Jane on my desk.  Mind you I stopped smoking just to see if it was that, it wasn't.  I told paramedics I'd go to the hospital, but I didn't go because I had things to take care of.

So today, Thursday, I go back to the room to clear out my stuff, because point blank period, I didn't feel safe.

I go in the room, the whole place is lined with white rat poison.  I can't even grab my stuff I feel so woozy.  That's with the window open and the fan on, still can't.  My flight leaves at 4, so I doubt I have time to do all this stuff.  I might see if I can get it postponed because I have important stuff in there.  Maybe I can buy a gas mask, I don't know where, but I want pictures of all the stuff

He moved my things, closed the window, clearly he had been in there, knew I was allergic, and lined it with Rat poison 

What should my next steps be

Part 1, probably unrelated but mixed in there will come at a later time"

I am a junior in college in North Carolina. I have wanted to study abroad since I started college. I finally got that opportunity this year when I found out that I got accepted to study abroad in Finland. However as I did some more research I found out that most of the classes I wanted to take were only taught in Finnish. So after being devasted that I would never get to study abroad I immediately started planning a road trip to see as much of the US as I could and visiting many friends along the way. I got pretty far along with the plans and found out that I could still switch my application to a university in the UK. So here is my dilemma, either I go on a road trip for 3-4 weeks after school gets out and visit friends that I might not see for quite some time, plus I lose that time that I could be working my internship. Or I go study abroad in the UK for a semester and miss the first semester of my fraternity being chartered.

I would also greatly appreciate input from people who have either studied abroad or gone on a cross country road trip, or both. And if you have any experiences that would be key selling points please let me know!

TL:DR Should I study abroad or go on a road trip?

Thanks in advance!"

I graduated with my Computer Science degree not too long ago but haven't done much since. I'm still living with my parents and I've only applied to a few jobs. Since I didn't intern or get any outside of school work experience, I'm underqualified for so many jobs I've looked at. 


My parents are crazy nice and don't badger me about my failed job searches. I don't want to take advantage of this and laze around at home much longer. So I thought I might find a temporary job doing anything pretty soon here to get some kind of work experience. Only one problem.


I have social anxiety and really struggle at making conversation. I'm so terrified of lunch breaks, downtime, age differences, etc. I've always been a nerd and don't have many interests and don't go out much. It's just so hard for me to imagine being happy in *any* work environment, including my eventual career job. Since graduating, I've got one true friend and my family to keep me from getting lonely. If I'm forced to leave the city for a job, I might lose social contact. 


My social anxiety is also keeping me single. I don't get out much so my days are pretty much exercise, video games, learning how to develop games, and job hunting. I feel like having a job will make me seem like less of a loser and make me more interesting and accomplished, so I'm afraid of dating until I've gotten a job.

58o6sx,34,2016-10-21,"How do you see automated data science platforms such as DataRobot affecting the field going forward? Are they just another tool, or are they the beginning of the end for the 'traditional' data scientist?",teshi-o,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/58o6sx/how_do_you_see_automated_data_science_platforms/,"Data science as a field is obviously booming, and there is a lack in the supply qualified data scientists compared to the demand. In recent years, some services offering automated data analysis, like [DataRobot](https://www.datarobot.com/), have come online, and they are incredibly impressive. For those unfamiliar with them, they utilize machine learning algorithms to determine the structure of the data itself, run hundreds of possible models and algorithms, and outputs all of them, including ranking them by various performance measures and allowing someone to then integrate the model or results of their choice into their projects. All someone has to do is upload their data and DataRobot takes it from there. It is essentially automating the process of data science that takes place between collecting/structuring the data, and using the results of the model. 

And it is quite good. I have a colleague who spent a summer as an intern on the data science team for a fairly large financial company, and they hosted a intracompany Kaggle competition, and he said some of the people had some very impressive performances, but someone tried using DataRobot on the same problem for comparison and it blew everyone out of the water.

And though DataRobot is one of the first and better known platforms, it certainly will not be the last. I know of some startups that are aiming to compete with DataRobot in the near future.

So my question is, what do you think this means for the field of data science? Is this just another tool that will be incorporated into the data science toolbox?

I applied before my school's career fair, talked with a representative from the company at the career fair about their experiences -- but not the position I applied for specifically -- and had one thirty minute phone interview a week later. That was all the interaction I had with them before they offered me the position.

I was obviously also applying to other positions and had another interview, so I didn't and still don't really know all that much about the company. Can anyone speak to the extent of what they knew about a company/position before they accepted an internship offer? The only things detailed in the offer letter were the pay and the start and end dates. I know of a list of 6 possible locations where I could be placed, but I wouldn't find out exactly where until March. Other than that, I don't know much. 

This would be my first internship and I don't have much experience making bigger decisions like this, so I feel as if I don't know enough information to accept the offer. At least with colleges I could speak to other students who attended the school and could hear about their personal experiences within a specific college/major. It seems like there's no way to get that kind of information for an internship.

I plan on sticking with this company for the next 1-2 years unless I get an internship in SF at a well known company. I believe it would be hard to find a job with similar perks being a College student. Now the downside to this is I am the sole developer at the company, we outsource bigger projects and I mainly handle the inner workings of the company. 

On to my worries! I am able to choose my own stack, whatever technology I want to work with, and have to handle other things as well such as deployment. Now my problem is that I feel whatever I am learning I am learning on my own. I do not know if I am using the *best* ways of doing things or if I could do something differently, I am not sure how I can improve. I keep this in mind and as such always try double check my code to make improvements even if it works well.

However I would like to know how I can use this time to improve myself to the best of my ability as a programmer despite the fact I don't really have a ""mentor"". Would it be worth it for me to try to pursue other opportunities whilst within College or will I be okay staying with this company and learning on my own?

I'm currently supporting about 15 users and I am doing absolutely EVERYTHING related to IT (The organization has an IT guy on the board of directors but he's very busy with his primary job so he decided to provide this opportunity to me to alleviate with his workload and allow me to gain experience). Unfortunately, when it comes to server administration I have very limited experience so pardon my stupidity on the subject. Keep in mind that I essentially inherited the network with 0 documentation and in somewhat a bad state. 

* Problem: There are thousands of updates required under the Critical/Security/WSUS tabs, and I am having a difficult time essentially determining where to begin with the updates. I noticed that some updates correspond to older machines no longer on the network, or that have been updated to newer OS, and even updates for a Windows 2003 server that has never been on the network... Is there a way to weed out updates that are not relevant to the network? Or even a way to determine which updates I should be installing first prior to installing other ones?

* Additionally, I'm having issues with WSUS providing ""Error: Unexpected Error // An unexpected error occurred. Please contact your system administrator if the problem persists. Click Reset Server Node to try to connect to the server again."" when trying to approve any of the updates as well as slow-ish performance. 

Goal: The problem started with the organization needing to manually update each individual machine instead of pushing for automatic updates through the server. My only logical reasoning to troubleshooting this problem is to get everything up to date so I can more carefully look at individual problems that might be causing for automatic updates not to go through. What approach would more experienced sys admins do to tackle these current issues?

Fast forward to now and things are a bit different, though not too much. The company I expected a job offer with didn't recommend me for employment and all of the subsequent companies I'd been interviewing with invited me to their final round of interviews but declined to offer me a job. 7 companies in total took a close look at me and then told me no.

This really broke my spirit. I know this happens to everyone, but it almost feels like if 7 companies turn you down in a row you're doing something terribly wrong. 

As a chemical engineer with a 3.2 GPA I know I'm definitely not stupid, but something inside of me keeps telling me I'm a worthless piece of shit that now will no longer be good enough for anyone in his life.

I was wondering what other opportunities you see people pursuing in research in the coming years? I'm not necessarily interested in bioinformatics, but moreso the direct patient care aspect of medicine. If you have any ideas/opportunities for either side projects to express my interest in this field, or for post-grad fields to look into, let me know!

So i've been on here the past week or so getting help with an internship that I am trying to land. It is a C# development internship for an education software company, and it's going great so far.

I have already passed the initial phone screening for requirements, experience, logistics, etc.. I have also completed the first technical assessment, where they sent me two C# projects, one of which I had to debug, and another which required that I use custom classes, exception handling, file input/output, button events, and sorting to complete a task. They liked my code, and have invited me in on Monday for a whiteboard technical with the developers.

The thing is, I don't really know C# that well. I have a strong foundation in Java and a strong foundation in C, both of which, combined with google, made the programming assessment very easy for me. That being said, if someone were to say ""Write a program that does x y z in C#"", I would not be as confident, especially at a technical interview in front of judges.

I was wondering if any of you knew a good resource to learn the syntax and special features of C# that would better prepare me for Monday. I am a very strong OO programmer (Java, Python, Swift, learning C++ in class), and just need to figure out the peculiarities of C#.

I'm a student (22 years old) who will be graduating in May with a Bachelor's in CS and I'm at the point where I'm applying for my first real job. However, I'm feeling anxious, overwhelmed, and without direction.

I've been reading this sub for a while now so I know about the big companies we desire, what to study for my interviews, how to set up my resume, etc. The thing that is keeping me up at night and stressing me out is that I still don't know what I want to do. To elaborate a little more, I know I definitely want to do something in the field of computer science, but the field is so broad. The point of this thread is that I'm hoping some older, experienced guys out there will listen to my rant and be able to offer me guidance, or at least help me breathe a little easier and shake some of the anxiety.

As far as work experience goes: I've had 2 jobs at my university doing IT work, those were both to A) make money and B) get some work experience on my resume relating to computers. I know that I definitely don't want to take the IT career path. This past summer I had an internship where I created an ""application"" for this company, but it was using this website (Runmyprocess.com) so I didn't really gain any coding experience. Alas, it's something to talk about and put on my resume. Glad I had an internship rather than not. I was the project leader for that so I did gain some leadership experience, as well as the experience of working for a company and communicating with the different departments (writing emails, scheduling meetings, coordinating testing, etc).

As far as school goes: Most of my core CS classes were all taught in Java so that's where the bulk of my knowledge lies. I've taken a Database Systems class so I have some knowledge in SQL. I wanted to at least declare a specialization so I had something else to put on my resume. After reviewing what my school offered I decided to give Cyber Security a shot, my one professor was very passionate about the subject and keeps me interested enough to the point where I'll be completing the specialization.

Background about myself as a person: I consider my self a social, outgoing person. I have good people skills and would consider myself a leader (usually the team leader in classes where we have group projects, president of my fraternity which has 80 members, chair positions in other on-campus organizations). I wouldn't say I'm necessarily anyone special, but judging by my peers I'm definitely not your average CS student. As it stands I'm not a rockstar coder, but I am a motivated go-getter who wants to learn. Ideally I want to end up somewhere where I'll be able to learn a lot, somewhere that will allow me to grow as an individual and recognize my efforts. I'm not one to sit around and take the hand I'm dealt. I can take the time to appreciate where I am, but I'm never truly satisfied. I always want more, the next opportunity, the next chance to grow and improve, always trying to better myself and also those around me.

My question today is: What do you think I should do, where should I go? Since I'm still young and in school I don't really know much about this whole thing. There are the big software companies, consulting firms, fintech, investment banking, health care services, etc. There are roles like back-end developer, front-end developer, technical analyst, and so many others. It's important to me to pick my first job wisely. I want somewhere that I will fit in, but will also allow me to grow my career to my fullest potential. Naturally, I want to make big money (who doesn't?). I also want to be part of a solid work culture and have a good work/life balance (who doesn't?). I know it's important to just get some type of job first. However, I've gathered that certain jobs may make it harder for you to get jobs in other fields. I don't want my first job to be too far away from what I really want to do and wind up stuck on a career path I'm not satisfied with. I also want to figure out where I fit sooner rather than later so I have more time spent focused on advancing in my desired career path. 

I don't want to keep rambling on for much longer. If anyone would like me to answer any other questions that would help them assess me I'm happy to answer. I appreciate any and all advice, thanks for reading and thanks for the help."

Now, the last part of my degree is passing my language proficiency exam, and I have been trying so hard for so long and I am completely and utterly at a loss. I came in with a major in Russian Studies from undergrad, and what I thought was a solid background, but I definitely still had some work to do. I took intensive courses where time permitted with being in school and working full time through all of it, and managed to greatly improve, but the ONE professor who my school allows to do the testing for Russian has failed me on the speaking test twice now. I took a class with him and used his textbooks. He is an angry human being and uses yelling and intimidation to strike fear in the hearts of his students, and I guess that works for some people, but it doesn't really make me more motivated. 

He doesn't have faith that anybody can pass his exam without spending many weeks in a language immersion program - and while I agree that would be a fabulous option, I can't afford it. I've had to work the entire way through school, so I can't even afford to take all that time off, let alone actually pay for a program like that and the living expenses during that time. I have a great job right now but it's technically an internship, and therefore my advancement to a career position is contingent upon finishing my degree - that is, unless I want to dive back in to the general applicant pool and not take this ""golden ticket"" route by converting up from my internship.

My school will not accept test results from elsewhere because of the specific program I'm in. They will not let me test with another professor. I've shown them results from other teachers that I've worked with and proved that I am fully capable of speaking Russian at the level they want, but I have debilitating testing anxiety with this professor and this process. I can only test one more time anyway. I really wonder if it is worth it. I have a variety of other ""life issues"" that have come up especially in the last two years and it's taken a toll on my mental health and this test is the LAST thing I want to worry about.

I'm also deathly afraid of disappointing everyone around me. I'm tired of explaining why I'm still in school, even though I have literally finished every part of my degree except this test. It makes me feel incredibly stupid and inferior. I'm constantly studying and trying new things and nothing seems to work. I'm right on the edge and my school is not helpful and it doesn't sound like even a note from my therapist explaining the anxiety and mental health concerns is going to help.

Perhaps this was a ramble, I'm sorry...I'm just completely emotionally worn out and I am no longer interested in this degree as much as I was, and I don't know if that's because I never wanted it that badly in the first place or because I've just been brought up to my limits lately. I came straight to grad school from undergrad because this is what I thought I both wanted and needed to do...and now I wonder if I'm really cut out for it. 

If I quit now, or even take a leave of absence to try and figure things out, is it going to look terrible later on my resume when it shows that I started school in Fall 2013 and took forever to finish? I'm so lost, and so out of emotional energy.

TL,DR: Finished everything for my degree except language proficiency and professor seems biased against students who can't afford expensive immersion programs, and now I'm emotionally spent and don't know if it's still worth it. Advice or motivation appreciated."

So I'm about 2 years from finishing my bachelors. I've been reading on here how important it is to get internships over the summer.

Well I want to do the airforce ROTC program (you train while in school to be an officer after graduation.

My remaining summers would be spent training for the air force so I would not be able to do any internships. Would it matter when applying for jobs that  I don't have any internships if I have that military officers experience?

Also I'm going for a masters in CS with concentration on intelligent systems so again would I be fine without an internship?"

I have previous internship experience. I'm also doing a very big individual full-year culminating project. Between my course load, learning the concepts and math I need for my culminating project, and actually implementing the project, I absolutely have zero time. I believe I have good time management but the volume of work leaves me even without weekends.

I do keep a resume up to date, and I could find time to fit in some interviews. But I feel extremely rusty on my algorithms and data structures. I really need to go back and review these concepts in order to do well on a technical interview. I'm aiming for something in computer graphics, games, or something else that requires a lot of math, optimization, and low level programming. I feel like these types of jobs would really put you through the grinder on a technical interview.

Would I be screwing myself over by doing job interview preparation and job applications after I submit my culminating project in March/April? Or do I absolutely need to bite the bullet now and apply? If it makes any difference, I'm willing to relocate anywhere in the world--I'm more interested in having the type of job I want and it doesn't matter where it is."

Now that I've started taking the classes, even though it's not difficult yet I really don't like it and I can't imagine doing it for the rest of my life. Before I started uni I tried to talk to them a lot about doing something I actually wanted to do but they only heard what they wanted to hear and wouldn't listen to any of my reasoning.

So my plan is to switch to essentially doing a double major in psych and a humanities and I'm completely set on it but I'm terrified of telling my parents because I can't even begin to imagine how angry they're going to be. And I'm too dependent on them financially so I feel like if they get really mad they might cut me off. I would hide it from them but what happens when they want me to apply for internships or code something for them.
Any advice on how to tell them?"

58wulg,76,2016-10-22,Why My First Assignment as a Reporter Was My Last,Benzomere,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/58wulg/why_my_first_assignment_as_a_reporter_was_my_last/,"It should have been the kind of career-making story that would launch my career out of the small town news market, something that seemed edgy and nearly satanic to the proudly out-of-touch folks around here, though the Discovery Channel had done a few melodramatic specials on it at least fifteen years ago. Instead, I have spent my life ever since desperately hoping that no one ever connects my name with what happened. 

I'd ended up back in my hometown after college, and I was pissed. I'd basically flipped the bird to everyone I'd ever known and every institution that had molded me in my first eighteen years, sure that I would find some faraway paradise where my genius would be recognized for what it was, that I'd blossom into the greatest journalist the world had ever seen. I was going to blow the lid off of everything. Through classes and clubs and internships, I spent four years telling everyone within earshot what a bunch of stupid backward hicks I'd managed to escape from, and they all agreed in the kindest possible terms that I certainly did not belong in a place like that.

When my dad's death forced me to move back home just weeks after graduation, part of me wondered if it was karma. I couldn't shake the icy hollow feeling deep in my gut that the universe was punishing me for being so mean and uppity about the people I came from. Of course, I told everyone that it was simply an economic decision, that losing the sole breadwinner of the family left my mom, whose decades of work experience boiled down to ""keeps a tidy house and bakes a mean meatloaf,"" completely on her own with no way to live. While all of that was true, dad's company paid the family a hell of a lot of money to keep us from suing. And we'd have won any case too, they decided maintenance was too costly and his truck stalled on a railroad track. No open casket, I'll tell you that much.

By the ripe old age of 24, I felt like a total failure. I had escaped and been pulled right back into the same house with the same posters from high school on the walls, the same mom who offered me PB&amp;J sandwiches with the crusts cut off, but no dad and nobody to keep things going. That wasn't supposed to have been my job, and you can bet that I resented it.

I don't think you process mourning quite so much as you just get bored with it. Mourning my dad, mourning my life, mourning my future. For months, that was my whole life, there wasn't anything else I could even think to do. Then, it just got tiresome. I was sick of being sad and feeling sorry for myself, even if I had good reason to be.

The local news station sat smack between my mom's house and the grocery store, I must have passed by it nearly every day of the week. One day, and I'm not sure why, call it a whim, I turned right instead of left, walked into the station, and asked the receptionist if they had any job openings. As it turned out, one of the reporters walking through the lobby recognized me from the coverage of my dad's funeral, which had been big news in the little community. He put his arm around me like we were good friends and took me right back into the news office to the manager who handled internships. Just like that, I'd managed to turn a trip into the grocery store into a job actually putting my degree to use.

If you think that sounds exciting, you haven't been paying attention. Nothing happens around here, not even a scandal in the news channel staff that might have created some kind of upward mobility for me. After two years of schlepping camera equipment and sucking up to the insufferable anchors (who thought they were *real* hot shit), I never went to work without a couple of those mini plastic booze bottles in my gear bag. 

At first, I thought the local rumors about tattooed freaks were just from bored high school kids who'd been watching too many low-budget horror movies. Frankly, nobody that interesting would have any reason to be here, not even spooking the normal folks. But as I was driving home one dark night, I discovered that they were completely true. I nearly smashed into the disabled car on the shoulder, but my driving reflexes have been nearly superhuman since dad's accident. 

I pulled over and clicked on my hazards, then ran around to the trunk and fished out half a dozen reflective triangles. This section of road had no lights at all, and on cloudy nights like this, you could barely see your hand in front of your face. I nearly ran into the guy standing in front of the car before I saw him. 

""Oh, thank you!"" he said, in a voice that told me he'd been on the verge of panic until I showed up. ""I don't really know much about cars, but the whole thing's just dead. The emergency lights won't even go on."" We surrounded the car with the safety triangles and used my phone to call AAA, and I suggested we keep warm in my car while we waited. Under the yellow plastic lights inside, I could finally see that this stranded driver did not fit the town's typical aesthetic. 

His face seemed to be equal parts shiny silver and smooth skin, with rings and chains and baubles decorating every surface from his hairline to his neck. Even his tongue flickered as it reflected the dim light, and he clicked the piercing against his teeth when I spoke, listening intently and staring at me like a friendly snake. Elaborate flourishes of tattoos peeked out from his collar and shirtsleeves, and I had no trouble imagining that his body was just as covered in ink as his face was in metal. 

He said his name was James, and that he lived right outside of town with a few other friends who shared similar interests in what he referred to as ""extreme body modification."" As he described it, the piercings and the tattoos weren't just about looking different and freaking kids out (though, he admitted somewhat sheepishly, that is one of the major benefits), but it was a kind of community bonding for them, a shared experience of pain and trust. Not my bag, but to each his own. 

James finally noticed my press pass dangling from the rear view mirror. ""You a reporter or something?""

""Or something,"" I answered. ""Although, maybe I have a story now. Turns out that those kids really *weren't* on drugs, they really did see a gang of tattooed weirdos out in the woods!""

James grinned at me, his cheek jewelry jingling. ""I've got a way better story for you,"" he said. 

I wish I hadn't listened. I wish that when he waved goodbye from the passenger seat of the tow truck, that was the last I'd ever seen of James, the super-pierced driver stranded on the side of the road. But, of course, it wasn't. 

Instead, four days later, I found myself in a surprisingly large and well-kept cabin right outside of town, a beautiful property tucked into the hill above the pond we generously dubbed ""Thayer Lake."" As soon as the story had come out of my mouth, the station manager couldn't get me out the door fast enough, along with three camera operators and so much equipment that we had to bring two vans. I can't even tell you what the station was thinking when they bought all this stuff, I'm pretty sure that's still the only time it's ever been used. The outside loomed in dark wood, wide steps leading up to a wraparound porch that surrounded the whole house, revealing a breathtaking view of the lake, visible from inside through spectacular two-story windows that sparkled spotless in the afternoon sun. To be blunt, this flew in the face of the expectations I'd had for a house full of ""body mod enthusiasts."" 

Turned out that the house belonged to one of James's buddies, a guy with photorealistic puzzle pieces meticulously tattooed all over his head and neck. I couldn't tell you how many hours he must have sat under the buzzing gun for all that, but it was a hell of a lot more than I'd be interested in. His grandfather had left him the place, the crown jewel of the modest family estate, one last slap in the face to the judgmental conservative family who had shunned his less-than-traditional grandson. 

My crew got to work setting the place up for filming: snaking wire across the floor, screwing scaffolding for lights and mics into place, finding the best angles for the cameras. That last bit was the hard part; I still had no idea what exactly we were supposed to be filming. As I took in the foreign sights in the house, the torturous-looking tattoo needles and dark pots of pigment, long stainless steel cones and rods with a variety of piercings from big to small, the unreadable strangers who exuded auras of dangerous deviance and genuine friendliness at once, James emerged from a room back down a hallway, wrapped in a fluffy white bathrobe. His beaming smile pulled my eyes right to it, the only empty white space on his chaotic hardware-filled face. 

""So where should we set up the cameras for the best view of...well, whatever it is we're watching you do?"" I asked, trying and failing to sound cool and unimpressed, like I saw this kind of thing all the time. It wasn't often that I felt like a dork in this town, and I didn't enjoy it. 

""The main event,"" James said dramatically, with a devilish grin, ""will be right up there."" Looking straight up, I saw silvery chains dangling from the vaulted ceiling, glinting in the bright sun streaming through the massive windows. They hung from an elaborate-looking pulley system that appeared firmly affixed to the exposed rafters with bolts as thick as my wrist. I caught one of the camera crew watching us and gave him a quick nod, pointing up at the ceiling, and he got to work aiming our lenses upward.

At this point, I realized James was still staring at me. I didn't want to admit that I was still completely baffled as to what he was talking about, so I saved face in the best possible way: I started the interview. It was actually going to work pretty well, I think, having local-girl-me and James-the-Freakshow on the portable cam, with all the preparations happening right there a few feet behind us, framed by the picturesque backdrop of Thayer Lake, ensuring for all our viewers that this kind of thing really did happen in our humble little town. Whatever ""this kind of thing"" was. 

After the few basic who-are-you and why-are-you-here questions, I asked James about what we would be witnessing here today. James stood, turned his back to me, and dropped his bathrobe. I have to admit, I gasped. So did the cameraman behind me. 

James's back was *covered* in what looked like enormous fishhooks, the skin around them bright pink and puckered, a few streaks of yellow-brown iodine left behind by what must have been a meticulous cleaning. There were ten of them hanging in four distinct rows from his shoulders down to his hips, where he wore his only article of clothing, a pair of skintight boxer briefs patterned in comic-book action bubbles (you know, like ""POW!"") He chuckled slightly at hearing our reactions, seeming to hold himself still as the hooks shivered in response to every little movement. 

""Allow me to introduce Ms. Megan,"" he said, beckoning over a heavyset woman with royal purple hair and latex gloves on her hands. James explained that Ms. Megan was *the* expert on ""suspension,"" an extreme form of body modification where people literally hung from hooks pierced through their skin. 

""What makes you want to do this?"" I asked, doing a better job than I'd expected at maintaining my professional reporter-voice, ""I imagine that you must feel very vulnerable, being in that helpless position.""

""I'm not helpless,"" James answered warmly, ""I have Ms. Megan taking care of me. Without her, I'd have never gotten into the body mod scene in the first place, and now I'm sitting here about to do the sickest suspension anyone's ever attempted. But like, it is about vulnerability, you know? It's about trust. I trust these guys, and I know I can trust you."" Thank the Lord for makeup, because I'm pretty sure my cheeks went bright red at that little thank-you from James for the way we'd met. 

Ms. Megan ushered us over to a massage table on the side of the room, where James casually lay on his belly with his face poking through the padded hole. The other body mod artists helped stabilize his limbs while Ms. Megan finished the last of the preparations. Concentrating with a furrowed brow and the tip of her tongue peeking out from the corner of her mouth, Ms. Megan deftly skewered James's arms and legs with more than a dozen new hooks, which she unwrapped individually from sterile medical supply bags. I watched in awe, wondering how I could have been unaware of this bizarre art form when it seemed so well-supported on every front. Usually, Ms. Megan explained to the room, suspension doesn't use the arms and legs, too much risk of tearing right through the skin and causing major damage. But she'd grown to know James's body over the years, and she thought his could support it.

Finally, it was showtime. The crew turned on the blinding light panels, filling the center of the room with intense, unnaturally white light, throwing the corners of the spacious house into sudden shadow. James shuffled carefully toward the center of the room as Puzzle Tattoo guy pressed a switch on the wall, lowering the rigging down from the ceiling. The pulley system moved smooth as silk, not letting out so much as a squeak as it brought the heavy chains down. James lay himself flat on the hardwood floor while Ms. Megan and the other two body modders quickly slipped the chain links onto the hooks protruding from James's body. Ms. Megan double- and triple-checked everything before whispering into James's ear, receiving two big thumbs-up. 

Ms. Megan, the expert, would control the pulleys, ensuring that James's body would handle the stresses of speed and minor movements as he was hoisted up into the air by his skin. She began to apply pressure to the control on the wall, and the rigging started its eerily silent ascent back up to the ceiling. At first, James didn't move, the chains and straps still relaxed. They slowly straightened as they rose, then suddenly snapped taut as they pulled on James's body weight. His fingers and toes flexed in spontaneous reaction to what must have been a bizarre sensation, then relaxed as his experience took over. It was all I could do to keep my stomach from playing a rerun of breakfast. Even though I knew there was a camera on me, I chewed my thumb so hard I thought I'd draw blood. 

It all went wrong so fast.

Even with Ms. Megan's cautious hand, it took only a few seconds until James was hanging a full fifteen feet off the ground. That's when one of the crewmen passed his limit, and spewed vomit like a geyser all over the back of one of the camera operators. 

It was purely an accident. He was just operating on reflex at that point, just like any of us would respond to a tidal wave of coworker puke down the back of our shirts. He wheeled around to see what the hell was going on. 

If only he'd let go of the camera first.

The huge camera followed its captain, knocking right into a huge high-power lighting array. Sparks flew in a massive explosion as the high-voltage halogen toppled over and delivered a fatal surge of electricity directly to Ms. Megan's purple-topped head. For a moment, everyone forgot about James to focus on the clearly-dead Ms. Megan, whose dramatic locks had been burnt into nothing along with most of the top half of her head. I was frozen, my brain so surprised by the sudden turn of events that I couldn't even process the world around me. Like a camera flash, the bright-white explosion of the light had temporarily blinded me, but the smell and sound were so clear as to evoke the primal knowledge in me before I could see it. 

Fire. I could hear popping and crackling and electric arcing scattered all around the room, and the air filled with the odor of smoldering plastic. When my vision faded back in, I saw black soot around the outlets. The cameraman behind me let out a shriek and dropped his heavy equipment to the ground as it shot sparks all along the cord tracing back into the wall. 

Visible flames appeared along the ground, racing along all the cables leading to television equipment and tattoo guns and everyday appliances, licking at the baseboards and climbing effortlessly up the walls, consuming the glossy varnish that showcased the natural wood composing the impressive home. 

An agonized scream from James instantly took everyone's attention. His friends rolled aside the body of Ms. Megan and pawed frantically at the control panel. 

It was fried. 

The vomit-covered cameramen bolted out the back door, generously giving the fire an endless supply of oxygen. The room erupted in a massive fireball as the wave of fresh air rushed inside like a flaming tsunami, knocking everyone off their feet. Except James, of course. 

All of us were on fire. My cameraman wasn't moving. I didn't help him. I could feel the skin on my legs melting inside my polyester pants as I crawled across the floor toward the open back door. I made it out and threw myself over the side of the porch, smothering the flames in the mud on the ground. An enormous plume of thick black smoke was being pumped out from the massive house fire, the fire department would be there in no time.

But it was too late. Even for James, who would burn alive dangling fifteen feet above his friend's living room. Laying injured on the cold ground, I saw it all through those spectacular picture windows."

3) The effect of Nihilism and different ways of viewing the world (philosophical) changed my life from being introverted to extroverted

**Planned career:**


I enjoy **philosophy** (reading and discussing, continental philosophy with a focus in existentialism and morality). This would mean I would most likely be in a history/social science program rather than a logic program.

EA: Case Western, U Chicago
Public schools: Madison, Cal, U of Mich, UW Madison, U of Minnesota (basically in already)

RD: Northwestern, Yale, Brown, Harvard, Duke, Cornell, NYU

If I could get some advice on my choices and if I'm overestimating myself, I would be very appreciative. **Thank you in advanced!**"

I never went out with my buddies and broke up with my GF during my first year so I could devote all my time studying. I ended up having a high GPA.

But now I'm in my senior year and I can't find a good company for an internship required to graduate. Probably because they are not currently looking for interns (Or maybe this is just my ego trying to protect itself). 

For months I've been looking and I'm hurt that those with a low GPA got internships just because their uncle or whatever is a CS graduate working in that company. My parents are not in the CS field, they own their own business, it is not a corporation so I don't want to intern under them even if they offered me to do so. 

I feel like a failure. Like all my effort studying hard was useless. I ended up tricking my parents into giving me their retirement funds; I won't go into the details how, but I took advantage of the fact that my father loves me very much. 

I feel somehow bad for  doing it, but if I didn't do it I would end up a loser compared to my classmates! I don't have what it takes to even find an internship, there is no way I could find a good job by myself. 

 At least with the money I conned out of my parents, the annual interest I would gain would let me be more successful than my classmates. Their salary would be no match for me. **I feel extremely hurt and insecure right now.**

I was recently charged with a DUI-D (driving under the influence of marijuana) in a southern US state a week after accepting an offer from a Big 4 firm for Technology Consulting. My offer was extended after an internship in NYC (the charge is in a different state than where I will be working). This is my 1st offense and is considered a Misdemeanour 1. Due to the slow wheels of justice my trial most likely won't start until January, possibly even February and the start date for my Big 4 position would be in July or August (I've already lawyered up, but based on police reports the chances of the charge getting reduced to reckless driving is low unless there is some administrative error which pops up)

I'm extremely concerned about losing my offer as a result of this charge. Can anyone offer any advice? I'm a nervous wreck and I'm considering going to student therapy sessions - I'm the 1st person in my family to get a job at a big company and the thought of screwing up this opportunity and letting my whole family down is causing me to lose sleep and my appetite. 

I see a few possible options/outcomes which I've listed below:

* 1) Call my recruiter this week and let them know
* R1a) They thank me for being honest and keep the offer on the table

* 3) Don't do anything until the court date and a conviction is handed down then revisit the above options

Does anyone have any experience or industry knowledge about campus hires and arrests (not issues arisen while people were already employed)? Is anyone aware of the timing of background checks for Big 4?

Does a successful internship add any credence?

590sxr,2,2016-10-23,"[Long] At an academic and professional crossroads. I am unsure of what to do, or even what my options are...",Unsurethrowaway278,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/590sxr/long_at_an_academic_and_professional_crossroads_i/,"**Background:**

I am a 25 year old male, and when I was a teenager (or probably before that, I have a terrible memory), I was diagnosed with ADHD and Bipolar Disorder.  Eventually, through the natural growing-up process, a series of different life events, and the right medication, I became able to function normally.

My experience with mental illness had a profound impact on me, and this combined with my natural interest in psychology prompted me to eventually get my Master's in Clinical Psychology in December of 2015.  I have all the pre-requisites to get an LPC (Licensed Professional Counselor) License, and counseling is definitely something I want to do.  However, my experiences with medication (without which I would almost certainly not be as functional as I am) made me want to be able to prescribe psychiatric medication to my patients as well, since I know how helpful that can be.  Since med school would take too long as I would have basically had to start my entire college career over, I went to nursing school instead.  The hope is that I would eventually get my Nurse Practitioner license, which would allow me to prescribe medication (with the supervision of a physician, which I'm fine with).  

In June 2016 I started a 15-month BSN program that will end in August 2017 with me having my GN (Graduate Nurse), and after 6 months of working as a GN I will be granted my RN license.  Then, after getting about a year of experience, I can go back to school and get my nurse practitioner license.  That was the theory anyway.

However, these past two semesters in nursing school (almost done with the second), have been hell.  Graduate school was hard, no doubt.  Yet even though my thesis required comparable hours of work, it never felt even close to this bad.  These past two semesters I've been sleep deprived, depressed, and anxious to say the least.  I expected that to an extent, but it's gotten to a pretty scary point.  I've had extreme difficulty trying to lose weight (which is already hard), I have misplaced valuable items (even a textbook I borrowed from a teacher), and I have even had a few instances of serious anger (almost unheard of for me).

About a week and a half ago, I had a major Obstetrics test that was scheduled for 10:30 am, yet I somehow had it in my head that it was at 1pm.  I didn't figure it out until my friend came up to me studying in the lobby of the school and asked how I did on the test.  I completely missed it, and though I managed to get a doctor's note to get it excused, it was completely devastating.  Nothing has ever fallen through the cracks like that.  It's not like I've never been late or missed a meeting, but I've never missed anything like this.  So, this was sort of a wakeup call to my girlfriend (who was already worried), who then brought it up to me several times until I listened and realized she was right.  Nursing school is genuinely damaging me.  I know I don’t care about nursing enough to really want to finish nursing school, and I hate what it’s doing to me.  I am miserable, and I think my plan probably needs to change.  

**The Dilemma:**

I want to work as a psychologist, and as mentioned before I already have the pre-requisites that will allow me to acquire an LPC licensure.  I also want to be able to prescribe medication if possible, or at the very least provide an authoritative view on medication options for my patients (at a minimum something like provide recommendations that patients can take to a psychiatrist that a psychiatrist will actually listen to).  
My parents pay for my school, and help out with life expenses (though I have worked on and off throughout my career and use my savings to pay for most of my expenses).  They were psyched about my current plan and have been very encouraging about nursing school.  I really don’t want to disappoint them.

So far the options I’ve come up with are:

1. Continue my previous plan: finish nursing school, get RN license by early 2018, apply for NP school beginning of 2019, finish NP school while working as a nurse, then in 2020 apply to take the LPC licensure exam, then work for about 2 years as an LPC intern until I finally get my license in 2022 at the age of 30.  It’s a long road, but the end result would be that I could be both a counselor and a prescriber of medication (under supervision of a psychiatrist)


2. Finish nursing school, get RN license by early 2018 (might as well finish what I started), then go and get my PhD in Psychology (a 5 year degree) which would get me a license to counsel by 2023 with more freedom than a master’s level counselor.  I would not, however, have any prescribing power though I would have more medical knowledge than the average PhD in Psych.


3. Stop nursing school after this semester, and apply for a PhD program in psychology.  I’d probably get in to start in the summer of 2017, and it would be a 5 year program, ending in about 2022 (I’d be 30).  I’d have no prescribing power, and would forever bear the shame of not finishing nursing school.

**The Questions:**


1. If I don’t finish nursing school, what other choices do I have for being able to prescribe medications or provide authoritative recommendations on medications for my patients?


2. Are there any options/plans I haven’t considered that you can think of?


3. How do I break this to my parents?


4. Any other advice, or another place that would be good to ask about this.

I've been talking to a company for a while and it seems like it's really likely that they're gonna hire me. The company is a small (somewhat new) consulting company and the experiences and such look awesome. They mentioned pay a bit in the middle of the interview processes. They said 

- mid 50k salary base

- 5% 401k 

- about 10% annual bonus. 

- other small benefits. I can opt out for insurance.

I was thinking more around low to mid 60k salary. But at that point in the interview, since I just wanted to keep on moving in the interview process, I just said ""yeah that sounds nice."" Would it be okay for me to negotiate after they decided they want me? I think I'll be talking to the CEO for salary negotiation as this is a small company (I've talked to him a few times already as part of the interview process).

My peers/family suggested that I should just have this offer around me and simply apply to other jobs but honestly I'm burned out from applying to jobs. Most jobs I did talk to said they'll look into hiring new grads in Spring since I'm graduating in May. What should I do?

FYI, this will be in a non expensive city (unlike Bay area) so 50~60k is like not bad, I think. I'm also not a superstar (far from it) with decent project but no internship. &lt;3.0 gpa but they didn't ask."

Sophomore year of college was tough for me. My father was diagnosed with cancer in the beginning of the year, and eventually passed away a few months later. Because of this, I was traveling back and forth between home and school a lot, which caused me to neglect some of my class work. My GPA took a huge hit, and now I'm worried I'll never be able to get a job at a top company. Is there any way I can explain this in an interview, even if they don't ask.

My family went through a lot over that time and I didn't have the motivation to continue with the class (especially since I was taking Calculus at the same time), so I dropped it. I wasn't enjoying Physics as much as I thought I would anyway, so I wasn't too upset about it. 

This semester, I decided to take Biology and Chemistry as part of a Bioinformatics.

Can some people help me come up with the right plan with what I have right now?,poopywienerfarts,OSUOnlineCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSUOnlineCS/comments/59690p/im_graduating_soon_in_spring_or_summer_term_of/,"I have no experience in coding or programming - and no professional employment (and no internships) - before I started the program in January, so I know C++ sorta and I'm beginning to learn Web Dev and databases this term, and I will learn some Java in the next couple of terms. I have taken Data Structures - although I need to study them some more before being able to answer questions/ solve interview problems about them. 

I am located in the opposite of a tech hub - very few software job listings, mostly in government or defense corporations. I am willing to relocate anywhere in the United States with a good software market and career opportunities: SFBA, Seattle, New York City, Boston, etc, etc. I would like a job in non-front-end web/mobile development, or a C++ or Java job. I would prefer not to work remotely, since I want to work and learn from people in person.

I have an idea for what my resume should look like. I am starting to get it populated with projects and stuff, which will make up the bulk of it, but won't really have anything else. 

So my plan so far is to study for interviews and pad up my resume with projects and skills, and then essentially mass-apply for jobs online that sound good - maybe 2-3 per day. What I want to know is how to get a job in another city across the country as an unremarkable entry level candidate? I assume some companies who I pass a phone interview with will fly me out for additional interviews, making the process longer and longer, since I am not local anywhere.

What else should/can I do? If you want to PM me and help me out in a really personal way I would love that &lt;3"
596jtf,0,2016-10-24,Is college required for this field,ToBigbaseDesigns,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/596jtf/is_college_required_for_this_field/," My first question is there any well made program that teaches coding and another one that teaches animation? Specifically (For coding) c# or what ever the unreal engine runs on. I mean professionally done, not some one on a youtube channel giving out instructions. I'm willing to pay even 1k, it's far cheaper than what I have now.
My second question is can I get hired by a game studios if I show outstanding skills? (For a game developer career.) How about average?

 The reason why i'm asking this is because i'm debating on droping my 4 year college or not. I don't want an enormous debt and to pay for classes I don't want to take or need. I want to get into programming and what my career needs now.
 What i'm saying is I don't like school anymore, I would rather cut the nonsense out and go to what I love and be doing it directly. Classes like English  makes me mad here; it's not even good writing all they're doing is teaching people how to be dull and communicate properly. (Actually understand what you've written.) It literally makes me want to slam my head into something or to severely hurt myself.
 I would really rather to just start learning on my own, go out get a job and work on my own projects. Not to be stuck here in a place I don't want to be at while getting further into debt. (Estimated around 80k+ for 4 years minimum.)

 Yes I've done some research on it but I would rather hear from some one personally in the field. I believe I have to get some internships and practice my skills in what would have been time at college. Who knows, it might be an advantage."

After receiving an internship this past summer in my field, I think it hit me I was in the wrong field. Prior to this summer, I have taught kids computer science every summer through a summer camp I directed. In my internship, I worked in a cubicle from 8-4 and felt like I had sold my soul to corporate America. Also, there is not a tech industry where I'm from, so no matter where I worked in tech I would be far from home. 
  
But, I'm a senior so it's too late to change my major to education. My school has an alternate route where I can get a Master of Arts in teaching, but CS is not a subject I can get my licensure in. I have to have 21 hours in a subject to get licensure, and I don't have 21 hours in any subject you can get licensure in. I have 12 hours of math credits, but business is closer to what I'd want to teach. Also, math is probably my weakest subject, so I'd be nervous about teaching it to young minds.
  
The biggest part came when I told my dad, who said that he felt like I would be wasting my degree if I came to school and got an engineering degree only to be a teacher, among the fact that I already have a job making a lot more money lined up with the corporate company. 
  
So, now upon being conflicted about math or business, I'm even more worried about disappointing my dad but I just *know* I won't be happy eight and a half hours from home slaving away in a cube even if the paychecks are nice. 
  
I posted here half as a rant but also I'm imagining I can't be the only person this has happened to."

Senior. Also a year younger than everyone else in the class of 2017 (I skipped a grade). Oh and I definitely don’t qualify for financial aid lmao

Intended major(s): Undecided- maybe gender studies (rip my salary- I probably won't actually major in this but it lines up with my ECs/interests), political science (likelier to be my actual major), economics (same deal as polisci), mathematics/physics (at my safeties)

Academics:

* ACT: 34C (35E 33M 33R 36S) 29W

* SAT: Not submitting, but 1380 (710 CR, 670 M)

* SAT II: **780 Math II second try, 710 US History**, 680 Literature second try, 670 Math II first try, 650 Literature first try.

* Class rank: School does not rank, but unofficially (calculated via schools' stats on unweighted GPA quintiles) 12th/57. Not that colleges will bother calculating that statistic, though

* UW/W GPA: **3.77 cumulative UW** (3.75 freshman, 3.95 sophomore, 3.62 junior *but there were extenuating circumstances*, currently have a 3.92 for my senior year grades) / 3.91 W

* Coursework: taking almost all of the most challenging classes available to me. Currently in all APs. I’ve taken APUSH (not reporting this score b/c I failed the exam), AP Calc AB (5), and will take AP Micro&amp;MacroEcon, AP Spanish Lang, AP English Lit, AP Calc BC.

* Awards: honor roll 9th grade to present. My summer team won the sportsmanship award at a national championship. Some team awards from my high school team’s success, as well as a couple little awards from my summer teams. National Merit Commended Scholar. Nothing too great here compared to all the nerds in this subreddit.

* LORs: One from my APUSH teacher who said she “would be honored to write [my] recommendation” and one from my AP Calc AB teacher who has seen me put in a lot of hard work in her class (I got a 5!). A kickass rec from my old coach who literally wrote two pages on my work ethic, leadership, dedication, commitment, etc. Also my college counselor who is going to mention some great things that other teachers who are not writing my recs have said about me. 


Extracurriculars (purposely vague):

* Intern at the state affiliate of a national civil liberties organization — **this is usually a position given to law students**. I began as a volunteer and stayed for long enough that they now refer to me as an intern. I’ve been doing this since November of junior year.

* **Founded a sports team at my school with no help from the administration (this is big)**, organized everything for it, recruited the majority of the team, sophomore year I drafted and submitted a proposal to grant the team varsity status (after I worked extensively with the school administration, they gave us varsity status), created and still run the team gear store, work with athletic department to get early dismissal and such. I basically still manage the team. Lots and lots of leadership here.

* varsity in this sport for three years of high school (JV for first year)

* club team in this sport for 10 years, began doing this at the national level right before junior year. Anywhere I apply early, coaches at reach schools **(Yale, Tufts)** will talk to admissions, get me some help, but *no guarantees/no likely letter.*

* advocated for a change in the code of conduct for my club team to cover issues of bullying and harassment that I’d seen go unaddressed on the team. These changes were implemented.

* Leader of school’s gender &amp; sexuality alliance for junior (co-leader) + senior year (head of club), member for all four years of HS

* Attended several diversity conferences, including a three-day national conference about leadership and social justice (I love social justice basically)

* Stage crew for the winter musical sophomore and junior years, and likely senior year. Some leadership-y things here.

* Founding member of school's social justice/activism club. We've done some projects: food drive, sexual violence/human trafficking awareness project, etc.

* School’s leadership program, 9th grade-present.

* Yearbook club member (won’t fit on common app)

* Literary magazine staff 9th and 10th grade (won’t fit on common app)

* Member of various social justice clubs (feminist club, people of color affinity group, current events discussion club) (won't fit on common app)

Essays:

* Common App: wrote prompt 1 about my relationship with feminism and how it has changed as a result of some issues I've faced. 8/10 or 9/10

* Supplements: Probably 8/10. Wrote mostly about social justice and my dedication to and passion for my sport.

Schools:

* Cornell ILR (RD, no recruitment boost even if I were to apply ED, which I'm not doing)

* Brown (RD)

* BU CAS + Kilachand Honors College (Some legacy here- RD)

* Tufts Arts &amp; Sciences (double legacy- ED II if Yale rejects me. Recruitment boost, but no guarantees. **The coach thinks I'll get in if I apply ED II.**  Lots of qualified people from my school applying here.)

* Connecticut College (RD)

* UVM Arts &amp; Sciences + Honors (EA)

* Northeastern, College of Social Sciences &amp; Humanities (RD)

* St Mary's College of Maryland (EA but more likely RD because I haven’t written the essay yet)

* Eckerd (Rolling)

* Yale (REA- recruitment boost, but no guarantee that I'll get in. Coach says I'm ""solidly in the game with my academics, but then again nearly everyone is."" **Hook?**)

Questions:

* Do I have any chance at Yale, with the recruitment boost?

~~* Tufts or BU for ED II? I've visited both on recruitment trips, and I liked Tufts, but I **loved** BU. Now I don't know what to do because my parents are insistent on Tufts ED II because ""it's a better school.""~~"

I decided to learn software after I graduated. Got an internship, learned HTML/CSS/JS. This got me onto a web development path, which I thought would help me focus on something specific. Wow, holy shit, I was so wrong.

The internship ended, and for the past couple of months I learned SASS, Bootstrap, jQuery and used those for some side projects. I picked up another project and now I'm learning how to work with PHP on a MAMP environment on Wordpress (I know, wordpress sucks). I realized that I had a focus problem, that I was spreading myself too thin. However, there was still a major gap in my resume if I was to be focusing on web development - I didn't know any frameworks. After some research, I decided to go with React.js. This was to be a dive for at least a week so that I could start creating my portfolio of my projects with React. I went to sleep that night sort of content at this path and direction. 

I woke up to an email from Google saying I passed the first round technical interview, which I took in Python (which I only learned so that I could take the test). I have a month before my second round technical interview, and at this point I'm at a loss - what do I do? I'm pretty sure I'm going to take the test in Java at this point, since I have some experience with data structures and algorithms in Java. But it feels like I'm putting all my eggs in the Google/Java basket. After this month of studying, if I don't get the offer or move on to the next round, do I just go back to javascript and learning web development? How do you guys find focus when you've only dipped your toes in the software pool? 

Thanks for reading, I appreciate any tips you guys have. This is my first time posting so I'm sorry if this post was difficult to follow."

I love the company, the work is fun, the people are great, I'm learning a lot and as of right now, I have no complaints. For awhile now, I have been wanting to return there after I graduate as a full-time employee. And the pay is decent in this area. 

A lot of people say I should try another company just to see what's out there and I understand that, but I think staying for another internship would bring me one step closer to one of my goals which is to work there when I graduate. 

I can see the benefits of trying new things, but I think staying for my 3rd internship is what would be best for me. Thoughts?"

BP3 looks great. Austin sounds like an awesome city and it sounds like I'll be doing actual software engineering and held up to the same coding standards as their full time employees.

I am currently a junior CS &amp; Math major and toyed with the idea of minoring in Physics or Bioinformatics.
I was taking Physics I over the summer and my grandfather unexpectedly got extremely sick and passed away towards the end of the semester. My family went through a lot over that time and I didn't have the motivation to continue with the class (especially since I was taking Calculus at the same time), so I dropped it. I wasn't enjoying Physics as much as I thought I would anyway, so I wasn't too upset about it.
This semester, I decided to take Biology and Chemistry as part of a Bioinformatics. However, I again was not liking them as much as I though I would, and they were causing my grades in my CS &amp; Math courses to tank. As a result, I dropped both of them. Unfortunately for me, they are both comprised of two courses each (Chem had a recitation and Bio had a lab), so they show up as 4 W's on my transcript for this semester. In total, I now have 5 W's over the course of the past 4 months.
How much will this hurt my grad school applications? I am looking to apply for CS and Data Science PhD programs, and I have a 3.56 cumulative GPA &amp; 3.96 in-major GPA. I also have research experience (although no publications yet) and several internships. Will these W's destroy my chances?"

I am currently a junior in college going through interview season. As someone new to job searching in general, I would like to ask whats a reasonable deadline for accepting an offer for a summer internship. I know that this varies from company to company, but it still feels, in general, too early to know for sure I wouldn't want to work for other companies in the summer.

Following the advice of this subreddit, I basically completed as much intern applications as I possibly could. I only heard back from 1 company last year, which I ended up working for, so I was scared that I was going to get very little interviews this year as well, even after sending bulk applications.

Now there are still some companies I am interviewing with, completing coding challenges for. Additionally, I'm optimistic that many other companies will be interested in me as well that haven't gotten back to me yet.

Although I don't have a solid offer from any company yet, I believe they will be sending me one soon. At the same time, I don't know what to expect for the deadline of the offer, and until when can I extend it to. November, December, January? I plan to keep interviewing for other companies as well to see if I can get any offers that may be better for me in my situation. I know I can renege the offer in the future if something comes up, but will this burn bridges?

Additionally, I was wondering if previous internship hourly wages should have any effect on how much we should get paid for our next internship. For example, I got paid 23$/hr last summer so if the offer I get is lower than 23, should I try to negotiate the wage? I know internships are for experience but I would like to know. "

I'm not really anything special. I don't go to a target school or anything. I go to a state school in the Midwest. All I did was study and do things like Hackerrank, CTCI, etc a lot. I was hoping to land a *good* internship, but never thought I'd land one of the caliber that I did.

So now, comparing me to the ""typical prestigious intern"", I feel like an imposter. I'm honestly afraid that I'll get a project *designed* for the typical genius student from MIT and then bomb it, and not get a return offer (or maybe even blacklisted). 

Is this normal? "

Permanent dilemma so I was wondering what some of you might advise me to do.

So as it stands I am looking for a permanent/full time position in the Advertising/Marketing field after graduating in June. I did exceptionally well in the program and since then I've been searching high and low for a break. After months of searching, going out on informationals, portfolio reviews, networking etc. I decide to pivot from looking for a Creative role to a Account Services role and I manage to land a series of interviews with a very notable Marketing company. We go back and forth with follow up interviews where I meet and interview with 6 different managers of the same company/division and 2 different Talent Manager outright say to me that they want me in the company or they definitely see a place for me there. However the positions I interviewed for did not pan out due to the client not going forward as well as internal restructuring. I have maintained a great professional relationship with the Talent Manager and at last contact he reiterated that they are very keen to bring me on board, however there weren't any positions at the time which he thought best fit me. He then stated than there may be opportunities in the new year. All of the positions that I was brought in for were paying around 55k/year and were all mid-manager level. This situation/company will be referred to as ""Company 1"".

Cut to a recent offer of an Internship from another lesser known agency (Company 2). Now at this point in time I have been jobless for about 4 months or so, managing to get by on my savings alone (which are dwindling down unless I become the neighbourhood Pizza delivery guy). I initially was looking for Account Manager positions at (Company 1), however the Talent Manager there said that although he totally could see me doing the job there, the position requires ""agency experience"" (which I do not have). What bothers me is not the minimum-wage being offered as I am fairly frugal to being with - I think I can make it work so to speak. 

The problem is that I am 35 years old, with a background in Marketing/Promotions/Event Management and I am wondering if this internship would make my resume look strange to future employers. At (Company 1) I am being considered for a position that hovers around 55k, and only (from what I gather from the Talent Manager) not being considered for Account Manager positions because I do not have ""agency experience"" which I can gather from (Company 2) should I take the internship. I would think that if i'm being considered for a pretty substantial role at (Company 1), I would at the very least be able to be considered for a Junior role at other companies. 

Do I take this internship, gather in-field experience etc. and continue searching for a permanent gig in the new year (assuming it's a 3-6 month contract internship) ? I fear that if I take this position my resume will look like a mish-mash of work experience and titles that strays far away from the more traditional path of Intern&gt;Junior&gt;Mid&gt;Manager. If I was 21 I wouldn't even blink at the conundrum, but i'm 35 now and i'm worried that this may set me back somehow. Do I take it because it's ""something I can do in the meantime"" because fuck-all has been going for me otherwise? I'm worried about the ""optics"" of it all: here is a 35 year old, with 15+ years of experience, but not technically in Account Services, (Company 1) considers him worthy of a substantial, well paying role (55k is great for me), but now he's taking a minimum-wage paying internship? What do I do here?

I'm not entirely sure what that means, but I would imagine it would be something like ""What would you do if the input could not be stored on a single machine?"". I must say I am not hugely familiar with this type of stuff, and this makes me kind of nervous.

So my question is, if one is interviewing for an intern position, what is the sort of level that would be expected when asked questions about scalability? Is it acceptable to say something handwavy like ""well, if we split the data this way, we could then do this and combine the result while maintaining correctness etc."" without actually implementing any of it, or would they expect more detail?

Also, does anyone know any resources to prepare for questions about scalability? I know it's a big topic, but maybe there is a way to improve at least a bit in the approximately 2 weeks that I have."

I make a considerable amount more than they will pay and I have won't have my finances in order until February. I'm afraid of missing an opportunity because my gpa is only a 2.99 and I don't know how many opportunities I'll have.



The interviewer asked me a few questions about the computers I've built, trouble shooting I've had to do, and my previous work experience, but they seemed most interested in my working availability.

What would you all suggest? They said they'll let me know next week if they decide to go with me. It's pretty stressful to think about, the timing might not be right here.

TL:DR - had interview, might need to quit current job which pays considerably more and I won't be able to truly afford that until Feburary. afraid this may be only opportunity. what do?"

On my previous payslips with co-op (engineering internship) companies in AB, only my Federal Taxes show up in deductions.

I've done all my tax returns btw, all seemed fine.

But, can someone tell me what's the difference between AB and SK in terms of income tax that I do not know about? Either that or I've not been paying the right taxes all along (yikes).

I'm super fluent in English, Arabic and I speak a little bit of Russian. I know basic C++, MATLAB, and AutoCAD/Revit and HVAC(Mech mandatory class).


I am a frequent lurker in this sub and I am feeling bad everyday when I read threads like ""Landed my first internship!"" ""Applying for this internship""...etc.

I don't have many choices in my country as everybody here finishes 4-5 years of engineering in school then the university provides ""training"" for about 3 months and you're off on your own with your degree. 

I spent hours on Google trying to find internships that would suit my area of interest(heat transfer, turbines, strength of materials or machine design) and I'm not even sure if those things are keywords to search with.

I tried googling for example ""mechanical engineering internships in Netherlands"" and all I get is needing 1-2 years of experience, ""excellent"" coding skills (mostly matlab), 3.5+ GPA (the highest scoring GPA in my department is ~3.3) and things I am not very knowledgeable about or haven't taken yet in my university program.

I am panicking and I feel sick everyday browsing this sub while seeing people struggling to get jobs/internships with even 3.0+ GPA and I keep reading that the best options for 2.4+ GPA is mostly experience and activities.

I have never massively enjoyed the topic, but I felt it was a good path into a financially lucrative career, so I stuck with it.  I'm decent enough at it, but not top of the class - 3.3 GPA.

I did a couple of internships at private equity firms while I was at school in the summers before my junior and senior years and then was able to get a job at a small private equity firm after graduating.  I've been at that same firm for the past 6 years now.

To be completely honest, I've never truly enjoyed the job - partially due to struggling with depression, and due to a lack of self-confidence.  The first 4 years I did well enough, consistently got raises and bonuses, but didn't progress to the next level, and thus my confidence died.  The last 2 years I've really struggled to maintain motivation, which has had an impact on my success.

The firm is small and run in an unstructured manner.  For the entire time I've been here, I have not had one person I could call my ""boss"" or manager, I simply bounce between different higher-ups depending on project or deal.  I'm also never given any sort of timeline for when they want something done, I always have to ask.  I also never get feedback - unless I ask, but am usually given a vague response.  The consistent response is that I'm not ""passionate"" for the business, which is understandable as I'm a quiet guy and prefer to keep to myself for the most part.  I've only heard when certain people have had an issue when a 3rd party mentions it.

I enjoy some aspects of the job itself, such as market analysis and financial modeling, but don't enjoy the culture or the deal-making aspects of it at all.  The higher-up positions don't appeal to me at all...

I've wanted to get into something more in-line with my interests for a while, but struggle to find a realistic job that isn't a massive drop in income, at least in the long-term.  I've been fortunate enough that I have no car payments or even mortgage, so my expenses are mostly food, utilities, insurance, maintenance, etc. but would still need to change my lifestyle drastically if I made $50k rather than $130k...

My hobbies are all more hands-on, involving doing and creating things.  I ride motorcycles, hike, dabble in woodworking, and enjoy tinkering with electronics.  I'm not particularly skilled in woodworking or electronics, but still enjoy them.  I built a cart for my Big Green Egg that friends assumed I'd purchased, I built my dog an air-conditioned dog-house that is insulated and quite nice (she's spoiled), and generally have no issues solving problems when doing work like that.

Woodworking seems like a very difficult field to earn a decent living in until you've got years of experience...  I've known master woodworkers that have side-jobs because the woodworking isn't enough to pay the bills - guys who do work I marvel at, and in some cases are paid $10k+ for pieces, but they take far too long to build and such sales are few and far between.

I've considered starting some sort of business in home audio design &amp; installation, as that sort of combines the hands-on work that I enjoy with woodworking with the electronics tinkering.  I'm just not confident that I have the ability to compete in that field without years of experience.  I know how to run a business from the financial and market-analysis standpoint, but I am not a strong salesperson or manager.

I've also considered the fact that maybe I just don't mesh at this particular firm and could do well in the financial analyst type role in another firm with a bit more structure.  I just don't know how much of my lack of happiness here is my fitness for the job, how much is the company itself, and how much is just perspective...  

Perhaps a finance role in a company that does something I find respectable would be more enjoyable, as part of the reason I lack passion for this business is that I have significant issues with structural and cultural aspects of the industry.

I'm really mostly just struggling with determining what is a realistic career for me, given my background and interests.  I'd love to run my own home audio business, but doubt that's realistic given my skill set and experience.

Does anyone have feedback as to whether or not it's feasible to run a business without having spent years working within the industry first?  Would there be a system designer type job that would serve as experience without having to start as an installer ($11-12/hr...)?  Is there anyone else who's made a similar transition?"

I will be starting at Facebook in an undefined general SWE role - but I have been doing iOS for every internship prior to this. I still like working on iOS but I'm not sure whether or not it's going to be sustainable going into the future.

What technologies would you recommend looking at and would you consider a tradeoff in productivity learning a new stack worth the value of becoming temporarily more proficient in it?

It seems like a constant dance of getting to a point where you can work fast in a certain language, then needing to jump on the next big thing. I suppose over time, your overall foundation gets stronger."

I'm a 3rd year CS major and I've kind of been regretting choosing CS mostly because I don't enjoy coding, and don't really find the classes I've taken to be interesting, including the upper-level thread classes. The first 2 years I just told myself that I didn't know enough and would grow to like it once I learned more. I feel pretty crap saying this to Tech students, but I've never really been into STEM in general. I just talked myself into coming here and doing CS because of the future job prospects. I thought that would be enough motivation, but after making decent money at a software engineering internship, I learned that money isn't a good enough incentive. I've always been apathetic towards CS, but worked hard anyway to maintain a decent GPA. I had a ""fake it till you make it"" mentality. This semester though, I haven't been motivated at all, and my grades have suffered a huge amount to the point that I may have to drop a class to avoid failing. I don't feel bad about it though. Dramatic as it is to say, I've kind of shut down.

I've looked at the Public Policy, Psychology, and Economics major coursework and find them really interesting. I want to change majors, but it's far too late to change now, since my Zell hours will run out. I guess I just feel trapped and pessimistic about the future. I can't see myself doing software engineering or IT work. I've had a taste of both, and don't really find them interesting. 

Has anyone else been in this situation? Sorry for all the complaining and moping, I've just been feeling increasingly lost and hopeless."

I recently took a coding challenge as the first step towards a potential cs internship.

I got 2 of the 3 questions right and I'm happy with my algorithms for those two.

One of them I failed.  My algorithm was ok but I (stupidly) chose a language where reading the input format was complicated.  I ended up running out of time debugging the part of the code that simply reads in the input.  Sigh.

I have a few questions:

1) does any human ever read the code you write in one of these online challenges? I imagine it varies company to company, so a general sense of how often would be helpful.

2) am I screwed since I got one wrong?

3) is the speed of your algorithm important? Or should i just focus on passing the test cases

4) the test cases in this challenge were easy, and there could conceivably be more tests that are not shown while I edit.  Do many companies do that?

Apologies if someone has already asked these.  Also feel free to comment if I'm not being clear enough.  Thank you!

I'm a sophomore in college, and I've been involved with CS for 2 years now. Recently, I applied for the Google Engineering Practicum internship, the Airbnb software internship, and a GoDaddy software internship.

I got rejected from all 3. I'm not too disappointed because I was expecting this. However, I was also expecting to get some feedback so I could improve my résumé. I didn't get any feedback from Google and Airbnb. I messed up a question on the GoDaddy hackerrank question, so nevermind that.

I was wondering if it would be possible for some of you to give me some feedback on my resume.

Apart from that, I have a few questions:
1. Does a LinkedIn matter if I'm gonna upload my resume anyway?
2. Does it matter where I'm studying? I'm in a place that isn't really known for Computer Science.

59kahg,2,2016-10-26,Need some advice from those who made a transition with no CS knowledge or experience,non_solum_sed_etiam,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/59kahg/need_some_advice_from_those_who_made_a_transition/,"I just graduated this past May with a BA in Liberal Arts and a BS in Biology. I'm currently employed as a research assistant at the school that I thought I wanted to attend for a PhD, but lately that has not appealed to me. 

I started out college with the intent of going to dental school. I did a summer internship after my sophomore year with my dentist, and while it was interesting it didn't captivate me. Fast forward to the end of my Junior year and I had begun my undergraduate thesis project. This project involved implementing molecular docking in designing (or at least attempting to design) novel drugs. My thesis exposed me to bioinformatics in biomedical research and some of the basics of Python (occasionally had to use the Python shell). I was very interested in what I was doing and decided that I would pursue research. However, without any bench experience I have had to take a year off to get some experience in a molecular biology lab. This may be good thing, though, as I am doubting my decision. To make a long story short, I don't think the stress of being researcher, combined with low-moderate pay (PhD coworker complains) is worth it for a career that my heart isn't truly in. I find biomedical research fascinating, but I don't enjoy the stress that accompanies working with cells, animals, and the like. I enjoyed designing my own experiment as I did with my thesis, but to do that in research you have to become a PI, and becoming a PI equates to never ending grant writing and stress.

To the point. Obviously, I am woefully unprepared to enter CS. I have been working on a few edX classes for an introduction to programming since that is the small extent of what I have been exposed to. It's been somewhat daunting; there are countless options for careers in CS. I'm interested in programming and software development, but I'm not sure if there is something else I would enjoy more. Career options in CS is something I am currently exploring.

The way I see it I have four options:

1. Go back to school (undergrad) and take introductory CS classes. I have a semester of scholarships remaining by some fluke, so there is a chance it would cost little to nothing.

2. Go back to school (masters). I have heard that some masters programs offer conditional admission where prerequisites can be taken before being officially accepted. I don't know how feasible this is for me since I still have little to no experience to show an admissions committee. I have a good GPA (3.8-3.9) and could get a great letter from my thesis advisor, but would that truly be enough? I live in San Antonio, so I could apply to the MSCS at UT Austin, but I hear that's very competitive. Perhaps the program at UTSA would be a better fit.

3. Get a certificate in computer science. I haven't looked much into this option, so if this has been useful to anyone it'd be great to hear from you.

4. Get some sort of entry level CS job (maybe mix and match 1&amp;4 or 3&amp;4). I have doubts about this option just like I do about applying for masters programs. What kind of job could I realistically get? Are there internships for post-grads?

I've read a lot of posts in this subreddit and others, but I'm finding it hard to make a choice. I'm in an awkward position where my PI thinks I am going to be applying to the grad program and potentially rotating in her lab next year. I want to figure this out, so if any of you have had to make similar decisions or have alternatives I haven't thought of I would love to hear from you. Thanks in advance."

USA, my cap is probably around $1400 or $1500

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
I haven't been thinking of a 2 in 1 but I'm open to the idea. Good battery is nice but I'm not seeking the BEST.

* **How important is weight to you?**
My current laptop is 4.77 pounds which has been fine for me. Wouldn't want a laptop too much over that.

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac.**
Would LOVE to dual boot Windows and Mac. This is the main thing I'm looking for in this laptop honestly. I know this is easy with Macs but I'm not sure how easy it is to do on a PC, let me know if it would be too difficult. :/

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
Current laptop is 14 inches which is nice. Would prefer something around that size but I'm open to other sizes.

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. If you have no requirements, put N/A.** 
I code which sometimes just means running text editors but sometimes it's bigger programs like Eclipse or MATLAB (or I'll have multiple programs/tabs open at once).
In my spare time I like using Adobe products and other smaller programs for photo editing. On my current computer Illustrator can get kind of laggy.
I play Steam games casually (more below).

* **If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 
Most of my games aren't too intense (The Binding of Isaac, FTL, Jackbox have been my most recent ones) so I don't need the BEST, but it is definitely important to me that I can play the games that I do play. I do have some heavier games (I used to play Dark Souls) but I'm fine not optimizing on that.

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable business grade build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
I'll die without at least 8GB of RAM (current computer has 4GB and it's terrible). Don't need a touch screen or fingerprint reader. Would prefer to have an optical drive just to have it, though honestly I've probably used my drive like 3 times ever haha.

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**
I'm a computer science college student about to graduate, would wait to buy a laptop until I graduate but my current computer screen doesn't work half the time..
I've used Windows all my life but I used OS X at a summer internship and loved it, so I'm hoping to dual boot. I've read this is easy with a Mac, but maybe it isn't as easy with a PC??? I've heard a bit about ""Hackintosh"" but that they won't always work well. If I had to choose one, I guess I would choose Windows but I'd be a little sad lol.
I'm also looking for a long term laptop that'll serve me for a while after I graduate. :)
So basically the most important things to me are: dual booting (otherwise just Windows), fine for gaming, won't freeze up/slow down running big coding or art programs

59l8qd,3,2016-10-26,Degree in Computer Science which I hate. Burned out from Mechanical Engineering as a second major. Hate everything and absolutely stuck.,KumaOso,Career_Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career_Advice/comments/59l8qd/degree_in_computer_science_which_i_hate_burned/,"Warning: This may be a bit incoherent. I wrote this out as a stream of conscious.

For as long as I can remember, if you asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, I could never give you an answer. I picked computer science for my first degree because I liked the idea of being in game development but starting second year things did not seem right and wanted to switch to something. I never knew what to switch to and it got the point to just finish the damn thing instead of dropping out. I was offered by my dad to drop out, but I figured it wouldn't accomplish anything.

Come out of college I'm working at a run down theater that's no longer in business. I could not find jobs in anything computer science that I might be interested in because of the classic experience catch 22 and that all these computer science jobs were asking for proficiency in things no one ever told me about. I had no desire to learn those things either.

Yes, I tried getting internships while I was in school, but I never made it past interviews except once. The one time it did happen, the guy that had the job before came back so they gave it to him instead.

I went two years after school in a state of depression and anxiety. I saw therapists and counselors for help in my life direction, but every time I thought there was a lead, it just later gets shot down or I lost interest. My sessions ended up involving all my emotional issues with people. During this time period I wound up as assistant manager for the theater.

I decided to go back to school for engineering last fall because I thought my skillsets would go with it. Except I absolutely hate everything involving engineering, and my dad's been jonesing me to go into the field for God knows how long. Showed me the chemical plant he works at even and it did absolutely nothing for me. So, I'll be dropping out of the major in December, completely stranded.

What's making this whole difficult for me is I practically hate everything I see. My last job made me want to perform various violent acts to people or things. I can toss out sales or customer service as possible job avenues. None of the college majors at my last or current college do anything for me, and I don't even think school is the answer for me at this point.

Military is simply not an option as I don't meet the weight requirements. They didn't even bother asking me about my build so I could explain my weight. 

There's nothing I see that I like, and I don't find that my hobbies are really a lead. I've taken numerous career tests, MBTI, enneagram, etc. and they do next to nothing."

I am 24 years old and have worked in professional positions full-time for 7 years. I started my Associate degree full-time my junior year of high school while working in administrative and telemarketing, then worked for a couple years as an IT Intern and Business Systems Analyst, then for almost four years at my last full-time job working as an IT Data Analyst I-III working with databases.
 
&amp;nbsp;    
Details on Conviction: I have a felony conviction on my record for heroin delivery; I got in with the wrong crowd when I was 19 and committed the crime. Charges were filed by the state almost a year later and I was convicted in March 2012. Since the crime took place I have successfully completed a Mental Health &amp; Substance Abuse treatment program and have not had any issues since.
 
&amp;nbsp;    
Where I'm at: I loved my last job but they ended up laying off our department mid-2015 due to some internal and infrastructure changes. I worked there for almost four years and when I was laid off it was the first time I've ever had to look for work with a criminal background. Since I was laid off I've been doing some freelancing, but not enough to support myself on. I also nannied for my sister for nine months after my nephew (2) started having complications from Lyme disease. I normally never have an issue finding a position, but I feel like I have to change my approach after having numerous successfull interviews and then having my offer pulled due to background check results. I'm just so frustrated! I've tried looking online for companies hiring felons but they are all retail, warehouse, and fast food type work. I don't want to have to settle working in some gas station or subway when I know I'm good at what I do and enjoy it. I know I'll have to adjust my life now that I have a conviction, but I feel like there must be a position out there for me somewhere with employers that are willing to look past it.
 
&amp;nbsp;    
Has anybody else had experience with Minnesota or Telecommute jobs (from hiring or searching side) with a conviction or felony to consider? Are there any employers who are known to be more flexible with drug-related crimes? Any help or advice will be appreciated. I just don't know where else to turn to and I feel like all I'm doing these days is climbing uphill. Thanks!

I'm a Computer Engineering student and I have received two internship offers. One is with GoDaddy for software engineering and one is with GE Healthcare for their DTLP internship program. I really like both but the GE Digital Technology Leadership Program sounds very interesting and piques my curiosity a bit more; it seems very useful to have some real-world management and leadership experience to round out my skill set.

What I want to know is what people's opinions are on working for GE in terms of what it's like working for the company, the things interns learn, etc... If someone currently works for GE Healthcare, could they chime in?

And also, what is it like as a DTLP intern as opposed to a full time DTLP position (Do you still learn those core leadership and management skills or is it significantly watered down due to the shorter time period?) for those who have gone or currently going through the program?

GoDaddy seems to be a good place to work and the internship would match my current skill set a bit better than the GE one but, obviously, I may not gain as much leadership experience there as I would with the DTLP internship depending on how the intern version is structured.

GoDaddy's offer is a fair bit higher than GE's; GE's offered compensation is approximately $4800/month + a small housing stipend whereas GoDaddy is offering approximately $1500/week with housing included, just for comparison.

I would appreciate any thoughts that you guys might have on this and would be really happy if someone who has or is currently working for GE can chime in. Thanks!"

I'm stuck in a bit of a predicament, and would appreciate some advice from fellow engineering students. 

For background, I'm a freshman pre-major for Aero/Astro Engineering at Ohio State. I am currently struggling in my chemistry and calculus courses, to the point where even a C in each course is border line attainable at this point. I literally didn't study at all in high school, so I messed up the first couple weeks and am constantly playing catchup. I've been working on my study strategies, and getting some help. 

However, by a stroke of luck, I got an offer yesterday for an engineering internship. I don't want to reveal who it is, but it is a fortune 500 company. The company however, stipulates that I must maintain a 3.0 GPA, and if my GPA dips below a 3.0 at any point, the offer will be retracted immediately. 

I do not have high hopes of making a 3.0 GPA this semester, so I'm somewhat lost on what to do next. The last day to drop a class is tomorrow (10/28), so I need to make a decision quick. I'm not taking enough credit hours to average out a C in both classes. Chem and Calc are 9 credit hours combined, and I'm taking 15 total. 

I'm thinking I need to drop at least one, if not both Chemistry and Math. I probably need to retake both these courses anyway to be honest. 

But I am a freshman, so I don't really know what I'm doing. If anyone sees any alternatives, I'd be grateful. 

Thanks!

The thing is that I suck in school and I only concentrated of stuff that inspired me. Like .. I have built my own 3D engine using OpenGL by myself without any class about it because I wanted to but I have failed a microsoft access class twice because I find it useless when u should be using SQL. So, I don't even have done university yet I know that I could do the job of a software engineer. I know calculus and I am a beast of everything that touches IT but only when I feel it. So, I had found an internship and I had to pass a Codility test online (programming online) to test your code complexity and speed e.t.c. There were about 30 peoples and I finished third. Most of them had done UNI or had master degrees. The thing is that, I wanna do something that I love and that I will feel useful. My current grade arent enough probably to ever get me near a master degree but IMO, the career of engineer is not something that can be taught, you need to be born with it. Creativity, wanting to create, to optimize and just having a proper attitude. Half of the engineer will just apply stuff while a real engineer will create stuff. The job I applied to was a game programming job and I was not taken because i'm sure that my big O notation was not perfect (they could not tols you what mistakes you made). Now, my life is going in ruin honestly.

I am currently 21 years old with the potential inside me to change the world of gaming. I am not even joking, all my friends told me that I have one day to make my dream game come true.

I have pathetic grades at school and won't be able to attend UNI because I hate school and because of my grades.

I have a really weird personality but one of the best attitude ever. I have never been angry a single time in my life and I am never stressed.

I live at my parents house and I feel like trash still being there while my little sister 3 years younger will probably attend university before me which will destroy me inside because I will feel like the family worst  member.

Since I want to work in video games or thing I love, I dont want to work for the companies in my home town since all they do is entreprise software and debuging website and that doesn't interrest me much.


Those days, I keep lying to my parents that my internship is going well because I feel like if I tell the truth they will reject me completly.


I am starting to get even more depressed each day to the point where alchool is getting nearly a solution and that I always go to sleep thinking what puting a bullet in my head would do.



What should I do ? I'm tired of this bullshit life where I am useless... I know I can become great but I never will get choosen cause society priorize grades over actual working capacity. 

I have postulated to work as a software engineer for Reddit itself since this website lately became like my second home and It's important for me. I will probably get rejeted cause they ask for 5 years of experience while I have none. 

I have my unity project (my dream itself) but it is so big that my parents wont let me work on it as my job and because kickstarter doesn't seem to be working since too many people made dying projects and now no one trust kickstarter. 

I am desesperate. Everyday is getting rougher to go throught and I know I won't last forever holding all of this."

I am the only C# developer on staff, and the entire codebase is written in Delphi on a windows XP virtual machine. The current ""version control"" being used is SourceSafe. The majority of the applications are data importers and exporters, and we use INI files as config files to express the desired file paths and delimiters and what not.

Well I am helping bring us into the present. I am porting some of our delphi apps into C#, a coworker recently implemented a local Gitlab server for true version control.

In my C# app, I decided to use a JSON file for the config rather than the Ini, because of its ease in object mapping. 

Well my boss caught wind and said that it would confuse everyone if we were using both jsons and ini files. So i expressed that for what we are doing, visually they are very similar. A SQL dev can easily look at a json file and interpret the way that the pairs match up, similar to in an Ini file. He said, that if i am truly passionate about it, then I need to create a presentation highlighting the benefits of Json files, and that they would decide after that.

So now I am asking for your assistance. I have googled and there does not appear to be many direct comparisons between Ini files and Json files. 

Obviously the object mapping capabilities alone are huge for me. Add the fact that microsoft has made an effort to move away from Ini files by not adding direct support in .Net (even though there are libraries that do help with them). Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

I am a freshman Computer Science student. I recently applied for a number of internships, and have yet to hear back from the majority of them. So far, I have had one phone interview in which they said they would get back to me within two weeks (a week ago), and an on-site interview yesterday. The company from yesterday called me today to tell me that they wanted to ""lock me down"" and so they will be sending me an offering by the end of the week or early next week.

The company who is already prepared to hire me wants to offer me $25/hour, but this will have to cover housing. I can probably find a nearby apartment for about $1000/month, and my parents said that they would be willing to help my put up first month / last month / security deposit.

This company wants me to commit within the next two weeks or so, but I have yet to hear back from so many companies. My dream would be to work at a bigger company focused on tech, but this company is a non-for-profit government contractor.

As a freshman, should I just be happy I was offered this opportunity and take it, or wait it out and see what other offers unfold?

Thanks."

what are my most viable options? i feel like because i have no experience it's hard to find things at this time of year because companies will have to train me for a while, while at the same time they know i'll leave in a few months. is there any demand for easy freelance / contract work without requiring much experience? where do i find it (maybe startups or something)? could i just apply for full-time positions without telling them that i'm going to leave in a few months, and pretend that i'll be working permanently instead, even though i know that this is really unprofessional?

money isn't that much of an issue

some background:

- undergrad (first class) and masters degree in mathematics from a leading university

- entirely self taught coder

- 99.4th percentile contest rating on hackerrank, top 10 in the uk (kind of irrelevant since hackerrank doesn't seem to be used much by brits), also did coding competitions at secondary school

- languages: mainly python, currently self-teaching some web development

- a few personal projects on github, nothing particularly standing out though

- zero work experience. i messed up all my internship interviews at uni"

I'm currently a sophomore at an alright state university, (Ranked 32 Engineering, No Published ranking for CS) and I'm heavily contemplating switching to CS. 

My first internship was at a research lab and ever since I've known I wanted to get my masters in CS. The program there is excellent and will pay you 50 -75% of your salary and 100% of the tuition + benefits, etc. And they prefer you go to their Director associated schools (Stanford, MIT, Georgia Tech,  top 20 CS programs). 




In light of this I'm contemplating between two choices: 

Completing my CompE degree and shoving all my tech electives towards CS, OR switching to CS and having to play a little bit of catch up (two classes maybe) and lose all the ECE classes so-far.




Some of my concerns are the following:

Would a top-tier graduate school look at my CompE degree less than a CS? (In graduate school I wish to focus on AI, ML) Would my breadth of knowledge from the CompE degree even be useful? With my Current CompE plan I may be able to squeeze out a Graduate Certificate in Software Engineering, not sure how much that would sway the decision."

I haven't yet decided my focus but I'm leaning towards information extraction or maybe speech technology.  My program requires either an internship or a thesis project at the end to graduate but I would much rather do an internship as I have a thesis from a previous master's already.  The way it works is the program usually sets you up with an internship advisor in January, you write a report stating what your plan is going forward and then you periodically check in until assumedly you have a job/internship.  I was talking to a friend the other day and he stated he already received an offer for a summer internship.  I expressed surprise but he said that interns normally apply in the fall.  I didn't know this and now I fear it may be too late to apply to anything.  

I am going to try and get a hussle on my resume but I'm afraid that the companies may contact me too early for an interview.  My fear is that if I apply now, they will ask for an interview in a week or two and i will be totally unready.  So far I've only taken one strictly NLP class, focusing mostly on statistical or rule based methods and nothing in machine learning yet.  I also am just now taking DS &amp; A and was hoping to take a class in OOP in the spring.    I was thinking of quitting my non-programming job (I have some savings to hold me over) to focus all my time on studies/job preparation and was going to use part of winter break to practice leetcode/hackerrank/CTCI stuff.

So I guess my question is how soon would a company contact me back after applying?  I have friends who work at several large tech companies and I was hoping to pass my resume along to them but I've heard resumes may get processed faster that way and I'm not entirely sure if that's what I want.  Would it be better to hold off to apply in the spring when I'll be more ready for an interview?

In terms of enjoyment, the best job would probably be working in the IT department of  a summer camp style location that I worked at last year (it's very large with over 1,000 seasonal staff and over 7,000 participants at any time). However I'm worried that because it's a less standard IT job future employers won't value it as much as working at a place such as an insurance, manufacturing, or financial company. Also this job probably won't give me future connections to a full time job after graduation.

Am I worrying about this too much?  I already have interviews set up with a business communications company and a shipping company.

Sorry for the long post, I appreciate any input."

Had decent advances in career and generally kind of ok with where I am.

But a lot of the time I feel like I'd be having more fun in development.

Generally my work is 90% coding, since I despise manual and static data approach and usually set up ""self sustained"" environments that do most of the work for me. And realistically I think my core Java skills are pretty good and comparable to a mid-senior dev.

But here are the problems I see with switching:

1. Every time you look into job descriptions it's more about libs and frameworks than the language itself. And since tests usually don't need that depth, I only have experience with few of them (and even then, limited)

2. My position will probably degrade from senior to junior-mid, with corresponding salary hit and it's discouraging as balls.

Did any of you have a similar situation? How did you deal with lack of knowledge? (I mean I understand that you need to learn, but it's difficult to pinpoint what I actually need for ""developer package"") Were you destroyed on the interviews?

I'd appreciate any input. Thank you."
59wqxw,1,2016-10-28,Should a take a more prestigious or one with a better full-time conversion chance?,kickoffspinoff,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/59wqxw/should_a_take_a_more_prestigious_or_one_with_a/,"Hi, I'm trying to decide between two internships in order to figure out which one would overall be better for my career.

My first option is to intern with Microsoft. They're a pretty big company and carry a fair amount of weight on a resume. Unfortunately, the team that I'd be on seems to be more low-level focused (Windows kernel and such), which isn't a path that I think I want to be taking. The biggest draw to them, however, is that I hear it to be *extremely* easy for interns to convert to full-time. According to numerous links on Quora and such, all you have to do is be semi-competent at finishing your assigned project.

My other option is with Facebook. From what I've heard, they carry a *bit* more weight than Microsoft does in terms of prestige. They also pay more, and they seem to give incoming interns a large degree of freedom in deciding their project (so I could move away from low-level projects). The downside is, getting a full-time offer after your internship seems to be harder, whereas at Microsoft it seems to be almost a sure thing provided you just do your work.

So overall, both have their pros and cons - more pay and a higher chance to get a project I like are definite draws for Facebook, but a very high chance of full-time is a definite draw for Microsoft (compounded by the fact that I'm not terribly confident about interviewing in the first place). Does anyone have any personal experience that could help me make a decision? "
59x4f9,4,2016-10-28,Movie Night,Slaro1989,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/59x4f9/movie_night/,"This story happened to me a few years ago. It was a very stressful time because I was stuck with lame internships while not able to find a real paying job. I stayed in the house of my boss his mother. My room was just a bed with a bureau. Although more people lived in the house there were no shared rooms whatsoever. Every morning became increasingly more difficult to get out of bed. I did not see any friends, the work during my internship was a joke while no-one really cared, and I became more isolated and depressed each day.

My only distraction was going to the movies now and then. So I went this particular day. New James Bond Movie, almost Winter, sun had set and people were having fun. I got out of my bed for the first time that day. Unshaven and not even bothered to throw some water in my face I left the house. Wearing the same clothes I used the whole week. I did not think about it. I felt all humanity's grieve on my shoulders. It were the happy times of the year but for me everything was grey and somber. Loneliness and useless, knowing for sure that you can do it, but not getting the opportunity. The innocent victim of a society that doesn't really care.

The cinema I usually take is in a large mall but it was being renovated. I forgot and although frustrated I decided to just walk around for a while. The depressing thoughts crossing through my head made me forget about time and place. I just wandered through the streets looking for nothing, seeing happy people, feeling sorry for myself. It must have been an hour later when I realized that the streets suddenly had become silent. I could not hear the cars and was walking through a street without lights, bars, or restaurants. The only light came from a huge full moon high in the sky. I decided to walk back and turned the corner. There it was, in the middle of this dark street were the smashing lights of a cinema.

I never saw this theater before. It was a beautiful almost ancient looking building. When entering the lobby I was completely alone. A bit strange because James Bond was recently released with a few other blockbusters and people normally go to the movies this time of the year. On the other hand I also didn't really care and preferred to see my movies in silence. Though a smell of fresh made popcorn hang in the lobby no-one was there. From the food corner to the ticket boots. Plain empty. I walked around a bit but could not find anyone.

Just when I decided to walk out I heard foot steps behind me. Two boys, 16 or something, identical twins. Just looking at me. I didn't know what to do. They gave me the creeps. Something just didn't fit. Suddenly one of the boys grabbed a few papers out his pocket. Cinema tickets, he pointed them in my direction. Not sure what to do I walked towards them to ask where the staff of the cinema was. Or their parents. No answer. They just looked at me. The tickets in the boys hand looked unripped and brand new. I could not distinguish any name of a movie on it. Carefully I tried to get one of the tickets but the boy pulled his hand back. His brother suddenly pointed at my pocket where my wallet was. Of course, they were probably the kids of the owner who was at the toilet or something. I took 10 Euro's out of my wallet. The boy with the tickets handed one over to me while the other smoothly grabbed the money out of my hand.

I just realized that in all the confusion I didn't even know what kind of ticket I had just bought. What movie I was going to see. What time. I looked on my ticket but there was nothing on it. Just some bar-code and a few cinematic looking symbols. I felt conned. I didn't notice that while gazing at the ticket the boys had disappeared. Again I looked everywhere but no-one to be found. Completely frustrated with the situation I made the decision to just enter one of the halls to see if there was a movie running and to make something out of this mess. There was one hall. I opened the door and entered. Again, no-one to be found, no movie running. This was not my night. Time to go home and just sleep. Tomorrow might be better. Or not. I simply didn't care.

However, when trying to leave the hall the door did not open. It was locked. I pushed and pushed, even screamed, but to no avail. It wouldn't open. I ran around looking for an emergency exit but there was nothing. I started to become a bit panicky thinking someone locked me up in there because I entered without a proper ticket. Or some sick maniac in a fake cinema. I calmed down when suddenly the lights in the hall dimmed and the projector started running. Still not sure what was happening I sat down in one of the seats.

And then it happened. The moment that I did not just think to be in big trouble but to know it for sure. Right when the movie started. No commercials, no trailers, no credits. Just the two boys that sold me the tickets on the big wide screen, standing in the same cinema lobby, looking directly in the camera, at me. The only thing different were their smiles. Not in a normal way but it felt evil. Their mouths way to big for their face, just as their dazzling white teeth, it seemed completely surrealistic. I was paralyzed. What the f*** was happening here. Simultaneously they pulled up their arm and pointed straight towards the camera. To me. I knew it for sure. I felt their eyes everywhere. I completely panicked and was finally able to run towards the door. It was still locked. I screamed, I pushed, I rammed with my fists on the door but it didn't even move. The projector was still zooming but suddenly I heard something different in the darkness. Not sure what it was I turned around and there they were. The two boys in front of the screen. In the hall itself just a few meters away from me. Laughing without a sound and still pointing to me. They started walking.

I smashed my shoulder against the door with tears in my eyes, screaming for help. I don't know how but when the boys were just a few rows away from me the door finally gave in. I rolled in the lobby. Still no-one around but I couldn't care. Stood up, saw the boys coming, and ran straight out of the cinema. The street was dark but the huge Moon was still there. I could not miss it, not because it was so huge, but because it had turned red as blood. I ran through the streets looking over my shoulder to see the boys leaving the cinema. Their smiling faces solely enlightened by the red light of the Moon. It made their mouth and teeth even look bigger then before. They were running as well. I felt like being in a bad dream not able to wake up but it was real. I was sure of that. After running for at least 10 minutes I started to realize that the streets were almost pitch black. I was the only one there. The red light of the moon made everything look threatening. No bell felt safe to rang, no door felt safe to knock on, I had to flee that was the only thing I knew for sure with the sound of children's footsteps becoming louder and louder. 

Suddenly the sounds disappeared. It was like I was completely alone but it didn't feel as a relieve. I stopped running and calmed down a bit. My eyes became accustomed to the darkness. Looking at the houses I recognized my own street. There must have been a blackout or something. But I was still not 100% certain I was not being followed and I turned around. It was if my my blood turned cold. At the end of the street in the darkness I saw a shadow of a little boy. Only one. Although I could not see his face I just felt his eyes above that creepy laugh on me. But where was the other one. The footsteps started again and the shadow came closer. I turned around to run away and there I saw the other one. On the other end of the street, also running directly towards me.

I threw myself against my own house and grabbed in my pockets for the keys. Just in time. I opened the door and stormed in. I immediately locked the door behind me. I heard the footsteps of the boys at the other end of the door. Then it stopped. What where they doing. I waited in the hallway just gazing at the door seeing their shadows becoming bigger and bigger through the glass. The red light of the Moon making everything look aggressive. Nothing happened. They just stood there. No movement. It took me a moment but I ran towards my room and again locked the door. My laptop was still on my bed but the screen was off. I tried to turn it on but out of power. I walked towards the window and opened the curtains to look down. The street was empty, no-one there. It didn't relax me. I could feel their eyes. Almost see their creepy smiles. 

What was that cracking sound. The stairs. I ran towards the door of my bedroom but it was still locked. The sound however was unmistakably people walking on the stairs. How did they enter. How was it possible. I did not hear them open the door. No forced entry. There was no escape. The footsteps came closer to my door and stopped.

For a few seconds everything was quiet. I was just sitting on my bed staring to the door. This was it. No escape, no-one to ask for help, this was how it would end. The sound of silence became unbearable, just knowing that they were there, not a single doubt. The first knock completely blew me off my socks. It was like a thunderstorm happening next to you head. The second and the third knock were like cannons in a battlefield. The dozens of knocks afterwards seemed to come from a whole army of people standing in front of my bed room. And not just knocking, but scratching, the sound of countless footsteps running and walking throughout the house, over the street, everywhere.

The moments after that are a bit foggy. I just remember the creepy red light of the Moon shining in my room and the sounds against the door. I hid under my blanket and must have fainted. I vaguely remember hearing the door open but I am not sure. When I woke up everything was quiet but the day light gave me an euphoric feeling. I walked towards the window. It must have been morning but the first cyclists and cars were already finding their way through my street. I ran towards my computer to plug it in but it was already on. Just how I left it before going to the cinema. I was flabbergasted, amazed. I found some extra courage and opened the door, no-one to be found. The only movement I heard were my room mates waking up and making their breakfast. All my depressed feelings were away. This was not the end, but a new beginning.

Disappointments will always be there but I found my way. Even a job. It was a horrible night but it gave me a purpose as well. Something I am strangely grateful for. The road to happiness can be tricky but it is important that you don't lose yourself. The cinema I never found again. I went looking for it but could not remember the street. Some people might say it was all a bad dream. A fantasy. I never told anyone about it but I knew it was real, just as my self respect, just as my true potential. All very and unquestionably real. 

And if I ever doubt myself I just have to look at the almost empty cinema ticket I found that morning in my trousers. It was certainly a movie night to remember."

We're looking into adding functionality to our newest product that would allow the user to control the humidifier from anywhere with an app. What would be the best way to do this? We currently have an ESP8266 on the Humidifier that allows it to connect to the internet. We are thinking that mutually accessing an SQL server may be the best option.

There are lots of services like Thingspeak that allow users to control IoT devices, but we want there to be as little set-up as possible for the customer, and Thingspeak requires quite a bit of setup for each device. We would also like to minimize the back-end work we have to do, as none of us have extensive experience with databases.

We aren't interested in doing any kind of analytics on customer data, so if we have no access to customer information, that is acceptable.

Ideally this is how each device would work:
1. Turn on humidifier, and select your local wifi network on the touch screen.
2. Download the app and enter the serial number of the humidifier (possibly other credentials to ensure security)
3. Control 3-4 device settings from anywhere with the app"

I am now a junior at the university and am only enrolled in a more advanced C++ class and a basic UNIX class while i finish up the rest of the unrelated degree requirements I have to take. So the problem I am now faced with is: How can I quickly get up to speed with everyone else? It seems to me that everyone else who is at my level of advancement in the degree (only three semesters left, YIKES) are already taking internships, working on open source projects, etc. I don't think I am anywhere near the level of where I can be working on open source stuff, and don't think any companies would be interested in hiring an intern with nothing but a modest knowledge of C++. This concerns me because by the time I feel that I'll be able to participate in these resumé building activities, it will be time to look for a job/grad school!

I learned Python (procedural, struggling with OOP a bit), MATLAB and R at University. I have a slight bit of knowledge in JS and SQL too. 


My question is, what language can I learn to help build a portfolio? I believe C++ is most widely used for AI and ML but i've been advised Java is easier and I can look to mobile apps. Where can I find ideas to code small webapps or mobile apps?

Bachelor's thesis was about machine learning. 
After graduating I am going to try to get a full-time job abroad. This year I applied to many companies for summer internships but most of them rejected me by CV. The most disappointing reject is reject by a big4 company because I applied through referral and all my friends with the same referral were invited to interview. 
Currently I work as Quantitative Researcher at a small fund and particularly I develop machine learning methods, previously I worked as freelance Data Scientist and Software Developer in a digital agency. Also I participate in Kaggle. The job I want to get  abroad is one of the following: Machine Learning Developer / Software Developer/ Data Scientist, it's all ok for me. 
The first question I would like to ask: is working as Quant Researcher considered by many companies  (big4 and unicorns like Airbnb) as bad work experience and should I change my work to something more connected with developing software? I want to maximize my chances to get a job in a 1.5 year or at least the number of interviews to be invited (passing the interviews is a separate question, I solve LeetCode problems not bad imho)
The second question is: is getting a Software Developer full-time job easier than Data Scientist because the interview questions are pretty standard and the number of open positions is much higher ?

I really like the work I've been doing and responsibilities I've been given, and would like to go back to graduate school to get a Masters in the robotics field at some point. I have a few qualms that I have hoping you guys could help me answer:

1. My undergrad GPA wasn't stellar(3.15, but at a Top 20 school). I plan to get work experience for the near future, and apply no later than the fall of 2018. Would ~3 years of relevant work experience(counting 2 internships I had in undergrad) put less weight towards my gpa? 

2. Since I've left school, there is really no one I know in academia that would write me letters of recommendation. Was never too close to professors, although a couple I'm sure would remember me. However, I definitely could get good letters from managers/bosses at the companies I've worked at. Does it make a big difference where the letters would come from?

3. Outside of work, I do work on some personal projects to gain a better understanding of CS concepts and languages. However, I live in CA close to many research universities. Would it be possible/make sense to get involved with some of the research/projects there? Or would my time be better spent working on projects/making connections at local TechLab? I do like working on cool stuff, but I would also want to make progress to getting ready for grad school.

4. I plan on applying to CE,CS, or Systems Engineering programs. Georgia Tech's OMSCS looks really appealing to me if I choose the CS route, and is definitely at the top of my list right now. I would also be in favor of going to my local school(same as undergrad), but don't think I would be able to make the admissions requirements

I would appreciate any advice you guys could give me, as I do want to make sure I am on the right track. Thanks!"

Asian &amp; 22 years old. Bilingual in English^1stlanguage and Korean^2ndlanguage


GPA - 3.39; Honors. I messed up freshman year but eventually figured out how the system worked and averaged ~3.6 after Freshman year.


I have yet to look for a job or go do interviews; I wanted some advice/guidance about how I should proceed.
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I took a break for the past 6 months to figure out what I wanted to do. I'm currently living in a city in the SEC with roughly ~200K people with my parents. I've been working at my parent's mum &amp;pop's shop, reading books about life/business(roughly 20 books), doing things I enjoy, but I've become bored.

I've decided I want to move to a larger city and start off by getting a job. I’m looking at places such as: **Chicago**, **New York**, **California**,  **Atlanta**; in that order. I'm open to other cities.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Concerns are my experience and references.


Experience

            
* Instead of doing a business internship Junior Year, I opted to do a leadership internship at a missionary in Mexico. I was feeling lost/trapped at the time and basically said f*** the system. I got on a flight and paid for living expenses to teach kids English and work physically-demanding labor. Very rewarding and eye-opening experience. (Led a team of five and to teach English and build bathrooms for the locals).


* Started an LLC with a friend Junior Year that's done about $15,000 in revenue this quarter selling decals. I contributed the idea and handled: allocation of funds, profit margins, supplier, and design of product.


* I don't have any bank internship/work experience other than working at my parent's store.


I took upper Advanced Investing course and a Derivatives class for my ""specialization. On the plus side: I am an unwritten book/fresh, clean mind. 

Didn't get A's cause the teachers wouldn't let anyone that wasn't in class a certain amount of days an A.

* Grade (B+)  Investing Class: Taught ""Quantitative Value"" by Wesley Gray, and a bunch of finance research papers.


* Grade (B)  Derivatives Class: Taught ""Introduction to Derivatives and Risk""


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reference

* Parents are immigrants that came to American 25 years ago. They own a small store in a rougher neighborhood. I don't connections to the finance world.

* Other than maybe a few professors I can ask, I pretty much don't have anybody. I didn't really know them too well personally and I haven't kept in contact with them either.... but I definitely want to ask my professor that helped with the book for a recommendation/reference. How should I proceed?


* I also was thinking the leading supervisor at the missionary. He'd write me an excellent recommendation/reference. Super smart guy graduated top of his Engineering class and left it all to be a pastor/missionary.

**What's the best route i can take? What kind of jobs/internship could I get? Could I even get a job with this resume? OR would i have to go do an internship?**



I'm interested in something involved with a ""culture"" company or investing/analyst. Maybe pivot into something like marketing/finance for a ""culture"" company, i dont know. When I say ""culture"", I mean something with a more Google-eque work environment, company culture, etc. 
I think analyst type jobs would be more of a 2nd option for me.

I know the job spectrum is broad for finance majors so I'd love to hear any other recommendations.

59yxhx,5,2016-10-29,"Fuck Razer, and their abysmal tech support.",madergaser,pcmasterrace,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/59yxhx/fuck_razer_and_their_abysmal_tech_support/,"Alright, so I guess this is more of rant than anything, along with somewhat of a survey to see who has had similar experiences with Razer support.

TLDR: Razer took a month to repair my blade stealth, and didn't even do it correctly. No updates were given, unless I asked for them. Please, for the love of yourself and all things holy, don't buy a Razer product. 

I thought comcast was shitty screwing up my schedule by having the technician arrive 4 hours late, oh how was I wrong. 

With all the hype surrounding it, I bought my Razer blade stealth at launch this March. It was ostensibly an amazing laptop - a macbook quality laptop for $999 (don't hate me for praising apple for what they do really well please). All the reviewers, from Linus to Dave Lee, raved about the build quality, the pretty keyboard, and the decent performance. 

When my blade came, it made all kinds of weird sounds - the fan was rattling, the SSD made HDD sounds, and weird sounds came from the speakers when it was plugged in - so naturally I sent it in to razer for repair/replacement. This was easy, and I got a replacement with a different serial number 5 business days after I sent it in. The replacement sent to me had exactly the same problems, so I accepted that it was just an inherent flaw - no big deal. However, as I began to use the laptop more and more, especially during a lab internship during the summer where I typed almost daily, the laptop began to behave strangely - the keyboard would not work for hours on end, and after a few days, it would magically work again. The problem fully manifested itself when school started (the most optimal time possible!), and my keyboard, despite being able to light up, just stopped working entirely. 

I contact support, and they tell me to send it in again, this time for repair. I remind them that I have already sent a laptop in already, and a $999 investment is pretty significant, with the hope that they would do it correctly this time. They give me the reception confirmation on September 26th. THREE WEEKS PASS with complete silence from their part. Three weeks is a pretty long time for a student to live without a laptop. I call them up, asking for an update, and they tell me that the repair center is ""waiting for parts which should arrive soon"" for my repairs, giving me an ETA of October 20th for my laptop to be shipped. I wait for an email from them on the 20th. Nothing. 

They ship the laptop to me on October 26th, a whole month after I sent it in (I obviously sent it in days before they received the laptop).

Guess what? The keyboard isn't even fixed correctly after my long wait - the tab and right shift keys don't even light up. As seen [here](http://imgur.com/jUFfANJ)

I just find it funny how Razer, which makes such shitty products and has such shitty customer service, remains one of the top gaming hardware companies out there.

If you have a horrific story with Razer support, please share :)"

Mind you, I taught myself coding and had to do it all on my own. I just got into CE this summer. 

[After leaving a start-up](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/54o0hz/business_major_ceo_snapped_at_me_after_i_found_a/), I found another company with reputable ties that I would volunteer with. I currently have worked my way onto my own class of my own. Classes begin in three weeks. I design the curriculum, come up with projects, and collaborate with the students.  

Anyways, I just applied to a bunch of internships and I am a bit worried. if I even do get a interview, I'm a bit worried of looking like a fraud. As in, teaching is always looked down upon because it is not really like you're learning anything new...which a company may just not find interesting. I'm just not in the position to create new projects (just due to inexperience, not quite sure where to begin). But I love teaching code and it's definitely a rewarding experience. 

There's also a CS fair coming up and I feel like this one is going to be a bit easier than the internships I've been applying for as it's mostly smaller companies. So is teaching a good thing or a bad thing?"

I really enjoy the CS and CompE classes, but don't love the EE classes (circuits, physics etc.). Is CS better for me? I really enjoy programming and have done that in most of my internships. I also have an interview with Google coming up for next summer. I really enjoy my CompE classes (computer Architecture, digital circuits etc.), but I don't know what to pick. CS would allow me more electives, but CompE would give me a broader base in electronics. Any thoughts ?"

**Chapter 22: Exodus**


Tara turned to Derek and Cerion and smiled as brightly as she could after compelling the apartment doors to swish open, “We’re home!” She strode through the threshold and studied the apartment. Everything was exactly where she left it. Tara took off her shoes, neatly placed them in the retractable shoe rack, and deftly waved her hands in front of the sensor strips that traveled along the nearby walls. Instantly, the living room entertainment panel lit up and began throwing classical music into the apartment. 

Cerion stared around at the appliances, furniture, decorative vases and paintings that were strung along the walls, “Your living space is quite different than what I am used to, and I am very intrigued by the aesthetics.” She clicked her talons along the wooden flooring and inspected a water-colour painting of a pair of koi fish, perpetually encircling each other within a serene, blue pond. “These creatures are reminiscent of the delicious *sedch* that we commonly farm and consume across the Sovereignty.”

Tara chuckled, “We do eat fish, but not those ones in particular.” She tossed her backpack next to a couch, “Follow me. I’ll show you the guest room where you’ll be staying until Ambassador Evans can get you your own place.”

The door swished open as they approached the guest room. Tara swept her arm at the bed, “This is where you can sleep. I hope the mattress isn’t too hard for you. But if it is, you can adjust the stiffness by turning these dials right here.” She demonstrated briefly, turning some silver dials that were located on the nightstand beside the bed. A small whirring sound seeped into the room as the mattress relaxed its tension. 

“Marvelous!” Cerion cooed.

“I’ll let you get settled in. I’m going to go order some dinner.” Tara smiled again, and left Cerion to prod around the guest bedroom.

The smile fell off her face as soon as she entered the kitchen, weighted down by a heavy knot that sat at the bottom of her stomach. Her mind constantly returned to the volumes of data stored on her tablet. Hundreds of Onathin bioscans arrayed themselves in her head, all positive for the neural parasite, and sorted according to phenotype, morphology, and genetic strain. On the journey back to Earth from the *Forge* she also sorted the data by political affiliation. Most of the known Stalwart Claw supporters in her database were infected by the same strain of the neural parasite, the strain that arranged themselves into an insidious network inside the host Onathin’s brain. There was little doubt in her mind that these parasites were the ones in control of the Stalwart Claw political party, especially after Senator Crysin’s announcement of secession from the Onathin Sovereignty. *Things will get worse, the longer we wait. What can we do about it now, to buy ourselves more time?* 

Tara realized that she had been staring at a small metal parcel that was sitting innocently underneath the drone delivery port, next to the kitchen window. An angry biohazardous symbol was plastered across its shiny surface, underlined by lines describing the dangers of the contents within. A genuine smile slowly seeped across her lips as she wondered where her husband had teetered off to.

She scooped up the parcel and found Derek sitting on a couch in front of the entertainment unit, scrutinizing a fist-sized glob of blackened nanomaterial. A toolbox was spilled open at his feet, and Derek was currently probing the nanites with a screwdriver. Tara raised an eyebrow in amusement, *That’s an interesting tool choice.* The blackened nanites seemed to respond as Derek poked the screwdriver at some hidden interface within its mass. She plopped down next to him on the couch, rested her head on his broad shoulder and watched him work. 

A small portion of the nanites seemed to shimmer silver as he continued to prod the interface with the screwdriver. He paused and turned his head slowly to look at Tara’s face on his shoulder. “H-hi.” He offered.

“Hi, Derek.” She grinned and noticed confusion in his eyes, which quickly gave way to indifferent acceptance as Derek swiveled his head back to focus on his half-broken omni-tool. She reached over and gently grasped his chin and turned his head back to face her, “I have a surprise for you.” With her other hand, she revealed the metal parcel and brandished it in front of him.

His eyes traced the biohazardous symbol and immediately came alight with shock, delight, and a flicker of mischief that Tara had not seen in a very long time. “That’s very dangerous.” He stated as he reached over to relieve Tara of the dangerous package, “It-it says so right here.” Derek tore through the warning label and pried open the metal casing with the screwdriver. He peered inside and inspected the contents. 

The silver nanomaterials inside cast a flickering light onto his grinning face. They were currently arranged into a solid cylinder which started to peel apart as Derek approached it with his old, blackened nanite mass. As soon as the two made contact, the silver cylinder completely dissolved and swarmed around Derek’s hand as the new nanites integrated themselves into the old nanite glob. He smiled, dropped the packaging on the floor, and continued to configure his omni-tool by poking at its insides with the screwdriver.

Tara closed her eyes and took a deep breath, filling her nostrils with faint mixtures of their home and Derek’s scent. The past few weeks had been very stressful, and she tried to relax and center herself. There was still a lot of work that needed to be done on the Onathin neural parasite, but she knew that it was necessary for her to take a step back and reassess the problem again. *I’m going to need so many interns.* A chill ran down her spine as Tara suddenly identified the reason for that heavy knot in her stomach. The video that she had uploaded onto the Onathin Songlink had repeatedly mentioned the neural parasite. With the entire Sovereignty now focused on that video, the ramifications of revealing the parasite could prove disastrous.

She was shaken out of her thoughts when the entertainment unit abruptly diverted the flow of music and substituted it with the voice of a newscaster. Opening one eye, Tara realized that the viewscreen had started to stream the hourly report from the Interstellar Newsnet. 

“Good evening, and welcome to the Interstellar Newsnet’s hourly update on local affairs, and those beyond the Sol system,” the newscaster began. “Forty-seven Drikenyl warships arrived in the Sol System today, along with the ESC *Leopard* and the Drikenyl passenger ship that had arrived on Earth a week prior. Although some members of Earth Council have expressed concern over the presence of so much alien firepower in Earth orbit, the general reception to these Drikenyl have been warm and welcoming. Drikenyl soldiers have begun disembarking from their respective warships in shifts and are joining the Pilgrims in the Salish Sea.”

A media drone threw its view of the Salish Sea onto the viewscreen, illuminating their living room with a subtle blue glow. Several hundred great orbs of water hung in the sky, held transfixed in place by ghostly beams of light that shot up from deep underneath the surface of the sea. The orbs all surrounded the towering column of spinning water, which flickered and flashed as the Pilgrim Drikenyl continued to pour into it from the skies. Occasionally, a stream of water would burst from the central column and shoot a few Drikenyl into the floating orbs, as if quarantining them away. The newscaster continued, “Efforts are still underway to process and situate all of the arriving Drikenyl, and Coast Guard relief teams have arrived and begun enriching the Salish Sea with additional nutrients and minerals. Shipping lanes through the Salish Sea will continue to be disrupted for at least the next two weeks. In the meantime, the Drikenyl have established what they call ‘surface slipstreams’ to accelerate naval travel through designated areas in an effort to minimize this disruption. To find the entrances and exits of the surface slipstreams, or to donate to the Pilgrim Drikenyl Relief Fund, please visit the Vancouver Coast Guard netsite.”

Derek grunted in annoyance and pain as a small section of his omni-tool suddenly pinched together, taking a small slice of skin off of his finger. As blood slowly seeped out of the wound, he looked hopefully at Tara and held out the injured finger towards her. She sighed, “I’ll be right back.”

The newscaster continued as Tara got off the couch and rummaged through some cupboards, “In other news, hopeful investors may be disappointed to learn that Earth Council has decided *not* to approve a new trade agreement with the Onathin Sovereignty. This agreement would have rescinded previous trade restrictions, and allowed Onathin citizens to invest in Earth-bound businesses and enterprises. Under this trade agreement, humans would also be allowed to do the same with Sovereignty-based companies. Several leading economic think-tanks support the decision, saying that such protective measures are necessary in light of the recent volatility in the Onathin Sovereignty markets.”

Derek gave a small smile at Tara as she came back with a small bottle of HealSeal and applied a thin, transparent layer onto his finger. The blood instantly stopped seeping out of his finger as the wound sealed shut. She gave a small smile in return, but underneath, her anxiety grew as the news report continued, “This market volatility comes at the heels of Senator Crysin’s recent announcement of secession from the Onathin Sovereignty. In his statement, the senator had declared all ‘Stalwart Claw-controlled’ worlds to be independent of Sovereignty control. However, in many cases, it is unclear which worlds are considered to be controlled by the Stalwart Claw.”

The viewscreen of the entertainment unit suddenly flickered, and an Onathin megacity swam into view. Glittering towers and spires rose high into the skies, filled with angry Onathin protestors that squabbled and squawked at all levels of the central governance spire. “Demonstrations have flared up all across the Sovereignty on worlds where the Stalwart Claw hold a small majority of the seats in their respective Planetary Parliaments, with protestors passionately expressing their intent to remain within the Onathin Sovereignty.” The video feed abruptly flickered to to a silver grey hallway, filled with smashed windows, broken machinery, angry scorch marks, and hastily cleaned green bloodstreaks. “A recent demonstration aboard the Xecheed space station escalated to violence, as protestors clashed with security personel, leading to the destruction of several dozen businesses along the 3rd trade ring.” 

The newscaster paused for a breath, and continued, “On core worlds where there is a substantial Stalwart Claw majority in leadership and support, heavy traffic and long queues plague every spaceport as non-aligned citizens attempt to leave the planet with their assets in hand. Several of these core worlds, including Redola V, Trennor II, and Henfir III, have suspended trade on their respective planetary stock exchanges in order to mitigate capital flight from their world markets. Central banks on these planets have frozen the assets of any businesses which run off-world operations, and have also instituted restrictions on currency withdrawals to prevent bank runs. Rumours of asset seizures within these Stalwart Claw worlds have also begun to circulate within the Onathin Songlink.”

The video feed changed once again, suddenly showing silver-white metal structures that floated in orbit over serene orange-blue planets. Glittering glass surrounded metal trusses that extended around a large volume of empty space, like a pair of glass-gloved hands cradling a sphere. Tara got the sense that these structures should be holding something, but looked hopelessly derelict. “As a result of these economic policies, many starship manufacturing companies have declared bankruptcy overnight as their investors and creditors have rescinded their previous agreements. Starship forges are out of commission amongst many of the outlying systems due to their inability to stave off upkeep and administrative costs. Manufacturers within the richer core worlds have enacted their insurance policies to keep up production, but the long-term health of these companies are still under question. This crisis in starship production comes at a perilous time as the Forsaken continue their advance towards Sovereignty Space.""

Soft clicking echoed along the wooden floorboards as Cerion trotted into the living room. She stared bleakly at the viewscreen and released a small, desolate *coo* as the newscaster continued, “The uncertainty in the Sovereignty economy extends beyond the starship construction industry. Food production agreements, energy generation, spaceborne resource extraction, and trading lane agreements that extend between confirmed Sovereignty planets and Stalwart Claw controlled worlds have all been rescinded by order of Senator Crysin. Outlying colonies, dependent on support from the inner worlds, face an uncertain fate despite First Prelate Iwardion’s assurances that Sovereign support will continue to flow to their worlds unhindered. The culmination of all these market fluctuations and uncertainties has led to a 20% drop in the Greater Sovereignty Index. More wealth has been lost in the Onathin Sovereignty since the announcement of secession than the entire wealth that Earth has ever produced!”

The newscaster took a breath before continuing, “First Prelate Iwardion has repeatedly condemned the decision for secession, citing the illegality of Senator Crysin’s unilateral decision.” 

Light flickered as First Prelate Iwardion’s blue-feathered face materialized onto the viewscreen. “Citizens of the Onathin Sovereignty, the notion of secession is ludicrous, and dangerous to our time-honored way of life. We have remained united for centuries, and never have we become as fractious as we are now.” Feathers burst from his wings as he brandished them impressively, ""The Stalwart Claw has always disagreed with the Shardlight Talons regarding foreign policy, and I have always respected their opinions and responded diplomatically. I now see that their political party is not borne from the Onathin spirit of cooperation, but from more primitive urges for power and destruction.” 

The feed flickered again, this time showing Onathin security guards of varying plumage colours hauling silver crates and wooden containers out of several abandoned buildings. First Prelate Iwardion’s imperative voice continued as some of the guards open the crates to reveal the ordnance inside, “By my command, we have seized much of the illegal weaponry that the Stalwart Claw had been stockpiling. This, coupled with their deplorable deliberate infection of the Henfir System, is irrefutable evidence that Senator Crysin had always planned to wage war on the Sovereignty. They have manipulated the hearts and minds of their supporters with the Gorandis Incident, a tragedy that they engineered. They have turned your sentiments against the innocent humans, a nascent species that has yet to even colonize outside their home star system. And now, they seek to fracture us further through illegal declarations of secession.”

First Prelate Iwardion’s four eyes stared piercingly through the screen as his face flickered back into view, “Our civilization has survived many millennia, and we will continue to survive in the face of this new adversity. We must remain united as one Sovereignty! Reject the Stalwart Claw as a valid political entity, reject Senator Crysin’s order for secession, and stand with your fellow citizens. We cannot afford to squawk and squabble amongst ourselves as the Forsaken linger closer to our colonies. Cast aside the deception forced upon our hearts, so that we may push away the coming darkness!”

Tara stared in disbelief as First Prelate Iwardion’s face washed off the viewscreen, “No mention of the neural parasite at all!”

“With the instability of the Sovereignty weighing on my mind, I would not be preoccupied with passing mentions of the neural parasite either, Tara Yang.” Cerion stated as she started pacing back and forth behind the couch. The frantic clicking of her talons against the wooden flooring heightened the tension in Tara’s heart. “Prelate Iwardion is correct about the madness of secession. Never before has that idea ever permeated into the Onathin Sovereignty with such fervour and passion! Granted, secession had been discussed in the past, but the conclusion of all those debates was always in favour of remaining united under the rule of one Sovereign.”

“And now, suddenly, a large portion of the Sovereignty wants to leave and form their own civilization.” Tara stared at the viewscreen as a commercial began to play. Her entertainment unit automatically muted it. “It *must* be something to do with the parasite. And it makes sense! If the neural parasites have somehow become fully self-aware, then they would try to take as much control of the Sovereignty as possible.”

“Hence their gambit in engineering the Gorandis Incident.” Cerion continued Tara’s thought, “When their gambit failed because of your recording, they knew they would lose the election. Now they are attempting to wrest control of as many planets as possible.”

“But this is all conjecture!” Tara sighed, “A very likely conjecture in my mind, but we have no real definitive proof other than some readings of a parasitic network inside a few Stalwart Claw brains. How many of those guards would have supported secession? How many Stalwart Claw citizens have since renounced their political affiliation, and what strain of parasite do they carry?”

“Does this change our objective?” Cerion asked, “We still require a method to eradicate this parasite, regardless of whether or not a specific strain is the cause of the chaos in my civilization!”

Tara nodded, “I agree that we still need to come up with a way to completely destroy the parasite, but perhaps all we need for now is a way to disrupt the networks that the parasites form in Onathin brains. That could be all that is needed to stop the Stalwart Claws from continuing their mission to assume control over the entire Sovereignty.”

Cerion cocked her head, “That is also conjecture, but I will admit that I do not harbour any intentions of starting my own civilization at the expense of the Sovereignty.” She waved a wing, “But that presents us with another problem. Any solution we create to disrupt the networks will need to be tested, and we have no willing subjects with intact parasitic brain networks to perform these experiments on.”

“We would need, at the very least, a constant supply of that specific strain of the neural parasite to even do any *in vitro* experiments.”

The entertainment unit came to life again as the commercials ended. The newscaster continued in his grave voice, “Following First Prelate Iwardion’s address, the Onathin High Court has impeached every single Stalwart Claw member of Parliament. Dozens of these members have been since arrested, although several prominent members, including Senator Crysin, have so far escaped arrest. Sovereign forces have also executed several more raids on illegal Stalwart Claw weapons depots, seizing millions of credits’ worth of military ordnance.”

Tara quirked an eyebrow, “What if we get Diplomat Pellon to help us? He probably has access to those Stalwart Claw Parlimentary members that were just arrested. Perhaps they could become our source for the neural parasite?”

“Is it wise to reinforce the existence of the parasite into Diplomat Pellon’s mind?” Cerion asked cautiously, “If he is infected with that strain…”

“He’s not.” Tara confirmed, “His was the first bioscan that I took. He is infected with the same strain that you carry. I think he’ll come around.” She looked at her tablet, “And I can only hope that Prelate Iwardion carries your strain as well. We will undoubtedly need to inform him of the parasite in the future, so that we can get our eventual treatment administered across the entire Sovereignty.”

Static crackled into the room as the viewscreen of the entertainment unit flashed and twitched. General Davis suddenly materialized onto the screen and stared sternly into Tara’s eyes, “Dr. Yang, I’m glad I was able to finally contact you. We have wounded pilots transferring to your infirmary.”

“There are plenty of doctors and nurses at the hospital that are more than capable of attending to them,” Tara replied. There was a strange beseeching gaze behind the General’s stony stare.

“There is one particular pilot that will be beyond their abilities, Dr. Yang. To be honest, I’m not sure if there’s anyone that is qualified to treat his condition, but I implore you to do your best.”

“General?”

“Please, Dr. Yang. It’s my son.”

Alan yanked on the helm controls and swerved his Blinkship abruptly, narrowly avoiding a swinging maroon laser beam. He scattered a trio of Pathfinder probes into the side of the offending Voidblade, sending its pieces slicing into a nearby Dreadnought. An escorting Swarmship suddenly exploded beside him as another Dreadnought rose into view. “Shit!” Alan swore as he fired another probe and transported his small strike force out of harm’s way and into the safety of the main Kredith Swarmhost over the planet of Sojix II. 

A few bolts of dark red plasma followed them through the corridor, impacting the protective dome of a nearby Hiveseed. Alan relaxed his grip on the steering controls and wiped the sweat off his brow. “Wardrone Ixtacs, that’s about all we can do to slow them down. Without control of the Sojix star, we can’t do much else but wait for them to engage us over the planet.”

Kredith rasps and screeches dissolved into intelligible English over the *Hermes’* speakers, “Understood, pilot Radisson. Many of the Hiveseeds are ready for the evacuation corridors, but there are a few that have not yet completed their extraction maneuvers from the planet.”

“Tell them to hurry. The corridors will stabilize soon.” Proximity alerts began blaring over the speakers as the Forsaken fleet flooded into orbit over Sojix II. “But not soon enough.” Alan groaned, knowing that the meagre orbital defenses would do little to soften the blow. 

The dozen photon lance satellites that hung in orbit spun to life, and disgorged collimated beams of white light that incinerated a few Forsaken Dreadnoughts. More ships effortlessly replaced them as they entered weapons range and unloaded their plasma into the defense fleet. Carrierhives surged into motion, spitting plasma in response as their carapaces cracked and splintered from the Forsaken weapons fire. Shadowspikes streaked out of the Dreadnought fighter bays and strafed the Hiveseeds, carving burning lines into their biomass domes. Blue ion pulses rained from hundreds of towers along the superstructures of the Hiveseeds, obliterating hundreds of Shadowspikes even as their domes began to crack.

“We just need to hold on a little while longer. The corridors are almost ready!” Alan yelled as he thrust his Blinkship sideways to avoid a volley of plasma. The bridge flashed as corridors encompassed the Shadowspike group that was chasing him and sent them hurtling like missiles into the side of a Dreadnought. Purple flares erupted along the capital ship’s black hull as it crumpled inwards from the impact. A surge of Kredith weapons fire from a nearby Carrierhive finished it off.
Screeches and squeaks seeped into the bridge as Wardrone Ixtacs ordered a portion of his Swarmhost to adopt a defensive posture around a pair of Hiveseeds that were slowly ascending into orbit. Tendrils slowly retracted into the underside of the colonyships, shrugging off globs of hardened dirt and rubble as it rose higher into the sky. Faint distortions emanated from hundreds of small worker ships as they encircled their Hiveseed, slowly pushing into space. Alan winced as a bright light poured in through the viewscreen. A photon lance satellite had just been destroyed by a pack of Voidblades that were quickly moving towards a group of Hiveseeds that the satellite was protecting.

Alan pinged the exposed Hiveseeds on his tactical overlay, “Blinkships, pull those Hiveseeds into the main fleet!” Acknowledgements chattered over the speakers as Alan hurled his ship through a corridor and appeared underneath the first of the unprotected Hiveseeds. Grunting with exertion, he pulled the *Hermes* into a tight spiral around it and fired a high-yield Pathinder probe. Voidblade laser fire swung wildly as the Hiveseed vanished in a flash of light. One particularly angry Voidblade rounded upon Alan’s small ship, but was pulverized by numerous corridors as the rest of the Blinkships entered the fray.

Forsaken ships continued to pour into orbit and clashed with the overwhelmed defense satellites. One by one, they burst like stars against the backdrop of the orange-brown planet, succumbing to the Forsaken assault. “There are so many of them,” Alan muttered as he blinked underneath another Hiveseed to transport it to a safer location. 

The couple dozen Hiveseeds in orbit over Sojix II had been herded from the Ukline, Xylron, Belxis, and Yitrex systems, in accordance with General Davis’s order to fallback to Ekres. These orphan Hiveseeds now fired wave after wave of ion bursts into the approaching Forsaken fleet, detonating Shadowspikes and disabling Voidblades and Dreadnoughts. Blinkships flashed into existence around the Hiveseed fleet and hurled the Forsaken hull fragments into the paths of the Shadowspikes, ripping them apart as they tried to close in on the floundering Hiveseeds. Dark purple lasers carved furious lines across splintering biomass domes, shattering the Hiveseed superstructures underneath as they slowly burned their way through.

Alan’s heart jumped a beat as a high pitched chime resounded through the cacophony of alarms on his vessel. He punched at his communications console, “Wardrone Ixtacs! The first of the evacuation corridors are stabilizing!”

Brilliant spheres of pure white light bloomed out of the dark void, enveloping several Hiveseeds before completely disappearing. The frustrated Forsaken ships twisted about, and retargeted the colonyships that were left behind. Bursts of plasma pummeled the superstructures of the Hiveseeds while dark lasers sliced buildings down. Sections of Hiveseeds began shearing off completely and fell screaming into the planet below. In desperation, worker ships streamed out of their Hiveseeds and began suicidal charges at any Forsaken ships nearby. Alan watched as a dozen worker ships impacted against the dark hull of a Dreadnought, throwing yellow flares defiantly into space as they exploded, leaving only small dents in the capital ship. 

“Come on! Where are the rest of them?” Alan cursed, “Wardrone, the Hiveseeds need more support!”

Carrierhives surged into motion and tried to head off the advancing Forsaken fleet. The tactical overlay was engulfed in red signatures, and blue allied symbols vanished with alarming speed. Alan squinted as he sent another pathfinder probe into a Dreadnought. The ensuing flash of light tore the Forsaken ship in half and sent the middle section careening into a Voidblade that was about to fire at another Hiveseed. Swarmships chased Shadowspikes around the colonyships, but were decimated by Dreadnought fire. Suddenly, the skies above Sojix II erupted in white as the remaining Hiveseeds disappeared into more corridors.

“We’re almost all done here!” Alan yelled, pinging the tactical overlay, “Consolidate the remaining ships here. That’s where the last group of evacuation corridors are going to open!”

“Pilot Radisson, we cannot defend the ascending Sojix Hiveseeds from that location!” Wardrone Ixtacs warned, “Those Hiveseeds must be protected!” 

A searing beam of maroon light singed his port wing as Alan swerved the *Hermes* around a Voidblade. He gritted his teeth as he scattered a trio of Pathfinder Probes in his wake, igniting the Voidblade with three spheres of pure white light. The Forsaken ship crumpled from the sudden loss of mass before shattering in a brilliant purple flare. Alan glanced at the timer above the tactical overlay and cursed, “Give me some escorts, and move to the corridor anchor point!”

He jerked at the flight controls as a Dreadnought suddenly appeared in front of him and fired a storm of dark red plasma at him. Malevolent red light raced past the hull and impacted a couple of escorting Swarmships. Alan fired a probe and blinked his squadron to one of the Hiveseeds that was still struggling to reach orbit. Blizzards of worker ships circled around it like a cluster of frenzied bees, emitting anti-gravity pulses to push their colonyship into space. Voidblades closed in, cutting through the worker ship swarm in wide swathes. Lines of explosions glinted within Alan’s determined eyes as he fired another high-yield Pathfinder probe right at the central spire of the Hiveseed, transporting it in a flash to the corridor anchor points.

Lasers reached towards the *Hermes*, passing dangerously close to the armoured hull. Alan’s escorting Swarmship fighters belched plasma at the surrounding Voidblades, destroying the laser cannons before disappearing through a corridor. Alan quickly glanced at the tactical overlay, trying to locate the last Hiveseed that was attempting to reach orbit. “Fuck!” He swore as Dreadnoughts descended upon the hapless Hiveseed, saturating the skies around it with electrifying plasma. 

Biomass crumbled and tendrils lashed out in pain as the superstructures shattered from the Forsaken weapons fire. The Hiveseed’s central spire shuddered as Voidblades constantly swept their lasers at the buildings, cutting through ion cannon towers, secondary protective domes, and desperate suicidal worker ships. Bright explosions reflected off the black Forsaken hulls as the Hiveseed’s base plate fractured. Ruptures grew like a wild spiderweb, and segments of the Hiveseed sheared off and plummeted into the planet below. A piercing chime echoed across the bridge, shaking Alan out of frozen horror, “The last of the corridors are stabilizing!” He gritted his teeth and blinked what remained of his squadron to the corridor anchor point. As the *Hermes* embraced the welcoming flash of light, the central spire of the last Hiveseed was consumed in burning plasma fire, sintering and cracking violently before plunging back into Sojix II.

Alan blinked to clear his vision. A pale brown dot hovered in front of him and seemed to squirm in place. *We made it.* he took a breath and released the tension in his stomach as he recognized the planet of Ekres IV in front of him. He shook his head, trying to get the image of the shattering Hiveseed out of his mind, “Wardrone Ixtacs, I’m sorry. I couldn’t get to the last Hiveseed in time.”

Unsettling shrieks and screeches dissolved into unexpectedly calm English, “Our losses are many, Pilot Radisson, but you and your people have already helped save billions.” Wardrone Ixtacs continued, “We ask that you remain with us to save even more as we continue the exodus from our worlds. I am now reconnected to what remains of the Hivemind network, and it is apparent that the state of the war has rapidly deteriorated.”

Alan sighed, “How bad is it?”

“After the fall of Kredin, the Hivemind network was fractured and contact with most of the Dominion has been lost. With the Forsaken launching attacks from the void within the Home Cluster, we cannot hope to organize effective defenses without proper communication channels. Fortunately, the Mindweavers’ order to retreat to Ekres managed to permeate through most of the Dominion before the Hivemind was irreparably broken. Many systems have already been destroyed, and the remaining Hiveseeds are gathering the minds of their citizens into their spires, and collecting all available biomass before abandoning their planets. They will travel along the few starlanes that are still unfettered by Forsaken Voidbases or vanguard fleets and seek refuge in neighbouring fortified systems.” Wardrone Ixtacs shifted his screeches at his subordinates, ordering the remaining Kredith ships to begin moving towards Ekres IV. “We must recover as many Hiveseeds as possible, and consolidate here to defend the Mindweavers. Unfortunately, Ekres is disconnected from most of these viable starlanes.”

“So they’re trapped in the isolated pockets of Dominion space, surrounded by Forsaken forces?”

“Correct,” Wardrone Ixtacs abruptly paused. Curious at the sudden silence, Alan established a visual link to his Carrierhive flagship, and found the Wardrone staring intensely at the vibrating webbing in front of him. A couple of his insectoid limbs were enmeshed within the stringy webbing, which pulsed with faint flickers of light as information flowed forth and into his carapace. “Updates from the Hivemind inform me that your General Davis has already dispatched Blinkship squadrons to several major systems, in an effort to establish corridors to Ekres and thereby circumvent the Forsaken siege.”

“I guess the idea is that the Hiveseeds would travel to the major systems for safety, and then the Blinkships can collect all of them at once and transport them here.” Alan surmised, “Which is why he sent us to the Sojix system, and why Flockleader Wiksen diverted his fleet to Ediken. Hopefully he’s having an easier time there than we did at Sojix.”

“General Davis has also dispatched Blinkship squadrons to Cedoren, Usanir, and Beyoli. With their assistance, we may be able to retrieve those Hiveseeds and their biomass stores from the clutches of the Forsaken armada that have laid siege to those systems.” Alan watched as Wardrone Ixtacs motioned to a nearby battledrone, who activated some commands into the webbing in front of him. “Many Hiveseeds, and the hives on their respective worlds, have already been destroyed by the Forsaken.” His membrane wings seemed to sag a little, “Billions of minds have been lost, and it is uncertain if their experiences can ever be recapitulated. The Mindweavers themselves are also greatly diminished in number. Only a small portion of them were evacuated from Kredin.”

The communications console beside Alan started downloading data from the active Hivemind link, displaying tactical information about the Ekres system. Both Ekres IV and V were heavily fortified, with a couple dozen Onathin photon lance satellites in orbit over both planets as well as several Kredith defensive weapons platforms. There was also a large orbital assembly over Ekres IV that the console labeled as a ‘photon lance array,’ presumably to provide extra protection to the Mindweavers on the planet’s surface. From what Alan could make of the readings, it seemed that the Onathins had linked together a series of miniaturized photon lance satellites into a circular, flat interconnecting array, all linked to a central power source that was latched onto the underside of the circular array.  Alan admired the silver-white construction, but began to search for Henry’s signature amongst the hundreds of Carrierhive symbols that hovered over both planets. *Where is he? Did General Davis send him off to another system?* He suddenly realized that Wardrone Ixtacs’s fleet had stopped moving towards Ekres IV.

“A cluster of unescorted Hiveseeds is approaching Ekres. They are pursued by a large Forsaken armada, and will drop into normal space at this location.” A rippling circle appeared on Alan’s tactical overlay, just beyond the Ekres VI gas giant. Wardrone Ixtacs continued, “We must translocate to that location and intercept the Forsaken.”

“Understood, standby for corridor stabilization.” Alan signaled to the other dozen Blinkships, and a moment later the space around the Carrierhive Swarmhost lit up in brilliance and disgorged them over Ekres VI. The blue-green gas giant stared impassively back through Alan’s viewscreen, subtly hypnotic with its swirling turquoise clouds. Chimes bounced around the bridge, rousing him from the mesmerizing sight, “I’ve got the Hiveseeds on sensors. Blinkships, get ready to close in on them and transport them to Ekres IV.”

Several beams of light trailed into the system as the Hiveseeds dropped into normal space. Gaping wounds pockmarked their surfaces, ringed with burnt black scars. Their outer hulls shuddered as they struggled to prevent cracks from propagating along their carapaces. The biomass stores of these Hiveseeds were obviously depleted, or were prioritized to reinforce their central spires where the Kredith minds were stored. Alarms resounded through the bridge as hundreds of dark purple trails of light beamed into the system behind the Hiveseeds, materializing into Forsaken Dreadnoughts and Voidblades.

Alan blinked to the nearest Hiveseed and immediately fired a Pathfinder probe, sending it safely into orbit of Ekres IV. As the corridor flash receded, Wardrone Ixtacs’s fleet surged into motion, hurling torrents of yellow plasma bolts at the Forsaken fleet. Brief bursts of purple light flashed in the void as Voidblades succumbed to the Kredith weapons fire, but several dozen had survived the onslaught and closed in on the straggling Hiveseeds. Gigantic portions of the slowest Hiveseed shattered and splintered off as lasers carved and sliced into the failing carapace. Biomass tendrils flailed from the underside of the Hiveseed, reaching out and strangling a few Voidblades that had flown too close to the colonyship.

Feeling pretty worthless,Squilliam_Fancysonn,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/59zly3/cant_sleep_feeling_pretty_worthless/,"Junior engineering student here. Applied to a few (15-20) internships so far and had three interviews with decent/good companies. 


First interview was with a company which I thought would have been easy to get a job with, but I got my rejection email pretty quickly. 


My second interview went ok, but just found out about a couple of students in my classes who also interviewed with them, and they are much more qualified than I am. 


Now I'm playing my third interview over and over in my head and just thinking of the fuck-ups I've made or may have made during it. 


At this point, I'm basically just waiting for the other two rejections. There's no way I have a chance against the other candidates, especially since I fucked up what I thought would have been my back up.


I'm so stressed out because it's my junior year and I feel like if I don't get anything next summer, I'll be SOL and unemployable forever. My GPA is a 3.275. I'm somewhat involved but never had any leadership positions. I'm a good worker and quick thinker, but pretty bad at public speaking. So basically, I'm pretty average but apparently average doesn't get jobs. It's so frustrating because I think that I'm doing better than a good portion of my class, and most of should be able to get jobs, right? I just feel literally worthless, I'm not even worth a single penny to any of these companies."

Title says it all. Basically I'm a junior in college (economics major) that started the computer science track pretty late. I'm doing well in my introductory course right now, and taking 2 courses next semester (discrete math &amp; second half of introduction sequence); will be taking more in depth courses my senior year;  my previous internships have been in UI/UX (no programming, unfortunately), and biotech, and I'm an economics major, so I've already accepted an offer from an economics consulting firm (reneging would be pretty bad). I realized I really enjoy computer science, and assuming all goes well next semester in my courses, my question is what are the odds that I'll actually get interviews for full time offers my senior year considering my lack of experience relative to my peers? I'll have completed a BA in Computer Science by the time I graduate, but obviously a lot of the core courses that recruiters want, I won't have on my transcript until I graduate. Any advice?"
5a0b1k,3,2016-10-29,CIT degree with focus on software development?,bmcmb,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5a0b1k/cit_degree_with_focus_on_software_development/,"Hi, I'm at a top 25 school that's got a good reputation for tech/engineering and  has 3 different tech sectors: CS, Computer Engineering, Computer and Information Technology. I'm currently the school for EE/Computer engineering but have been planning to change my major to CIT and my changing degree will be final at the end of the semester. I've got a good GPA, and am not afraid of math, but I'm want to make sure I'm making the right choice before it's all said and done and unchangeable. One downside is that the average starting salary of CIT grads is 10K lower than CmpE, but is climbing rapidly with the changes to the CIT program (7K in the past 2 years). CS accepts 6 credits from the 30+ engineering credit hours I've already taken, while CIT accepts all but 3. This is why I'm so hesitant to transfer to CS...basically money reasons. 

The CIT grads go to software development, database, networking, or info security stuff. The Computer Engineering grads often go to low-level software development, while nearly ALL of their classwork is dedicated to circuitry stuff with little room for any electives. I've spoken with CmpE students and a CIT student who transferred from CmpE, and they both have agreed with my viewpoint of the CmpE curriculum being way off what people actually end up doing after graduation, with the CIT degree being much more focused on real-world problems, even more so than CS sometimes.

The CIT program is VERY flexible. So I want to go into software development, so let me give you an example of all the specific software classes I can fit in my major because of electives/core courses, INCLUDING algorithms/data structures to some degree.


Intro to Software Development Concepts (C#)

Intro to Object Oriented Programming (C#)

Systems Programming (C++, Algos/datastructures)

Object Oriented Application Development (Java/datastructures)

Software Development for Mobile Computers (Not sure what language)

Enterprise Application Development (Java)

Database Programming 

2 more I'm thinking of choosing from out of these:

Advanced Coding Security

Software Development for Mobile Computers II

Packaged Software Solutions

My question is: How hard do you think it would be for me to get a job or internship as one of the many ""Software Engineer"" opportunities that are out there? Or do you think people will see CIT on the resume and move on to the next?

5a101m,5,2016-10-29,"Love doing work at my new job, but having a difficult time with coworkers who are ""training"" me, not sure how to handle or cope",Jcorb,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5a101m/love_doing_work_at_my_new_job_but_having_a/,"I love the actual WORK part of my job. It's a mix of writing and coding, and even though I stay busy all day, I genuinely enjoy it.

Only thing is, of the 4-person team I'm on, the two guys who are supposed to be ""training"" me seem like they're being assholes, and it's really getting under my skin.

See, among all of the other work, which I think I'm kicking ass at, we also have to fill out these elaborate MS Excel spreadsheets, called Bluebooks. It's time-consuming and confusing, even though I've been making notes whenever I do them. It seems like every week, my coworkers throw in some other thing I have to keep track of and update in these.

Well, that's not the issue. The issue is that they're condescending, and act all pissy whenever I ask them a question. They've been here longer than I have, and I've always respected seniority, but they're both my age but talk down to me like I'm some high school intern. One of them has even berated me and sent me an internal email saying I shouldn't be taking lunch if I have things to do; which is not only ridiculous, AND I was perfectly on top of everything, but he did it in such a way that makes it seem like I'm supposed to ask her permission before I do anything. 

Well, getting back to these bluebooks, they're normally due Monday, so he wants me to get them done Friday so he has a chance to look them over and point out anything I missed. Perfectly reasonable.

Only most days, he shovels a ton of projects on me, and I always ask ""is this priority, or can I finish the bluebook?"", and the answer is always ""bluebook is never priority"". So because of that, I always wind up having to stay late or do bluebook over the weekend (because you can't do them early, or the numbers will be off). However, because of that, it means he's not really available for questions until Monday.

So, he gets pissed off when I don't get them done before Friday, even when he tells me other work is more important, he gets pissed off if I email him questions over the weekend, and he gets pissed off if I wait until Monday to finish them.

Because I'm still ""the new guy"" (just over 2 months), I know I have to be careful how I handle myself. Yet, I feel like I'm constantly walking on eggshells, and it's stressing me out. Even lastnight and today, I feel both angry and a sense of dread, because I know that most matter what, this guy is going to take this condescending tone of voice with me, and being talked down to just gets me boiling with rage, every time.

Yet, outside of his attitude, I love the job, and the manager is hands-down the best boss I've ever worked for. If anything, I have to remind myself that he's still the manager, because he's an incredibly friendly guy.

My best friend -- who used to work there -- thinks I should just approach the managers and ask ""Is there anyone else available to walk me through the bluebooks?"", and just use that as a segway to mentioning that the one coworker doesn't seem to like answering questions, and also expects me to work weekends (which actually isn't company policy anyways, unless it's an emergency).

At the same time... I dunno. I'm used to working blue collar work, where if you have a problem, you tell them off yourself. I worry that talking to the manager might come across as ""tattle-telling"" or something, as we're both grown men. And it's not like he's completely in the wrong, either; I'm supposed to get the bluebooks done sooner, and I'm pretty much always cutting it down to the wire.

I don't know. I'm not used to working in an office, and I'm losing patience over my coworkers' condescending attitudes, to the point it's affecting my ""free time"" as well. I just don't know how to handle the situation."

I'm currently in the interview process with company A, but it's very likely they won't have a decision made until mid December  
  
I've found someone that may (or may not) be able to give me an internal referral to company B, but I'm not sure if it's socially acceptable to reject offers from internal referrals, and I don't want to give up on company A (what if A&amp;B give me offer? I'll reject B for sure)  
  
Finally, I can also probably return to my previous internship company C and afaik they were pretty happy with my previous performance, but I'm concerned they might have filled up their spots by the time I'm done with company A and B  
  
All 3 companies will require ~3 months for visa processing, and I intend to start in May  
  
I prefer company A &gt; B &gt; C &gt; randomly shotgunning resume again  
  
What would be the optimal strategy here? When should I reach out to company B and C? It's highly likely that if A doesn't give me offer in Dec, companies B and C have already filled up their intern spots, and it might be way too late to shotgun resumes after I'm done with all 3 companies A, B, and C.

Hello all, I graduated end of 2015 with a BS in Electrical Engineering, and have been working since then as a robotics software engineer, at a military contractor. I really like the work I've been doing and responsibilities I've been given, and would like to go back to graduate school to get a Masters in the robotics field at some point. I have a few qualms that I have hoping you guys could help me answer:
My undergrad GPA wasn't stellar(3.15, but at a Top 20 school). I plan to get work experience for the near future, and apply no later than the fall of 2018. Would ~3 years of relevant work experience(counting 2 internships I had in undergrad) put less weight towards my gpa?
Since I've left school, there is really no one I know in academia that would write me letters of recommendation. Was never too close to professors, although a couple I'm sure would remember me. However, I definitely could get good letters from managers/bosses at the companies I've worked at. Does it make a big difference where the letters would come from?
Outside of work, I do work on some personal projects to gain a better understanding of CS concepts and languages. However, I live in CA close to many research universities. Would it be possible/make sense to get involved with some of the research/projects there? Or would my time be better spent working on projects/making connections at local TechLab? I do like working on cool stuff, but I would also want to make progress to getting ready for grad school.
I plan on applying to CE,CS, or Systems Engineering programs. Georgia Tech's OMSCS looks really appealing to me if I choose the CS route, and is definitely at the top of my list right now. I would also be in favor of going to my local school(same as undergrad), but don't think I would be able to make the admissions requirements
I would appreciate any advice you guys could give me, as I do want to make sure I am on the right track. Thanks!"

5a41b9,3,2016-10-29,Not sure where to go from here,confusedstudent2016,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5a41b9/not_sure_where_to_go_from_here/,"So I'm currently a 3rd year CS major from a large public university in the Northeast. I came in to college in Fall 2014 with 30+ AP credits which has let me get to where I am today. I had to take very few gen ed courses in my time here and I can graduate next semester with my CS degree (Spring 2017). 


The problem is, I love college. I don't want to leave because obviously all my friends are still here and I enjoy fully dedicating my time to learning. People always say college is the best time of their lives and I agree. Partying, being in close proximity to all of my friends, classes, etc. is awesome. I realized this a few months ago and I decided to add on another major: statistics. I know I want a job where I'd be working on AI, ML, or NLP algorithms in my career so I thought that doing a statistics major would be helpful for those jobs. I enjoy the subject but definitely not as much as CS. I'm starting to question myself, however, of staying at this school just for hanging out with friends and learning something that may *potentially* help me out in the future. Basically, I have really bad FOMO. If I go this route, I can graduate in Fall 2017 or Spring 2018 (with the rest of my class).


My other option is to do a BS/MS program at my university. I can graduate in Fall 2018 (so 4.5 years total) with both degrees. The problem is, I'm not sure if this is worth it either. I don't know how effective it is to complete an MS at the same university as I did my  BS. A lot of the grad courses have the same title as the undergrad courses and I have actually taken some graduate level courses (Graduate Algorithm Design). I'd primarily be interested in an MS for learning about the more advanced topics in our field such as AI, ML, NLP, etc. I'd probably take the MS project option and not do research. So what do you think? Is this route worth it?


Finally, the last option is to just graduate next semester (Spring 2017) with just 3 years of undergraduate education. I'd hate to do this because I'm cutting the supposed ""best years of my life"" short by an entire year. However, if this is the right choice in terms of not wasting my time learning useless stuff, then I'll accept it and have to live with it.


If I don't do the BS/MS route, I was thinking of going back to grad school for an MS anyways. However, I'd want to go somewhere good (at least better than my undergrad school) but I don't have the undergrad research experience for it. I have a pretty solid GPA (~3.8), will have 3 internships by the end of next summer, and have worked with a professor on a medium-sized kinda simple project. I also think I'd be able to get a solid GRE score but I'm lacking the research part of my application. So I probably won't get into some CMU level MS program but maybe a tier below. Otherwise, I was also thinking about the GA Tech Online MSCS program while I work but that would be a very stressful and busy 3 or so years in the program. However, its definitely a top-tier university and I wouldn't be losing 2 years of salary while completing a master's degree. So this would definitely be a solid option if I don't do the BS/MS route.


**So I have three options:**

1. CS/Statistics double major and graduate next year (3.5 - 4 total years)

2. BS/MS and graduate in two years from now (4.5 total years)

3. Just CS major Graduate next semester (3 total years)

What do you think, Reddit? I'm really confused about what to do and I need some outside perspective on my situation."

I have completed five fairly substantial open source side projects, all websites with JavaScript and Node. 

My skills were self taught, and although I am confident in my ability to program anything practical, I do not currently have any skills in Data Structures and Algorithms, and I won't be taking the corresponding course until at least next year.

From what I've read, cs interviews seem to be fairly data structures and algorithms heavy. So my question is, should I still be applying to internships, or would all of the interview be impossible for me to answer if I were given the chance at an interview?"
5a7h2r,2,2016-10-30,PM intern to software engineer,notthepirate,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5a7h2r/pm_intern_to_software_engineer/,"About me: I've had two software engineering internships in the past, and I've gotten two summer internship offers: one being a Program Manager at Microsoft, the other engineering at a startup in the bay area. Not a super famous startup but still a very good place where I'd learn a lot.

I'm considering taking the PM offer because it would be an interesting experience, and maybe something I'd want to do when I graduate. Again, I've never done PM before so I can't be sure of this. I see the engineering job as a ""safer"" choice since I already know what SE jobs are like and I know I enjoy them. So my question is this: How much of a difference would it make for future prospects if I look for dev jobs and have a PM internship on my resume rather than a dev internship? Microsoft is a good name on the resume, but does PM make much of a difference?

Also, if anyone wants to share their Microsoft PM intern experiences or what it was like looking for work after, I'd appreciate it :)"

I have my B.S. in chemical engineering and I am currently in my second year of a highly ranked PhD program. I am 100% sure, and have been from the start, that I intend to go into industry following graduate school. My adviser, like many academics, has never worked in industry and I don't think he understands exactly what companies are looking for. He is guiding me in the way he thinks best (i.e. preparing me for academia), but I want to know reddit's opinion of a few things for industry vs academia:

* My adviser expects me to finish my PhD in 5 years, but I have heard that industry expects you to finish in 4. Any truth to this?
* Obviously publications are important for academia. My adviser wants me to put out 6-10 before I finish (I should have 3-4 first authors out by the end of this year). Does industry also want a high number of pubs or is this less important?
*  Internships. I did 3 in undergrad and I feel that it was the biggest factor in getting my job offers with my BS. Should I do an internship or Co-Op in grad school? I know my adviser would prefer I just stayed in our lab for the whole time.
* Should I take the FE? I didn't take it right after undergrad because I was told it wasn't a big deal for chem eng, and my adviser in grad school says I dont need it, but I am concerned not taking it may hold me back. 
* My adviser wants me to stay in academia and end up at some prestigious post doc and then pursue a tenure track position. Even though I have told him I prefer industry he continues to say things like ""this paper is really going to help get you that competitive post doc!"". How do I communicate to him that I want to go into industry?
* Do I need to post doc for industry? I was under the impression it is not necessary but I have been told by some senior grad students that it is becoming more expected from large companies."
5a834c,4,2016-10-30,Graduating On Time,Almiria,UTAustin,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/5a834c/graduating_on_time/,"With spring 2017 registration ongoing, I've been thinking about the time it will take me to graduate and would appreciate some input about my situation.


Some background:

I transferred into UT after my freshman year at UTA doing the CAP program into electrical engineering, so had I attended UT all four years I should be scheduled to graduate spring of 2018. However, since I did the CAP program, I ended up being behind in terms of EE classes by a year. Ultimately I ended up getting back on track by taking EE 312 and 313 during the summer, so until I graduate all I need to take are solely EE classes. 


My concern:

I felt confident in taking 3-4 EE classes every semester to ensure I graduate on time since I don't have to devote my time elsewhere, but I recently started an internship (which I haven't had since coming here) that I would be able to continue until I graduate given that I perform well. Given this opportunity, I don't think I would be able to handle 20 hours / week of work and exclusively engineering classes to graduate on time. 



My solution:

I was planning on taking an extra semester at UT to lighten my course load every semester, but my parents are pushing me to graduate on time saying that companies will look down on someone taking an extra semester to graduate. I tried reasoning with them by explaining the benefits of taking an extra semester:

     1. Focus more on classes and learning the material / better GPA
     2. I would graduate in Fall 2018, meaning I have an extra opportunity for
         a summer internship before looking for full time positions

But they weren't really convinced and said to take enough classes to graduate on time. Especially with work, I'm almost certain I can't graduate on time without my grades suffering and/or having less time to truly learn the material in my courses.

So, should I take an extra semester to graduate? If I do, how should I explain this to my parents so they'd understand my situation?"

I know this type of post has been posted before and mostly those people are suffering from impostor syndrome or something like that. I am pretty sure that this is not impostor syndrome and I am actually incompetent. I only know the very basics of coding/data structures/algorithms. 

Quick backstory:

*  I graduated with a CS degree from a decent university.
* I didn't do any internships but I worked on my own small personal projects and was quite happy with them. I also worked on group projects for school work. 
* I was pretty average in school, I didn't do horrible but not great either. 

When I worked on projects, if I got stuck on something I usually searched for it online and eventually would be able to get past it. I feel like this would not work at jobs where everything should be well coded and well thought out instead of some solution found online.

Despite all this, I somehow convinced myself I could be a developer in the real world and somehow landed a junior position. They asked very basic coding problems if they were more difficult I might not have passed. They emphasized that they were looking for someone who could learn fast and grow with the company. The thing is, I don't learn fast. It takes me a decent amount of time to learn something and be competent enough to do work with it. Of course because of my fear of being fired I started reading tutorials online and watching videos of how to use the frameworks the company uses but I know I wouldn't know enough to produce decent work and will eventually be fired.

Basically, I've been constantly in fear of being fired and it keeps me up at night. I haven't even started working yet. I feel like I got this job by mistake or the interviewers thought I was better than I actually am. 

How do I get past this anxiety / fear? Is it normal to feel like this or am I just weird?"

I am concerned that my inaction in reporting new income while on Medi-cal is going to be a problem. I just received a notice in the mail about needing to check my eligibility in order to continue coverage and need some advice. Here's the situation from the beginning... 

I initially joined Medi-cal through the San Mateo Health Plan in 2012 when my dad died when I was 22. I spent the next couple years working minimum wage as an intern so the income limit was never really an issue. I actually tried to get on Covered CA in 2014 because I had a few serious medical problems (IBS, ADD, depression) that Medi-cal didn't cover but I didn't make enough to qualify. 

In late 2014 I got a full-time job that came with Aetna health insurance, and I just assumed that the Medi-cal wouldn't renew so I didn't cancel it. As it turned out, I never got kicked off Medi-cal. 

How do I know? Because when I got laid off a year later, and I was now living in San Francisco, I was able to update my Medi-cal plan to the San Francisco Health Plan. During this time I spent a few months on SDI (before getting laid off) and then later UI.

Starting in 2015, I have been working a new full-time job – that does not offer health insurance – for nearly two years now making more than the income maximum and I still have the Medi-cal coverage. I thought it would end last year when I ignored the renewal notices, but nope, I still have coverage. 

I just received another notice in the mail for this year, and am wondering if I don't reply if I will keep my coverage again. I've read that there can be a penalty for not reporting income changes, but don't know how strict the penalty is. I have had some serious health issues these past few years that Medi-cal has covered completely and until recently I was concerned that I would unable to keep a job because of these issues, so that is the main reason I never reported my new income. I am much healthier now and am less concerned about my illnesses getting in the way of keeping a job. 

I'm wondering if I should not respond and hope to keep Medi-cal coverage for next year or proactively cancel the coverage and start  paying Covered CA? Also, should I be concerned about having to pay for anything Medi-cal covered over the last year? "

The CEO has expressed some interest in hiring me after I graduate this June. The pay is average (somewhere around 70k) and they are incredibly flexible. I can work whatever hours I want so long as things are handled.

So my question I guess is as follows: will this limit my opportunities moving forward? I don't want to pigeon hole myself into a situation where it is hard for me to move to a larger company because all my experience is with a pretty small one.

I remember when I first came I was seeking advice on how to break into investment banking. Long story short, I gave up on that route because I go to a non-target school in the Southeast. My school doesn't even really place well in corp fin in the Southeast, let alone IB. Still, through some hard networking over the past 2 years, I was able to land 3 internships.


Started off the summer of 2015 as a commercial banking summer analyst with a reputable bank in the Southeast and East Coast in general. Then this past summer, I worked for a large Tech firm in corporate finance (think HP, Cisco, IBM, etc.). Now, I am in my last semester in college doing an internship in M&amp;A (Corp Dev) with a smaller company, but very reputable in it's space and a Fortune 1000. I really like this company, the team, the environment, the work I do, and I just about everything else. I believe they are going to offer me a full time position as my manager has hinted at it and the compensation for a starting entry level out of college is quite competitive. 

Seems like the perfect gig right? Well, my main issue and probably the biggest one is that I really despise living in the South/Southeast. I grew up on the West Coast and have been dying to get back somehow. My worry is that if I take this job, especially at the stage I am of my career, it will be increasingly more difficult to break away to the West Coast and make a move back. 

So, I've been pondering and thinking about maybe pursuing a masters in finance from a program like UT or Vandy in the hopes that their alumni network will be stronger and could lead me to work on the West Coast. Does this seem like a bad idea? Is it bad to turn down a 55 to 60k ish salary and instead spend that much on a 12-18 month MSF program from a reputable school? I would really appreciate any advice, tips, suggestions, feedback anyone could give. Last time I came here, it was very well thought out and I'm hoping to get the same here."

The only problem is that I would likely have to take half a day off of high school every other day.  That is no problem with my credits and that's not what bothers me.  What is a problem is that I I'm already doing half day college so that'd only leave me at 1/2 of high school every other day.  My parents both agree that they think it's important for me to socialize with more people my age and this wouldn't really be helping things.  I agree that it's important to me because I'm not naturally the most outgoing person so if I didn't meet friends or girls at school I probably wouldn't see them otherwise.

5abg20,6,2016-10-31,I'm likely to lose an opportunity because of my anxiety and self esteem. I need some advice.,alt-f4-minded,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/5abg20/im_likely_to_lose_an_opportunity_because_of_my/,"I'm interning at a call center as an analyst, but my anxiety is getting in the way. My assignment is up in a month. It was originally supposed to be in August but they extended me through the fall semester. However, before I knew I was extended, i had to present on my internship. They asked what my future plans were. I said I was looking into manufacturing experience because I figured I was on my way out. After all, the other interns from other depts knew they'd be sticking around at least a week prior.

 Fast forward to now. One of my co-workers has the ability to disarm my anxiety to a large degree. I can joke with her, let her knew my worries, ask her all my dumb questions, etc. She thinks I do good work, but I feel like she's the only one I work with who knows what I do. She touts me to the manager, but I fly under the radar. As I'm sure many here can relate, I'm a master of self deprecation...self promotion, not so much. I haven't had a significant conversation with my boss since my extension. Everyone is friendly with each other, but I am too shy to talk to them. I usually go straight to my cube and work all day without interacting with anyone.

The other day, my confidant asked me if I wanted to stay on. She believes my manager thinks I'm uninterested because of what I said in my presentation about manufacturing experience. Really, I didn't know what I wanted to do. Partly, I was trying to soften the blow of rejection if I didn't get that extension through December.

She told me to try to meet with my manager to let him know I am interested in staying on, but i don't know how to approach the subject. I'm considering just laying my anxiety out on the table to hopefully explain the way I am. I feel like that might open the door as I make myself vulnerable. Then again, that door could slam shut. My boss does seem to care about his employees. He goes out of his way for his team, but I see where my being aloof comes off as divested from the business. Maybe getting this gorilla off my back will help us both open up the conversation and let him know where I'm coming from.

What do you all think? Should I open up about my anxiety, or is that unprofessional? Should I keep my anxiety secret and just let him know I've learned a lot about the biz in the last couple of months that I want to stick around? Have you been in a similar instance? If so, what did you do and how did it turn out?"

1. I applied for an internship at a consultancy, and had a call with the recruiter. She seemed impressed by my skills and experience and following the call, sent an email through saying it was great to speak and she would update me on the next steps in 2 weeks.

2. 2 weeks later, nothing. No follow call and no email updating where I am. I sent her a polite email just to chase her up on it.

3. A week later and still no reply, so I decide to ring up the company, explain the situation and the receptionist said she'll nudge the recruiter to get back to me.

4. 5 days later since I called to check up, there's still been no response.

So here's the dilemma, do I send her another email to the recruiter? I've chased and tried to be patient but it just seems so strange that she hasn't got back to me. And if it was a rejection, then surely she could have replied to my previous emails stating this?

I'm left in a weird limbo at the moment, so any advice on the steps would be appreciated.

GRE 1: 149Q/163V

GRE 2: 155Q/161V


School: Big 10 School in the Midwest- Think Ohio State, Michigan State, Wisconsin-Madison, etc.

Major: International Relations with a focus on Asia


- 3.2 GPA - really messed up my first two years as I had no idea what I was doing, came from a super shitty school and area (high violence/terrible academics), and had serious health issues, but I pulled up my GPA from 2.0 and Academic Probation to 3.2 by doing really well in my final years. I was able to ace all of my econ classes (7) save one where I got a B. I think I only took one math class, Calc, during college. I failed it the first time but retook it and passed with a B the second time.


Work experience:

- 4-5 Years Out of School (2012 Grad)
- Top Foreign Policy Think Tank (e.g. Brookings, Council on Foreign Relations, CSIS, American Enterprise Institute, etc.) the last 4 years working on a variety of foreign and some domestic policy issues (nothing social though) with policymakers across the spectrum
- Promoted 3 times in less than 4 Years
- I've also worked on diversity programs in international relations a lot over the last four years
- Half Year Internship at U.S. Embassy in Asia working on Trade Promotion
- Half Year Internship working in Parliament of Western European Country on Economic Issues
- Half Year Internship working on Health Market Public-Private Sector Programming
- Study Abroad: Japan for a Year (I speak Japanese pretty well)/UK for Half a Year (studying economics)


Extra curriculars:

- I volunteered in college a bit with low-income students, minorities entering college that needed extra help, etc. but haven't done anything significant since graduating


Goal of MBA:

- I would like to use the business skills and knowledge gained from an MBA (as well as OCR opportunities) to enter the rotational program at a multinational conglomerate such as Johnson &amp; Johnson, GE, or P&amp;G. I would work at the company for a few years then go into international trade policy on the Hill, within the current administration, or at a nonprofit. The ultimate goal is to work on these issues at a high level within my home state in the MidWest and Washington, DC, helping to combat some of the effects that have occurred with the hollowing out of the Rust Belt.

- I want to also apply to policy schools to learn more regarding the policy side of these aspects as I feel they go hand-in-hand in so many ways. There are also many great joint/dual degree programs out there.


Target schools:

- MBA - ???

- Policy - Harvard Kennedy/Tufts Fletcher/Georgetown SFS


I'm a little lost here. I want to aim high but I know my GRE and GPA are nonstarters at most top schools. I know however that I can get into a top policy school as many of my colleagues with similar stats have gotten into the aforementioned schools.


Something such as Stanford's US MBA Fellowship is EXACTLY what I want to do, it hits every single point of my background/career goals, but I know that I have a snowball's chance in Hell of ever getting in.


I studied so long (~100+ hours) to raise my quant score for the GRE, but I'm afraid that what I never learned as a youngin (there was a lot of material on the test that I had never seen in my life) has forever inhibited my ability to get a higher score. I never studied for the verbal (was actually scoring higher during practice tests).


Where should I aim? What should I do?


I was thinking that if I could get into a top policy school, such as Kennedy, that I might be able to use that to leverage my way into a top MBA and dual-degree. Is that realistic?

I don't think I want to work as a software developer but an internship in that area wouldn't be so bad and plus, that's what most companies hiring are looking for. However, I'm more interested in net security. I'm currently reading a book titled, The Art of Exploitation by Jon Erickson and attended a couple of CSG club meetings. So it's not llike I'm not doing anything to prepare myself. I just feel like I'm falling behind compare to others. 
Back to my original question, what are my chances of landing an internship with a low GPA? Worst case scenario a 2.0 GPA.

**tl;dr** I think I might end up with a low GPA(over 2.0) this semester and I plan to start applying for internship next semester. Will it be that hard getting companies to hire me with this GPA, no experience, and no personal projects?

**EDIT** Thanks y'all for the advice. :)"
5ad908,1,2016-10-31,International student finding internship in the US - Is it too late?,coriandres,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5ad908/international_student_finding_internship_in_the/,"I'm currently a junior, double majoring in CS and linguistics in a somewhat well-known college in the US. I am knowledgeable in several languages (Java, HTML, CSS, C, JavaScript, Ruby), but I'm only confident in my skills in Java. I've worked as a web developer over the summer this year, and got pretty interested in front-end web development. But I don't have any personal project because I am already putting all of my effort in maintaining my current academic status. At this point, I just don't think I am qualified to get an internship in America, since I've heard that international students needs to be outstanding in both their academics/extracurricular achievements in order to land an internship that's willing to sponsor them. I've been looking around to apply and it's either I'm not (or at least I don't feel that I'm) qualified enough to apply to large enough companies that will sponsor me, or international students are not eligible to apply.

Any advice would be appreciated. I'm pretty lost at what path I should be taking, and whether to start finding internship back in my home country instead, and give up trying to settle in the US in the future."

They asked me several technical questions for proof of my technical knowledge. And I'll be blunt my answers were horrible and there were 2 that I didn't know the answer to. Nonetheless, I left feeling horrible and embarrassed. This entire weekend I kept thinking about how I could of done better. This morning I received an email informing me that I passed there interview process and they are inviting me to a new hire orientation. I'll be honest I'm surprised by the news and feel unqualified and little confused as to why they chose to accept me into their program. I feel that this won't go well and that I'm not meant for this. My confidence after the interview was non-existent. It's a good opportunity for me but I don't feel happy or proud. In fact I feel worse now. I literally cannot process the fact that i got accepted. Could it be lack of candidates who applied or what?"

I just wanted some input from you knowledgeable folks on the personal projects section of my resume. I've decided to list 4 (the ones i consider significant)of the projects I've undertook in the last few months. I would like your perspective, as a recruiter/ experienced engineer. Thank you guys in advance. 

Connected lighting: An internet accessible platform to control household lighting. Platform includes hardware (microchip low power microcontroller with ESP8266 WiFi module and dimming hardware), and software interface to access different sectors. Hardware can deal with traditional incandescent as well as LEDs.

IOT Doorbell: Smart doorbell capable of sending a text message or email when someone rings it. System is an add-on to any traditional mechanical doorbell and is capable of surviving on batteries for 18 months. Uses Atmel mico with ESP8266 module. 

RFID garage Door: Add-on system that works with any garage door (with small modifications), making it operable with a RFID tag as a key. System maintains a log of operations and uses encryption to prevent modification and stealing of keys. Future additions for the project includes addition of NFC capability to eliminate passive card in favor of smartphones.

High Precision Bench Multimeter:

(Under development) High precision bench multimeter capable of measuring 25v – 0.5µV and 500mA – 0.5µA with 2 samples per second low error mode (~ 0.05%) and 15 samples per second graph mode (~0.1%.) Software can display either single values or a time-based graph. Uses a microchip microcontroller in conjunction with raspberry pi for data processing and Analog devices 24-bit ADC and low noise op-amp for data acquisition. Basic hardware for project has been completed, currently working with a university professor to reduce noise in circuit and provide adequate accuracy. This project was born out of necessity, I could not afford buying a bench multimeter for my lab (the ones in my price range had very high burden voltage.)"

I recently started working at a large semiconductor company, but the position is validation of their chips. Since my interests stem with software development, I would prefer working exclusively with software. However, my current position has some perks. I still program (Python scripts, SystemVerilog) and my manager has stated he will extend the offer until I graduate as long as I perform well. I plan on working in my position until the end of the school year, but if I receive a software development internship for summer 2017 I will most likely take it. How should I approach my manager (after some months have passed) to state my interest in interning with a different group that works more on the software side of things? 

If I shouldn't approach my manager to talk about something of this nature, is it necessarily an advantage in applying for software positions in the same company given that I currently work in the company?"

Obviously any job is better than no job, but I'm worried if I can't get a job at a place whose name will boost my resume soon after I graduate then I would have kinda wasted the advantage I have going to a top CS school, because after a while work experience matters a lot more.

5af800,2,2016-10-31,I got my dream job. Now it's not working out and it might be for the best. What do I do from here?,thingsarechanging,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/5af800/i_got_my_dream_job_now_its_not_working_out_and_it/,"Throwaway and vague details because my field is specific, close-knit and I may be too easily identified otherwise. I hope this is OK.

I dreamed of having the career I have now literally my entire life. I saw it once in kindergarten and never thought of doing anything else. Even my superlative in high school was ""Most likely to be a ____."" So the fact that I am where I am now is a big deal. I had to have a B.S. degree and currently carry a couple of years of volunteer experience, a few years paid intern experience, and now a year of paid experience. The field is also extremely, EXTREMELY competitive, even for unpaid internships. 

I was hired where I am after interning for them for nearly a year. The internship was paid, but not much. I later learned that I was able to intern for so long because they were short staffed. My workplace has a very strongly negative reputation in my industry. When I announced that I got my internship, I was pulled aside by 3 different very well respected figures in this industry and told *do not go*. One of them begged me not to do this to myself, said he cried while he worked there, that I would hate it, it was very tough, etc. Me being me, I recognize that the BEST figures in our industry all started here and if I wanted to also be the best, I too needed to be here. If it was a hellish bootcamp, then so be it. I'm very tough, I've survived a lot, I can do it. And so I did.

What I learned, though, is that it is not ""tough"" because of high standards or expectations like I would have hoped. Maybe it was 20, 30 years ago. It is ""tough"" because the people can be awful to each other and it's totally unchecked. Example. I was bullied relentlessly by another employee while I was an intern. She was nasty and cruel to all of us interns, but incredibly sweet to her coworkers. Once, she was berating me for wearing a particular outfit she said wasn't OK and forcing me to change into a much hotter outfit when I would be sitting out in the sun, and another employee walked in. Second employee questioned what the hell was going on, reversed her decision and stood by me. Her reign ended when we all got together and told another employee - not a boss, not HR. There is no ""open door policy"" and no system in place for employee conduct, so the situation was handled very informally and would have otherwise continued forever.

Anyway. I get hired. I worked in one area for a couple of months, busting my ass to try and get ahead but was provided with little to no direction on what to do. We have a document on the computer we fill out to track our progress, but no direction on how to work on some of those things. When I would try to work on things that required the participation of my bosses, I was blown off or told we'd do it another day. Some days I'd be told that I could sit down with my bosses and do this assessment or go over that test, and then they'd apologize and say they actually couldn't do it that day, but would get to it. Most of my coworkers were extremely upset for me and did what they could to support me, some of them were not supportive and were happy to let me shoulder all the grunt work since there was not much else I was authorized to do. There was one who was very nasty to me when she was training me and again, I did not speak up. I should have. A few months in, I'm on the verge of quitting as I am firmly stagnant and unhappy.

Eventually I am moved to another department, with the bosses admitting that I was hired at a bad time and that they didn't have the resources to train me in that area etc. So I move over and settle in. This is a department I know better. Things went smoothly at first, however, the dynamic here is different. My teammates are not wholly supportive. Some of them are VERY nasty and underhanded. They use tactics to stop me from doing things I *need* to do to advance. I shoulder much more grunt work here and receive venom from every level of the hierarchy when I cannot or should not due to working on tasks I need to advance myself. For example, I tell a senior person I cannot do the schedule they have written for me for the day as most of it happens at the same time - is physically *not possible* - and am told by that person, ""too bad. deal with it. make it work."" etc. One person in particular likes to erase me off of things I have scheduled for myself and I have to confront them about it. Or they'll use all of the supplies I need for another task I'm supposed to be advancing on and then go ""Oh. Oops. Guess you can't do that now. Sooorrryyy! Maybe tomorrow."" Etc. 

Another thing that happens is criteria for being officially signed off and done with learning a task changing after I've finished what is asked of me. So basically, I'll be told by my mentor for that item, ""I need to see you do A, B and C and I'll sign you off."" I learn and do A, B and C. Then they say, ""Okay. Now I need to see A, B, C, and D and I need to see it X more times."" Thus drawing out the process. 

We have also had several events which take up most of my day as I am expected to shoulder the work. Not unexpected, I would say, being the lowest rung on the ladder. For example, a piece of equipment broke. Every day for three months, many very heavy items had to be moved by hand across our workplace as a result instead of being kept in our location. I was often assigned to this task. It would eat up, at minimum, an hour of my day if not more. It was also very much against regulations. This is just one of a few things that ate much of my day up.

I have also been trained incorrectly on things. I've been scolded but always pointed out that I am doing what I am taught to do. A few of my coworkers in this area simply do not care about doing things the correct way on a pretty regular basis and sometimes I am scrambling to pick up the slack that's left as a result.

My boss has encouraged me to stand up for myself, and I have. However I was recently sat down by her and her boss and told that they have chosen a date for the end of my employment with the company, in a couple of months. I am technically employed on a seasonal basis but will be at a year of employment. Their reasoning for getting rid of me is that I have not advanced far enough in my learning and training of certain tasks to justify keeping me. Mind, I have gotten far and I excel at what I am done with. But the things that I have not completed are the things my coworkers hold me back on or that have not been trained correctly in the first place. Our highest boss said during this meeting that their decision may change and that nothing is set in stone. So they may still decide to make me a permanent staff member. My immediate boss made it clear to me that the issues I'm having are not to be held against me but she needs to see me fighting for it, and that I need to come to her. So I have. I was recently trained incorrectly on something very important and could not be signed off on it as a result. I went straight to her and expressed my frustration. She told me, ""Then you need to find someone you trust to train you."" I have also never received a review of any kind while employed. No 30, 60 or 90 day or anything like that. 

Here's where I am now. I'm frustrated. I'm scared. I fought very, very hard to be where I am today. I had to make excellent grades in school (internships want transcripts), I had to pass physical tests, I've worked my tail off every step of the way and always gotten high praise and great marks. Now I'm being told that my time is going to be over and not on my own terms and I feel as though the shortcomings of others plays a *huge* role in where I am stuck right now. I'm really angry about it and having trouble coping with the news. 

On the other hand, I don't know if it's all bad. Would I stay? Yes. I want to work more closely with my bosses in improving the workplace and its training, I want to continue advancing even though it's hard because I do excel when given the chance. Our interns love me to death and I love teaching them. The other departments love me as well. Another year of paid experience under my belt, especially at this place, would get me in at just about any other facility in this industry very easily although I would have liked to remain at this place for my entire career. But the reality is that I'm paid very little for someone who does a specialized and dangerous job. I still have to work a second job to scrape by even though I'm full time (and yes I live that r/frugal lifestyle.) My workplace is obviously toxic and more stressful than it needs to be. I don't think ""Find someone you trust to train you"" is EVER an acceptable answer. EVER. I think every person senior to me should be held to a standard that makes them someone I can trust to train me. Their way of doing things is clearly very broken and I don't know if there is anything I can or should do about it.

That leaves me very firmly stuck on what to do. I am fighting to prove myself and stay. I have a lease until the end of May. My parents live only a few hours away, so it wouldn't be a huge deal to up and go, though I think I would like to stay until my lease is up, even if it means working an unrelated job (would be very easy to find something retail at the same pay rate.) But, I also am working on limited time. I have an autoimmune disease and may not always be in the shape I need to be in to get a job in this field. I do have a hire status at my last place, but it won't be doing exactly what I want to do. It would be doing something else - however they are a great company and they very much wanted me to stay. My degree is also STEM so I could continue my education or do something with that.

I really am stuck and could use some guidance. I keep bouncing back and forth between angry, frustrated grieving and intense planning and I fear my overall anxiety is going to drive me to some poor choices. I just know I am good at what I do but it's such a hard field to get into that I may be done with it whether I like it or not. Help! "
