The Day Everything Changed
 Richard Humphries

It wasn’t good news, that’s for sure, when my big jolly Irish nurse came back to the hospital room. With an unwanted Intern. A dour and intense, dark-eyed Intern who sat on the foot of my bed while the now un-jolly nurse turned down the volume on the television. She had tears in her eyes. Shit.
“Well, it doesn’t look like good news,” I tried.
His words in reply were fast and breathy.
“It isn’t good news, Mister Humphries. It isn’t good at all.” He said it as if he was angry but we three knew it was pretense. “The tests came back and the pathology report says the growth on your pancreas is a carcinoma.”
“That means cancer, doesn’t it?”
“Yes. Cancer.”
“I have pancreatic cancer?”
“Yes, you do.”
“Fuck.”
“You have pancreatic cancer.” He needed the practice of saying these things to patients.
“Sorry, Nurse, about the swearing.”
“That’s okay. Really. Really.”
My vision narrowed to a tight tunnel while my mind insisted I was watching a movie, or in some horrible joke, or the victim of a mistake in the lab. The wrong slide with some other guy’s name that sounded like mine. It couldn’t be. It just could not be. Not me. I had things to do. Plans. At least one great novel to write.
“Isn’t that the kind of cancer that kills you in, like, three months?”
“At the stage you’re at, we generally say three to six months until . . .”
“Until I die? What ‘stage’ am I at?”
“Stage Four. “
“How many stages are there?” I was hoping there were a great many.
“Four.”
“Fuck.”
“It’s advanced.” The Intern stood from my bed, straightening his white coat, making his escape.
“Would you like us to send the Chaplain?” She was Irish to the core.
“Yes. Please. Send the Chaplain. I won’t swear at him. Promise.”
“I’m sure it would be fine if you did. We’ll have him come up.”
“Thank you,” I said. I can’t imagine what for.
They both took it as an excuse to vamoose, however, and I was suddenly very and completely alone. Alone. Alone and scared.
This happened twenty-one months ago.
I still get scared about disappearing from this world soon—dying and being put in a box or burnt to ash– and so had to write this book. It isn’t a ‘cancer’ book or self-help, but rather the kind of sexy/funny murder mysteries I tore through in my youth. Kind of a way for me to be around once I am gone.
I’m now working on book #2.
I never did see the goddamn Chaplain.""

aeddn,3,2009-12-14,"I am currently living in the U.S. and I have become an ""illegal"" immigrant. (Expired passport, came here on a temporary Visa). I am a mechanical engineering student with high aspirations. If you have any legal expertise please give me some insight on my options.",importantquestion,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/aeddn/i_am_currently_living_in_the_us_and_i_have_become/,"Greetings Reddit!

I have been battling with this problem by myself for a while but it has not affected my life drastically until now. I need advice and any information I can get. I feel as if my dreams and goals are getting further and further out of my reach. Here is my story (kind of lengthy but necessary) 

Let me start from the beginning.

I moved to the U.S. with my family when I was around six. We came legally on a temporary Visa, trying to get a break from some political pressure my mom was going through. She worked as an accountant for the Mexican government, some embezzlement ordeal began, and they tried to frame her / pull her into the mess. The issue never settled so we decided to stay in the U.S. for a bit, hoping to be able to relocate to another country (Spain) by selling all our properties and withdrawing our savings. It ended up that our savings had been locked as part of an investigation and all we had left were a few houses my mom owned. After selling the properties, we arranged to transfer the money here little by little (10,000-dollar cap for transferring money). Long story short we were not able to transfer enough money to relocate.

All this happened pre-9/11, so immigration laws were not so strict. 

My family decided to start a new life here in the U.S. My mother and father both were very successful in Mexico but had to resort to cleaning houses in order to get by. My family of six lived in one room in my uncle’s house for a few years. My sisters and I began to attend elementary school here while my parents continued to clean houses. My dad also jumped around as a handy man; pool clear, painter, truck driver, etc. (Pretty much anything he could do to make money). My mother worked magic with money so we were able to finally get our own apartment after almost 3 years of living in one room. (mind you, still only a 2 bedroom) With the help and good will of some of the most amazing people in our lives, we finally were able to rent a house. Again, my mother worked our numbers right and we were able to buy a house years later after a few loans from friends. We are now very stable and have come a long way from where we were. We own a home, 3 cars, and lived relatively well. (small house, standard cars, and we at least have food) We have always been a very humble family and do not have luxuries of awesome Christmas/birthday/graduation gifts, vacations, etc. Our income is around 15,000 a year. Nevertheless, we enjoy life. 

My siblings and I have always excelled in school and in our passions. I am bilingual, (no accent in English, accent when speaking Spanish), straight A student, and have many accomplishments to my name. I have excelled in robotics competitions, winning a few world championship titles when I was younger. Love working out and am an athlete (varsity swimming and wrestling). Enjoy music (symphonic band, marching band, jazz band, know how to play trombone, baritone, flute, guitar, and love drumming) Certified computer technician, enjoy programming/web design. I could keep going (not gloating) but basically, I am an all around person who enjoys learning new things and mastering what I focus on. 

Since I was little my dream was to become a Mechanical Engineer. I worked hard in school to accomplish my goal. I also have my own little workshop in our garage where I take on projects from time to time. Currently working on ""green"" a four-seater quad cycle project with the help a few friends.


Here's the problem
	

 I am currently in college studying mechanical engineering. I am on a full ride thanks to various private scholarships I was able to obtain. As you can figure my parents cannot pay for school, and since I have no legal status I cannot get financial aid. The only reason I was admitted into college in the first place was because of a new bill that was passed: House Bill 1403. Before this bill was passed, I was in a deep depression knowing all my hard work had gone to waste. 	When you are a kid, these restrictions do not affect you too much. However, when you grow older and realize you cannot get a driver's license like your friends, you cannot get a ""real"" job. You CANNOT apply to the school of your dreams even though you are qualified. That you MUST lie to people close to you (friends) about why you cannot drive nor do certain things that are usually not an issue. These things all hit me during my high school years. I pushed through regardless and excelled hoping that a new development would give me opportunities. 
	
 As a college student, I am very involved, and many doors are opening for me. Unfortunately, I am in a very stressful position. I have been offered/applied/accepted to a few internships. I have also been offered to go to a few conferences related to school, along with job offers. I would love nothing more than to be able to have these experiences but I cannot. Since I have no legal status, I do not have a federal I.D. to allow me to fly to these locations. I would use my passport, but it is expired. I would renew it but I cannot go back to Mexico without having to physically return. If I did that, I would not be able to come back into the U.S.
 Things are getting tough without the proper paper work. After I turned 18, a lot of pressure was set on me. I take the bus to school in the mornings when I cannot get a ride from my dad or a friend. I used to drive but sold my car after I was re-ended and went through a horrible experience dealing with the law. (realized just how quickly everything could dismantle even if someone else caused the accident- deportation)


I have looked into a lot of law in order to be able to find something that may be able to help me, but my efforts have been futile. My parents were able to gained residency / SSN # after my oldest sister got married and applied for them. (Took about 5 years, even with a few connections). They have applied for me but the process will still take about 8 years at least.


If I could somehow obtain a legitimate federal ID than I could apply for a TIN (taxpayer identification number). Which would allow me to get a job and fulfill my true potential.

Please help me. I live in Texas. If you need any more information PM me but remember, I can only disclose so much information.

-- this is of course a throw away account.

agulo,6,2009-12-20,I'm an atheist and i have to write 3 pages about my Jewish experience and emotional connection for an internship. I can't do it.,trogdor1134,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/agulo/im_an_atheist_and_i_have_to_write_3_pages_about/,"I was born with jewish parents, but i quickly became atheist.  I hate everything about our jewish community and my jewish experience, but now my mother has found me an internship through a jewish organization and i has to write 3 pages all about my wonderful jewish experience and how it helps me in life and AAARRRRGH. i can't do this.

I probably jst man up and B.S. my way through this, but i feel like i can't. I can't sell out like that.

**EDIT:** here's what i've writen.  i think i'll have to start over.

I grew up in an extremely Jewish environment, where being Jewish put you in the majority.  My family was reformed, but my great grandmother was orthodox and my uncle Gregg kept kosher in his household.  This put me in a little Jewish bubble.  I can’t say I minded this little bubble for a few years.  If everyone is like you, then what is there to hate, right?  Of course being from Beachwood, I and all others that would eventually make it off to college would be told numerous times that “This isn’t the real world” and “People might not like you just because you’re Jewish” or even “Some people will think you have horns,” but it appears that I’m jumping the gun a bit in my biography.  


From a very early age I had a connection to the Greater Cleveland Area.  I remember one of my first baseball games.  When we got past a certain street we would lock our car doors.  I loved that sense of “tiers of civility.”  After a certain street, those who lingered in that bubble were worse people, evil people, who would like nothing more than to car-jack a mother, father, and two little children’s car for no reason.  Cleveland is predominantly Christian, so I was given the sense that outside of the Jewish bubble of Beachwood were terrible Christian people.  It was an interesting blend to say the least.  


From that point on, I knew that Cleveland was nothing more than a cesspool of crime and grime with nothing beneficial or worthwhile to come out of going there, especially in an unlocked car.  As for the suburbs of Cleveland, I never bothered to know any of the other children from cities such as Orange and Mayfield and so on.  I met them a bit while I was playing Middle School soccer, but that meeting consisted of me picking out a fat kid to guard and dribble past so I wouldn’t have to put much effort into the game.  Beyond this I never cared for and never will bother with the Greater Cleveland Area.


So anyway let’s hop back on the topic of Judaism.   I remember in 9th grade being told the story of Martin Luther and the protestant movement in Christianity.  Now I know this wasn’t the only reason for the separation, but the people were frustrated with the fact that mass was held all in Latin.  You see, there was already colloquial English and at that point no one understood Latin except the priests for obvious reasons.  So the people sat in church listening to a bunch of gibberish for an hour or so and then left feeling somehow hollow and unfulfilled.  How can they show interest and passion for something they know nothing about?  They can’t.  So what have I done for the past 18 years?  I’ve sat through a bunch of Hebrew gibberish for a few hours every service and then leave dissatisfied.  Sure they tried to teach me how to read Hebrew in Hebrew School, but then never taught me what it means.  What good is a language that you can read but don’t understand the meaning of what you read?  Right now you feel as though I have once again gone on a tangent and need to focus, but patience is something that I have grown to appreciate and so should others.  The point I’m making is that I felt like Martin Luther.  I needed to separate myself from this ignorant system.  I however broke off in a different manner.  I became an Atheist.  I first defined myself as thus in about 8th grade.  That means I wasted about 13 years with religion, just long enough for a Bar Mitzvah.  I’ve grown to despise the thought of god and I’ve come to understand the great amount of ignorance floating around in this world, and refuse to take part.


So why on earth would I apply to a Jewish internship?  Well, you’re going to pay me.  I hate jobs for the youth.  They consist of stocking and cleaning things.  That’s it.  So if I can get 2500 bucks and not need to work at a two-bit restaurant, I’ll do it.  The main reason however is because my family is Jewish and thus they found this internship, not me.  They are practically forcing me to apply, and thus I write these ramblings.  I hope you appreciate the 20 minutes I put in to write for your little Internship.  I don’t expect that I’ll hear from you.


**EDIT: Alright, I completely rewrote the essay in a formal and kind manner.  I don't think i'll post it here in case they find it here somehow and see this magnificent piece of writing above.**

**I wrote the truth, just simply not in it's entirety.  My new essay paints me out to be the perfect Jewish child that just can't wait to get this wonderful internship.  I feel dirty.**"
