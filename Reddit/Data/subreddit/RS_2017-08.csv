I originally planned on going to dental school or something, anything medical related. But I have now realized I am not interested in the time consuming route to become a dentist or even a doctor. I don't have the motivation or even passion to do something in the related medical field. So, I have been thinking of a change in careers, to something IT and computer related. I tried applying to multiple Internships as a QA and data scientist, but since I have zero background in this field I did not hear back from anyone. What do you guys think I should do? How can I land an internship because I think hands on experience learning something new would be really helpful instead of struggling to teach myself something I know nothing about. I've been super depressed and I feel so lost. Any suggestion on what my first step should be will really help me try to achieve something."

I need advice. I just began the program this summer and only have CS161 under my belt. In less than two weeks, an internship I've been working this summer (unrelated to CS) is coming to an end. My job prior to this was in food service/retail which I've been doing for 7 years (please don't make me go back.)

I joined this program after finishing a teacher credential program and realizing that teaching wasn't really the right job for me, or at least teaching chemistry. I've got an interview coming up for a position as a Computer Science teacher, which I actually think could be fun. The issue is, I want to see this program through, and during my student teaching I was putting in 60-80 hours a week just for the two classes I was teaching in addition to working food on the weekends. I'm worried that if the position is just as demanding I won't be able to do the classes and I'll be stuck in a contract. 

With the workload being a gamble, should I take the position?"
6qtket,474,2017-07-31,What I found in the Ashland Police Department's evidence locker,professionalsuccubus,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6qtket/what_i_found_in_the_ashland_police_departments/,"In my senior year of college – this would have been in ’93 – my degree required an internship. Luckily, the local police department had a friendly relationship with the criminal justice faculty at my school. It was easy for me to nab a position in my fall semester, and most of the cops seemed like they enjoyed showcasing their expertise to a newbie. I enjoyed a couple weeks of ride-alongs and tours of the headquarters, but soon I felt like I’d gotten the gist of it, to be honest. This was a college town in rural Illinois, so it was basically drunk kids, meth cooks, meth users, and traffic tickets. Sprinkle on some bar fights, shoplifting, and domestic violence, and you had Ashland figured out.


My internship was made even better by my cousin, Frank, an Ashland cop, who saw to it that I wasn’t bored. He would show me which parts of town to avoid, tell me some of his “war stories”, and once, when we were patrolling late at night, he sped down a stretch of road while blasting the theme song from “Cops”.


It’s been long enough, so I’m not worried about getting myself or Frank in trouble now. He left the force in 2007 and has been working happily in private security ever since. I ended up staying on the academic track and am similarly unconcerned about getting in trouble for something I did over two decades ago.


The thing I shouldn’t have done was photocopy police evidence without permission and keep it. I still have the copies - one letter and some journal pages - sitting right next to me as I type this. I had forgotten about it, until I read my email this morning and saw a message from Frank. Then I went to the basement, where I kept all the nostalgic junk from my adolescence and early adulthood, and started digging through boxes.


I can’t explain why I kept those pages for so long. The shock value alone is probably a sufficient enough explanation, but there was something else...some sentimentality or something. The woman who wrote them is gone and has no family, and some part of me hated the thought of her existence winking out of memory, like a dying star. 


The night I copied the evidence was a Friday. I was scheduled to be at the police department from 4:00 PM to midnight. Frank was working, so he scooped me up, and we set out in his squad car. A couple speeding tickets, a wellness check, and one sub sandwich later, the sun was setting. Frank turned around in a cul-de-sac to begin patrolling his sector again. Navigating the winding neighborhoods, he slowed as we passed one block.


“Has anyone told you about the *murder* that happened over here?” he said with dramatic intonation.


My interest was piqued. In three weeks of shadowing, one noticeably absent part of this internship was the regaling of famous local crimes. Tempted by the prospect of an eerie tale to usher in the fall evening, I told him I hadn’t.


Frank pointed to one of the homes, a small farmhouse with a wraparound porch. Its white paint was peeling, and although it looked small, it had a second story with a large balcony.


“So, in the 80s, a lady named Alice Weiss lived in that house. A guy named Colton lived over there.” He pointed to the powder blue house next door. It was in better shape than the white house, but it still looked pretty run-down. The vinyl siding was dirty. Unkempt vines choked the porch’s latticework.  Unlike the rest of the homes in the neighborhood, this one still had a gravel driveway, peppered with tufts of weeds.


“Then around Thanksgiving, cops get a call about gunshots coming from the Colton house. They show up and find Weiss on his front porch with her brains blown out and Colton inside in the same condition.


“What got people extra riled up is that Weiss had pentagram-shaped burns on both of her arms. Coroner said they were a decade old, at least. Colton’s body had pentagrams carved into his skin too, but they were fresh. It looked like Weiss did it before she killed him.”


“Well, this was right in the middle of all the 80s Satanic panic, right?” I said (secretly hoping Frank would think I was knowledgeable).


“Right,” he said absently. “But that bullshit cropped up all across the country, and there were plenty of alleged cases without any real evidence to back up the accusations. Here, we had a case with flesh-and-blood victims, one of which had Satanic markings on her body predating that whole fiasco.”


“Fair enough,” I replied.


Frank made a right at the stop sign and continued through the neighborhood. “That’s kind of the end of the story, unfortunately. Weiss had been mentally ill for most of her life and people were exactly as understanding as you’d think. Everybody assumed she was just a crazy woman who worshiped the Devil because that’s what crazy people do, and when that wasn’t enough, she murdered her neighbor.”


I mulled over his words as a silence overtook the cruiser.


Frank broke the quiet a few minutes later, when we emerged out on the main road. “And as much as people tried to forget it happened, the Weiss case just stuck with people. Colton had been her neighbor since she was born, known her family, known her grandparents. They lived next to each other for over thirty years, and then one day out of the blue, she just murders him and offs herself –”


A tinny voice on Frank’s walkie interrupted him. Dispatch needed an officer to come back to the station and help with an emergency ex parte order.


When we got there, a distraught woman with a black eye was sitting in the lobby, rapidly tapping her foot against the tiles. Frank gave me a knowing look and told me to go find Sergeant Tate; he would come get me when he was done writing the report.


The Ashland Police Department was clearing out old files to be moved to off-site storage, and today it was Sergeant Tate’s problem. I helped him move box after box, looking longingly at some of the files. After thirty minutes, the sergeant told me in a low voice he was going out back for a smoke. On his way out, he called out over his shoulder in a teasing voice, “No peeking, now.”


Offering him an empty promise not to, I stood obediently until I heard the door shut behind him. Then I went to work. I rifled through every box, content to read a little here and there, but at the front of my mind was the story Frank had told me less than an hour before. After a few minutes of unstacking boxes and hectic shuffling, I hadn’t found any files from before 1979. The excitement I’d felt gave way to resignation. I wouldn’t be finding anything on Alice Weiss in here.
 

Nevertheless, I continued to look through the old files, though at a slower pace. There was still a chance I might find something. Plus, I reasoned that I might as well look while I had the time. My instincts ended up proving correct. My heart rate quickened once I started to see dates from 1980, then 1981. I kept going until, in a box of files from 1984, I saw it. One manila folder bore the label: “010111785--009   WEISS HOUSE”. I glanced around and pulled it out of the box.


The folder contained only a letter and a small journal, both bagged. Automatically, I threw it back in the box and carried the whole thing to the adjacent corner, where there was a small desk, a file cabinet, and a copier. I peered out the door frame, saw nothing, heard nothing. I cracked the photocopier cover and slid the letter, still in its plastic, underneath, and hit “Start”. The machine whirred to life, and I whirled around and started to loudly re-stack some of the boxes. I knew Sergeant Tate smoked American Spirits, so I had a comfortable eight to ten minutes before he returned, and I’d used at least five searching the boxes.
 

The second the copier had finished, I put away the letter, maneuvered the journal open, and began on the first few pages of that. I had never felt so tense, and the compulsion to duplicate those documents was not one I could explain. I had started, and I barreled on to finish, feeling dread at both the potential for trouble and the prospect of not succeeding.
 

When the final page came out, I returned the journal to its box, folded up the papers, and shoved them into my small purse. Then, since I didn’t hear Sergeant Tate, I decided to re-arrange some of the boxes to hide my unexplainably desperate search. By the time he returned, smelling faintly of smoke and humming tunelessly, I had calmed down and resumed my normal work.


I finished my shift, intensely aware of the paper crammed in my bag. When I got back to my apartment, it was blissfully empty, the remnants of my roommates’ pre-party lying scattered around our living room. Hesitant to look at my spoils, I changed into pajamas and reheated some leftovers. I eyed my purse as I ate. Once the food was gone, I retrieved the wad of paper.


The evidence tag was blurry, but legible on the page beneath the writing. Dated 11/17/85, it referenced a case number and listed case type as “homicide/suicide”.


I read the one-page letter first. It was written on lined notebook paper in confident, swooping cursive. I’m transcribing it below:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*My name is Alice Weiss. I’m thirty-three. I still live in the house I was raised in. 3106 Birch Lane. I have been in and out of psychiatric care for over half of my life. Recently, my therapist and I have been doing some new things to try and get at some of my problems. Among other things, I’ve been having nightmares on and off for the past fifteen or sixteen years. I can’t glean anything useful from them. Just an unhelpful combination of darkness, candlelight, fear, pain, screaming, nausea.*


*So, after failed attempts at everything from cognitive-behavioral therapies to medication and dietary changes, she’s asked me to keep a dream diary. If I commit to writing down anything and everything I remember, she says I may understand a little more about what is actually happening in my dreams. The last few weeks, I’ve been writing down what I remember when the dreams wake me up in the middle of the night. I didn’t read any of the entries until earlier today. I was afraid of how it would all sound in the daylight.*


*It worked, but I don’t think this is what my therapist meant to happen. I remember where the burns came from it wasn’t something I did to myself like Momma told Dr. Colton I remember everything now and I’m going to kill that son of a bitch*

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The second item was a black notebook, one of the small, pocket-sized ones. The handwriting is barely recognizable, but the evidence tag says it was written by Alice and found in her house. The handwriting was a similar type of cursive, but the lines were bolder and narrower, like their author was stricken with urgency.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The day after my fifteenth birthday, Mr. Colton came over asking to borrow some sugar. Mr. Colton was my parents’ age but he lived with his elderly mother. Thus, he had acquired the label of “weird old man”, the kind of unspoken distrust that we kids felt towards unmarried adults. His eyes roved up and down my body as he asked. I thought this was the worst thing.*


*Before I could give him the sugar, he lunged at me, pressed a cloth over my mouth. When I woke up, I was blindfolded and bound at the wrists and ankles. I never found out where I was. I thought this was the worst thing.*


*I think I’m underground. I don’t know how long I’ve been here. Days, at least. The room I’m in is small, no windows. I don’t think it was built by professionals. The room seems to be hewn out of solid rock. There aren’t the reassuring right angles of newer construction.*


*Mostly men, but sometimes women, come and go, bringing me food and taking it away and bringing me a chamber pot and taking it away. I think they’re all different but it’s hard to tell. They don’t speak much and their hoods cover their faces. Sometimes they forget to bring me food and sometimes they forget to take the chamber pot away. I thought this was the worst thing.*


*I think they drug me quite often. A few times I’ve passed out suddenly, and when I wake up, my body hurts. Sometimes I have bruises and cuts without knowing where they came from. I thought this was the worst thing.*


*The drugging, passing out, waking up with injuries has been getting worse. This last time, I woke up with my forearms all bandaged up. Whatever’s underneath hurts, it burns and itches. I’m too tired to look. I thought this was the worst thing.*


*They feed me bread and water once a day. Once, I complained that I was still hungry. My keeper suggested I eat some of the roaches.  The candlelight twisted his grin into a cruel mosaic. I thought this was the worst thing.*


*I wake up to a new pain. My insides hurt...I don’t know what they’ve done to me this time. They treat me better now, so I try not to think about it. I get more food, candles, and a few extra blankets to sleep on. They’ve started posting someone outside my door at all times. The person is always humming something low and tuneless, like a Gregorian chant. I thought this was the worst thing.*


*Time passes. My belly swells. The bandages on my arms disappear one day. Two circles with a star inside. I might have been angry or upset about this once, but now I just don’t care much.*


*One night, I am ripped out of my sleep by a ripping pain coming from below. I scream into the tiny concrete room I am in. I keep screaming and screaming until they come. I don’t get any drugs this time. I feel split in half, before God and everyone, more opened and vulnerable than I have been this entire time. The pain is so bad I forget how much I hate Mr. Colton and his friends as they tend to me. I beg for them to kill me. It takes hours before the baby comes out. I thought this was the worst thing.*


*I rest, and they take the baby away. If this were one of Momma’s radio dramas, I would scream and cry more, rage until all of my energy is gone, demand to see my baby. But I don’t want to see it. I don’t want anything but my room, my school, old life back.*
 

*Today I hear footsteps approaching my prison. They tell me everything will be okay as long as I do one more thing.*

 
*The scream that erupts from my throat is louder than any noise I made with the baby. They bring me a platter with a tiny, frail human figure on it, the flesh charred and blackened.*
 

*They tell me to eat. This is the worst thing.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
So yeah. I was a little shaken after reading. Luckily, I still had ten weeks left in the internship. I was able to get a little more information out of Frank and some of the other cops, including some who had been around when the murder occurred.
 

One of them, Lieutenant Mueller, remembered some of the facts floating around in the aftermath of the deaths. Roughly forty years apart in age, Alice Weiss had lived next to her eventual victim, Randall Colton, for her entire life (excluding her hospitalizations). Doing my best to act like just another college kid intrigued by cheap gore and true crime, I mentioned Frank had spoken about pentagram burns on Alice.
 

“Her psychiatric records specifically acknowledged the burns, because they were the reason she was admitted to her first facility when she was a teenager,” he told me. “Her mother says she found the burns when the girl started wearing long sleeves, even in July. Weiss claimed she had no memory of where they came from...but, even as a teenager, her records *also* spoke to a history of depression, hallucinations, and self-harm.”

 
I brought it up again with Frank, a few weeks later. Specifically, when I was at lunch with Frank and one of the Ashland PD’s detectives. I can’t remember his name, unfortunately. I do remember Frank telling me he was a Chicago cop before moving to Ashland, which is why “he’s the only one who doesn’t get fazed by this stuff.”

 
My biggest question was the connection between Randall Colton and the Dr. Colton mentioned in Alice’s final letter, and the grizzled detective answered it without even realizing it.

 
“I get why people react so strongly to the Weiss thing,” he said, in between French fries. “You live right up next to people, sometimes for years, and they’re never a threat to you, and then suddenly they’re the worst kind of threat. And in small towns like this it affects people even more powerfully because you’re naturally more interconnected. Hell, we even found out in the course of that investigation that Randall Colton’s brother was a psychiatrist over at Marion South State Hospital and he treated Alice Weiss back in the sixties when she had her first breakdown.”
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
So that’s all, right? A young girl in a small town, stricken with poor health at an early age, in a time when mental health treatment was still young, struggling for years before ending it all in a terrible fashion. Time goes on, family homes empty and refill, case files get put in off-site storage, people forget.


The reason I dug out my copy of Alice’s last words were because – as mentioned earlier – Frank sent me a short email this morning, asking if I remembered about the murder house from my internship. He attached an article from the Ashland local news attached.


3104 Birch Lane - Randall Colton’s old house - burned to the ground yesterday. The tenants were making meth there, and the house exploded. Three people died.


Once the flames were out and emergency responders were able to properly investigate the scene, they found a crude sub-basement. Frank told me he’d heard from one of his old buddies that the room must have been decades old, constructed well before things like home inspections and building permits were a reality.


Through a hidden door carved out of the foundation, they found small hallway leading to a smaller room. I didn’t ask Frank if they found any pentagrams on the walls. I’m sure he would have told me if they had.


The way Frank put it in his email, “hacking into the ground like that, it’s a miracle the house didn’t collapse twenty years ago.”  


Although I know he didn’t mean to be ironic, I’m not sure “miracle” is the word I would [use.](https://www.reddit.com/r/professionalsuccubus/)"

I'm 20 and currently on my first year of software engineering at Sydney. Recently my mom has been aggressively pushing me to ""do something with my life"" because I'm always on the computer a lot. I am currently studying full-time, going to university 4 days a week, and am getting straight A's.

She always rants about a lot of things like, ""Why don't you find a job and be useful? You don't even need to study because you're so smart."". She also once recommended that I ""take a couple of years off university"" to go apply for her cousin's company, although I feel like she just wants me to drop university completely to work there.

Another one she always brings up is, ""Think of something and start a business."" or ""Why don't you figure out how to invest and do it and become the next Warren Buffett?"". She constantly talks about how her co-worker's children are actually doing useful things and I'm just sitting here doing nothing.

Everyday she would come home and start ranting about how useless I am and it's really starting to break me down. I really do quite agree with her, but I guess the main problem here is that I don't know where to start.

Should I be looking for a simple part-time job? (Would people even hire me even when I'm only free 3 days a week?)

Should I try to find an internship of some sort? (Paid or unpaid?) Although I believe that my university makes us do internships somewhere around the second or third year.

I've read about the very basics of investing, but honestly don't know how to start. I understand that time is on my side when it comes to this.

Is there anything at all that you may suggest that I could do given my situation?

I seriously appreciate any and all advice."

I am 8.5 weeks through a 10 week internship and I need some advice. I've already been paid the ten week salary from the internship yesterday, however last night I've noticed my left hand twitching.

So I am conflicted on whether I should call in sick due to a twitching in my hand? It has started last night and through a lot of research online I found that it is probably benign. However, I fear that it could be an underlying early symptom of something more serious such as carpal tunnel or ALS. 

However most of the time while reading about calling in sick, employers usually allow it to prevent a cold from spreading. But in my case it's to make sure I don't have an underlying serious neurological disease. So should I do it? I fear that this could be serious and if so I want to get it checked out asap.

One fear I have is my ""mentor"" in the program. He's told me on multiple occasions that he doesn't care about my life or what happens but just wants me to get my work done. So I don't know how he would react to this. However his boss, the director of my internship is very nice and doesn't like my mentor too much. I think she will be fine with this I guess.

I don't know. I feel that it is common sense as my health is my number one priority but what if it is benign? "

I've been here a little over a year. We are an agency mainly focused on Drupal with some WordPress thrown in. Personally I very much enjoy the front end side of things. I enjoy JavaScript a lot, but most of the work I do at work is just basic DOM manipulation and click events. Mostly using vanilla js or jquery. 

I try to keep up with more exciting front end technologies (react, etc), but as my responsibilities increase I find that I have much less time to explore new things, and I feel unmotivated to keep coding after I just spent 8 hours at work doing a bunch of drupal development. Nor do the use cases for the new front end frameworks lend themselves to what we do, it would be overkill. Right tool for the job etc. 

So my question is, would it be reasonable that in a year or so if I wanted to move to another role (more focused on product development vs churning out drupal wp sites) that I could land a job with my current skill set? I know there is definitely overlap, and I feel that I am developing a good foundation in vanilla js so picking up frameworks would hopefully be relatively simple. Or am I pigeonholing myself as a CMS developer? is the only way forward to still dedicate myself after work to keeping up?

I'm sorry this is long. I think it just got complicated. 

I'm a US citizen interning at a USA-based NGO's site in a third world country. I'm US born, but this is my country of ethnic heritage, and the one my parents immigrated from as adults. Uniquely, the NGO's local office and regional office share a building. One friend and I work for the local office, and one girl works for the regional office, let's call her Chloe.

* Over the weekend a few weeks ago some local NGO interns and I went to visit a local historic religious site. Mind you, Chloe has a history of saying offensive things out of the blue. She's a bit younger than us (we're all in our 20's, mind you) and tries to be daringly offensive to seem cool- kind of undergoing a belated teenage rebellion. Up until this weekend, everyone just sort of resigned themselves to pretending the things she said didn't happen because it's hard to escape the other expats in the country.

* But theeen out of the blue, she used some images depicted in historic carvings to tell me I want to/have/should partake in bestiality. It was **really** graphic. It was not a one-off, she kept going at length about animals and their potential interactions with my genitals. This was addressed to me because the images depicted a folktale of my ethnic people. Then she segued into telling me I should have my partner painted up in blackface while imitating a fake foreign accent, add some more bestiality stuff I won't type out here, so I could act out one of my favorite childhood myths sexually. We were not talking about sex **in any way** previous to this. All of this was said directly in front of my office-mate, who was aghast.

* I explained that I am not into bestiality or race-play, and that I considered these suggestions somewhat offensive. She dismissed me and said that someone out there would be into it, so it was fine to say to me. She also said my boyfriend using blackface is fine because I'm ""brown"", and it would only be bad if I was white. I will also remind you that we were in the middle of an ancient temple, and that all these suggestions specifically targeted the history and religion of the native/MY, people. 

* I was the only non-white intern in our group, so I didn't cause a big fuss. I was stuck with these people far from my apartment, and I was mostly in shock. Then I got increasingly more upset, there was a fair bit of crying. Long story short, I brought it up to the most senior administrator who wasn't gone on vacation, let's call him Bill. At the time he seemed really empathetic and posited outcomes such as firing Chloe, suspending her from work for a bit, and/or requiring she complete a cultural sensitivity course. We left the discussion agreeing that no one would do anything further for a few days while we both thought on it. He said he would talk to the other most senior admin in the office, Chloe's direct supervisor and the one who hired her, we'll call her Pam.

* Then the next day, which was a weekend, Pam tried to secretly call Chloe to her office. However, her secretary didn't know what it was about and called me about it because she didn't have Chloe's cell number. Chloe is also one to run off at the mouth. Pam basically told Chloe that I was filing an HR report against her, assured her that nothing would come of it, hugged her, and apologized that such a terrible thing was happening to her. Pam apparently professed to knowing she wasn't supposed to be contacting Chloe yet, and that she wasn't supposed to be telling Chloe WHO filed the report, but she was telling her anyways. Pam has not voluntarily tried to contact me in any way since she found out about any of this three weeks ago, despite being in charge of investigating the issue. After Pam met with Chloe I emailed Bill to ask why she did it, and he was very evasive.

* After the weekend, with me aware of all of this, Bill tried to pressure me to sit down and mediate with Chloe so she could tell me she was sorry in front of him, and I could accept her apology. He said that I ought not let things fester. I asked him to explain what was happening and he said that he considered me telling him what had happened an official notification, and that he'd informed 'senior leaders' and that an investigation was starting.

* When pressed it became pretty evident that 'senior leaders' meant his boss, who was on vacation for the next month and didn't know any real details of what was going on, that investigation meant Pam, who has not asked me or the officemate that was present for the conversation for any information or clarification, and that this hadn't actually officially reached this NGO's HR department in the US. When I asked for details about HR policy and why Pam had gone to Natalie despite him telling me definitively that she wouldn't, he got defensive and upset and started telling me that no one is accountable to tell me what's happening, and that I was not the one driving the bus on this. He actually got pretty intimidating and flustered. I was a little scared. He wouldn't explain what the HR protocol for this sort of thing actually was and kept telling me I just needed to trust the system. 

* No one has asked me to submit a statement, I haven't been interviewed by anyone, and no one has contacted my corroborating office mate. I am isolated in a third world country where no one is really held accountable for anything, and even more than what Chloe said, I feel nervous about how the administration responded to it. Please tell me if this is normal? It feels not-normal.

**tl;dr**: A co-intern said some reeeally graphic sexually aggressive/racist stuff to me in front of another co-intern, in a religious site. Her boss, I think, stepped out of line, and now the other admin is trying to shut this all down before it causes too big of a fuss. I do not think what happened to me is actually being investigated or reported to HR. I don't know if there's anything I can do."

I decided to delay my grad plans by one year, and try to get as much professional experience as I can.
Yesterday my boss informed me that he was impressed by my work and that he wants to extend my internship to a 6 months paid internship, which may lead to a job (after 6 months).

6qxjdy,0,2017-08-01,Vacations can sometimes suck,realryang,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/6qxjdy/vacations_can_sometimes_suck/,"Hey guys! You might have seen me post a couple times, because I believe this subreddit is a great way to vent/find methods on how to deal with our APs. And since I have seen many posts from college students, I thought I'd provide my two cents for those dealing with their AP bullshit for the next couple weeks/months (depending if you're semester or quarter). 

The WORST thing you can do FOR YOURSELF is to just waste time during the summer, whether it be playing LoL/Overwatch/CS:GO or just binge watching Rick and Morty episodes. I know many of us are counting down the days where we could just go back to school, focus on OUR EDUCATION, OUR PERSONAL GROWTH, and just kicking it with the day 1 homies, going to raves and shit (guilty pleasure). Trust me, I would love nothing more. However, since college is all about getting good grades, thus leading to a profitable job to these APs, they want to see you actually doing something with your education, whether it be getting a summer job/internship. Unless you have a scholarship/grants/loans, some APs want to see that their money isn't wasted on a kid who's just spending his/her summer not doing jack shit. As fucked up as it sounds, some APs (such as mine) see paying for their kid's education as an investment, and the job I obtain after graduation is their RoI (Return of Investment). I go to a private school, so my parents are working their ass off. I try to return the favor by doing the best I can, but college is college. They don't get that sometimes shit happens. We're still young and learning how to get our live together, and our mental state can be unstable due to, oh I don't know, an emotionally/physically traumatic childhood. Sue us.

Now I know not every AP really cares about grades during college. Some of my friends' APs don't give a shit about college grades, because they're already in college! However, not everyone is that lucky, and everything I say is a generalization with some truth to it. So why get a job/internship other than maintaining distance from your APs? The first obvious reason: MONEY! It's important that you start to learn how to manage your finances. The sooner you do that, the sooner you can leave your APs house for good and be self-reliant. The second reason is, while we hate hearing our APs constantly nag at us, college is indeed a very important time for us to starting getting our shit together! Finding what you love will bring you happiness, and you can forget about all the BS you went through! I can tell you from personal experience, maintaining distance and building my career has been rewarding and allowed me to keep my sanity. The key is to tell your APs what they want to hear when you get a job/internship, such as where you're working, where it could lead to, and how much you're getting paid (this is risky if your APs tend to steal your money). Now I know the economy blows and finding a job/internship can be taxing. But be proactive! If you're looking for a summer job/internship, you should start searching/applying around January-March. Utilize your school's career fairs, alumni network, anything! A great thing about internships is that some are abroad! I had some friends whose internship program is in Korea, and her parents were more than happy to let their child study in their native country.

There is always a way to make it work! If you have any questions, feel free to PM me! I'd be happy to provide all the insight I have! Try and enjoy your summer break! Kick it with your day 1s from high school and keep your distance! "

I'm 4-5 months into my first job (depending on how you count it). It is with the City, let's say it's the Tech Bureau.

I'm thinking of looking for better paying options in the private sector. But I know there is a stigma against people who work &lt;1 year.

My question is -- I've interned for the City before this, but for a different division and with less responsibilities (intern), let's say this was for the Engineering Bureau. I stayed as an intern for close to two years.

So if you count the City as my ""company"", I've been here for a little over two years, despite working in different divisions and with different groups.

I feel with all the constant rejections, I feel that I have no value at all. I also felt that I might be excluded from getting a job due to being part of a certain demographic or area given the info on my resume. And that saddens me overall.

I also have nowhere to turn at all in this ordeal. I might think of a career change even though I still want to do data entry and research. I also done some math problems out of the blue in recent days.

His answer: Pursue a free masters degree in any program for a year at Mercy College (still unsure if that's actually true) and you can get jobs with that degree.

My uncle further explains that it could be the best thing that can happen to me and I also asked him that I still want to get a job, I don't want to fall behind money-wise for a year plus than I already had. He assured me that you can still go for it; he and my older brother worked and go to college simultaneously back in the day.

One side of me says that this is the only way that I could get a real job but the other half says weigh it. I can go for the education but I want to make sure that I don't want to make the wrong decision. Fortunately for me, I have all the time in the world to make up my mind until the vacation comes in late September.

I am in accord with my uncle for his good suggestion and advice that he gave me. However, what do you guys think what's best for me? Go to college to get the masters and job or just endure the same thing like I did this summer or maybe something else?"

It may get a little long so sorry about that.

I feel like I accomplished absolutely nothing this summer. I finished my freshman year in April and will begin studying Computer engineering this Fall. 

I didn't get any internships but I didn't worry because I was told I shouldn't sweat it because I was a freshman. So I instead decided to start looking towards summer jobs.

Well, that didn't go as planned. I didn't have a high school job so my references were limited. I kept applying to places through July for some sort of part time work. This included basic stuff like restaurant work as well as stuff like temp positions. I didn't land a single job. For most jobs, I didn't even get a response. For the jobs I got an interview for, I heard the same thing: ""We're not hiring seasonal college workers."" Around the end of July I gave up because I kept getting told by interviewers how it was too late to train people who were going back to school in August anyway.

So now I'm worried that it'll just look like I wasted 4 months to employers. I'm planning on applying for co-ops since I'm eligible starting this upcoming Spring, but I'm afraid not having any work experience will hurt my prospects a lot. I understand a part time job isn't totally glamorous for a resume but I feel like it's better than nothing.

I did start volunteering in late July once I realized getting a job was totally unlikely this late in the summer, but I still have only done it for a couple weeks so far. I'll still be doing it as much as I can this month to at least have something to show.

Also, because I'm in CoE, I kept involved with robotics and joined a few project teams that were running this summer, but I don't feel like I contributed too much to them aside from showing up to weekly meetings and putting stuff together.

I am going to be an undergrad TA for Physics 2 this Fall, so I hope that looks good on a resume despite not really being entirely relevant to CoE.

I've also been trying to get the developer certificates from FreeCodeCamp to practice programming, but I only started that mid July and haven't completed any yet. That could be good to build my portfolio + have a certificate to show on my resume, I suppose. I've also been trying to learn C++ but I haven't actually made any big projects with it so I feel like I haven't done much with that.

That's all I have to say. I appreciate anyone who took the time to read this kinda disorganized rambling, and I appreciate any and all comments."

I have been interested in computers and coding ever since I was young. I taught myself some java through highschool, but always had problems understanding the depth of it. Eventually, once I reached college, I went into the computer science field, and started taking classes there. It all seemed very simple, and I breezed through the classes with high B's or A's. Now that I am going into my sophmore year, I feel like I understand less and less every day. 

In preparation for a possible internship during the school year, I started to use CodeFights to touch up on and do more coding, but everything in there just seems so difficult. I have only solved 6 total problems on the site, and even had some troubles on the easier ones. For example, here is the problem I am stuck on right now: **Given a sequence of integers as an array, determine whether it is possible to obtain a strictly increasing sequence by removing no more than one element from the array.** I have been trying to do this problem for days, but have not been able to.

In all honesty, I feel like the problem starts with my lack of workflow. I jump right into coding, without planning, or really even thinking about how to solve the issue. I have tried to sit and think about a problem step by step before actually diving into it, but it doesn't ever seem to help all that much. On top of that, the plethora of internet resources aid in my lack of knowledge of a language. Any time I can't remember something, such as how to write a Switch statement, or for-each syntax, I always turn to StackOverflow. In turn, I feel like I am never really learning how to do something, but instead how to look up something.

Even though these problems aren't that difficult, and I feel like I don't actually have the knowledge of syntax in languages, it still scares me, and makes me think that I am just not cut out for doing what I love."

After doing some research and meeting with an advisor, I learned about this possibility of double majoring in CS/BA. This is a really exciting prospect for me but there's a couple of concerns/questions that have risen because of it.

1. In order to graduate with the degree I'll have to take two summer courses in 2018, and take an extra semester in the Fall of 2019.
2. My biggest concern isn't the extra money that'll have to get spent, I'm more concerned over how big of an issue it'll be over not having a summer internship this upcoming summer. I've heard that it's crucial to have one, but taking these summer courses will prohibit me from doing so.

Main question is: How big of a detriment would it be towards my career to not have a summer internship next summer? Is there anything else I can do to boost my resume prior to next summer?

Outside of the backstory I didn't ramble, everything is an important detail. Thanks!

Based out of Nashville, TN.

So heres the story:

**BACKSTORY**

Near the end of March 2016 I finally found a place worth visiting in my long search for a new place. Nashville has through the roof real estate so for a young unemployed guy who moved here recently to pursue my passion for the music industry, roommates was and is a must.

I viewed a rather large place with 3 bedrooms and every intent to fill each one. The RENT is $1,650 a month plus utilities. Divided by 3 roommates thats only $550 a month, not a bad deal at all for a 2200sq.ft. place in a gated community.

I was shown the place by a showing agent. I loved it. I was ready to sign. I checked with the showing agent to make sure, 'hey, I can have roommates right? I don't know anyone yet cause I just moved down here, so I'll move in alone, but I'm aggressively looking for roommates. That cool? 'Yeah. The lease needs to have everyones name on it though, so when you get roommates just contact use, we will amend it with their names and you'll be good to go!' Sold!

He makes the leasing agent aware of my desire and that agent contacts me and gives me the lease. Things seem in order, but before I sign I just gotta double check that roommate factor. If I was given misinformation and can't have roommates then I won't last the lease without a job. He did confirm exactly what the showing agent said. SOLD! I sign the lease.

A few days later I give them a call and say hey, I found guy number 1. I'm getting close to this process. (I meet them, make sure we click, they apply through the rental agency, when they accept the guy then I let him move in and we amend the lease). So on the phone I say hey, I was told by these two agents I can contact you when I'm ready, but what exactly does that mean? Person 3 at the rental agency gives the details and I'm all good to go.

Well, long story short, I have bad luck. It took me until June to get roommates. It took me 2 months of paying the full rent on my own, but not only did I find 1 but 2 guys ready to move in. Finally! So they get through the whole process I just mentioned, they pass the application process, and I ask the rental agency; 'hey, can I just move these guys in? I like them and they passed your application. Signing the lease is just a formality right? They need a place to live asap.' The person in charge of lease amending at the agency says thats not a problem.

I get the 2 roommates moved in and not a couple days later do we all get the new lease. The only difference? All of our names are on this lease, just as explained to me by the showing agent, leasing agent, and lease amending lady at the third party renter agency. One roommate signs digitally, I go to sign the next day, but before I do I get a call.

**PROBLEM INTRODUCED (my thoughts)**

""Hey, so the owner actually in fact was never in favor of you having roommates. He was under the impression that you were going to live alone (in a 3 bedroom house?). He doesn't want you turning it into a frat house (what? lol.)."" I tell her yo, I spoke to so many people so many times, I can't afford the place without roommates. I'm sorry you and your client had a miscommunication, but we live here, I signed the lease, which DOES NOT say wether I can or can not have roommates, and you told me to go ahead and move them in that the amending of the lease was just a formality. You gotta talk to this owner....

Next Day

""Alright so I talked to the owner. Hes fine with you having 1 roommate, but not 2 (oh no, I can't kick someone out, I need 3 people for that prime price). But since 2 are already moved in he is willing to compromise (my favorite word....). He wants you guys to make an additional $1,500 deposit (haha, what?) per roommate (jaw drops..)."" Ok, no lol. One guy is an intern and only here for just a couple months, and intern = no money. Another just had a major car repair and can't afford anything extra, in fact can't afford anything at all, I've fronted him his first months rent which he will pay me back next week. And I'm not rich, I can't just dish out $3k just because this owner wants me to.

So to be clear, he doesn't want the money for himself. Hes asking for a deposit... We get the money back. So he's not a thief, just shady.

**HERE IS WHERE I NEED LEGAL ADVICE**

Over the course of the next few stressful days of ongoing conversation and more conversations and details I won't bore you with, everything culminates to this; The owner wants $1,500 total in the form of an extra deposit in exchange for him allowing me to have 2 roommates, and he is willing to accept it over the course of the remainder of the lease. 10 months, 10 $150 deposits. This detail will be outline in an amended lease with the new roommates names on it. We verbally agreed to this.

So is this legal? Again, the lease says nothing about roommates. Not that I can or that I can't have them. It says nothing about an additional cost contingent on the addition of said roommates. I'm being threatened with being kicked out if I do not comply by signed the new lease and paying the money. I've been told over and over by the lease amendment lady that there are other ways out of the lease, I will not receive the black mark E(viction) Word on my name. Which is good, I guess?

**UPDATE**

2 more months have transpired. 1 roommate moved out due to a disagreement, and did so without a problem because this fiasco took so long that the lease never got signed. The remaining roommate wants to move out in 2.5 weeks due to his internship being over and I'm on the hard search for 2 more guys to take their place. So myself and the lease amending lady agreed to not sign an amended lease due to this revolving door of roommates due to the fact that they charge $100 to amend the lease every single time. So every time a roommate comes and goes? No way, lets wait till everything is set in stone and pay that fee once. The lady has no problem with this. 

**UPDATED LEGAL ADVICE NEEDED**

So here I am with an unsigned amended lease and I get a call from the lady again bringing up this issue after 1-2 months of silence. ""Hey, so a couple weeks ago your leasing agent spoke with the owner and the owner changed his mind. He wants the money in a lump sum. He doesn't agree to the monthly payments anymore (haha what?). I didn't tell you because after speaking with the leasing agent I was advocating for you. This owner shouldn't go back on his word and verbal agreement. Go convince him to change his mind back so that I don't need to inform the tenant of this shady change."" Well, that conversation either didn't happen or didn't work. At this point he wants his lump sum deposit. I get an ultimatum email from the lady saying ""I spoke with my team and we recommend you stop searching for 2 roommates and only look for 1 since the owner was ok with 1 after our very first convo when this problem started (but wait, your team advocated for me to search for 2 roommates before I even signed the lease?). Also, he wants that lump sum of $1,500 deposit, just a reminder. And if you can't comply with these let me know and I'll ask the owner if hell let you out of the lease (are you out of your mind???).

I chewed her out through email and ended it with the threat of seeking legal counsel and litigation towards the owner. This is my first time moving out and I don't know anything about landlord/tenant law, so I'm not sure if all of this is actually legal, but even if it is it's definitely shady as heck. Well, I figured I would post my story here and see what you all have to say. In the meantime I should be going to sleep due to an early call time, but instead I'll look for local lawyers who I can hopefully pay for a phone call for some legal advice in addition to /r/legaladivce's advice. If what he is doing is illegal, I'll pursue. If it's not, I guess lets get out of this lease.

Is this all legal? Do I have any recourse?

**TL;DR**

I'm 4 months into a 12 month rental lease. Rent is $1,650/mo + utilities. I was verbally told by a leasing agent, showing agent, and lease amending agent that I can add roommates at a later date. 2 months into the lease I try and instead of allowing it the owner asks for $1,500 deposit, per roommate, or I can move out asap. I'm given an ultimatum. I'm NOT in violation of the lease, to my legal knowledge. It doesn't mention wether I can or can not have roommates and doesn't mention any additional deposit money contingent on said roommates. My question is, is this legal, do I have any recourse, can I move forward with my staying here or must I bend to the owner and sign his forced amended lease demanding money?

This is a BRIEF SUMMARY. There are a lot of details in the long version. If you plan on offering advice I recommend taking the time to read. I did my best to not ramble and only put in the problem and the shady details. Theres just that much going on... That said, I encourage and appreciate all input even if you stuck with the TL;DR.

Thanks for your time reading Reddit, I know it was long. I'll take all the input I can get!"

I wanted to drop a quick text here just to ask for some local opinions on which Uni is generally better. More specifically I'm looking for
1. quality of studies (if any of you did one of these programs would be nice to hear your opinion), 
2. quality of life (living expenses, student life) 
3. and most importantly job perspective. I intend to apply for internships during the summer and since both Konstanz and Passau seem like small towns I wouldn't expect to find huge tech companies there. Instead I'll be looking for jobs in Stuttgart and/or Munich (depending on my choice). 
That being said, I'd like to know a bit about the tech scene in these cities. I did a quick lookup on Stack Overflow and  there seems to be a lot more going on in Munich. If you could provide me with article links, job searching sites, communities, start ups, any kind of resource really I'd very much appreciate it.

I'm majoring in Computer Information Systems and after my undergrad is finished I'm going for an extra year to complete an accelerated master's program (offered to me for having a 3.8+ GPA) 

While I go to school full-time, I have a part time job at a criminal record database and background check company. I started as a ""cleaner"" (basically utilized SQL to clean up the data before the clients got it) and now the company purchased licences for a new software (very similar to Selenium). I was tasked to utilize my technical writing skills to use the software CDs to create a training manual for the company to utilize for the new software. 

The company bought the software to be used to save money doing our own web-scraping instead of buying big criminal data from outside sources. After creating the manual and creating a few data scraping robots, I was moved to a new team.

A new team was created called RPA (Robot Process Automation). I was moved to this team because executives believe the software can be used to automate internal processes (like the non-IT data entry department). So that's where I am currently.

It's a mid-sized company and we have many software development teams, networking and security teams, QA, QC, etc. 

I'm close friends with one of the IT directors and my manager and luckily for me they are very flexible with my hours and open many opportunities for me. I've been working here a little over a year and I just don't know what I should do next. Computer Science has so many paths to take and I don't know if I would like to go down the software and architecture path, or networking, or security, etc. Should I stay at this job all through school or find internships elsewhere or how can I get the most out of this current job? I already try to be sociable and network with as many developers and people as I can and expand my LinkedIn network, I don't know what to do next. "

I also wanted to share to people that for me a lot of it is taking initiative and recognizing opportunities or even creating them.

I was able to transfer from the restaurant industry where 3 years ago I would have been coming home with wet shoes as a salaried manager probably averaging one of the lowest adjusted hourly rates in the building. I would have to wash the dishes constantly since we didn’t have money for staff. I had 3 pairs of shoes because driving home at 2am for 1:30 hours with wet shoes just wasn’t my thing.

I met people at through the restaurant and was offered an opportunity to volunteer with a local non-profit, I had been fixing every employee sand family members computer for free and cash for awhile and word got out. Fix some computers for their office, maybe help refurbish some machines get a beer. It was awesome, once I was allowed to actually work on the MSRP stuff and read about it I learned a ton I had never experienced before. I had only had an older 801 A+ exam and failed the CCNA and stop spending the money. This experience to me to see Sun Sparx equipment and DEC and NEC and older servers and well as tons of laptops was my escape from the grueling hours at the restaurant. I gained an appreciation for the computing history and the older titans and was excited to see the new ones.

It was a long 3 years but after transferring to be closer to my then GF only to quickly have things not work out which I'm still unclear why, but it was still probably the most interesting experience I have ever had. It was obvious I was now just stuck there without support and further away from my volunteer work with a 1:30 hr commute to work. I was drinking daily, doing 60 hours at the restaurant and another 10-15 at the non-profit. I was practicing coding while I was stuck at work, was heading towards burn out.

Eventually it happened and things don’t work out, 16-20 yr olds that are over entitled, or by the same token 40 yr olds, they are all the same people, but different forms. I was depressed, not working, and not volunteering. My community stepped up and my non-profit found me someone willing to take on a paid intern. My knowledge of linux and scripting intersecting with their desire to learn powershell automation, it was great. For 2 months at least.

My restaurant attire was fit for work so that was a plus, this was 1:30 hrs away as well but it was something that had a future. At the same time a school approached my non-profit about a teaching refurbishing opportunity. They were in another state, far away, what did I have to lose? The nonprofit agreed to help me out a bit financially while we see what relationship we can have an opportunities we can make for these kids.

 Back at the internship checks started to become an issue and I had to stop going, it was hairy but still any amazing opportunity. Continuing with the non-profit Tuesday and Thursdays were 3-4 hours a day in a car to get to the school, there was a free roast beef sandwich with horseradish at lunch waiting for me sometimes upstairs from the head master. It was hot in that attic, I miss that sandwich, I miss that head master. One day I will return.

We rocked out that summer by getting some donated laptops, MSRP refurbishing them and also doing some ubuntu apache setups. These kids are all super geniuses with Aspergers autism spectrum so they read a ton, remember a ton, and learn from one day to the next. They are super direct, and probably just better people,

By summers end the school is cycling computers, doing setups… head master puts in a good word to his outsourced IT company and I get an interview. They see I know windows stuff, linux and coding which doesn’t really matter, no server proof really cuz internship was so short but after not hearing about anything for awhile I get the job.

Turns out their general purpose guy was leaving and I was going to replace him to my surprise, but that would come to my understand 6 months later. I was visiting 2 or 3 schools a day, sometimes with advance notice of the issue, never screen shots usually morning of I was being told were I was headed. Sometimes piles of dead hardware or firmware, AD issues or GPOs and everything networking under the sun. I wasn’t super familiar with Cisco IOS… but my linux background ended up making this OS Beautiful. Although I use meraki now.. and no worries from a k-12 school admin.

I had dual core desktop and virtual box and some donated laptops to practice everything on at night when I had time. I hate installs. Where was docker…

I had to use all my previous skills of SOPs from the restaurants since there was none here, massive hardware knowledge from the refurbishing days and being able to size up tasks for the day. Documentation from my manager days, this was probably the most important. Not to descriptive, you need bullets, I’m still learning.

I was 6 months in trying to support 15 locations, visiting as many as 20 in a month to collect or performance service, all smaller then 150 students. I was being ambushed by competitive MSPs at job sites with back door deals when I was just a tech. All sorts of privacy requests and general misunderstandings… I was sometimes driving out 3 hours ONE WAY to find out there was only a few hours of work at the location but the person wanted it fixed in person… not over the phone they don’t like it and thought it would be more complicated to fix…

I was learning what I liked and what I didn’t like, and helping people and seeing teachers less scared and more effective and technology being transparent to the students learning was amazing. It was a shit ton of real world experience, even thought I was driving between 3-6 hours a day, my car was dieing, I wasn’t getting paid all that great and I was still volunteering at the non profit and the school. I was pretty exhausted.

I’m sorry Ryan it took me this long to speak, I have always been slow.
I’m sorry it took me this long to step up, I thought we had more time.
I’m sorry the last time you saw me you saw someone that was weak and over whelmed
I'm sorry I didn’t reciprocate the love and affection you shared with me and everyone
I'm sorry it took you leaving this world for me to realize you where the only living person I ever liked.

On august first 2016 Ryan shot himself in the temple. Found in the parking lot of a hospital, he had stepped out of the car I assume so as not to waste the vehicle for us. Found with a note in his backpack reading “no drugs, organ donor, blood type 0+”
His lease was up, he volunteered a ton, he had a stable job. He wasn’t a bad person, and Ryan and I don’t need fucking hand outs. We are grown men and we don’t need hand outs. Sometimes things are hard though, sometimes it’s not fair to expect people to divine all answers and outcomes with clarity through their entire life. Maybe it’s not fair to require people to beg for help in a society that shames in and then offers a pill with in a new master not a solutions to a fundamental societal issue. I know now I should have been there during that time. I am not the same.

I didn’t take this well. The thought of someone I can only remember with a smile and a hug towering over me, crouching down and beginning to lay down for his last time on the frigid dark asphalt and the last thing he does is share his organs.

He was smart, he was a harder worker then me, he was supporting more people with his volunteer work. This world never felt quiet to me. It’s been a year and it just feels empty but I am not sad anymore.

FUCK FUCK FUCK

Well this is why I'm posting right a year later here on. I read something here once and I was able to slowly fixate on it and change my course. Someone talked about hating themselves so much they wanted to kill their habits that make up themselves. Therefore you wouldn't be that person so you would have to hate a whole new person. I began to understand this was a better lasting change. This world is happy to stay the way it is and we have to change it. In my own bouts of darkness I had to pull on all my knowledge sources to try to control this. I wanted to share some things that had great impact on me.

I was aware of Aaron Becks cognitive behavioral replacement therapy and shame spirals and I started to find it was a scientific interpretation of a wonderful quote by Milton

“Me miserable! which way shall I fly
Infinite wrath, and infinite despair?
Which way I fly is Hell; myself am Hell;
And, in the lowest deep, a lower deep
Still threatening to devour me opens wide,
To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heaven.”

Showing you it is your thoughts and your ability to think about them in a negative manner repeatedly building stronger neuroconnections and myelin sheath you are making depression a habit.

It’s like if karma isn’t real if it’s just the habit of looking for good and only seeing good and the neurochemistry of the mind training involved in all of that. Seeing only opportunity or only obstacles. 

Jonathan Haidt and Matthieu Ricard have amazing books that helped me start to control my thinking again.

“Watch your thoughts, they become words;
watch your words, they become actions;
watch your actions, they become habits;
watch your habits, they become character;
watch your character, for it becomes your destiny.”

Even arnold Schwachnager education of a body builder is amazingly insightful. It all starts painting this amazing picture.


Well after quitting everything and trying to go to hydroponic farming, I think vertical farming will be a huge industry in 10 years. I was lucky enough to visit this location nearby me twice during my last 30 days. They had 4 “admins” and 300 students or so. 

And the file share for roaming profiles was getting about 30mbps when no one was on, and the internet was 50/50 for a freaking school…
50 vms, 2003 -2008 installs.

I told my now boss straight out they are idiots, you don’t need this trash good luck. The admin ended up leaving 2 weeks into school starting and I took it. The other 3 guys were a 3rd party company coming in a few times a week. The next 3 visits had zero documentation and they flat out refused certain requests. Gone. 0 support, school Is running some passwords are wrong, I can’t log into vcenter but I can RDP and GPO powershell remotely on things.

Tube monitors on the walls, document scanners with incandescent light bulbs and RCA connections. Storing 10-20 chromebooks in every room when 80% had BYOD. No Mac or IOS support even on domain, no windows 8 / 10 support. I mean the directory and databases are still horrible.

Anyway…

We are now BYOD with 1 to 1 Chromebook loaner for the year. We support windows 10, Mac, ios, android, buffer updates. We got a 10x internet increase and saved $300 monthly. Now 200/200. 15 VMs and more cleaning to come. Migrated from raid 5 to raid 10 on the SAN, upgrade to the 10 gbe SFP and put the OS images on the local raid 10 on the servers and the data on the SAN and it seems to be functioning well but I'm not genius. File server tests at 600mbps in my 10 gbps buildings.

We have 70 inch touch screens coming for each classroom and are training our staff on what is email and internet. It’s amazing how you can have a doctorate and not know this.

I'm excited for students to have a personalized device, supported that they can take home and maintain the learning experience and make sure the resources to learn have high availability so they have learn at their pace. I’m excited to empower some teachers to have more flexibility with their classroom.
I’m unfulfilled but maybe there is progress Ryan. I don’t sleep and often I forget your face. I want to make sure this next generation have better support structures in place like Sebastian Junger talks about in tribes. We as a school don’t support them enough once they leave.

TL:DR

I used to take a old NEC tube monitor with a hub to my friends house to play warcraft. We would set static IPs, and use Hamichi and Kali to play once we unhooked the phone. 
Now I manage 17 buildings on 100 acres, over 300 users, VMware environment of 100 cores / 1TB ram, 18tb SAN , 40 TB nas backup. I read a lot.

Open information got me here. Thank you r/sysadmin.
This world is maleable, you can prove it.

One more semester of school.",m137_1,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/6r4pvo/22m_wherewhat_to_look_for_it_systems_management/,"I'm currently trying to figure out the best way to leverage my skills, experience, and education to provide me with the best starting career. I have one more semester before I am finished with my college degrees. I'm majoring in IT Systems (BSC; think network engineering, etc.) and Management Information Systems (BBA) with a minor in Finance. My long-term (8-10 year) goal is management, pref. in the IT space.

I've completed 4 internships so far - all in the network engineering space. Two at a large hospital and two at a Fortune 100 company. I just completed my internship this summer, but it's looking like there are no relevant job openings. I found one potential opportunity here, but it's contract based work in a 24x7 support type role making what I make now as an intern. While it would be a foot in the door, I personally feel that I'm worth more than that.


Some career paths I've considered pursuing are network engineering, network security, consulting, and IT Audit/Advisory with a Big 4 firm. I have no formal work experience in any of these, other than network engineering though.


tl;dr - What would be the best way to market myself to find a great starting career? How can I leverage my skills, education, and internship experiences to find me a well-paying job? If anyone has similar majors that are already in their careers, do you have any guidance or advice? Thanks in advance!"

I graduated about a month and a half ago, and I would like to preface this post by saying I know I'm very late to be looking for work. I had some bad family issues come up right before graduation, and they took my focus away from job hunting. I understand this is not an excuse, and that i'll have to reconcile with whatever initial employment I get. I should also note that I haven't applied to anything yet, because I've been trying to figure out what sort of job I actually want. It seems I'm at a critical juncture, and I would like some advice on my situation.

Now that that's out of the way, let me explain my situation. I'm 23 years old with both a Physics and Engineering degree. The reason I have two degrees is because I went through a dual-degree program with Dartmouth college for a BE (meaning I spent a total of 5 years in college. My concentration was in Computer Engineering. I thought I would love the hands-on aspect of engineering, which is why I initially did the program; however, I have come to learn that I do not like hardware engineering. On the other hand, I throughly enjoyed many of the Computer Science classes that I had to take to fulfill the concentration as well as ones I took for my own enjoyment. These range from a Software Design course taught in C, a Smart Phone Programming course, a Databases course, ect... In total, I've taken eight courses that would be considered specific to the Computer Science major at Dartmouth. However, I have not taken Discrete Math or Algorithms, which, as I understand, are core classes for a Computer Science degree; moreover, glancing through sample interview questions at various companies, it seems there is a heavy emphasis on algorithms (things like O(n) notation and various algorithmic strategies for solving programming problems). Additionally, I should say that don't have much experience in the way of internships related to software engineering/programming. I did some physics research related to tweaking and algorithm written in C for grouping galaxy clusters, and internship at an IT department where I wrote some Perl scripts, and a large project where a team of two other students and I designed a dual MCU device to wirelessly report power usage data to a backend service*.

Now on to the questions I have: Should I take a discrete math course and algorithms course before attempting to apply to software engineering jobs, or is it sufficient for interviews just to buy a review book on algorithms and learn from that? Secondly, what sorts of jobs should I been applying to, and is there a recommended way of going about the job search at this point (very late applying, that is)? I thank you for taking the time to read my post, and appreciate any and all advice!

Do people generally recommend taking an internship is their is no comp in any form offered?  One place does do equity that can be transferred into salary.  just curious what to expect.  

In NYC if that matters.

Any help?",ConvictDev,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6r71yd/been_reading_this_sub_religiously_for_many_months/,"Alright alright. So I admit it may have been somewhat a mistake, but I've been glued to this sub for the past 5 or so months. I gained a ton of good knowledge on what to do whilst in school to best my chances of success during school and after graduation, but all this information is starting to leave me feeling overwhelmed, and I haven't even started school.
     I'm coming in with very minimal programming experience. My tiny highschool in rural MO offered nothing remotely close to computer science / programming, so I had virtually no exposure to it until recently (I have gone through part one of the Helsinki MOOC on java, so I'm at least somewhat familiar with some of the very basics).  

I'm dead set on securing two internships while I'm in college. That would be soph-jr and jr-sr summers. I want this very, very badly. I would also love to find part-time programming work during the school year as well, we will just see what opportunities I can come across in my not-so tech hub area (KC). I'm not a Big-N or die kind of guy, but I'll be honest, securing an internship with on during school, or a full time offer upon graduation, would be amazing. I'm aware there are tons of other great companies to work for, they are simply an easy target to aim for as they're reputable, household names.  

I'll also note that I will be working roughly 20 hours per week during my time in school. There's no exceptions to this; finances won't allow me not to (I'm in quite a bit of debt already from a previous stint in school). That's going to take valuable time I could be working on side projects, contributing to open source, solving leetcode problems to prepare for interviews, etc. That's why programming-related work would be a godsend. Until then, I'm stuck at UPS (but their tuition reimbursement deal is pretty sweet). So, I will have to utilize my time extremely effectively. Did anyone work during school as well, but still have time for all the aforementioned subjects?  

So, I suppose what I'm asking, is does anyone have advice to help settle my mind while I can still be certain I'm on a path to achieve my goals? Are there specific areas I should focus on, specifically during my freshman year, to get me on track? I'm going to build a few projects, though they will surely be simple. I could probably start on easy leetcode problems. Anything else? If my biggest immediate goal were to land a soph-jr summer internship, what should I primarily be working on until then?  

I don't want to come off as super stressed. If anything, I'm beyond excited to be in school and to get things going. Naturally, though, I've been overthinking this as I tend to do a lot, and while there's not 100% sure path to success, I'd love to hear from others who are in the process / have made it out.

I'm currently a rising junior pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Business Administration. A side effect of this pursuit is that I'll have to take two summer courses next year.

Backstory, I am 30 years old and have decided to go to school for a career in computer science. I initially was focusing on programming, and am about to finish up my first round of summer classes. My question for the guys already working in the field (IT, programming, etc) what would be the best route for me to pursue? I feel I am already relatively good with IT work, my current job - which is a small retail company with about 50 locations - has me doing a lot of the hardware setup (network switches, firewalls, etc) for all of our retail locations when our dedicated IT team is tied up doing other things, I'm pretty good at it and I enjoy it. My focus was going to be on programming because I think that part of computers is fascinating as well and I have a buddy that makes good money doing this. The deciding factor will really just comes down to what degree, or focus in school will set me up with the best job opportunities when I get out of school? Or even an intern opportunity before I get out of school. The point of me going back to school is to get out of retail, and I enjoy really anything with computers and technology so there's not going to be a deciding factor between anything in the field. I just want the best opportunity to make more money and have job stability. I am located in the Dallas/Ft Worth Texas area, if that matters.

The thing is, I have not taken officially taken any programming courses, by that I mean none that my college offers. I have only since February decided to change my major from engineering to computer science, however with that being said, I have done a fair bit of independent studying via textbooks and an online mooc (mooc.fi which is a 2 semester java programming class offered by the university of helsinki). I know that probably doesn't count as real experience but so far that's the only concrete thing I have under my belt in relation to computer programming.

I've only completed the gen eds such as english, calculus, chem etc. I won't be able to take DS&amp;A until january but I hear that is prime season for internship postings to go up so I would be at a larger disadvantage than I already am. I'm not aiming to land a big name internship I am not picky and would/will gladly take any one that is offered to me, I simply want to get my feet wet pursuing something I actually enjoy and so I don't have to go back to working shitty retail jobs. Is it too early to start applying to internships and if it's not, what things should I learn independently as to increase my odds of landing one and what constitutes a side project and are side projects worth adding to a portfolio?

Major: Political Science


Demographic: Asian female, upper middle class, living on the Peninsula in CA, rising senior at a generally upper middle class area


GPA UW: 4.0 

GPA W: 4.421 

Notes: I took Multivariable Calculus in my junior year, which is a year ahead of the generally top-level section that most juniors at my school take. Also, I have taken every AP science course offered at my school, which makes me the only person who has done so in my class and, as far as I know, ever at my school. 
Class Rank: about top 1-2% (low due to taking band all four years)



ACT: 36C (35E, 36M, 36R, 36S, 8/12W)

SAT Math II Subject: 800

SAT Bio M Subject: 800



Sophomore APs

AP European History: 4

AP Physics C Mechanics: 4

AP Calc BC: 5



Junior APs

AP Biology: 5

AP US History: 5

AP Computer Science A: 5


10 APs in total by the end of senior year. I have taken the most rigorous courses available, bar language due to scheduling conflicts. 


Other Classes: I have taken 4 community college courses over the course of high school, and 2 during middle school. During high school, I have taken an English/Writing class, an Intro to Computer Science class, an Intro to Chemistry class, and an Intro to Sociology class. 


Extracurriculars

- Intern at City Hall this summer under the City Clerk's office: I have learned a lot about municipal government and how state and federal laws affect the workings of municipal government over the course of this summer, and I am planning on writing quite a few essays about my experiences. 

- Student Ambassador for my high school for all four years: I lead tours for incoming eighth graders and their parents, as well as hold and moderate panels for them. I will probably write a few essays on how this has made me a better public speaker and has helped me come out of the shell I had built myself in middle school. 

- Vice President of an informal school political discussion club: It is mostly a club where students at my school can get together and just talk about short-term and long-term political issues of our time. We didn't do anything particularly special outside of school, but I feel particularly passionate about it because I enjoyed some of the discussions we had. 

- Internship at a local publishing company Summer 2016: Company wrote about the biotech and pharmaceutical industries. While most people would not know about the company, a lot of ""big-shots"" in the industry and on wall street depend on the information from this company to determine competition/investment, so the company is pretty influential. I helped move the archives of the publishing company to a new network. 

- Writer/Editor of online magazine: I wrote 2 articles a month, as well as edited 6+ articles a month.

- Double Gold Medalist in Figure Skating: I have been skating for 12 years. Within those years, I have qualified for sectionals once (the level below nationals) and received the Double Gold Medalist award last year, which is a nationally-recognized award given by the United States Figure Skating Association to people who have demonstrated exceptional talent in two different fields of skating. I am currently continuing to skate recreationally and working towards my appointment as a judge. 

- Vice President and Co-Founder of school's medical club: Maintained club website, helped create presentations on topics in the medical field, and organized sales to raise funds for our club. 

- Girls Individual Golf Tournament at school: I placed 6th, but could not advance due to my school not having an official girls golf team. 

- Mathnasium instructor: Pretty self-explanatory. I taught kids math from beginning counting through precalculus. 

- Math Club Official: Helped grade math contests held every other week at our school. Consistently ranked top 5 in my class. 


Teacher Recommendations

AP US History: Was also my AP European History teacher and definitely likes me. He is probably one of the reasons why I like political science as much as I do, and I believe he will write about all the times I have stayed after class to talk to him about random things that we are learning in history and experiencing in modern times. 

AP Bio: Was also my freshman biology teacher and also definitely likes me. She really made me appreciate biology in all the weird quirks (such as A+B definitely does not always equal C, unlike physics and chemistry). She also knows that I enjoy a good debate and discussing modern science issues (EPA, climate change, scientific literacy, etc). 


What are my chances for Columbia, MIT, Yale, Stanford, Caltech, Harvard, UChicago, Duke, maybe other ivies? 
Well, actually, all the other ivies except Princeton. I have visited New York a lot, and thus have a thing against New Jersey. Princeton is great an all, but I got a thing. You know how it is. :P


Any and all input is much appreciated!! :)

Everything has been great up until recently. They've started a new campaign and want the interns (there are only 3 of us) to call restaurants and ask them to sign up for an event. 

I first have to say that my social anxiety is probably pretty tame in comparison to some people, and I initially thought that while I wouldn't exactly enjoy making the calls, it wouldn't be too bad. Once I actually started calling however, I just started to break down. I probably made 5 calls in 45 minutes, none of which were successful of course. This exact process repeated the second day and I was seriously stressing out at this point. I didn't feel like they were getting any easier and if anything, I felt like they were exactly as bad as I expected they would be. I started to get anxious about making the calls when I wasn't even at work and even when I went to look for a place to eat on my phone I remembered the calls and how much I dreaded making them. 

So yesterday I told my supervisor that I was really uncomfortable making the calls and that if there was some other way I could help I would be happy to do that instead. Unfortunately for me, there apparently wasn't and she said ""I wish we had known that earlier"" which I thought was extremely rude (do you mean before you hired me??). So now I'm thinking I made a huge mistake even bringing it up because they probably think I'm just lazy or something. This whole day I didn't say one word to my supervisor because I was scared she was pissed off at me.

It was probably a stupid thing to say but there was no way I could pretend I was okay with making the calls when I clearly wasn't, and up until now I've done tons of other work and done the best I could so I figured it wouldn't be a big deal. Now, no one told me I was fired or anything, but I'm worried I'll leave a less than ""shining"" intern.
 
I've got mixed feelings about the whole thing. Part of me feels bad because they were counting on me to do this, but I'm also kinda angry cause I feel like it was a sucky thing to make the interns do (and personally don't find it an effective tactic). I think that if I somehow stick it out and make some calls, I could minimize the damage, but I don't even know if I'm up for it.

Mostly just wanted to vent, but advice is welcome and appreciated."

All thoughts are welcomed. Thanks!** 

Life situation: 
My wife and I decided this year to move from California to Maryland to be closer to family. Also, we're originally from the east coast and feel like we belong there. Currently, we're in a cross-country distance since we decided it was best for her to do her PHD internship in Maryland to increase her chances of post-doc placement there. We were thinking originally for me to move over by June next year the latest, if not sooner if I land an opportunity, but the distance has been a bit tough, and I'm not sure if I'm not being considered seriously since I'm applying from California.  I thought about moving in November so I can still do the cross-country drive weather-wise since we have a dog. 


Job search situation: 

* I've been searching since May and had 2 calls, but no luck in moving to the next stage so far. 

* I applied to 40 jobs at this point, and was rejected 8 times. 

* Thanks to your awesome feedback and guidance on here, I have a permanent Maryland address on my resume (with a current city in California I'm in) and also noting that I'm available to start 3 weeks after acceptance, with no relocation needed. I also have been customizing the resumes and cover letters to the positions. 

* I've been focusing my search on internal audit or audit related roles, such as compliance, risk assessment/management. 


Current factors to consider: 

* I'm currently working in a business process management related role, making just over six figures and have a long-term project that should reach a major milestone by November. I've been in this role for 7 months, after completing an 18-month leadership rotational program for the company. I got my MBA prior to starting at this semiconductor manufacturing company. 

* We have saved up about $70k in savings so far. 

* I've been connecting with numerous alumni in the Maryland area. I went to an undergrad college in Baltimore.

* I'm month-to-month in my current housing situation in California.

* Her family lives right outside Baltimore, and we can stay there rent-free until I land a job in Maryland. We plan on getting a house not too long after I land a job and she lands her post-doc.

* I have loan payments of $1k a month. She has no loan debt.




My professional background:

* Went to a Top 20 undergrad school in Baltimore. Undergrad degree in Economics, minor in Business

* 7 years in internal audit (focusing on operational audits) for a large telecom company on the east coast. Promoted twice to Team Lead role. I do not have an accounting background or CIA certification (I have an inactive CFE certification).

* Decided to switch career paths and went to a regional MBA program in California, focusing on Marketing and Strategy. I primarily picked a regional program since we thought we would settle here, but hey, unexpected turns in life happen.

* Marketing did not pan out, or I didn't make the right decisions to let my career move that ways. Did internships in Business Development and Program Management (focusing on corporate quality and customers).

* If I land an audit-related role, I will pursue the CIA certification, but I do not think I qualify for the CPA certification.

6r9nzg,1,2017-08-02,Graduate School Research Plan,Mayowas,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/6r9nzg/graduate_school_research_plan/,"Hello,

My name is Mayowa. I have some questions about graduate school and feel I can obtain invaluable advice from some of the comments posted here. I'm from America, got my bachelors last year, and am currently living in Japan. I majored in biological science and biochemistry. When I first started college I was set on going to medical school, but realized I had never given any real consideration to graduate school until I started working in a lab. 

To be honest, I was not totally invested in the research lab I was first apart of, and mainly joined because of the good relationship I had with the professor. The lab I was first in was an analytical chemistry lab, with my research revolved around clinical biosensors. Later in college though I participated in a summer internship at a medical school my junior year, and worked in a life science lab. It was humbling to actually see techniques I learned about for long put to practical use. Not that I hadn`t done some of what I learned about in labs, but its just not the same as undergraduate laboratory classes, if you know what I mean. 

Getting a little off topic, I`m living in Japan now because I figured out too late during my undergrad that I wanted to study abroad. So I decided to take a year of Japanese my senior year, and come to Japan after graduating. One year has since passed, having originally come to teach English. 

Before coming though, I had the intention of entering graduate school abroad. Most likely in Japan. I never took much time to reflect on it due to America`s history, but the amount of international graduate students, conducting STEM related research is high. Among said students, a large portion of them are from Asia, but the same thing cannot be said for American students in Asian countries. The globalization of science has increased dramatically the past few decades, and I think cultural understand shouldn`t be overwhelmingly one sided. 

Anyways, my main question is about writing a research plan. All of the schools I am looking at have some form of graduate school entrance exam. Either a combination of a written exam, presentation of research plan, and an interview or something of that nature. 

So how exactly do you write a research plan? I`ve never written one and feel like I am struggling to do so. To anyone who was or is currently a graduate student, how much of what you learned in graduate school were you familiar with before actually entering? I only ask because I just wondering how detailed a research plan has to be. 

For example, if I were to list a prospective timeline of what I would be doing each month (classes I would take, experiments I would do, etc.) in the research plan, how far would I need to go. The first few months, 1 year,..._? Surely it wouldn`t be possible to list everything, because new techniques would be learned and applied during graduate study, right? I also understand that there are graduate students whose research does not stem from what they learned as an undergraduate. To those of you in this category, what did you do? Did you find it hard not being familiar with some commonly used techniques, or did it just become easier with time? 

I don't think research plans have to be written only by the applicant, but I would certainly like to make sure what I write shows I have put some thought into what I would like to research when sharing the plan with a professor to receive feedback. A few weeks ago I had emailed a professor and setup a skype meeting after sending him a statement of purpose. It almost felt like I followed a review article format (background info, significance, problems, possible ways to fix the problems, etc.) and stated unanswered questions I wanted to research at the end. I however did not go into detail of what experiments I would use.

He read it, asked me the ""Why do you want to study here?"" and ""How did you become interested in developmental biology?""- type questions, in addition to some of my past research experience, before asking more questions about what I wrote. In the end, he certainly wasn't disappointed (we did talk for about 20 minutes), but was a little surprised I only wrote about one research area of his lab. 

This is actually another part of the research plan I'm confused about. It will take 2 years for a master's, but I find it hard to predict how long things will take while I attend classes. Everybody hits a point where something just doesn't work for various amounts of reasons, but I guess he was essentially saying I would have a main project, in addition to other small ones. He seemed delighted that I was interested in his research, but I feel it will be necessary for me to initiate and set up future communication for more conversations and a possible lab visit so I can get everything in order. After receiving a master's, I would like to continue on with a Ph.D.

If you did, thank you for reading this far! I always like to search for an answer before asking another person for help, but I have not really found anything that can substantially help me yet. I would love to hear your thoughts. THANK YOU!

I know my university isn't that big in CS (and UWaterloo is better) but as of my research what would make me different is my side projects.

- What are some good resources?
- How do I get in touch with people through Linkedin to get a referral or an insight of how things work?

6rah86,39,2017-08-03,Terrible performance in school and only took QA internships. All hope of a software developer position was lost.. until today as I just accepted a software developer job! (A retrospective view of my job hunt),GotOutOfQA,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6rah86/terrible_performance_in_school_and_only_took_qa/,"I thought that I was stuck in QA for the rest of my life.  A software development gig in the USA (I'm Canadian) was my end goal, but with terrible performance in school and internships in QA, I thought that was out of reach.

**Before interviewing (my credentials)**

I took my first internship in QA because it seemed like a cool place to start.  And it was.  I really enjoyed it.  It was a blast finding bugs and speeding through every single manual test case faster than my other coworkers in QA.  I learned so much about QA that I didn't realize existed before.  I made it my goal to learn as much as I can, since internships are a great opportunity to learn too.  My boss was a great mentor; he taught me everything there was to know about QA.  Near the end of my internship (it was 8 months) my boss took a few days off and allowed me to lead the team with another member of QA.  Though I thoroughly enjoyed it, programming was always my end goal, so probably 5% of my time (and some lunch hours) was spent working on scripts that would automate things.  Sometimes I would show my QA coworkers the scripts, sometimes they'd glance at me and ask it.  They weren't a lot of scripts, but they were enough to pad my resume with.

My next internship was in QA because I couldn't find a position in software development (I feel like my grades and cover letter were the reason why, with more emphasis on grades).  All of the software developer jobs that I applied for didn't respond, while 10%-20% of the QA jobs that I applied for did, so I took them with the intention of doing things similar to my first internship (ie. write scripts in my own time while at work).  At this company my boss liked my performance which lead to an extension of my internship.  My boss got a QA intern for another 4 months, while I got a few extra bullet points to put down on my resume.

I failed my first CS class, which shows up on the first page of reading my transcript.  Imagine reading someone's transcript and seeing an F on the first page.  Not a good start, eh?  I also ended up failing data structures and algorithms. But hey, that's okay, a lot of people fail, so I put on my big boy pants and attempt it again.  This time is different though; I get a tutor and go to every single office hour.  Yet even with tutors and getting extra help the final was too much for me to handle, so I end up failing it once more.  That's *not* okay, how the hell does someone bounce back from this?  Turns out, there's a way.  My school requires you have a streak of great semesters before you can take a class for a third time.  So I ponied up and fucking had three semesters of great performance (not enough to bring my GPA above 3.0, but enough to retake the class again).  I retook the class and somehow passed it.  How I did so much better this time... I have no clue.  Every single examination was so much easier (except for my final, which I fucked up on, but the rest of my grades were enough to save me from another dreaded F).  I also had to retake Calculus 1 because I didn't meet the prerequisites for Calculus 2.

**Getting that interview**

So how does someone that graduates with a bad GPA (2.7), failed Data Structures and Algorithms twice, retook four classes, and only took QA internships get interviews for software developer positions?  Honestly, the only relevant thing in that list of fuck ups is that I only took QA internships.  Not a single company asked for my GPA, and only one of 250 companies asked for my transcript.  So how *does* someone that only took internships in QA get an interview for a software developer position?  By marketing themselves as a developer.

I wasn't a software developer nor did I have any work experience in roles that didn't have the letters ""QA"", so a lot of people that reviewed my resume often tossed it after reading those two letters.  90% of the work that I did at both places was QA work (manual testing).  However, that 10% is what I capitalized on in my resume.  I made sure that I never mentioned anything about manual testing, designing test cases, or anything else that I learned from my first internship in QA.  I did know that testing knowledge is very important, though, so I touched up on it in my cover letters.  I didn't shy away from my job title being ""QA Tester"", since that's the role that I was given.  With that said, my resume gave off the impression that I was a tool developer from the scripts that I created.  I was able to say that I worked on x, or developed y, or extended the functionality of z even though I only spent 3 hours on it.  I was also able to put that my internship was extended, which is a great thing to put on a resume when the things above it are development oriented.  Lastly, I was able to talk about the specific bullet points without hesitations or ""umm""s.  If it was on my resume, you know damn well that I'd be able to talk about it for 10 minutes.

I also had a lot of help from my personal projects.  These are VERY important.  Don't just make CRUD apps that you can whip up in a few hours.  I took concepts from my upper division CS classes and applied them to my own questions to find interesting answers.  One of these projects took one month, while another took four months.  I also had an iOS app that took 9 months.  These say a lot about your programming work ethic.

**My actual job application process and interviewing**

Though I graduated in June, I started applying in January 2017.  A lot of people here suggest applying in the Fall so that you'd have full time positions lined up by graduation, but a lot of the places that I applied to in January said that they ""can't see that far into the future"" for May positions.  They also said that ""they're looking for people to join the team in the next few weeks, not months"".  But that's okay.

At the beginning of my job hunt, my cover letter began as a full page of text with one paragraph brown-nosing the company, three paragraphs explaining how well I'd perform three bullet points from on the ad, and a final paragraph rewording the first paragraph.  It was very formal, with the name of the hiring manager (if their name is gender ambiguous I'd waste a lot of time doing my research on the company website or Linkedin trying to find out if they're male or female so that their salutation is correct; or address it to Hiring Manager), address, country, zip/postal code.  At the end of my job search (and the cover letter that got me a job) my cover letter was usually half a page.  The first paragraph was one sentence that said that I saw their ad on Indeed/company's career site/Friend's Facebook post.  The next paragraph was a paragraph that linked as much of their required skills and job duties to my own experiences in software development (basically saying how I'm a 80% match to what they're looking for).  I also added that I have a brain for testing, if it was an SDET role.  Sometimes I'd separate this into two paragraphs, cause no one likes reading big-ass paragraphs.  The last paragraph was a closing statement about me getting my degree, and how excited I am to work for that company.  If the company was american, I'd include ~~my favorite beer, why, and a link to the political party that I fully support~~ that I'm eligible for TN status to work at said company.

Of around 250 applications, I had 26 companies actually move forward to a phone interview or online assessment.  My favorite interview experiences are the ones that started off with an HR phone screen.  It felt like they actually cared about the people that they were interviewing.  I applied to several positions at every company, and while I wrote a cover letter for every single one, it was difficult for me to know exactly which position I was being interviewed for.  One thing that I really appreciated was when the recruiter would tell me exactly the position that I was being interviewed for, rather than guessing what position it's for.  If they didn't tell me, I'd ask, but sometimes the responses and answers are more vague than the job duties in the position description.  This is painful when the first interview is a technical interview and you don't know if you need to brush up on your linux admin tools cause one of the jobs that you applied to was part of the infrastructure team.  This happened and it was so annoying.  My worst technical phone interview experience was one where the guy asked me a question that was totally irrelevant to the things that he suggested online in preparation for technical interviews.  In this experience I was given the name of my interviewer, and the HR person suggested that I visit his LinkedIn and tech blog.  On his tech blog he had suggestions on how to prepare for interviews, but the interview that I had with him was totally fuckin different than what he suggested on his blog post.  The phone call also cut off in the middle of the conversation (never ever happened with my other phone interviews which are all done in my room)!

Of those 26 companies, I had on-campus interviews with 5 different companies.  Three of them were in Canada (local), and two of them were in the USA (they paid for flight, hotel, expenses, and one of them paid for the rental car).  I had no experience with LeetCode when I started.  Looking back at how I approached my interview questions, holy shit did I need LeetCode.  I never thought it would make me a better developer, but it did.  It changed the way that I thought about my problems.  I never broke down problems into potential data structures that I could use, and instead, just hacked something together.  But then again, interviews just want to see that someone knows how to program, right?! (no)  Though exhausting, my favorite on-campus interviews were the ones where you were there for the entire day.  I appreciated this because you didn't need to go back to the company for a second time.  It also helped with nerves to get past the first interviewer.  In the first interview, my brain is foggy as hell and I'm not as sharp when it comes to coming up with an optimal solution.  But once that first interview is done my brain is wired and ready to go.  It also helps me understand the culture of the workplace when I'm there for 6-8 hours, rather than there for just one.

Of those 5 different companies, I had a verbal offer from two of them (both in the USA) and got a written offer from one of them.  I got Company A's verbal offer on a Thursday morning, and got Company B's verbal offer on the afternoon of the Friday following it.  Company A offered more than Company B and offered a signing bonus that Company B did not offer, so I told Company B my offer from Company A, and she told me that she'd try to get the guys upstairs to match it, but there's no guarantees.  At 5:40 PM (on that Friday) I receive an email from Company A that they won't be continuing with me.  On Monday (That weekend felt like months tbh, couldn't sleep, questioned whether I should've just taken the offer and tell HR that the verbal offer with the other company fell through) she called me and told me that there's no jump in salary but she could give me a signing bonus which was higher than Company A's signing bonus (which was effectively 0, and so was their salary), to which I accepted.

**Too long, did not read**

* I had two 8 month internships in QA but wanted to get a software developer job

* At both QA gigs I would devote 5-10% of my time (Lunch hours, time that wasn't spent on Reddit) to working on scripts

* Marketed myself as a developer on my resume.  Some interviewers even said that they would consider my previous roles as a tool developer, not a QA tester

* My cover letter started off as a full page of filler for two to three points related to the job, but eventually was trimmed down to half a page of good content that was really really related to the job

* Sent 250 applications, 26 moved forward with phone interviews or online assessments

* Only one company asked for my transcript

* From 26 phone interviews/online assessments came 5 companies that wanted to see my human form

* From 5 companies that saw me in person, I got two verbal offers (both USA) and one written offer (accepted after an excruciating weekend)

* Verbal offers can fall through

**Last minute comments**

* If I could do it again, I wouldn't.  I hate interviews and hate applying for jobs even more.

* Rejections hurt in the beginning, but eventually you become numb to them

* The mental toll that I had waiting for Company B to come back to me was worse than waiting for marks to come back from an exam that you're not sure if you passed or not.  If you're not a top tier developer like myself and you're desperate for a job, I recommend taking it.  The signing bonus that I got is great but mental health is greater.

* Start using sites like Leetcode and Geeksforgeeks.  I really like the Leetcode random button.

* For the most part, Glassdoor interviews were unreliable

* To be honest this subreddit didn't help at all

* What helped more than anything is looking my interviewers up on Linkedin so that I can ask questions that are more tailored to them.  

* At one company I asked HR what work-life balance was like, and she said that it's great, that the company values having your own healthy life outside of the company.  At the same company, I asked about worklife balance to a senior developer that's been there for 3 years, and he said that typically developers show up at 10 am and leaves at 7:30 pm.  Noped out of that.

To add to the problem, my engineering degree - as I have learned the hard way - does not seem to generalize well to other fields of engineering, and so finding work has been difficult.

I need an alternative plan just in case I don’t get hired by either of them. 


My current work experience is very limited. There was one point where I washed dishes for my college’s main cafeteria (through junior year), and I was able to score an internship over the summer as an undergrad, where I gained some experience working with a database. Other than that, I just have volunteer work on my belt. I’ve had a rough time the past few years because I’ve been dealing with severe anxiety/depression/attention problems. Instead of actually helping me, doctors just shoved pills down my throat; in hindsight I can see that that just made things worse. Because of all of those drugs and my inherent neurological issues, it took me a while to complete my degree, and I only just graduated last December.


I just don’t know what to do right now. I could wait it out. Maybe the industry will bounce back, and then maybe many more opportunities will become available to me. Or maybe I should pursue a part-time job while studying something more marketable, like computer science. Or maybe I should be searching for a full-time job, AND studying part-time. I don’t know - I’m drowning in possibility right now and it’s making me very anxious for the future, like maybe I wasted 6 years of my life on the wrong degree. 


I know that part of getting a job involves networking, but that means knowing people, and as a socially-inexperienced introvert I have only 5 contacts on my Linked In profile. So how can I expand my network? Any advice on this, as well as all of the above would be dearly appreciated.

I graduated last year from college as a Software Engineer. My internship was to develop a full-stack AngularJS and NodeJS web app on my own. I was self taught but in the end the result was really good, got a high score and came out loving webdev.

After graduating I accepted a job offer in a multinational company as a ServiceNow Developer. They paid my training in ServiceNow and ITIL Foundations and it's been almost a year since I started. I'm going to be offered a permanent position at the company soon getting a good pay but I'm not sure ITSM and ServiceNow is what I like, since it's a bit boring and stale at times and I absolutely love Vue, NodeJS and everything related to webdev with JavaScript. My concern is that I've ""lost"" a year gaining almost nothing in that area, although project management wise I did gain a lot of practice.

I'm torn between doing something that I know will pay well but might be a bit boring at times, with the career prospect of being a dev/consultant in ServiceNow or later something like a Service Manager (which I see my boss doing and reject doing the same) or becoming a web developer ""again"" especially in Vue (which I've been learning and getting into) or NodeJS, knowing I won't get paid as much but the challenge will probably be more exciting.

Some sort of help on the decision?"

Basically, we want to do gene set enrichment analysis and pathway analysis on various GeoDatasets. I'm using the GSEA from the broad institute, which requires four inputs. 

So far, I've made a .gct file from the expression data I downloaded from GEO, using the GeoConverter module on GenePattern. 

I'm now lost, I have dicrete phenotype labels but have no idea how to make the required phenotype data file (.cls). I also need the Gene-set database file and microarray chip annotation file. 

How do I find/make these based on what is available on GEO? Or, could someone point me in the direction of something that I can read so I can teach myself what I need to do next. 

Thanks,

6rctle,7,2017-08-03,Housemate flunked out then stuck around for a semester,SAMDOT,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/6rctle/housemate_flunked_out_then_stuck_around_for_a/,"I'm holding onto a lot of pent up disappointment and frustration about this, so I'm hoping that posting here is cathartic for me. I'd like to hear whether this is something anyone else has dealt with, or how they think I should process this experience.

So three friends and I lived in a house for our final year of college at a small school. We all studied humanities and we were all self-described loners who didn't fit into the hipster or social justice crowds at our school. We spent most of our recreation time together drinking, smoking pot, and playing video games.

I spent a lot of time with my housemate who lived across the hall from me on the second floor of our house. He was a military brat who had recently broken up with his girlfriend of three years. We both grew up in sheltered households, we both struggled with depression, and we both played guitar-- many nights were spent together smoking pot on the roof outside my bedroom window bonding over these several shared traits. He would often tell me how jealous he was of the several close friendships that I had acquired at school and the fact that I was so much taller than him (he played basketball in high school). I could never tell if we actually liked each other or just tolerated each other's easy company, but I certainly felt as though I grew to trust him as a companion.

Halfway through first semester my housemates and I went on a road trip into Canada, and after we returned I noticed that the housemate who lived upstairs with me would open the door to his room whenever I left for class or work or food. It seemed like he was always in his room and it really seemed like he always wanted to hang out with me. It irritated me, so I started keeping to myself. Then he started spending each night sitting outside my door playing guitar, acting surprised when I left my room to use the restroom and then seeming offended when I told him that I had other things to do.

My other housemates relayed that he had been complaining about me behind my back, but I didn't think much about it.

By the end of the semester it appeared as though he rarely left his room or spoke to anyone other than his housemates and a couple old friends who visited him in his room. I had told him that I would spend winter break with him in the house, but I was accepted for a short internship. I decided to permanently quit drugs, so I gave him everything I had assuming that it would keep him occupied. When I came back a month later I went to his room to catch up. He had gained some weight and grown a beard. He wore an aloof look in his eyes and he walked as though his pants were filled with lead pipes. Everything about him was distant and slowed. I asked him what classes he had for second semester, he looked at the ground and in a voice that communicated an internal pain he told me that after our road trip he had stopped doing homework, showing up for class, or responding to his professor's emails. On top of previous semesters of failed classes, the school decided to force him out.

He had also stopped going to his job--playing guitar at a nursing home--which convened only twice a week for two hours. He told me that school wasn't for him and he was planning on pursuing his music career that semester, but clearly that wasn't the case. I was shocked that he had kept this from me--and even more shocked when he said that he hadn't told either of our housemates or any of his old friends. He was obviously embarrassed about his situation, and not wanting him to recede into his room any longer I recommended that he be open with everyone because they care about him.

Even more shocking was what he told me next--he was fucking one of my friends (who had a boyfriend at the time)! After she would visit me in my room the previous semester, he invited her into his room and one thing led to another. She had stopped texting me at around that time, and now I found the explanation for that. Hearing him describe the relationship, it sounded like she was using him because he never left his room and her boyfriend would never find out.

The following weeks were filled with disappointment. My housemate never left his room and I constantly heard coughs from his new cigarette habit. When I would invite him on nature hikes or to a local burrito joint he would look at his phone dispassionately and mumble to himself that my friend who he was fucking would show up later. He was never certain, since she showed up unannounced and let herself into his room without knocking, but he knew that the possibility of fucking her was worth not ever leaving his room.

It was weird, I felt a little betrayed by both of them, but I had other ways to spend my time than trying to help this guy or confronting my friend about it. His only interactions with me became rudimentary. Are you driving to the grocery store anytime soon? The cat threw up in the kitchen. Do you know where I can buy more pot? We should go on another fun road trip for spring break.

Any semblance of the thoughtful, creative person who I had acquainted myself with the previous semester had fled deep inside of him, the person I saw now just wanted to get fucked up and saw me as a tool rather than a friend or even a neighbor. Several weeks into the semester I told him something along these lines. I told him that he was depressed because he was leading an extremely unhealthy and self-defeating lifestyle. He looked me in the eyes and groaned ""I know--so should I just kill myself then?"". He acted deeply hurt at the possibility that I looked down upon him because of his choices, and admitted to me that no one in his life was providing him with any sort of guidance or perspective.
A month into the semester my female friend decided to cut things off with my housemate. He then tried to instigate spending time with me in the same way that he did the previous semester, only this time more sloppily. He would swing his door open moments after I left my room or came into the house. I would come home from class, or leave my room to use the restroom, and then his door would open with him staring into my eyes and emitting a feigned startled remark. Often this would happen while I was walking to go do something like pee or go to class, and he acted offended when I didn't engage with him. ""Dude! Did I do something to offend you? There's no need to be so hostile!"" he would call after me, after which he would slink back into his room. When I would talk to him, conversations would always end with him playing guitar to himself or him slinking back into his room.
There was no growth, and he mostly seemed bored with me. I would tell him about my ambitions and interests, and he would mockingly grin and say ""That's not how I think of you"". At night he would hide in his bedroom, but if I wasn't downstairs hanging out with my other housemates he would descend from his room to engage in drinking games or watch sports with them. I would be in my room, and hear him complain about my agitated behavior and random quirks. I don't enjoy watching sports and I quit drinking, and it became a routine that he would spend almost every night watching basketball, baseball, or soccer with my other housemates while drinking.

My housemates stopped speaking to me when they saw me around the house, and when I did talk to them I began to hear that they were all ""concerned"" about my agitation. I literally ignored him and went about my business, and my other housemates were now telling me how ""pissed"" he was at me and how invalid my own feelings were. They knew he had dropped out, but he had told them that it was his decision rather than the school's--and on top of this they didn't know that he was in his room smoking pot all day (and for some reason they wouldn't believe me when I told them). Evidently I was one of the only things that my housemate had in common with these guys other than alcohol, girls, and sports, and he somehow was able to completely antagonize me in their eyes after a few weeks of talking shit about me.

Living in the house became unbearable. Everyone started hanging out with him instead of me, and all my interactions with my housemates led to them reporting about it back to him. I knocked on his door occasionally to see how he was spending his time, and sure enough every day was spent smoking pot and jerking off and every night was spent drinking and watching sports. My housemates, who I had known for years by that point, replaced me with this guy who was always ready to bro-around and get fucked up. My female friend replaced me with this guy who she was able to use when she was bored.

I now see that they were never really close friends to begin with if I could lose them that easily. Literally take away drinking, smoking, talking about sex, and playing video games, and there was nothing left that these people wanted to connect with me over.

I came to this realization with still a month and a half to go until graduation. It was surreal. Like living in a memory that was reinforcing my own inadequacy to keep up (or to be held back) with these people who I knew very well. I spent as much time out of the house as possible, and every confrontation with my housemates reinforced how far off the island I had been exiled.
My housemate from upstairs never applied to go back to school or really got less depressed. I confronted him once near the end of the semester about what I was witnessing, and he immediately became defensive. He said that my ""mask is coming off"" and that I was now sabotaging my friendship with him. And of course soon afterwards I got a text from another one of my other housemates saying that he was told everything that I had just said to this guy. Clearly there was a gossip pipeline constructed around me to justify my unemployed-dropout-stoner housemate's narrative of victimization.

I can't get over how stupid of a decision it was for him to come back after flunking. His parents literally paid for him to get fucked up 24/7 for 6 months! I'm glad I didn't spend more time with him, because he was clearly in a very unhealthy place. I still can't get over that he stole my ""friends"", or that he was so two-faced by talking behind my back. Especially since I gave him so much. It really hurt that our friendship was only a facade for the spoiled codependent child inside of him who wanted to latch onto someone to provide him with meaning.

Now that I'm done with the stoner lifestyle, I feel as though there are so many opportunities to pursue that I would have otherwise been too defeatist or lethargic to even consider. The people who you surround yourself with certainly help define who you are, and finding a sense of purpose in my life naturally cut out the people who didn't fit into my vision of myself.

I think that it continues to bug me because of the sense of loss that I have for these friendships and for how long I spent having to live in that situation. I really hope that his parents will take care of him or that he finds a good role model to follow. I truly hope that, having learned so much about myself, I will never be involved with such a toxic person again.

TL;DR Loner who I befriended and lived with dropped out of school and stuck around the following semester to have one last hurrah before facing real life.

My courseload is pretty tough, since I'm working to be a Stat-Econ major after being undecided my first year. I'm taking Calc 2, Stat 2 (apparently 2 of the hardest classes in my school #help), intermediate macro, and an essay-based class that probably shouldn't be too bad since I'm a strong writer. In addition to that, I'm working on campus, which isn't a crazy time commitment (6hrs/week), but I also do SAT tutoring outside this (~4 hrs/week). My on-campus job is a work-study so quitting isn't really an option either. I'm also rushing a sorority this semester, which is really exciting but also pretty nerve-wracking, and also a pretty big time commitment. I want to be really involved in my sorority, and since I'm going to a big party school, going out most likely will take a big chunk of my time (My grades come first, if my grades slip, I'm obviously going to put this on the backburner first). I'm also treasurer for a club  at my school and write for two papers as well. I also want to work out frequently (ideally every other day but at least twice a week) so I can stay in shape. So question is, how do I effectively manage my time so that I get a high GPA (I'm trying to stay on the Dean's list), have an active social life, and still maintain my sanity (LOL)? I'd say I have decent time-management skills, as my freshman year was absolutely hectic, especially my second semester (somewhat hard classes, finding an internship, really messy falling out with my former best friend, a few family emergencies, typical boy drama, etc...), but I somehow got out alive with a pretty good GPA while having a social life. I did the same extracurriculars freshman year, but worked only 3 hours/week at my work-study, didn't tutor, and wasn't rushing a sorority (you can't rush until you're a sophomore at my school). However, I know that sophomore year is known to be much harder than freshman year, so any additional tips will be really helpful. Thanks and good luck on this coming semester (I'll need it)!"

If I were to wait, it would obviously force me to apply to the currently open internship positions 2-3 weeks from now, would this make a difference at all or does it not matter.

6rdyl6,1,2017-08-03,Looking for advice regarding internship,LewisHoltby,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/6rdyl6/looking_for_advice_regarding_internship/,"Hello WEBDEV! At the moment I’m studying web development in Denmark. I have a year left of my education and in January I need to complete a 10 week internship.

Now, at the moment I’m working as the only developer at a small digital agency where I develop simple web sites. Sometimes this include some minor API implementation, but aside from that the sites are pretty straightforward to set up and oftentimes only requires HTML, CSS, PHP and JS. I use either Wordpress or Grav CMS for content management. We don’t utilize any JS frameworks.

The company I work at has offered me an internship position, but I’m also considering applying elsewhere to get some more experience from other developers and be apart of some larger project which requires more advances technologies. 

As I see it, there are some pros and cons about staying at my company, I’ll try to list a few:

**Pros**

- Big responsibility as I’m the only developer (we also have a web-designer, but he mainly writes CSS)

- I would be able to choose which technologies I want to work with (I already bought a Vue JS and Wes Bos Node.js course, which I could spent some time to go through, we are not going to be taught about these subjects in class)

- I would get paid for the entire period, so I wouldn’t have to stress about money

**Cons**

- I would be the only developer! On my own if I get stuck on something

- I would’t expand my network

- I’m not able to learn from other developers

Would the experience of completing my intership at a large company be worth it or should I stick to the safe choice? I know 10 weeks isn’t a long time, but I’m nervous of not progressing as a developer if I make the wrong decision.

I hope some of you have some insight and have maybe been in a similar situation and are able to give me some advice 🤝"

6rejai,1,2017-08-03,Unconventional path in school - jack of all trades and master of none. Any advice on where to go from here?,Raullie,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6rejai/unconventional_path_in_school_jack_of_all_trades/,"I enrolled community college when I was 21 solely so I could take different classes and find out what I was interested in. At 22, I decided I wanted to get into biochemistry (I became interested in CRISPR and modifying unicellular organisms to synthesize useful compounds), so I started taking biology and chemistry classes at school, but typically only 2-3 at a time, for life/personal reasons.

Looking into career prospects for biochem, it looks like my career options for a B.S. would be limited, especially for a job here in the midwest.  Getting a Masters or phd, I would likely find a job in research (as a lab tech, which doesn't seem fun to me.  Or do my own research, but I'd have to be a great salesman in order to garner investors, which I doubt I'd enjoy)

So I figured bioinformatics would be a better bet.  After reading more online, it looks like the best way to wedge into bioinformatics is through a BS in computer science and eventually move onto a Masters (or just do a bunch of side projects, internships, etc.)

Anyway, I'm 23 now.  I'm getting to the point where I need to be more focused and independent.  I float from hobby to hobby and I'm not sure if me choosing to go for a CS degree is just a continuation of my problem.  I could get a BS in chemistry in 1-2 years and go to a coding bootcamp down the road. Or I could switch to a CS degree and graduate in 3-4 years.

Things I've become very interested in, but feel limited because I don't have formal CS training: Cryptography, blockchain, data science, python, linux, and rtl-sdr.

What I've learned in school thus far:  all my gen ed stuff, math up until Calculus, no physics, and I excelled in organic chemistry, python MOOC, but no formal CS courses.

Any advice on where to go?  My only real goals are for a BS (soon), to learn the things I'm interested in (many of which involve CS), and hopefully find a job that I enjoy.  I may also a bit different from most people interested in CS - I'm not interested in working for google, facebook, amazon, apple.  I admire people like Moxie Marlinspike or M.C. Mcgrath."

I just finished up an internship which lasted two weeks. The team was amazing, as well as the work itself. I really enjoyed myself and learned a lot. I would love to work at this company in the future.


A few days after the internship attended I received a very competitive offer to start working for them next year. I was overjoyed but there is a small problem. In my country a BSc Computer Science is a 3 year degree, whereafter you can complete your honours degree for a year (which is highly recommended). I graduate with my BSc this year but was intending to complete my honours degree next year.

I want to finish my honours degree as it opens up to a lot of other opportunities but also would love to work at this company. Ideally, I would finish my honours next year and work for them the year after. How do I go about letting them know that I am very interested in working there but only in 2019? And would this hurt my chances of getting an offer for a later date?

How should I prepare myself for the coming school year, and what should I do (computer science wise) to keep up to date with everyone else who is attending 4 year uni already?

Edit: for anyone wondering, I am an international student and have yet to take any comp sci related courses as I have a restriction on max credit hours I can take. Because of this, I'm getting other classes like electives, calc, physics, chem etc, out of the way. 

How should I prepare so that I will be able to apply and intern for a company next summer, as well as, not fall behind other comp sci students?"

I was working here last summer and part-time throughout the year, and now I am just about to finish up my internship. Every project that the position works on is like a 2-week hackathon, where there aren't code reviews, and it's about hacking together something to show the customer. In that sense, I don't think it would be a good career for learning or for development. Even more, after having three bosses, and my current boss is a really arrogant, passive aggressively acts like I am dispensable labor, and toots his own horn all the time in meetings about how he has so much technical knowledge (and he's never really had professional software engineering experience, just roles in field sales). Recently I had a meeting with him, as I have a few weeks left of this summer internship, and he asked me if I were interested in joining the role full-time when I graduate. He said I've proved that I can deliver and that naturally I would be at the top of the hiring list. 

My question is, should I just say that I am interested in the full-time role, to possibly have a full-time position in my pocket while I interview around during this upcoming school year? I'm not sure what compensation would be like, as it's a new role, but let's say it's a little lower than market price for SWE. Then, I will either reject the offer or reneg on any agreements I make if I find something better. I don't care about offending my bosses if I have to reneg, as 2/3 of them have come across as sociopathic workaholics, but I am worried that something like this would cause me to burn opportunities to be a real SWE at the company. If I had no other job options, I would take this job just to have an income while honing my skills and searching for a better job."

Everyone here just seems they have a fully kitted out portfolio with amazing side projects, thorough knowledge on data structures and algorithms, and so on.

I've had the fortune of having some good opportunities recently, most notably a job last summer and research this summer that involved using deep learning/neural networks for image processing tasks. When I was thrown into the deep end with neural networks last summer, it was definitely overwhelming but I got to ride on the back of a more experienced PhD student and ultimately learned a lot. Same case this summer: confused about many parts of the project, but benefitting from a lot of help from another PhD student.

Now however I have a lot of random knowledge about neural networks but still have big gaps in knowledge and have only completed one project independently, which was essentially just an NBA in-game win probability model using out of the box logistic regression. I am working as an actuarial intern right now, but that work is all in excel and not what I would qualify as ""data science.""

Do you guys think it would be possible to leverage these experiences to get an internship for next summer?

This is my first ever post here. So, please bear with me while I narrate my tragedy to you!  I completed my sophomore year in May. I'm an ECE major. I have a rather low overall GPA (2.93) all thanks to my surgeries which took 2 weeks time out of my fall and spring semesters each on top of extremely bad position where I couldn't attend classes regularly. So my whole year was kinda a bum. Professors were not much help either. Fortunately I passed with a C in my fall semester major classes (Principles of EE 1 and Digital Design) but because of these 2 Cs, my GPA dropped to where it is right now. In the spring semester I was able to get Bs in Principles EE 2 and Programming 1. C+ in probability. Considering how I was still not in my best condition this was really good for me. I took Systems and signals over this summer with its lab. Got a B in the class itself and an A in lab. However, this hasn't helped my GPA at all. I haven't been able to score any internship, however I did manage to get something like an internship(unpaid) for the summer at a professor's lab where I process data from ocean beds using MATLAB. I work part time at the IT department of my school's library during the school year to pay for my term bill. My problem is that by the time I do get something to put on my resume (such as technical projects from clubs I intend to participate in) it will be too late to apply for any internship. Also, while calculating my possible grades for the rest of my academic career I realized that it will be really hard for me to get to even a 3.0 (which is basically the first requirement to even apply online). I'm a really average student who mostly gets Bs in classes. This is really stressing me out. Do you guys think that I'm out of luck? like would I have to pull miracles out of my ass to get a decent engineering internship or co-op by the end of junior year? Thank in advance for any advice!"

At my school, we would have a bunch of programming assignments, called PA's, and every time I finished a PA, I got this strange indescribable feeling of satisfaction. It made those late night coding sessions all worth it. 

So I got my first internship at a web development company, and it was a great learning experience at first. But as I continued work, I started feeling a little despair every time I walked into the office. Everyday I would get in at 9 oclock and sit in a chair until lunch, and then sit there again until 5. What used to be exciting and enjoyable had become routine, and gray. Whenever I finished a project, I didn't get that strange feeling anymore. Learning new things wasn't as fun as it used to be, and I just felt unsatisfied with myself working there. I enjoyed the people, and the work was challenging, I just didn't get in the zone like I used to. I've been working on my own side projects, and I still get that feeling of accomplishment and drive when i'm doing my own thing, so I know I didn't start hating programming.

Now that it's over, i'm having a serious look at my future in the tech industry. I know there are plenty of companies that have its employees in love with its work like FB, and Google, but I know i'm not good enough for those guys yet. My question is, did any of you lose that little touch of magic you got when you entered the industry? How did you go about fixing your mentality towards your work? I'm not really sure what to ask here, I guess i'm just looking for guidance as a dumb 21 year old who doesn't understand this industry. 

Thanks for listening.


EDIT: Thanks to everyone who took the time to respond. I understand that a big part of this feeling is me being unaccustomed to working in the real world. I am extremely grateful that I found a skill set that I thoroughly enjoy, and do not take mean to sound spoiled. I never intend to leave the industry, even if I don't find the drive I had originally. I just hoped to get some tips and perspectives that might help me find it again."

So I know your cover letter is not your resume repeated, but I like to reiterate that I have skills in the job description, and connect them to a past experience to explain how I know that ""My experience at XYZ taught me how to do ABC"" etc.

I'm looking for nonprofit work and I had internships at various nonprofits but that was years ago, just recently I worked a pretty decent job (relatively) at a computer company where I ran the repairs department - which was pretty involved and more recent. But obviously less relevant.

6ro9uh,1,2017-08-04,Career advice related to A+?,IntroSpeccy,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/6ro9uh/career_advice_related_to_a/,"Hey guys I just had a couple questions hoping to feed off your collective experience. My situation is as follows, I'm 20, living with parents, just started college this month. I want to be in the IT field but I'm not sure in which capacity, so as for right now I'm in general education at my local community technical college. My plan is to do gen ed here, get an associate degree, and transfer to a bigger fancier college to get a bachelors in an IT related program. As you can guess I'm poor otherwise I'd just jump into a fancy college, and I can barely afford the college I'm in now, so here's where my question comes in. Would paying for the A+ certificate be worth it to me as I am now to allow me to get a bare bones entry level IT job somewhere? Because I need to make some money but more importantly I need experience, I had a unpaid internship for 3 days and I thought it was going great. They abruptly told me they had nothing for me to do and after a week of me calling every day to see if they needed me, I decided to show up face to face. They told me I was taking too much work from the paid employees and that I needed to come in less and that they would call me when they had something. Of course they never called back, so my question is what the hell do I do to get an entry level IT position if even going unpaid doesn't work?"
6roklk,2,2017-08-04,"TIFU by hiding the truth from a supervisor, confessing and getting shafted",NervousLittleMe,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/6roklk/tifu_by_hiding_the_truth_from_a_supervisor/,"I went back to school in my 30s and had the chance of a lifetime when I landed an internship at a highly sought after company as part of the graduation requirements.   Problem?   I hadn't passed two exams that were needed to become certified and that, if passed and hired by the company would set me up for a $45K starting salary, pretty decent seeing as I had never cracked $35K before then.

My internship supervisor invited me to join a training class along with a new employee and I felt welcomed as if I was could have a chance to get hired.  However I knew I still needed to make appointments and pass 2 exams.   It was in the training class that the company supervisor asked me, so NervousLittleMe, did you complete the exams?  I foolishly answered: “yes”.  Then the smart younger new hire said, “but the key question is, did you pass them?”, to which I remained silent and just smiled because I didn't want to admit that I failed them after I had almost finished a study program that should have prepared me for them. 

Before completing the internship, the company's supervisor offered to send me on a flight to a destination that would normally cost $3000 round trip since it's remote and there are only a couple of airlines who fly there.   I accepted but was nervous and finally, 3 days before the flight, took the supervisor aside to tell him of my fear of flying.  He gave me a choice.  Go or not and I could let him know the morning of the flight.  I finally chickened out, overslept and texted him that it's a no go 1 hour beforehand.  It was a standby ticket with little cost to them but it was a big opportunity lost.  The internship ended and the employees who helped train me prodded asking if I could qualify as a certified _____ (the job I was training to become) and I said no.  They then asked why not and I explained that I had failed the exams.  One of them was especially gruff, cursed and chastised me for failing.  I was ashamed.

Later on I asked the internship supervisor to be my reference and he accepted.  We periodically kept in touch and I was recently interviewed at a company that requested multiple references  I gave the supervisor's name and contact info, telling the potential employer that he was my top reference and to call him first.   They asked me whether I had told my references that I had given their names as references and I said no, so I knew I had to give them all heads ups really fast.  I touched base with the internship supervisor and, thinking the potential employer might ask whether I had passed some certification exams and found out I failed to reveal the truth, I admitted my white lie to the supervisor.
The result?   He emailed me back and was obviously upset.  He basically wrote that unless I could prove that I had taken steps to overcome my fear of flying AND that I met all the position's requirements that I had applied for, he would not be willing to risk his reputation by giving me a reference.  

So I emailed him back explaining all the steps I had taken including spending money on a therapy session to address flying phobia and research into other solutions, the company names, the costs, etc.  , plus I had to send him a link to the job ad I has applied to and reassure him that yes, I did meet all the requirements and would appreciate him as a reference.   If this guy doesn't come through for me, I won't get the job and right now it's my #1 choice for career development.

**TL;DR**
  
TIFU when I failed to reveal the truth about failing two exams that would have been useful for an internship I did a few months ago, asking for the internship supervisor's help despite this white lie, giving his name to a potential employer I interviewed at, admitting I lied and being grilled by the supervisor about a weakness that would disqualify me from the job.  He made me prove that I had taken steps to overcome this weakness otherwise the supervisor wouldn't want to risk his reputation to recommend me.   He got me defensive and potentially cost me the job all because I failed to respond to his question honestly.  "

I'll just bullet point since I feel too tired to write in paragraphs.

###**Company Information**

* Company is quite highly regarded within the tech industry, but not a common name otherwise

* I interned in a stack that has been and will be increasingly valuable over the next few years

* First internship, some difficulty finding internships otherwise (I'd say lower 50th percentile compared to my peers)

* Non-competitive internship - we had a single-digit number of interns and the company interviews many people every day (actively looking for new employees)

* Company is great to devs, has a phenomenal culture, values self-improvement and feedback


###**Timeline and Feedback**

* 3 month internship

* 1/3rd through, manager mentions company would be interesting in keeping me if I perform well

* 2/3rds of the way I got substantial feedback along the lines of ""surprisingly technically skilled, strong critical thinking/edge case detection, but could improve on certain team-communication aspects, sometimes gets distracted""

* 9-10 weeks in: Other interns have been invited to a feedback event I was not (this is where my suspicion grew)

* (Note: Company environment depends on and attempts to cultivate interpersonal skills)

* No substantial feedback since then

* Internship has significantly improved over the last two weeks but my manager stopped collecting feedback since then (it seems retention decisions are made around this point). I have been enjoying it more.

* Internship ended with no offer; upon asking, manager mentions he would like to see me come back (I don't believe he was speaking for the company here) and tells me to apply online

* No substantive feedback towards end

### **Investigation**

* Talked to an intern from last year: he received his offer within the last week of his internship

* Other interns have received offers

* Thus, the chance of me receiving an offer is low to non-existent

---

**Thoughts**

* Extremely introverted - I rarely talked to anyone (social anxiety). I plan to see a counselor about this, but I am confident I understand the source of this anxiety. It can be remedied with effort, but requires a level motivation that I believe I cannot maintain over the time required

* Social anxiety greatly diminished in (a) purely professional contexts, (b) when I'm talking about something I love, or (c) when I feel comfortable around people (which tends to take ~3 months, unfortunately.) Under some of these contexts, I've been told I'm a great speaker.

* Life isn't purely professional - it is almost certain that continued social interaction with my coworkers revealed a lack of social skills. Regardless, people have enjoyed working with me when we're working on a specific problem - i.e. when actually working, things seem and feel fine. 

* HR has been cold to me from the beginning; manager, directors, and others have been nice

* Reapplying, I would have a much higher chance of acceptance compared to a standard applicant (if I was treated like a standard applicant)

* This is indirect feedback: the company either doesn't want me or consider me a bad culture fit

* Monumental blow to my self-esteem and confidence, especially as most of it is based on a continual self-assessment of my skills/ability/relative ""success""

* Regardless, if I got in, it would be excellent for my career, even if I only stayed for a year or two

* Putting pure analysis aside for a second, I can't help but feel bitter. I feel this would severely contribute to impostor syndrome if I do reapply and get in.

Question for you in title. I'd appreciate your thoughts!"
6rp1io,1,2017-08-04,"Advice on getting into IT? I'm very interested in the field, but my background is in other fields and I have little experience in IT.",theojones3,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/6rp1io/advice_on_getting_into_it_im_very_interested_in/,"I've read the page on the wiki about getting into IT and similar, but I'm creating this thread because I want to bounce some of my thoughts off people. And get some advice about what I can do to break into the field.

A bit more about my background. I have recently graduated from college but in a degree program that isn't IT related (double major of biology and geography). I have taken a few courses that are kind of related (four programming/compsci courses). But most of my knowledge about IT comes from hobbyist work. 

I have a lot of passion about the field, but almost no formal work experience or formal credentials. And from what I can tell from job listings in my area, this will be a massive wall that creates a lot of trouble with me even getting heard out by employers, because even for the entry level help-desk type jobs most job listings want either a degree and/or experience. 

While I haven't gone into the world of creating a full homelab, I've done a lot of similar things as kind of a hobby and for fun (not really to prepare for a career, but to toy around). I've done the basic things like building computers, etc. I've done things like buy some managed switches and set up a home network and toy with vlans and vlan tagging. I have kind of toyed around a lot with building and configuring my own routers etc (pf sense, untangle, a some custom setups on freebsd that serve as a router), on that I've also messed with Snort and such. I've created LAMP setups/email server and gotten some server/cloud hosting space to experiment with various Linux/FreeBSD things, and have built/configured a home linux server (its functionality included a NAS). I've also toyed with Arduinos and Rasberry PIs and such.  A lot of the money I've had to spare for quite a while went into buying equipment for this type of tinkering. And in various forms that type of experimentation with computers goes back to a very young age for me. (Also, while in high-school I did some computer repair/setting up Wordpress pages for people/small businesses, thats about as close as I got to formal employment in IT) 

The previous paragraph was kind of to demonstrate the kind of passion I have had for the field and the type of experience that has lead me to believe IT would be a good career track for me. But its not really the type of experience I can take to a potential employer. 

Some thoughts on what I can do to build my skillset/create something I can take to employers: (are these a good idea?) 

* Create a blog where I write out some of the things I've been doing that is related to IT, and create tutorials and such? This would create a portfolio that I can take to potential employers that would hopefully demonstrate skills.

* Go to grad school in an IT related field? This would provide some time/space to build up internships and volunteer work to show experience, along with time to study the field and pick up certifications. It would also provide me a formal credential to take to employers. While a lot of programs want more experience than I have, I've found some programs that sound promising that may take someone with my level of experience. The con is the cost (grrr. more student loans). 

* If I do grad school, should I be a full time student or a part time student? If I'm a part time student I would be able to have full-time employment concurrent with my degree without completely overloading my schedule. If I am a full time student I would complete my degree more quickly.

* Undergrad degree in IT? Similar tradeoffs as grad school, but there would be less room for financial aid. 

* Get certifications? 

* How is the job market for entry level people in IT? "
6rp73x,2,2017-08-04,Thoughts on asking startup for internship,landotronic,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6rp73x/thoughts_on_asking_startup_for_internship/,"So I'm currently finishing up an online post-bac in CS. One of the biggest issues as far as I'm concerned with the online post-bac is that it leaves little time for internships. An additional hurdle for me is that I currently live abroad and I'm pretty sure getting an internship local to me would be very difficult. 

I do know, and I'm on good terms with, the founder and co-founder of a startup (former PM and peer from my previous employer). So I have domain knowledge in addition to my recently acquired CS skills. I'd like to approach the CEO/founder regarding an internship this fall but I was wondering  how to navigate that process.

My biggest concern is the difficulty of working remotely and doing my duties while in school. I also have a family to add in the mix, but no other obligations. So I see two options:

Option A: Ask to work on something not mission critical, like design a prototype or demo for some future project/feature. I like this idea since it's not mission critical there would be less stress on top of school, family, time zone issues.

Option B: Try to find some way to meaningfully contribute to their ongoing work. I'm a little afraid about the amount of work this could potentially entail. If work at our last job was any indication this could mean tight deadlines and LOTS of hours worked.

Also, how should I approach compensation? If I went for Option A, I'd be willing to do it as unpaid, assuming the tasks were within reason. I'm currently doing side projects anyways, so I'd just shift to doing my internship duties, and I'd get the added benefit of being able to put ""Software Engineer Intern"" on my resume.

For Option B I feel like I'd have to be compensated. If I'm doing real work that people depend on, I'd have to make it much higher priority in my life (I.e. Sacrificing family time, sleep, sanity). However, I'm not sure of the startups financial situation and if they'd even have the budget to compensate me.

Added bonus is the founder received a MS in a non-CS degree from a top 5 CS school, and as a result, every time I search LinkedIn for employees at Big N companies he always has multiple connections. I feel like if I do well and impress him as a SWE, he'd probably be willing to get me in touch with some current employees.

TL;DR - Friends with the founder/co-founder of a startup. Want to ask them for an internship but not sure how to determine work duties and compensation. "
6rpmrt,14,2017-08-04,1 offer and 2 interviews. What do I do?,projectc4,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/6rpmrt/1_offer_and_2_interviews_what_do_i_do/,"So I just got extended the position of an IT intern for an IT consulting firm. However, it is unpaid. I still have 2 more interviews looming on the horizon (August 11 and 14) and they are better than the unpaid internship that was granted to me.

The dates for those interviews are a ways off, so I can't just say ""I need a few days to think about it"" when it's more like a few weeks. Working at the internship that I was offered is my least preferred choice but it would be depressing as hell if I deny the internship and end up not getting offers from the other 2 interviews...leaving me with nothing.

6rpqt9,1,2017-08-05,"Debating dropping engineering or doing two degrees. Need advice, didn't know where to post...",amots,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6rpqt9/debating_dropping_engineering_or_doing_two/,"Hey guys. So I've been a lurker of /r/cscareerquestions  for some time and didn't know where to ask this.

I'm a rising sophomore at an ivy league university majoring in computer science. My last two semesters, I took 3 CS classes (10 classes total) and it was a pretty heavy workload for me (couldn't do many clubs, extracurriculars, or have much of a social life). But for the most part, I did well in all my classes and was fairly interested in the content. Two of the classes I took were microeconomics and macroeconomics; it was my first time taking a course in that discipline and I found it far more interesting than CS.

The university I go to is known for it's business school, so after a lot of thinking, I decided to apply to do a second degree (a bachelor of science in economics) but that'd mean I would need to fulfill all my CS engineering requirements and all the business requirements. It wouldn't be impossible, but it would certainly be tough in my 6 remaining semesters (around 5.5-6 classes each semester). 

A few weeks ago, I found out my dual degree application was accepted but even for the past few months, I've been on the fence if I just try doing this dual degree or dropping engineering (I would still do a CS minor since I'm only 2 classes away). I'm currently signed up to take 5 business classes and 1 computer science class this fall semester which will tell me if I'm really interested in pursuing this business thing, but from past classes/internships, I have a pretty firm belief I'll enjoy it more than engineering. 

So I hope I'm not rambling too much because I really would like advice--even though it may be biased considering the sub I'm asking. Ideally, I would want to get two degrees (a bachelor of science in engineering and a bachelor of science in economics) but even if I'm able to manage that, I think it wouldn't be great because: 

* I wouldn't be able to do many clubs/organizations in either engineering or business discipline which I personally think is the best way to learn
* Considering how little time I had this past semester with two CS courses and three fairly easy courses, I confident I will burn out at some point over the next three years
* I've done a software internship at my high school (just web dev for our school site) and robotics in high school and while I learned a lot and thought the work was cool, I don't know if I can sit at an office all day and figure out why my code isn't working for hours/days/weeks
* Will having an engineering degree be at all valuable/marketable if I go into business or finance? Because if I don't do engineering and have time to do more business classes/clubs, won't that make me a better candidate???

But there are definitely pros too...

* Being an engineer pretty much means I have job security for the foreseeable future
* Having two degrees could make me more marketable???
* I'll get to take higher level CS classes which seem interesting (but will also be a shit ton of work :( )

Anyway, yeah, I'd really just like to hear any advice that anyone has to offer. I'm hoping this post doesn't come off as bragging or anything; while I recognize I'm very fortunate to be in the position I am, I truly don't know if it's a good idea to do two degrees/if I can even handle it. Also, like I mentioned earlier, I don't think I will become a software engineer. Somewhat related, are there any specific jobs that would require both degrees?

Thanks guys"

I have found myself, unfortunately, in the position of being let go however I have roughly 3 months remaining of paychecks from my current employer.

I graduated 4 years ago with a degree in Computer Science; I had a single internship and two years of experience post college with a large company earning just north of 100k in the midwest.

Two years ago I quit my job to pursue a dream of mine (military pilot), however I have been removed from the program and am on track to being separated in the coming months. I have been removed from the program due to a very specific medical issue which is disqualifying for pilot jobs but will not impact my ability to perform in another career field (no conduct/integrity/performance/etc. issues)

My initial goal was to earn a similar salary to my previous civilian position, but either in the south of the eastern coast. After reading on here, and on /cscareerquestions it is clear that this may not be an attainable goal and I suppose my neurosis are getting the best of me.

1) Should I include my time in the USAF on my resume, and if so in what capacity (considering my employment has been completely irrelevant to my chosen career). If I should not include my time there how should I explain my time away from my career to potential employers?

2) As I am stationed on a AF base that is not in either of the regions I would like to live in, should I start seeking employment now; or wait until I have done my time and am able to move to one of the places I would like to live and look for work then?

3) What resources should I be using when finding a job? I am honestly rather nervous after reading some horror stories on the web. I have never found a job through traditional web applications, should I begin applying to menial labor type jobs as well? I would not be happy if my career was killed by this but I guess someone has to be a manager or work in retail/service/construction etc.. I am not opposed to doing pretty much anything but my goal would be to be able to attain my previous income level; if this is not possible I would still like to be able to live comfortably enough to start a family in the coming years."

I'm a rising junior Applied Math major whose taken a bunch of CS classes. I'm trying to go into Software Engineering after I graduate, but I'm afraid that I won't have the necessary experience because I'll be taking a lot of non-CS classes. 

I've done a pair of technical, but not too technical, internships, after my freshman and sophomore summers, where I've mostly used data science concepts rather than more ""traditional"" programming. 

So I'm wondering if I should be trying to get a Fall/Spring internship to make myself a more attractive candidate. It probably wouldn't be at a ""big"" company as I'm sure most of those year-long intern positions have been filled, and I'm way late to the game, but I'm wondering if there's any merit in spending the next few weeks trying to get a position during the year or if I should stay on campus and focus on my efforts on my GPA/research project and trying to get into more CS classes. 

Any help/advice would be greatly appreciated. 

TL;DR: Fall internship or focus on GPA?"

I know that most students on this sub are advised not to focus only on the bigN companies but I don't know if any smaller companies would be interested (or would have the ressources) to get a visa for a foreign student.

6rsdzd,3,2017-08-05,Taking yet another support role?,anotherITbro,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/6rsdzd/taking_yet_another_support_role/,"TL;DR - should I continue my career in IT support at the risk of pigeonholing myself?

Hi all, long-time lurker, first time poster.

So here's my situation. I worked at my University's helpdesk part-time for the past 2 years, doing basic support for the faculty and classrooms. I graduated with a degree in Computer Science in May, and started an IT support internship at a mid-sized (~200 employees) trading firm in Chicago. At this company, I've been learning lots of different things such as scripting, building/managing servers, Active Directory, while also doing basic IT support. 

Recently, they gave me an offer to continue as a full-time employee in a Support Analyst role. Basically, I would be doing what I did during the internship, but full-time. I really like the company and I would love to accept the offer, but I have one major concern. This would be my third consecutive support job in IT. Would that seriously hamper my prospects in moving to other areas of IT in the future? I've always wanted to go down a SysAdmin/Infrastructure type of path, and I'm just worried that when I want to move up and start searching for other jobs, they would see my string of Support roles as a negative. 

Any advice on this matter? Please tell me if I'm being naive."

I feel like the first year would be best in terms of me not having two many commitments, however, I won't be done with lab rotations by the time I'd have to apply, and I will not have chosen a home lab. My CV will also be kind of lackluster since I don't have any first author publications yet and I'd probably have to use old reccommenders.

The second year I think could only work if I somehow got my qualifying exam/oral defense done in the spring before that summer, or else it would delay my qual by a lot and then delay my research.

In the later years I will hopefully have a first author paper by then, but I wouldn't want to go when I'm close to being finished, or when I'm in the middle of some long animal experiment if that happens, so I'm not sure what would be best?

I'm also not even sure if my PI would allow me to do this, though I still don't know who my PI will be yet because of rotations. My current one once had a student intern in the summer doing part time teaching and part time lab work, but I don't think I want to stay in this lab.

Thoughts?

I'm currently working on my resume. I am looking for a part-time job, just about anywhere in the IS/CS/IT/etc field, that'll pay decently and give me more experience as I go through school.

I'm somewhat self-conscious about my resume because I feel like I don't have a lot of experience... This internship has been great, learned a TON, but I'm still worried it's not enough.

Been looking over some of the posts here before I posted anything. This is what I have right now after some work:

http://i.imgur.com/k48d0QK.png

I am looking for any and all suggestions.

In addition, I had some other questions.

* What is the feeling on colors in resumes? Something low-key, tasteful, not overwhelming?
* My first go round in college, I did great for the first 2 years, got an associates, then went to a 4-year college and my life fell apart so I dropped out in the first semester there. Now, I'm back. My first two years were essentially all A's. All my classes since I've been back are A's. *However*, my college still counts the old classes I failed, so my GPA is around 2.8-2.9... It's 10 years old now. What should I do about this?

Thank you."

Long time lurker here but I am currently in a bind as to what to major in in college. I am going to be a freshman this year at a top ten school for engineering (according to US news anyway idk if that really means anything haha). 

Anyway, I have always been interested in math and science in high school and I have recently become very interested in computers and have picked up python (and am also in the process of learning some C++). However, I haven't been around software long enough to know whether I am truly passionate about it. 

My ""plan"" as of a few months ago was to major in either electrical engineering or computer engineering so that I can have a flexible career path/path to grad school. I have read that EEs and CEs are hired for software work all the time (but not really vice versa). Therefore, since I have enjoyed software thus far but am not sure if I want to work in software, I figured I would major in one of those two majors and then choose what to do with my life a few years from now. 

However, the other day, I was looking at my schools' released stats about internships and I sort of freaked out when I saw the starting salaries of EEs vs CS students. I know that I shouldn't only care about salaries but according to the report tons of CS students are hired into large tech companies in the Bay Area while most if not all EEs end up working in manufacturing in the midwest (I would definitely prefer the former). 

So my main question is whether majoring in EE or CE would put me at a severe disadvantage vs CS majors from my school when applying for prestigious internships/jobs in the software field or if large tech companies in SV don't really mind if someone has a similar major to CS as long as they have some sort of relevant experience in the field.

Another option would be to major in EE/CE and try for CS is grad school if I decide to pursue software but idk how feasible/common that is.

Thanks so much in advance for reading through my little freakout and sorry for being a complete newb!  :)

6runty,50,2017-08-05,KS - I am a senior student nurse who was thrown out and trespassed from the hospital where I was doing my internship.,throwaway_student_RN,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6runty/ks_i_am_a_senior_student_nurse_who_was_thrown_out/,"Last week I was informed by administration that I was reported for ""unprofessional behavior"" by my preceptor at the OBGYN unit where I was doing my capstone. Additionally, the preceptor stated that I was ""bragging"" about my performance during school and my post-grad employment. My program requires that the clinical instructor and preceptor meet and discuss my progress. At my last review, I was given excellent marks and my preceptor stated that I am doing ""exemplary work"". 

I am unsure what transpired between that review and now, but my preceptor has reported me to the unit and school. I have been removed from my internship and trespassed from the hospital. I am confused by this because I've never behaved unprofessionally. I take my schooling seriously - I'm finishing my program with a 4.0, for example. There have never been any accusations like this at any time in during my BSN.

The school administration is working with me to find a new placement, and appear to be as flummoxed regarding this situation as I am. However, they also stated that whether I stay in a placement is ultimately the choice of the facility. As it stands, administration feels it is likely that I will be placed into a new internship January 2018 with the next cohort of student nurses.

This removal of my internship stands to cause significant harm to my career. I am unable to graduate without meeting the required internship hours, and I am currently 48 hours short. I have a job waiting for me. I don't see this issue addressed in the [Kansas BON Legal Issues for Student Nurses](http://www.ksbn.org/forms/legal_isues_ref_packet.pdf), [KS Nurse Practice Act](http://www.ksbn.org/npa/npa.pdf), or [Kansas Association of Nursing Students](http://www.kansasnursingstudents.org/).

My concern is that this has the potential to damage my professional reputation as well as create undue financial harm. If I am unable to graduate, I will be unable to be licensed or work. I need to disclose this to my future employer, which may adversely impact future opportunities with them. 

What would I need to show damages from this instance? As a student nurse, do I have any rights to information regarding the specifics of why I was removed? Do I have any legal recourse? What should I be researching? Where should I be focusing my efforts? 

If you can help, please let me know. Thank you so much."

I'm currently going into my senior year of undergraduate where I'm majoring in mechanical engineering with minors in material science and mathematics.  I have a high GPA of 3.8 and I am involved in plenty of clubs and projects outside of class.  However I was unable to get an internship during the summer.

I was talking to some of my professors and to engineers that work in industry and the general consensus is that engineers can only go far with just an undergraduate degree, and that going to graduate school would be a good move career wise. Is this true?

I was thinking about going into graduate school for my masters right after completing my undergraduate.  But one of my fears was that is that if I went into graduate school right after undergraduate I would be over qualified for an entry position job especially since I did not have an internship during the summer. Is this something that I should be worried about?

Then the other thing that I was thinking about getting a masters degree in mechanical engineering with a concentration in the material side of the degree.  I have really enjoyed the classes that combines both mechanical engineering and material science and I was wondering what types of jobs that I should be looking at when I get out of school.

Do you think this is something I should ask my employer? Is this too forward or desperate? Or do you think is it too early for a company to promise a position so far in to the future? I also don't want to leave a bad impression.

I have just received an offer to work in a slightly larger company in SF still ~50 employees or so. (Customers include : DropBox, Oracle, Cisco, Dell, Ge)

It would be for 4 months in the Fall so I would have to take the entire quarter off. However, the money isn't quite the issue (based on 75k salary) but was wondering if this would really benefit me and more importantly my resume. But the real goal for me is to join a Big 4 for a summer internship program.

I have been selected for final rounds at Microsoft for next summer. 

Interning at Microsoft for a summer or two is all I want. Is it still to beneficial for me to take this fall job? 

I feel like it will be easier for me to get interviews this year but maybe this fall internship would help with summer 2018 recruitment?

I just finished an overview I guess of data structures, their methods. Also multithreading, basic networking. 

Should I start with a new language or keep going in java??? And If I should keep going in Java what should I begin studying next? Also any example (preferably advanced, that would impress internship employers) projects that I can work towards as I'm studying ahead.

For a bit of background, I'm going to be a 3rd-year Computer Science major at UCSD. Performance wise, I haven't slacked off in my classes, but I haven't been as dedicated as some of my fellow peers. I had known that I needed to get a headstart on side-projects, but I never felt that I could think of something original to start since I didn't want to put something on my resume that many others have coded before and optimized already. I've also tried following youtube tutorials through projects, hoping that I would learn the skills and language on the way, but it felt too much like copying code, so I dropped those quickly. I finally set myself to work on a little food tracking app to help manage my fridge, since there were multiple occasions in which something had hidden in the deepest ridges of my fridge before I had discovered it due to the foul smells that emerged.

What I'd like right now is some guidance on what I can do after this project to maximize my chances at getting an internship the following summer, hopefully solidifying my chances at a job right after I graduate. Otherwise, I fear I'll have to go for a master's if the job search runs dry. I currently don't have any ideas for projects, and I was wondering from your experience, are there any projects out there that have been done by others that show great ability even when recreated?

With regards to campus organizations and hackathons, I haven't taken part in either due to my fears of letting my team down.

Here's my resume to showcase the culmination of my worries, I really have nothing to put there as all of my projects have been coursework so far: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1-W_kpRxvquRXN4cEp6X0hSS2c/view?usp=sharing

As we're still young (I'm 22 and he 25), I am worried about if I am ready for this. On the one hand, I know he is exactly the kind of person I want to be with. We make each other better and have helped each other when no one else could have. On the other hand, I don't know if I'm ready to put that single life behind me. Six months isn’t a long time, interactions with people are so different now than when I was single, and a long list of “what ifs” and “the grass is greener…”.

3.6 undergraduate GPA from fairly selective, unaccredited planning undergraduate program

Internship experience with mid-sized suburb; worked re-writing Development Code and Moderate Income Housing Element of General Plan (getting LOR from Comm. Dev. Dir. there)

1 year experience as GIS Technician for natural gas company (getting LOR from boss there)

Two summers of seasonal construction/landscaping work for local city's Parks and Rec department; was crew lead by second summer 

Volunteer experience as co-author of Main Street Economic Development Plan for a struggling small town with decent tourism draw; plan was published and implemented by Planning Commission

So with my school choices and my credentials, is this a pipe dream? Realistically, I'll at least need *some* funding wherever I go, just because of my financial situation. Are these a good list of schools to apply to, and if not, where should I apply instead?

I've been thinking about posting this for some time, but I wanted to avoid a possible wall of text. So, you can say I've been planning this post for a while.

Here's a quick introduction, in bullet points for better reading:
* I'm 32 years old, single and living in my parent's place. it's not really bad as I got my stuff, they like having me near plus location is amazing.
* I do not own a car - which tells a lot about my financial situation - but I am not in debt. Actually, I never used a credit card ever.
* I have a degree in Modern Languages, can speak European Portuguese and English almost fluently.
* In the past I have worked as a Translator (got bored), a Software Tester (only manual, turned out to be not really my thing), a Helpdesk agent (so much frustration, not enough certification!). At the moment I'm working in CS - mostly backoffice - and it's been okay. I've tried to go freelance but couldn't develop a routine and discipline, so I ended up getting a typical 9 to 6.

Here comes the middle section:

I always loved computers. I loved everything about them, the hardware, the software, most things in between... I just freaking loved it, and still do. However, I grew up knowing that I could never be a computer engineer as I wasn't really into math. But I was quite good with English so I just went with it. Also enjoyed the technicalities of language - linguistics -, and enjoyed Philosophy and Psychology. 

Then, I went to university... and hated it. But completed it because didn't like to quit stuff and didn't really believe I had options. I did enjoy English Linguistics - specially learning about functional grammar (so freaking cool). Months later, I got an internship as a Technical Translator. Computing was my thing, and wanted to add some scientific fields and develop something from there.

And I started making awful decisions. I tried a Masters in Translation but wasn't in the right mindset - I've been suffering from Major Depression for ages and wasn't being treated. Somehow ended as a Tester and realized that translation was kinda.. boring. So I decided to be honest with myself and started a painful journey of let's-figure-out-my-ideal-career. 

By December 2016, when my life was in pieces, going in an awful familiar crisis and feeling suicidal at least twice a week, I found this TED talk about Multipotencialites, and I finally figured out why I couldn't choose just one thing. I always disliked the idea of spending a lifetime doing the same thing, plus I just enjoyed learning stuff, analysis and solving problems. Decided to investigate this thing, started reading about 'scanners', 'generalists' and 'polymaths'', and for the first time in my life I started feeling confortable with my weirdness and decided to learn more about myself, what made me tick. So I sat down and started to elaborate a plan.

I picked something that it's been fascinating for me for a long time - computer science - and started relating it with my past work and life experience. Other thing I've been wanting to seriously getting into was Linux and Open Source. Started making a list and connecting everything... and today I just decided to draw everything and show it to you.

The conclusion:

At this moment, I am working on a (possible) future proof plan. After dismissing stuff like Web Development and System Administration/DevOps, THIS is what I want to be doing in the following 5 years. It still looks overwelming, but at least it's a start.

Would love to hear your opinions, and I can reply to any question. For instance, I know it's crazy someone from a Humanistics background going to a more technical and mathematical field. But some years ago I found out I actually enjoyed Maths and I've been relearning using Khan Academy.

You can see my plan here:
[my 5 year plan](http://i.imgur.com/ewqRQM5.jpg)

EDIT: Just realized 5 years would not be enough to complete everything. Heck, not even a lifetime. So let's say this are the things I want to focus *during* the next 5 years."

I'm living with family so my expenses are minimal, and I'll probably be able to save up at least $35,000 by next summer. I would really like to begin investing in ETFs with a CCP portfolio ASAP so that I can begin working my way towards achieving financial independence in my 30s or 40s (I'm currently 25).

However, one of my internships will be with an American company and I have high hopes that they'll extend a return offer for full-time work after I graduate (from what I've read, about 75% of interns get these offers). If this happens, I would happily move to the US but I would definitely plan on returning to Canada after at least 10-15 years. However, all the advice I've come across suggests that US residents should avoid owning TFSAs and Canadian mutual funds and ETFs to avoid tax complications.

Given that I might need to liquidate my holdings in a little over a year's time, would it be unwise for me to start investing now? If so, what should I do in the intervening time to make the best use of my money?"

I have had no experience in jobs outside of working camps for kids. I am graduating a semester late so I still have 3 semesters left and I am looking for a summer internship or job and am getting really stressed out about my complete lack of skill and knowledge it seems compared to other people competing against me. I have this upcoming season left and then I can spend a lot more time focused on other aspects of my life but for the most part for the past 17 years I haven't been able to do anything except focus on my sport and things related to that. I do school and my sport and that is it. But that isn't to say I am lazy or not busy. I am extremely hard working because you have to be. Balancing school and my sport is tough. Many days I wake up at 7 AM and don't get done with my day, and don't get back to my bed until 9 PM. Consistently. 

I guess what I am getting at is I have absolutely no idea what I want to do in life as a job. I never got the chance to experience what I really like outside of my sport. I enjoy making videos and taking pictures, but I don't think I am above the competition. I feel like the skills I am learning in college are hardly transferable as a Business Management major, and if they are taught, they are taught to pass a test and not for actual career experience. I have no idea where to start looking for a job. I also feel as though I am at a disadvantage compared to other people who have actually been focusing on their careers and schooling. I was always told that people who are looking to employ LOVE student athletes but I haven't found that to be the case at all. I'm really just looking for some pointers on how to start my career, and I'm sorry if this is vague. Has anyone been in similar shoes? "

I would definitely recommend the program to anyone looking to get into coding. There is no such thing as a silver bullet. Coding is hard and no program is going to be able to guarantee 100% of the people who take the class are going to get it. That being said I think a lot of the people who take these programs might be doing it for the wrong reasons. You have to have a passion for software development to be a coder. It is hard. It takes dedication. And sometimes a lot of lost sleep and extra  hours to master your craft. And that is what coding is. It is a craft. Not a job, or a gig, or a skill you are naturally born with, but a craft that you must take on a life long journey to perfect and master. You can't master that craft in a 6 month bootcamp, but Rutgers can set you on the right path for you to continue mastering that craft in the future. The program will give you the tools, it is up to you to get into the driver seat. The passion has to come from within yourself. 

Can I get a job after the program? 

The short answer is yes, but you have to put in the work. Make no mistake. The only person that can get you a job is you. That being said, people have had success after the bootcamp. I recently interviewed a grad from their first cohort and he spent a year after graduating doing freelance and internships but he didn't give up or get discouraged, he kept hustling and kept learning and now has a 6 figure role that he loves. you can check out the interview here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M45gObOJqVw 

In this interview with Mark Awai, full stack react developer, who recently broke into tech without a computer science degree. We talk about his experience both before and after the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp Program and how he landed his first full time developer role. Want to learn how to get a job after a Coding Bootcamp? Mark tells us about his year long journey after a coding bootcamp, his struggles with internships and how he eventually landed a full time well paying role at a multi-national, publicly traded, billion-dollar company.

I read tons of code, but haven't written a single line of code myself. My debugging skills are very solid and I've learned how to effectively navigate a big codebase (my Eclipse workspace has roughly 16k Java classes) to identify bugs and where I need to be adding code, but writing the code itself is still rough.

6s3bur,16,2017-08-07,Am I wrong for lying to my parents about my temporary summer job?,insomniyah,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/6s3bur/am_i_wrong_for_lying_to_my_parents_about_my/,"As we all know, it is Summer right now. I'm 18 and I currently work in a cafe as a seasonal job. I've been working for 3 months since the semester has ended. I actually planned on quitting within 2 more weeks because college is going to start again in 3 weeks. The main reason why I'm working is because it's the fucking Summer and I rather be keeping myself busy in the outside world instead of staying at home all day, listening to my parents and do completely nothing. 


My parents expects me to find a job in an office because according to them, an office job is ""respectable and they make a lot of money."" They also expect me to find some internship already... I just finished my first year of college and I'm currently in an undeclared major and they're fully aware that I'm undeclared. I'm still taking a bunch of required courses and then I'll finally declare a major. So far I've actually considered to major in either Business Administration or Teacher Education. I totally can understand why they view ""office"" jobs something respectable, but it's obviously not easy to find an office job so easily... So I took the easy way out and worked in a cafe that my friend offered. The pay is actually really good for a temporary job. But I honestly don't care about the pay much. Again, I'm only working so I can do something in the summer and have some experience. I honestly can see myself building up better commutation skills from working these past 3 months. 


But here's the problem, I've been lying to them and told them that I'm working in an office and doing some paperwork. Before I've even started to work, I told them that I got accepted to work in a cafe. But obviously, they didn't approve that and believed that ""it's a trash job"" and threw a lot of negative crap on me... But that didn't prevent me from declining the job offer . So I ended up lying to them and said that ""I've interviewed at an office and got accepted as a receptionist"". (I've actually applied to many different places as a receptionist but none have actually accepted me"".) Anyways, they actually approved the fact that ""*I'm working as an receptionist""* when I'm really not. So again, for these past 3 months, they've been believing that I'm working in an office but in reality, I've been actually working in a cafe. 

I've been lying to them because I didn't want to deal with their negative shit everyday and let them yell at me **every single damn day** about my current real job because I know they will. I know my parents too damn well. 

Today, my mom went through my bag, and found my check and saw the address of my job and looked it up and found out that I was working in a cafe all along. Then for the past 4 hours, my mom and dad kept saying that ""I'm no longer interested in school and I'm gonna drop out just because I'm working in a fucking cafe"". I've told them so many times that **""I""M ONLY WORKING FOR 2 MORE WEEKS"".** And then my dad brought up crazy assumptions saying things like ""I'm probably working as a prostitute or a stripper or some dirty slutty job"". (I don't even know why he even thinks like that). Plus I only work in the day and get at home around 4PM. They get crazy mad when I get back at home at 8PM. The sun doesn't even set at 8PM. Plus, I hardly go out with my friends because of how crazy strict they are. And the most I'll go out with my friends is at least 2-3 times a month which isn't even a lot and I always get back at home around 7 whenever I hang out. 

My dad goes crazy when I hang out with friends. I don't hang out with people who do drugs and shit and he thinks that all my friends are terrible people and I'm gonna end up being a druggie. Honestly, I feel like my parents just want me to be someone antisocial with no outside life. 

It just doesn't make any sense to me that  they want me to be able to find some ""respectable office job"" immediately when I barely have any fucking experience.... So am I actually wrong for lying to them the entire time?? 

**ADD ON//EDIT:** My parents told a lot of my family and friends that I'm working.  I forgot to add something else ridiculously  important but when I started to work I told them that I'll treat them out for lunch and dinner when I make a little more. So JUST MY **MOM,  DAD, AND LITTLE BROTHER.** 

But then they ended up fucking telling everyone else in my family that, **""I WILL TREAT MY GRANDPARENTS, 3 AUNTS AND UNCLE, AND 2 MORE FAMILY FRIENDS""**. 

Now that REALLY pissed me off because I didn't make enough money to treat everyone else for dinner. And then they decided to compare me with my cousin who is currently a registered nurse who makes about 30~60dollars an hour and I'm just here getting paid 16dollars an hour.  She was the only cousin who have actually CONSIDERED to treat everyone in my family because she can actually make a living and has an actual career. 

I wouldn't have mind as much if I was to treat my other family members if I worked a bit longer.  But I just think thay my parents are so retarded to actually think that I make a lot of money.  And they're actually fully aware the that I make 16 an hour despite that I'm working in a cafe. "

I posted a little while back on a different subreddit about jumping ship from a B.A in Marketing to A.A.S in C.I.T primarily because the prospect for jobs with a business degree is pretty laughable, I haven't even been able to find an internship despite having 3 years of freelance experience with dozens of companies (I wouldn't be surprised if this was entirely because of me, even though I don't know how). But anyway, I recently switched programs and will be starting in a few weeks, and should realistically be finished around this time next year with a full course load and winter/summer classes.

So here's my question, below I will add a list of certificates provided by the school (required to move to higher level classes), and I'm just wondering which of these are actually looked at by employers. Obviously all of them will be listed on my resume, but I'm just curious as to what the standards are. And further, how far into the program should I expect to be before being able to find an internship/helpdesk/entry level position to work side-by-side with my degree program.

Certificates:
* CompTIA A+
* CompTIA Network+
* CCDA
* MCSA
* CompTIA Security+
* CompTIA Convergence+
* CompTIA Project+
* CompTIA Server+
* CCNA

Now looking at this list seems like an awful lot of exams to be taking over the course of the next year/year and a half. Is it actually possible for this to be done so quickly? According to my audit and meeting with the head of the program they said it's the most likely option, however it seems like it's a lot.

Thanks in advance, I look forward to hearing everybody's insight! "
6s3zup,1,2017-08-07,"Get my graduate degree by 21, or stick with a Bachelors?",xienn,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/6s3zup/get_my_graduate_degree_by_21_or_stick_with_a/,"Apologies if I worded the title incorrectly, very low on sleep atm—

I'm going to be a high school freshman (14) in a week, and will be taking classes at my local CC. I've really been looking into computer engineering for the past couple years (built and serviced computers with my step-father since I was 5). That may play an  important role in my decision, not sure. 

I have two majour decisions to make:
Option 1) I can get my AS (Associates of Science) during high school, and possibly graduate early senior year as well; go onto a college for undergrad degree, finish and get an internship; continue into my master's degree and finish college with a grad degree and experience at 21 (I've heard and read that CE generally requires  higher levels of education for the large, corporate brands that I'd like to work in.)

Option 2) Coast through high school without worrying about AS, get regular bachelors (or masters later in career.)

Obviously I will have AP classes + extracurricular in addition to the college classes, but those aren't as large of a commitment as the associate.

Ideally, I'd like to be making atleast $120-130k mid career, comfortable home/apartment, no children, built 401k and emergency fund, stock options, and enough money left over for toys. Credit will (hopefully) be built up intelligently to ensure I have the lowest APR possible if I'd like to purchase something that may require financing (e.g. a car.)

Advice? Which option should I go with? I'm leaning towards option 1 as I know I have the motivation and work ethic, and it will likely give me the most payout quicker, but it is also tedious and dangerous as I could put myself in a struggling experience/financial situation.

6s4efs,3,2017-08-07,J1 Visa Wanted: Dead or Alive - Tips for finding a Traineeship as an Engineer in the USA,old_school_gearhead,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/6s4efs/j1_visa_wanted_dead_or_alive_tips_for_finding_a/,"Hi everyone! 26yo male from Spain here willing to live the dream of working in the USA.

**About me**

* Engineering degree obtained last year, field: Industrial Organization but with a 6.65/10 (don't have a GPA equivalence since those vary depending on each subject and European universities are graded differently), how could this degree be called in the US, *Management* Engineering? *Production* Engineering? *Industrial* Engineering?

* Desired job paths: logistics (imports &amp; exports would be cool too), supply chain, operations in manufacturing plant... As you can see, industrial themed jobs

* Skills: English C2 level, Spanish native level (duh), Japanese A2 level, know a fair bit of cars but more on the DIY repair side of things

* I'm decided to live in the US and J-1 Visa looks like a good starting point since I'm not subject to the 2 year rule nor be applying for any fundings, have set myself the goal of being a legal resident in the US (H1 visa will do) by the age of 30 - only 3.5 years left now

* Don't mind getting my hands dirty for the job, even like it and would rather prefer it to a desk job!

* Not afraid of working in non-hyped states (California, NYC...), I like Southern states but don't mind the cold, so I'm open to pretty much anywhere

* Dream job: importing cars to the US and being able to help the import community with gems that where never available in the US (preferably from Japan now that most 90's cars are beginning to have more than 25 years and are legal to bring in)


**Current situation**

After finishing my degree last November, found a trainee position which didn't pay well nor had any future, once it finished I'd be kicked in the butt. Stayed for 5 months while looking for full-time jobs and ended in an IT company on the R&amp;D department giving support. Not my cup of tea, but a paying job is what I needed even if it wasn't related to my job prefernces (note that no programming is required for my position). Now it's been 3 months and I'm starting to question myself whether it'd be a good move staying at this job, since it's not related to what I want and the longer I stay the longer I'll drive away from my career and get deeper in the IT sector, which I don't dislike but would prefer other more ""active"" jobs (while on my traineeship I worked in a rig factory organising services employees, not related to the production of rigs, and would regularly go down to the production line) that are more involved to the manufacturing process or logistics. Have been gauging my superiors with being at the production plant of the company, but looks like it'll never happen since they are always short on people in R&amp;D (it's a good first salary but no raises and people are earning the same as me after 7 years working there, they just specialise so much that only niche companies value their acquired experience)


**The gameplan**

Have contacted agencies that will get you a traineeship in the US and manage the J1 Visa process, it's a bit expensive and they don't guarantee a salary, are more oriented to management positions and not so much to industrial ones **AND** some have told me that the 1 year field related experience must be from a full-time job and others have told me that my internships and traineeships also count towards that 1 year field related experience, have contacted my local US Embassy and they don't want to give a firm answer, stating that it'll depend on the interview when applying for the Visa. This doesn't bother me too much since my plan is, if I go through with the agency it'd be by fall '18 so that I have enough time to save enough money to survive on an unpaid job throughout the duration of the traineeship and as a bonus I'd already have more than a year of full-time experience. (If you know any legit agencies that do this job placement thing, feel free to share it, any help is appreciated :) )

The other option is finding myself a traineeship, looks like it'd be easier to get a paid traineeship this way, but I'm having difficulties on getting companies attention. Already have an ""American-style"" resume, an old ex-girlfriend living in the US who helped me with this, but don't want to pull any favours since she's having difficulties finding a job herself but I don't seem to be trainee-material for companies.
So far I haven't had any luck, call it bad luck, poor academic performance or not worth the hassle of a Visa. I have tried formal motivation letters as well as ""passionate"" ones (stating that my dream is this and my passion that).


**Why the J1 Visa and not an H1B?**

I'm going the J1 Visa route since I think it'd be the easiest way of securing a job in the US, I'm also applying to full-time jobs but don't mind starting from the bottom on a job and I believe it's a way easier Visa to get than an H1B due to limited numbers and so.


**After all this rant, what do I want?**

Basically any tips and pointers, websites dedicated to traineeships (engineering ones are a plus!), best approach when looking for traineeships, previous experiences, opinions and anything you think could help.


**Bonus question**

How plausible do you think it'd be going to the US for 3 months (ESTA limit) and searching for a job during those 3 months? Some friends have told me that having a national telephone number helps and in that period of time I should get some results, but this is kind of an all-in option, as it would mean dropping my current job and maybe too high-risk for my taste."
6s4nvm,2,2017-08-07,"Hi Reddit, I am going to hand in my notice at work but I need a convincing reason to support my resignation - any advice?",VioletThunderX,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/6s4nvm/hi_reddit_i_am_going_to_hand_in_my_notice_at_work/,"I am 22/f working at an international firm. The job is terrible, very recently someone from a different department was rude and aggressive while talking to me and I am deeply unhappy.

I am considering resigning by the end of this month and I need help supporting my resignation with a convincing reason. Let me explain why this is important. I was an intern at this firm for 6 months and was told that based on my performance during the internship I'd be offered a full time position. Around May, I asked the HR if I would be getting the full time position since: a) I moved to this city for this job and I need to renew my lease soon otherwise I wouldn't have a place to stay b) I would definitely like to look for another job if they weren't going to give me one since I wasn't going to be unemployed.

The HR rep at that time didn't make any promises but she said that there's a ""big chance"" I'll be given a permanent position. So I decided that I should send out my grad school application (in case I don't get the job) and look for an apartment with a three month lease so that I can move home if the need arises. Shortly after I applied, found a new apartment and started a job hunt I hear from the company and they tell me I have the permanent position. I thought things are finally working out but they got worse.

Ever since I started as a permanent employee the work pressure has been intense. I'm at the bottom of the food chain but I'm doing 2x more work than people higher up. This is odd for the field I work in. I'm handling three major projects and sometimes I work 11 hours a day. Because I was an intern previously, I have a lot more experience than the people who are straight out of college and starting work as full time employees. 

Within two weeks, I was extremely stressed and very unhappy. I didn't enjoy the work anymore. Adding to this, my parents found out I had applied for grad school and they think I should pursue a master's. So they keep advising me to move in that direction. 

So now I am in a dilemma because I haven't heard from the university yet (I hear from them in the first week of September) but if I wait that long to hand in my resignation, it won't leave me enough time to finish all the formalities needed to move to a different country and attend uni (I'm an international student). So I decided to take a gamble and quit in August, serve my one month's notice till September and then move home early October (if I get accepted into uni)/ start a new job.

It's a big risk, I know but I feel like it's a risk I need to take. I don't see a future in this company, I already low key resent the people I'm working with and I just don't feel like I'll have much growth here.

My employment offer says that I can hand in a resignation any time without any reason but I know the HR rep is going to ask me for one because : a) I had initially shown interest towards the job b) quitting after a month is really odd. How it works is, after I resign, the partner approves it and from the date of approval I serve my notice. Between me sending in my resignation and the partner approving it, it's the HR who handles everything so I am just afraid that if she feels that I blindsided them (which I think she will), she might take weeks to forward it for approval. And it'll be a bitter situation I don't want to be a part of. She's had words with two other people who quit because they wanted to pursue higher education right after accepting their jobs so I know that doesn't sit well with her.

So what reason can I give for quitting suddenly? I feel that it has to be something out of my control, something neither she or I can fix that will ensure everything is done in time and I leave by 1st October (my lease finishes end September and if I renew it I'll be here another 3 months). 

The alternative to not serving my notice is paying a month's salary to the company - money I do not have atm. I'm really confused and I dunno what to do. 

Thank you for reading."

I'm currently enrolled in a CS Undergrad course and will be coming out of it next year. ( 2018 ). One thing straight is I love mathematics. Anyways let's proceed with the actual confusion. I'll be coming out next year. Then what?

These are my options and I'm oscillating between them from a week. ( ..no sleep )

* Go forward and get a Master degree on Computer Science specializing on computational neuroscience and vision. ( perceiving systems ). Then a PhD in Computer Vision or Computational Neuroscience, squeezing academic and industry internships. Later on join academia, research.

* Go forward and get a Masters in Mathematics, PhD follows. ( in differential topology ). Post Doc work for some years and then join a top University as a faculty, teach, research. Fun.

* Go forward and with Masters in Mathematics and Physics and then a PhD in String theory, ( as string theory requires a lot of math in particular group theory, category theory, differential and algebraic topology and gauge theory which I'm into and had brief exposure with particle physics as in internship( mostly was writing code and analysis in ROOT (with CERN, remotely) ( C++ ) ). Then join CERN or an University, teach, research.

Alright. Now my skills and knowledge.

Knowledge.

* Mathematics: I am proficient in engineering math ( linear algebra, calculus I, II, III, ODE, PDE, discrete math, basic statistics and probability ). Also I I have a solid grasp on introductory group theory, algebraic and differential topology, real analysis. Software side, I know Matlab well.

* Physics. I know high school physics well. I also had gained knowledge of particle physics during the internship but on an introductory level. That's it.

* Computer Science: I have taken the fundamental course during my undergrad. ( OS, compiler design, Database, C++/Java/C, Algorithms, Data Structures, basics of automata theory, optimization, computer graphics, electronics ). I am proficient in C/C++, I can manage Java.

* Biology/Neuroscience: I know high school biology well. I have taken the Harvardx, MOOC ( Fundamentals of Neuroscience) ( https://www.mcb80x.org/ ).

* Projects and other stuff: Computer Vision: I have worked on AR UI interfaces ( and currently writing a paper on this with my classmates) and currently working on eye tracking. Computer Graphics: I have worked on fluid simulations, multigrid solvers and image synthesis techniques ( PBR ), raytracing. Apart from this I used to code competitively and had gone to zonal ACM-ICPC level but now I have sort of lost the touch of it.

I want to go into academia. ( maybe research R&amp;D departments of companies for a short time just a have a dip into the industry. )
Thank you."

I am also on mobile so I apologize for the inevitable spelling and grammar errors. So onto the story/question.

TL;DR - Left career because of a weird situation, couldn't find work that paid enough, decided to go back to school to get degree, picked MIS major, and now lost on where to go from here. Looking for advice on internships, experience, certs, anything to help.

I left college at 20 so that my wife could finish school as we couldn't afford for us both to go. I was going for a business degree but never really made it out of the core classes that you are required to take. I took a programming class for fun and I loved it. I was also very good at it.

Fast forward to age 23, and I was making $75k managing a small company (35 employees) on behalf of the owner who decided he wanted to ""retire"". I started out as his assistant and became the ""CEO"" (that is was the owner called me to the employees, but on paper I was still admin assistant)

I did that for 5 years and at first it was an awesome gig. I helped grow the company by almost 50% and it was a great feeling. But it didn't last, by year 3 the stress of running the company, but having almost no real power wore down on me. All major decisions still had to be run through the owner, and he was usually very hard to get ahold of. I decided that I couldn't do it anymore, and this wasn't the company for me to continue my career. 

I updated my resume and used a generic ""director of operations"" as my job title. I guess that is a lie, but at the time I didn't think of it as a lie. I sent it off to two companies in the same line of work in the same area. I was hoping for some sort of management job, and I would be happy with 50k. I asked that my employer not be contacted, I didn't want my boss to know I was leaving until I had a job lined up. He is a very petty man. 

One of the companies called me to set up an interview and to discuss my expectations, we set the date for a week from the phone call and I thought everything was going to be great. Unfortunately I was wrong, I assume the hiring manager called the owner of the company I worked for, and asked about me. The boss realized I was leaving and promptly told them that I was actual just his assistant. 

So I show up the the interview and everything seems to go swimmingly. That is until I am asked to clarify my job duties, I did my best to explain what it was that I did and the relationship between the owner of the company and myself. I was asked again to clarify my job and explain my title, again I explained it again to the best of my ability. Next the hiring manager came in, and I was asked point blank what is my current job title, and I told her administrative assistant. She thanked me and said I should receive a call in the next few days. I knew something was off when I left. 

The phone call never came, but I did receive a nice email explaining that lying on my resume is why I will not be getting the job. I realized then what I had lied about, realized how stupid I was. Of course giving myself a title that fit the job was technically a lie, and of course they are going to need to verify it.  So the owner decided to either be petty or inadvertently call me out. But it was my fault no one else's.

Work became even more stressful because the owner came back since I was leaving. He needed to be brought up to speed on everything while I still did all the work. I was dying a little more everyday, now every decision had to be run through him and it was tedious.

I put out corrected resumes to a bunch of different companies in different industries and I got a ton of job offers, unfortunately the most anyone was willing to pay a college drop out admin assistant was 30k. I couldn't support my family on that little even with my wife going back to work. 

I kept looking but I honestly couldn't find anything and I was running out of time. The owner of the company was starting to take duties over and leaving me out of things (completely understood) and it was only a matter of time before I was put out. 

So my wife and I decided that if we were going to struggle for a long time at a tiny salary why not go back to school, and struggle with a tiny salary. She went back to work and I enrolled in school. I also work 30-36 hours a week making 12.50 in a retail store.

Remember that I loved programming 101 and I was good at it so I figured computer science was the way to go, but at the same time I didn't want to abandon all of the business experience I had gained. I also truly love business and the economics behind business. Found out that my new school offered a MIS degree which sounded like the perfect mix of the two.

I have always built my own computers and I was the  defacto IT guy at my old company so I figured I would give it a shot. I love the way tech and business have grown hand in hand. I picked MIS and have been running with it for a year now.

Surprisingly the way the MIS degree is set up at my school is you have to do all of the business classes first before they let you into the technology side of the classes. So now I am a junior with one year left to go and I have zero experience other than the things I have already told you about and the programming class I took last semester (so now two programming classes).

I have applied to a few internships but the all want me to have computer repair experience and I honestly don't have any real world experience. Or may favorite is that they want me to work M-F 8am to 5pm. Umm when do you expect me to go to school?

Finally to the meat of this whole story. Now knowing what you know about me what should I do?

I see myself being a small business consultant but what the hell do I know? Should I focus on getting an internship, should I focus on getting my A+ cert to get my foot in the door, should I keep expanding my programming knowledge (I don't think there is anymore required programming classes), or is there something I should be doing that I haven't thought of. 

There are people at the same point in there schooling as me and the already have future jobs lined up or recruiters calling them. I feel so far behind, and I don't want this degree to be a waste.

Sorry if the backstory was unnecessary. "

I started this path directly after high school, and although I am confused about a lot of things, I don't regret my majors at all. 

I was a 3.4-3.5 GPA student on scholarship until about exactly a year ago my boyfriend of five years, literally a week after expressing things about us being together forever etc. cheated on me and moved in with the other girl. I was heartbroken, and since both of my parents are largely out of my life, I felt like I had nothing left. I stopped going to classes, almost lost my cushy on-campus job, and was just a ball of nothingness for about 3 months. By the end of the semester, I was in therapy and tried finishing off my classes as strong as I could, but still ended up with a 1.87 GPA for the Fall 2016 semester. 

In the following semester, I tried my hardest to get as high of a GPA as I could, but I failed the scholarship standard by 0.06 GPA (GPA standard was 3.3, I had a 3.24). I lost my scholarship, and I'm in the process of appealing, but it doesn't look good, because I really messed up this summer semester and straight up failed a class for the first time in my life because I tried to take two really hard math proof classes in a shortened summer semester. 

I'm still going to therapy. I'm still working on myself, but I'm just so upset that I can't seem to focus. I should be graduating in May, but between having to retake these classes and not as much financial aid coming my way, it'll be next December or later now.

I also failed the first actuarial test the first two times I've taken it, which is extremely discouraging. Even though I'm not committed to an actuarial career, it would've really helped me get an internship and make some money and get some job experience, etc. 

I'm very frustrated with myself, and I don't even want to make advising appointments because I was doing so well and now I'm stuck. I was an overachiever for a long time, and I'm struggling to watch my high school friends doing really well, while I'm... just not.

I could use some encouraging words or advice from anyone who's been in a similar situation."

I didn't anticipate how draining it would be, especially with 3 hours of commuting each day and trying to keep fit. But now I've really kicked things into gear and am reading CTCI and polishing up some projects in anticipating for applications opening for summer 2018. So I basically I'm running short on time. I'm trying to finish CTCI and get to leetcode, and want ~2 months to truly get in shape, so I got a couple questions about my situation.

1. Assuming applications open right at the end of August, if I applied at the end of September to give myself more time to get into shape, would it matter? The extra time would let me polish up my projects and study for interviews would be great.  

2. What is the general timeline between applying and getting an interview? So say if you apply in September, when do you get an interview offer? And from the interview offer, when does your interview take place? Are you allowed to push back your interview date to give yourself more time?

3. If you don't get through for a summer 2018 internship, can you try again for a winter 2018 internship? Are these more difficult to get since there are fewer of them? Or is it about the same since less students apply?

Thanks. "

I figure that I might as well get an MS in CS from Georgia Tech because it only costs $8,000 and you get a tax deduction of $4,000 a year for graduate school so it basically pays for itself.

Am older colleague who works as a PM told me that a Master’s degree would show that I don’t know what I’m doing and that I should try to just “hack my way up” - that is, get a better job and try to excel there. 

Is he right? I want to be a real software engineer and not just a web developer and I don’t see why getting a better theoretical foundation - which would be finished in _2020_ - is somehow supposed to hold me back.

I will be entering my second year of Mechanical undergrad work this fall. Due to AP credits, I have the option of graduating in 3 years total with a average unit load of 14.5 quarter units from here on out. 

I have contemplated pursuing minors in either Physics or Materials Engineering. Perhaps both. I could complete my Degree and 1 Minor still in 3 years with a high unit load (roughly averaging 19 quarter units). Or I could slow down considerably and take 1 or 2 minors and stretch out my education to four years total. These options also lower my average unit count considerably (about 13 to 15 units). Also, I would have time to engage in student engineering clubs which I know are important in the job search.

Additionally, this past summer I was not able to secure an internship and as such, I have no experience directly in the field. I then came to the conclusion that should I graduate in 3 years, I would have just one more summer to get an internship before my education comes to an end and the job search becomes reality.

My main concern/thoughts are if an additional shot an internship + 1 or 2 minors would be worth the trade off of not being in industry for one year. Just looking for any input. I appreciate any and all advice.

I know this sub is perpetually answering this question for almost every anxious undergrad in existence, but I would be most appreciative of any critical feedback or advice anyone is willing to offer.




I am currently heading into my senior year of undergrad pursuing a degree in mathematics with concentrations in applied math and statistics from a fairly well-known state university in the US. I am interested in pursuing a PhD program in artificial intelligence/computer science, however I am a bit concerned about my qualifications after reading a few resources I've found around this sub.



Perhaps my chief concern is that as of right now I have no official research experience in a lab/under a professor. I have done plenty of work researching and developing a small portfolio of work on my own time or at hackathon-type events, but I also understand that this experience does not translate into letters of recommendation or publications, both of which seem to be considered high-priority for applicants. In addition to this, I am currently sitting on a ~3.2/3.3 GPA, which, while not necessarily terrible by conventional standards, does me absolutely no favors in terms of competing with other PhD applicants. (Though, for what it's worth, this ~3.3 was earned with rigorous course loads with virtually no filler classes.)



However, I will graduate with an unusual amount of industry experience after finishing a 7 month software development co-op at a mid-sized company and an 11 month software development internship at a large Fortune 100 company. I understand that these experiences do not equate to research, but can I leverage them on my application? I have a wonderful relationship with both companies and I have colleagues whom I know would speak highly of me in a letter if I asked them to write one on my behalf. Not to mention the work I did at these companies was by no means busy work. I worked on a large and wide-ranging number of projects, used a variety of technologies and languages, and produced quantifiable results for the teams I worked on.



Other potential pluses for my application include being an officer of a data science club at my university, having a good relationship with a few professors at my university, having TA experience, a sincere passion for my chosen area of study, fairly strong writing abilities, and (though perhaps it goes without saying) not anticipating acceptance into any exceedingly prestigious programs.



Any critical feedback, constructive criticisms, brutal honesty, or words of encouragement are greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading."

Recommendations?,infiniterecurse,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6se9wz/at_a_crossroads_in_my_internship_recommendations/,"So I've been working at this agency as a web developer for about 3 months now. It's... Not the best. I made a post 2 months ago which you can check out if you'd like to know the details, but to summarize:

1. The company is very much BYOD, which is pretty mindboggling. Luckily, there was a shitty mid 2010 iMac nobody was using so I'm using it now. 
2. The boss is a micromanager. He has to know every detail of how things are going, and on top of that has no idea how much time these projects take. My coworkers have complained about this too.
3. We're like about a 40-person company, five of us on site, three remote (South America). One is currently in another internship and will likely quit, the other is going to quit his job soon, so that leaves us with three. This sucks because our boss has us developing in-house projects while also developing websites for other companies in very tight deadlines. I'm a college student.
4. Project managers never consult us on things such as design. It grinds my gears as I'm currently developing a project that is going to be an extreme pain in the ass due to them not asking us what's can be done with the Facebook API, mobile design isn't done yet, shootings haven't started, etc. The project is due this September, just three days before my classes begin. So they kinda technically fucked over my summer.
5. My boss was about to refuse to pay me if I was taking a co-op, and I insisted on getting paid. My ""contract"" if you can call that is one flimsily printed piece of paper stating the maximum amount of hours I can work each month, along with the hourly rate. 

So... This brings me to my question. I got a cool email from a startup on machine learning, and they seem pretty cool. They want me to design the website and also help them on designing algorithms. I told them I was interested and I'd like to speak to them more. 

My question is... Should I quit? *Can* I quit? Honestly the document is really flimsy and doesn't have many details, so I'm sure I can just quit no problem, if this other startup offers more benefits for me than this agency. Though that's more of a /r/legaladvice question. 

Sorry for the long winded post. Thanks in advance, guys?"

Also! As of right now, I only have Chapman as one of my safeties and from what I've heard there Computer Science major is definitely growing and has potential but it's my only Safety currently, so I definitely need some help in that area or perhaps I could find a better substitute for Chapman."

How do people even become friends?,methofthewild,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/6seb34/anyone_else_feel_like_an_outcast_within_your/,"I started an internship for the summer and we are a group of interns that all met each for the first time this summer. But everyone seems to have gotten comfortable around each other so fast, and I feel like the odd one out, where I can't talk to any of them (1 on 1, or in the group).

I don't get how people do it so easily? They become friends just like that, and have plenty to talk about even if they don't have matching interests. I wish I could be loud and confident, or even just normal. But I'm always the one sitting on the edge of the table on my phone, finding excuses to get away early. I think I've cemented my position as the ""quiet one"", so I can't bring myself to try anymore. 

This is also effecting me with other non-intern coworkers. I just don't know what to say. So many awkward silences aghh."

I've been in the professional technology industry for about 6  years. During that time I've done infrastructure engineering around very specific products (IBM API Management / DataPower / IBM WebSphere). Recently, I've been thinking about what a career change would look like. If I did that I would want to become a programmer again (not having done such since my internship). The biggest challenge that I'm facing is that I've got no professional experience and taking an entry level job would come with a significant pay cut.

6sf823,1,2017-08-08,Another career advice question for a beginner looking to get into GIS,jboges,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/6sf823/another_career_advice_question_for_a_beginner/,"So i've recently discovered the wonderful world of GIS and decided that this is the field I want to get into and start a career. I have a bachelors of science degree in Geology and got exposed to GIS when working for my local state Geologic Survey. I started briefly in computer science when I was a freshman because I have always loved technology and would consider myself a quick learner when it comes to computer science principals. After using ArcMap I was instantly hooked and decided this is what Id like to do with my life. I enjoy being able to solve problems and develop solutions to working with data and then getting a chance to be creative and work on the visualizations in the map format.  I am trying to develop myself professionally using all of the valuble resources online, but am getting lost with the endless amount of options would love some guidance on a good progression of skills to learn to get to a level in which I am more employable in the industry. I currently have what I would consider a decent amount of experience and familiarity with ArcGIS 10.2.2 Advanced license  as far as standard cartography and a good understanding of cartographic principals. My latest map completed at my internship is [this one](https://www.scribd.com/document/355838400/South-Wallingford-pdf), which is the scope of all the experience I have had with GIS so far. My projects involved geodatabase and feature creation, georeferncing, geocoding, knowledge of rasters and how to utilize them, and layout/design. I have experience doing this in Arcmap and AGOL. I also used open source image manipulation and layout programs such as GIMP and Scribus for my last map, and I had a pretty easy time learning the basics of the program. 

None of my projects involved running any kind of analysis or tools on data in order to produce visualizations, and I know this is a very important skill to have in order to be employable in the field.  All features on my maps were either manually created or imported with xy coordinate data from excell. 

My main question is where do I go from here? I have recently completed a beginner python specialization through Coursera, and am currently using datacamp.com to learn SQL with python. The problem is that I currently dont know how this applies to GIS, I only know from this subreddit that it is an important skill to know as an accessory to understanding the software. 

What would be a good progression in order to make myself more employable in the industry without having to pay for a graduate certificate? Id really like to able to apply this knowledge of python and SQL to ArcGIS in order to help my resume. I also have a subscription to ArcGIS for Personal Use so that I may create some maps on my own time which can help my portfolio, but Im not sure where to start.  Any advice would be great to get me moving in the right direction from where I am. The kind of jobs I would be interested in and have applied to are more towards the data analyst side, but I would be open to pretty much anything as long as I got utilize data sets in ArcMap. 

Thanks!  "

I got myself a fulltime internship this summer paying $25 an hour. I have the opportunity to stick with this company for the next few summers, and I'll have a great chance of getting an offer as a consultant after I graduate.   

The thing is that my internship is in cybersecurity, but my major is in electrical and computer engineering. I don't know if I should look into other internships to broaden my skillset and experience working in my major's field, or just stick with what I'm doing now.  

My current gig is quite awesome. Great pay, casual office culture, flexibility working from home, and ability to work part time remotely during the semester with flexible hours.     

I know I should come out of college with a lot of experience under my belt, but I'm not sure exactly what potential employers are looking for.  

tl;dr Should I stick with the same internship with great benefits for the next few summers and potentially get a job offer, or try out different internships in different fields before I graduate?

What should I do going forward? I'm looking for any sort of guidance or advice.

6sfpfz,6,2017-08-08,Honestly feeling so depressed right now,Throwaway9837842894,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/6sfpfz/honestly_feeling_so_depressed_right_now/,"So I was accepted to two Ivy league schools out of high school but they offered me pretty terrible aid packages (about 40-50k each year in loans). My parents told me that if I wanted, I could take out the loans myself, but I would be responsible for those (My major is economics).

So, scared as I was about the prospect of being almost 200k in debt, I went to a state school for free.
Now, with the summer of freshman year just about over, I've never been more depressed. I applied for 20+ internships coming out of my freshman year with a 4.0 GPA and what I felt was solid extracurriculars, and got accepted literally nowhere. They told me that I was too young, that I hadn't taken the necessary classes yet, that they weren't hiring (even though they had applications for internships), etc.

As a result, I've been working in a grocery store this last summer. While I'm thankful for the opportunity and money, it doesn't seem like I'm gaining any valuable experience, or something ill be able to use to advance my career later on. 

I'm trying to remain positive and think that these same factors would have been true if I went to another school, but I see all my friends who attended these prestigious universities doing all these incredible things this summer and now feel like i've ruined my life. I know, it's dramatic, but I work so hard, and while I'm not entitled to anything, I just don't know what else I can be doing. I'm spending hours and hours at school volunteering, studying my ass off, joining clubs, etc. and it's getting me no where.

Did I completely F*** up by attending this state school? What else can I be doing to make myself a more valuable candidate? Should I think about transferring to a more prestigious school, even though their transfer acceptance rates are so low?

I'm sorry for being dramatic, but you have to understand just how hard I feel i'm working at everything, how tired I feel all the time, and to be completely shut down as I have been is just so demoralizing.

I did some internships when I was in college, but sadly they weren’t hiring when I finished studying.
It was in those internships that I learned that I made a huge mistake, I didn't liked my career, and it was too late to quit or change to another degree.
So when I finished school I spent 1 year going to several interviews for jobs in my field, but I felt like I was sabotaging myself because I wasn't really interested in working in those places.
Three months ago I went to a place that seemed pretty interesting and it looked like I would enjoy it, and I got the job.
But now I came to hate that place, my original shift was from Monday to Saturday, 2:30 pm to 10:30 pm. The second week they changed my shift to 6:00 am to 2:30 pm, in paper, because in reality we had an enormous amount of job so we worked from 6:00 am to 4:00 or 6:00 pm. Two guys quitted their job there, so now my shift if from 6:00 pm to 6:00 am, and I heard it's only going to get worst in a few weeks, and that in December we will be lucky if they give us Christmas day.
So I really want to quit because it's a job that doesn't makes me happy, I always come and leave home angry knowing I have to keep going there. But some friends and my parents keep telling me that I should get over it, that the work life is just like that, but I really don’t want my life to be like that forever.
If I quit I would have to look for another job in my field that I would probably won't like, but it's that or working in something totally different that pay less, which I wouldn't really mind as long as it makes me happy.
I really don't know what to do, should I keep going to that job and just accept that reality?, should I quit and look for something that might be better, knowing that I quite don't like my field?, should I look for something different that pay less but put less stress on me?. I would appreciate your opinion."

One thing to consider is that to run Ryzen cpus at a competitive level like seen in the bench marks, you often need a 3000 MHZ or 3200 MHZ ram. In order to obtain this, you'd had to pay more than what you would when using ram with Intel, especially when B-die and CL14 premiums are what Ryzens usually work with.

My cumulative GPA when I was a sophomore was &lt;3.0 but my major was 4.0 and I'm always working on side projects. Now my cumulative is 3.3 with a 3.8 major.

My only experience has been as a (successful: increased grades by ~30%) tutor for data structures/algos. Mainly I would implement visualizations of the basic data structures (trees, graphs, heaps, etc) using js/html5 canvas and we would review the properties and do practice problems either from the book or that I make up.

I've used a good amount of languages (ordered exp to least exp): java, javascript/node.js, c#, scheme, c, php, html, css, python, and a few others which I couldn't code in to save my life right now depending on whatever project I'm working on.

I've got around 20 public repos in GitHub with things I've worked on and 20 more private ones which have class related/private things that me and some other people work on. Compilers, bots, websites, some scripts, etc.

Only 1 person has ever contacted me which was a recruiter from Google about a year ago who found me on LinkedIn but back then I declined sending my resume/transcript because I thought of going to grad school (my grad school applications have a similar outcome to my job apps except I get denied at least). Possible to recontact?

I've read somewhere in this subreddit that the average CS grad is &lt;3.0 GPA 0 internship so I'd expect to be getting some response but so far I've sent probably 100 applications through LinkedIn/my uni's career site and haven't gotten a single response besides confirmations and all of these are entry level jobs that I believe fully or almost fully qualify for.

Well I'll also say that based on the resume FAQ my resume was 50% useless since I've been following a template for ""tech resumes"" from my uni which included achievements (scholarships and such) and objectives. Right now my resume is education, experience, projects x5, a subset of the languages and a few IDEs/tools I use. So yeah I fixed that maybe that's all I needed. 

Any thoughts appreciated.

Edit: some actual direct questions: Jobs that list 1+ years of experience as a requirement. I don't apply to them because I assume it means professional experience. Is this correct?"

I've always been on the fast track for CS because it's come easy to me and I've loved doing it. However, now since i'm signing up for classes, I've realized I can graduate with a CS degree due to AP credits I accumulated in high school. One of the course advisers (and my parents) suggested I look into a dual major with CS from the science college and Computer Engineering from the engineering college. However, this would mean I would have to spend the four years at college.

So, I'm left with two options.
1) Graduate in 3 years with a computer science degree. 
2) Graduate in 4 years with a computer science AND computer engineering 

Both are tempting offers. However, I don't intend to have a career in computer engineering. I love software, web, and AI development. I've interned at several large companies doing web development, both front and back end work (but simplified for interns), and I loved it. 

So this boils down to one question. Reddit, a dual major make a huge difference in employment, salaries, etc, over a regular CS degree in 3 years? Vice versa? Is a three year degree better or worse than a regular four year degree?

I'm not sure what to do, and have a feeling this probably crosses other subreddits so if I may be better served elsewhere, any help is appreciated.

As some background, my wife has been in the logistics industry for five years. Her degree is in English, and she originally wanted to do technical writing. She worked throughout college to avoid student loans, so she never had any relevant internship experience. Now that she's five years in, she feels a bit silo'd as well. She has no career progression opportunities at the company she is at, so it's time for a change.

There was an auditing position she had applied for which seemed like a good fit, but she just heard back today that she did not get the job. 

The issue I'm primarily trying to resolve is that she hates logistics, but has no clue what she WANTS to do. She no longer wants to pursue writing. She doesn't like what she's doing now. She doesn't express any interest in anything. She goes to work, goes to the gym, comes home and watches TV, and goes to bed. Rinse and repeat. On the weekends it's basically the same. She doesn't have any hobbies and no career interests aside from not wanting to be in logistics.

I've tried to get her to pursue some other hobbies but she doesn't seem interested. I think she is depressed, and it's exacerbated by news like today when she is told that she didn't get a job (which who knows if she'd have liked, it was an auditing job) and has to stay at the company she's at.

What sorts of things can I do to help her figure out what she wants to do? I'd love to have her pursue something creative or freelance, but she is not interested; she'd rather work for someone else, which is fine, but it limits things.

I'm not sure if the career paths for computational biology and bioinformatics are wildly different but I'll give this question a shot anyway. I'm currently a sophomore doing my undergrad with a major in computational biology and a minor in computer science. I do not plan to go to med school. I'm wondering what the job market looks like for someone with this degree, and what will change if I pursue a graduate degree in computational biology/bioinformatics (or computer science?). I'm also wondering if it is possible to get a job that leans more towards programming/IT with my degree in addition to bio-related jobs, since I will only be learning the basics and such. Not saying that I want to make the switch, but it would be really nice to have other options available if for whatever reason I decide to lean away from biology in the future. What should I do during my undergraduate studies in addition to the classes I'm taking (research, types of internships)? And finally, I don't know if this is relevant but I enjoy digital art, design, and graphics- could this be tied in to my career path in any way?

Thanks for your input! "

----

A new employee reports his desk phone isn't working. It's a desk I asked Capslock to setup yesterday, because he didn't do it Friday. He proceeds to tell me, ""Oh yeah, I couldn't find the network ports for his desk, so I just left the phone there."" 

Did he think new employee would just be ok not having a phone? Did he think to look at a neighboring desk to see where the network cables went? No, he thought the best course of action was to just not plug in the phone, and not bother to ask anyone where the network ports could be.

After I explained where the network ports were for those desks, I sent him back over to plug it in. 

---

Bonus!
His nickname is Capslock because on the day he started he was absolutely bewildered when everything he was typing was in caps. My coworker had to point out to him that caps lock was on. Also, he's in college studying to be a DBA. There's no way that's happening.

6slq25,4,2017-08-09,Dealing with Server Lag (SDE),Teradoc,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/6slq25/dealing_with_server_lag_sde/,"Okay...question first. How do people in larger organizations with ArcServer and/or SDE servers handle the lag they get from their system while dealing with their map? Backstory below for my (I think) unique situation...


For the local muni DPW I work for, we've been albeit a bit 'loose' in terms of the GIS system. We unfortunately do not have a dedicated GIS administrator or GIS team and the roles are kinda split up between the IT Director, a planning &amp; zoning guy, and the IT Deputy Director and then there's me, the one and only GIS field tech/engineering tech for my division. Well I gave the IT director a good startle, as when I started as an intern last year, I was given no access to the server, instead an offline geodatabase that I edited up and fixed (Schematic mapping of water main system). Well, I was fully hired on this year and *just* finally had a meeting between all the loose GIS knowledgeable people to try and form some cohesion. I had been editing the data for my different maps all stored on local computer (I know, big no-no) but I was saving the geodatabases and map packages to a separate server that was backed up nightly as a interim stop gap. Well...as said, that spooked the IT Director and long story short, I now finally have read/write capabilities to the SDE server and I've moved all my data up there so it's in a proper home and backed up nightly.


Now though, when I open my MXD (especially the water mains map as it's huge) I get a wicked case of lag when I try to move stuff or add or even pan around the map, whereas I used to be able to fly on that. I know it's a case of a shit ton of data. I think it's gotten better now that I've turned off some of the layers, but that's then hidden data that's useful. It also effects the ability to use snapping a lot. I have to now hover over something for near 10-15 seconds to get snapping to recognize.

What do other professionals do to handle this lag? Is there a way perhaps to 'download' a local copy of data and then merge it back into the server at the end of working on it? I'll wholly admit my knowledge of how to handle SDE is non-existant as school taught me how to do GIS and SDE was only mentioned in passing as 'it exists, moving on...""



**Edit:**  Thank you everybody for your suggestions! I can certainly attempt to do some of the things on my own, like layers and such. Other things I'll need to coordinate with my IT team on checking the server and such. I'm also interested now in the replication concept and I am going to look into that."

I really enjoy my experience. Towards the end of my work term, I requested to my Team lead to do end of term evaluation for university.

He gladly did so. It wasn't a perfect score but overall it was great evaluation. He offered me to stay for another term to extend my internship contract. Unfortunately, I only have 1 winter term left to complete prior graduation. Hence, I chose to graduate first. Early May this year, I emailed him and ask if there is an opening for an entry level engineering position in the same department.

Without delay, he forwarded my resume directly towards his 2 managers which interviewed me in early June.

I remember I had 2 days to prepare for final interview. I read as much technical detail as I can because I know it will be mostly technical questions. However, the interview was beyond my reach. I answer as best as I could. I recalled that I could only answer about 50-60% of 60 min constant technical questions.

I did not receive rejection letter so far. I followed up about 6 weeks ago. HR (which is contractor) said that they still interviewed large number of external candidate since there will be 2 position open.

I think my talents lie more on the front end (I minored in digital media and design in college and majored in marketing) but I am open to, and interested in, learning full stack as well. 

I got accepted into a bootcamp in Lexington KY that is run by an awesome company I got to intern for in college. 

In my current job, in Louisville, I work for a software company as a marketing consultant. When I informed my work about the bootcamp they offered me something I never expected...for me to stay on with the company as a front end developer.

Some background info: 'marketing consultant' is a vague term for my day-to-day job. Since the company is a startup (a successful startup) I've taken on a variety of roles. One being the redesign of our companies website. I loved it, and I think that talent showed my ability to learn code quickly, which is why I feel that they offered me the position.

My concern: I don't know enough yet to be considered a 'front-end developer'. I'm worried I won't have the discipline to teach myself on the weekends and get up to speed with the projects they are giving me. 

I live in Lexington now, so the commute is also a factor.

I have enough money saved up for the bootcamp, but plan to move to San Diego in May, 4 month after the bootcamp is set to end - so I'm worried about lag time in between when the bootcamp ends and getting a job out in Cali. 

*Current Job - languages I would be focusing on JavaScript, HTML, CSS, D3 
*Bootcamp:  HTML, CSS, JS, databases, SQL, Python/Node.js/Ruby/PHP, web frameworks, AWS, Git, GitHub, Agile, TDD, UI/UX design.

I know this is a lot of information, but I am really struggling with the decision and all the different factors at play. Any help would be awesome!"

Two interviewers explicitly told me the interview went well, one said it was extremely likely he'd be calling me back, and the other was supposed to send me an email right after the phone call. Neither ever returned my emails. 

I have 4 projects on my resume, 2 from school and 2 personal. Only one is on github and I'm still working on it, but I work full time and have a girlfriend and it's hard to spend hours working on it all the time. I'm hoping to get a beta version out soon.

But I'm not even getting interviews. I get rejection after rejection (when I can even find internships). My degree isn't Computer Science, it's called Information Sciences and Technology: Design and Development. The only thing I have left to do to graduate is complete an IT internship. I have to pay student loans in December and I don't know what to do because I only make $12/hr.

I was thinking about trying to find an online comp sci degree that will take most of my credits so I can put off the student loans and maybe have a better chance of getting a job / internship with the better degree.

Any ideas? Or even project ideas? Every person I've talked to (recruiters, software devs, the forum here) all tell me my resume is fine for a student / recent grad. Yet I can't get even an IT internship.


Does anyone have any suggestions for me?

Thank you."

Now this may be a common problem, but I think if I have deeper issues because I get incredibly depressed at the thought of working in an office environment at a cubicle. It feels incredibly stifling and monotonous to me. 

I had an internship at a Fortune 500 company last summer that I really disliked, and I quit my internship at that same company 2 weeks into this summer because I just couldn't pull through mentally. To be honest, I only majored in CS because my parents told me to. I haven't enjoyed it at all. And frankly I attended Cornell because my parents told me to as well; otherwise, I most likely would have just gone to my highly regarded state school (they did pay for my education in full though, which I'm incredibly grateful for).

I've always liked the thought of owning my own business. There's this new building in a shopping plaza that opened up near my house.  Every time I walk by I always think to myself how great it would be if I were to run a business in a space like that. But I don't have any idea as to WHAT that business would entail.  

And of course, even if I did have an idea as to what that business would be, it's incredibly risky to pursue something like that and forgo traditional employment. Am I just lazy? Depressed? Naive? I just can't seem to come up with what I'd like to end up doing if I weren't running my own thing. I will be going to career services when I get on campus, but from what I've heard, they aren't particularly helpful. 

Meanwhile, my classmates seem to be enjoying their highly paid internships in New York City, Bay Area, etc, and all I've done is sit at home trying to make sense of things. Does anybody have advice for someone who just feels incredibly lost and hopeless? "

Hey guys,

I'm a recent graduate that's been job hunting for about half a year now. I haven't had the best luck with getting interviews for SWE roles, but I've gotten a few and made it to the onsites for some of them too. I just got offered a QA role which pays significantly less, but considering my given personal circumstances and financial situation this QA offer is something I'm interested in. My biggest concern is that I'll get pigeonholed into doing QA and it'll be hard to find SWE/SWD jobs after this. If anyone could offer some consolation/reassurance/success stories about how difficult it is to become a developer after working in QA?  

I graduated with a bs in comp sciand have had prior internship experience doing backend development.

TL;DR Do you or anyone you know have switched from QA to Dev?"
6sre1a,1,2017-08-10,"I got a job on an Application Development team, and i'm worried i'm underqualified",m0usec0p123,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/6sre1a/i_got_a_job_on_an_application_development_team/,"Like the title says, I don't know where to begin.

20 years old from the East Coast, graduated high school with my associates of arts so I spent my last two years pursuing classes towards a CS degree before running out of scholarship money and ultimately settling with graduation with in Information Systems (IS) degree.

I took procedural programming (algorithmic design I and II) and my school focused on Java. Struggling to pay for rent and day-to-day expenses as i've been on my own since 15, I opted to focus on IS with scholarship requirements struggling to be met.

I got a product-based internship in college (Think mcafee installation work - ePO, DLP, ENS) and found out that's not what I wanted to do. I really wanted to program as part of a team and contribute to the building of some project.

I got an interview on the West Coast in California for an App Development company. 

During the interview, they focused mainly on things to do with the systems development lifecycle (App development, technical archietecture) and even let me see an example of a service they used online (can't remember the name).

The application allowed him to write some SQL statements and perform a task (moving a file from one location to another) using language-neutral microservices the company made. Like base frameworks, I think written in .NET, that could perform simple tasks and/or interact with other services that perform simple tasks.

The interview lasted for 9 hours, and up until that point (it was lunch) I was answering questions fine and meeting multiple members of the team.

Problem is - I didn't understand a word of it. I could speak on high-level terms about the MVC approach to solving problems (Like what it is) and idea of parnet/child relationships (i.e. when to use abstract methods/classes or interfaces), but even messed up on a few questions there.

(the biggest one was where to pass and perform actions if an interface has multiple consturctors that take in different paraments - 1 that took none - 
the 2nd that took a string and integer -
and 3rd that took multiple strings and multiple integers -
and I assumed the main constructor, with no parameters, is where I would use the information but even that made no sense after I said to one of the interviewers.)



The luncheon interviewer was the lead of the tech architecture team 

He formulated questions in such a way he saw that I had knowledge gaps with things like the common MVC patterns, what micro-services even are (I had no clue) and how to use common web-based API's to make those micro-services based on documents written up around the MVC patterns they stick to. I also had **NO CLUE ABOUT DEPENDENCY INJECTION, DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT AND INHERITANCE**

and I realized then that my IS, not CS, background was the biggest thing at play. My lack of knowledge of the *theory* behind the systems development life cycle stopped me from understanding how they utilize classes, import things, and pull data from one spot to the next.

Now, regardless of everything I got wrong, I got the job. I start at the end of the month, and believe they use .NET, not Java, which i've never used. I don't know where to begin preparing other than researching, generally, the ideas and theories that I obviously needed to work on. 

I spent 3 weeks studying algorithms before I got there to find out that it was basically useless, lol. I'm not terrified, but very concerned my lack of technical programming (i'm most **but not extremely** proficient in java, and can write simplistic HTML, CSS, and javascript after googling the problem at hand to sorta relearn the common patterns at play to pass data. I don't know the JSON format very well and only know simplistic Javascript from the JQUERY libraary to pass data to a SQL server. I'm not too proficient in SQL, but the statements are pretty straightforward and I believe I could google any common statment I meed need to use before/on-the-job.)

**TLDR:**

I got an job on an App Dev team, I believe as an Application developer, and understand *minimal* information on micro-services, .NET (never used it, have used Java), dependency injection, and how to write code that can utilize frameworks and language-neutral services that the company uses. SQL is shaky (1/2 year usage), with about 1- 1 &amp; 1/2 years with Object Oriented Programming languages (java)). Had a 9 hour interview, 9 different people, only the Technical Architecture Lead portion made me feel unqualified for those reasons I stated above.

I am seeking some guidance before I begin my college classes next month to complete my IT degree. Here is a brief backstory.

I applied back to college at the end of last year for an online IT program and I was accepted miraculously. So far I have completed 1 year of classes from 2012 to 2013 in which have been a mix of administrative management and IT classes. Due to unforeseen circumstances, I had to move back to my hometown and focus on working full time to support myself. Since I have been away from school for so long, I have basically forgotten a lot of what I had previously learned and I made no attempts to continue learning on my own. I have planned out the remaining classes I need to take to finish and I have about 2 years left with a summer internship that is required.  I am also focusing on a specialization on cyber-security. 

I am seeking out anything I should do outside of class to get back in the flow of things. So far I have looked into entry level certifications and I have a few books from previous classes to crack open and read for a month before class. 

Any recommendations about ANYTHING related to IT will be helpful! I do know I may need to refresh myself on the basics but I do have enough time to prepare.

THANK YOU!

So this one method is simple, we get data back from elastic search and I place it in categories for an excel sheep.

I feel uncomfortable talking about what I actually do incase it's against the rules, but basically I analyze text.  For this export method I am doing, I had to make one simple method for a part of this task, I have one catagory dog, and another cat, I make it ""Dog"" and ""Cat"" and sometimes these categories may be mixed like ""dog, cat"" and I make it ""Dog, Cat""

When I would get the ""Dog, Cat"" I would split it in an array, and incase in the future we had more than two categories, I did a boolean check. The purpose of this boolean check is to see if I should add a comma, because without it I would get something like ""Dog, Cat,"".

This method is used a lot so because of that, my coworker said it was inefficient, and he resulted in me to just use javas String.join("", "", String) or dog.join("", "", ""cat); instead, inside of the boolean.

My question is, does it really matter? All I am doing is checking (if (string[string.length - 1].equals(string[i])) if it's not, we append a comma and continue, if it is, we do nothing and finish the loop. In my algorithms class I learned that in big O notation it doesn't matter O(N + 1) = O(N) but does it change if it's used in mass scale or is my coworker being picky?"

6suory,2,2017-08-10,Keeping my options open,TJOCHO,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/6suory/keeping_my_options_open/,"Hi all. I am a rising college senior in the US, and tomorrow is the final day of summer internship at a Fortune 50 tech company. Monday I received an offer letter to return the company after I complete my final year of school, but I have to make a decision before I leave.

The issue with this is that I will miss the full time recruiting season for my senior year, and this internship is a major boost to my resume. By accepting the offer now, I could miss out on an opportunity at a better company with better pay.

I am here for advice on what I should do. Here are some more points I have been considering.

-My total compensation is 30% higher than the mean for my major.

-On top of that I receive a 10k signing bonus plus 9k in relocation. Which is a shit ton of money for me, and I don't think i lll get this somewhere else.

-There are realistically only 4-5 companies that recruit at my school that are an upgrade on the one I am currently at, all of which I would be in the same role.

-The location is in my top 5 cities in the US that I would want to work in, but I would have to leave all my family and friends and the city I've lived in my entire life.

-Regardless of the company I choose, I plan on leaving in 4 years to pursue an MBA.

-In terms of enjoyment, this was my favorite internship out of the 4 I have done, but I didn't love it. At the end of the day it was a job for me, and I found myself watching the clock constantly. I'm not sure if this company specific, or just me getting used to working full time. Regardless I have clock watched at every job I've ever held, but it still makes me nervous.

So what do you all think? Do I take it and have secure employment senior year, or decline and go through recruiting again at the risk that I won't improve my position?

Also, were I to take the offer, what are the consequences of reneging if I receive another offer elsewhere?


I hope this is the right place, I am a first generation college student and my parents and friends are all blue collar workers who don't have a lot of experience with this sort of thing. So I am really interested in hearing an outsiders opinion, thank you.

I think it's too early to quit, but I don't think I can keep going, especially for so long. I don't wanna be tied to just this thing, I wanna get a job and earn money and live life outside of school(the money from the internship is not enough; it's less than I currently make with a side job I have)

I'm a rising sophmore at a not-too-well-known Canadian university for CS, and this summer I'm doing completely irrelevant work. However, I have a really high GPA (we go by percentages at my school), and if I'm not first in my class, I must be pretty damn close (just based on marks I've heard from others).

The only real side project I have is a linear algebra toolkit program I've been working on, and right now it's pretty functional in terms of matrix operations (solving, inverting, multiplying, etc.), but it's pretty ugly to use (run through terminal, disgusting format, I haven't really taken the time to learn to make a proper GUI).

I also expect to receive an award for achieving the highest mark in CS II second semester, and I hope I'll be able to use my in-class success+good relationship with my professor to secure a part-time research position during the school year. I will also be joining my school's algorithmic trading club in the fall.

Aside from this and my academic performance overall, I don't really have much to show for myself in terms of CS experience, and I'm not sure how much the algo trading club or research position would help during fall recruitment as it would be something I have just started.
Where do I stand in terms of securing internships?

If it matters I'm a ""diverse hire"", but would I be a good applicant for something like Google's EP (I've only seen one other person from my school do it, and he had previous QA experience at a big 4 accounting firm), or an SE position at a good, but not ""big 4"" company such as Bloomberg?

I'm wondering what is a typical roadmap for someone in my position? I made the huge mistake of not doing an internship while in school. Although for my senior capstone course I had the opportunity to work on an open source web application written in Grails for a professor, which lead to a short term employment after the class ended to deploy the application on a production server and finish up a few details we weren't able to get to due to time.


I've also been working on a personal project that includes web scraping information into a database and preforming some operations on that data in a web application to make up for my lack of internship and to learn some new skills along the way.


The problem I'm having is there aren't too many entry level positions in this field, or they usually expect someone with tons of qualifications. I'm wondering if there is any type of stepping stone jobs that I could look for that would be helpful for me reaching my end goal.

I've got maximum GPA and I'm at the top of my year. However, I still feel as if that's not enough, that I'm inadequate, and a mediocre student at best, and that what I've achieved is nothing special.
A have a couple of people that I really like and consider good friends, and whenever I'm around them, I have fun and feel great. But often when I'm at home, I get a feeling that they don't actually like me, or care about me, that they just 'tolerate' me for the sake of not hurting my feelings, and that they're just pretending to be my friends (for whatever reason).
I don't have a girlfriend, and I've never had one, because I've always felt as if I'm not good enough, and thought that I would be rejected. One of my male friends even told me that he knew for a fact that one girl liked me, but I dismissed him insisting that she would never fall for a guy like me.
I'm about to start working as a paid intern in a company, but I constantly feel like I'm not suited for the job, and I think I'll only embarrass myself and people who recommended me for the position.
So, you see, as I mentioned in the title, even though my university is going great, I have friends and will soon have a job, I still feel depressed, unwanted and unloved. And as time goes on, I get these feelings more and more often. Sometimes it even goes as far as to me thinking that my parents don't actually love, even though I know that's not true.
I'm not the one to impose any kind of medical diagnosis on myself, but I feel as if I'm suffering from some kind of inferiority complex, and I feel it's getting worse.
I feel I'm being 'unreasonable' in my depression, because my life isn't actually bad, but every now and then those feelings overwhelm me, and I would really like some help or advice on how to deal with this.
Thank you all in advance."
6sx6uf,4,2017-08-10,Internship advice,Equation2,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/6sx6uf/internship_advice/,"So I just finished my first internship last week, and am kinda at a crossroad and would like some advice.  For reference I am heading into my Junior year studying Computer Engineering.    

The company I interned at this summer has offered me another internship next summer, and they want to know my decision by the end of this week.  The offer is really good for me financially, to the point where I probably wouldn't have to take out a loan for my senior year, which sounds really fucking nice.  However, I really don't want to intern there again.  I really want to try and get some more variety in my experience, and I feel like if I go back there I wont accomplish that.  I also feel like I didn't grow my technical skills there very much, which is probably the main reason I don't wont to go back there (I am not sure if this is a valid point, me being just an intern, and if I should change my view on this).

I really want to apply to other companies that do things I am interested in working on, however the offer I have from my previous company is really appealing.  Add in the fact that getting an internship at a company that interests me is not guaranteed, and re-applying to the company I interned at doesn't guarantee me the current offer, spending 3 more months there wouldn't kill me.  

Any advice on what I should do?    "

(virtualization, cloud, Linux, networking and security are my specialties) career. After my contract not being renewed back in February I've had a lot of interviews but still, rejection after rejection. This has left me pretty damn discouraged, and I'm looking at potentially making a change to web development. 

I'm very strong with the ""infrastructure"" side of things and have a decent background in system analysis/design (my capstone project for my bachelors was lauded and we almost went into business with it). I had a software development internship back in 2014 that I left to go into I.T. for, largely because I felt useless and the tech was ollllllld (VB6).

My question is, is this a realistic goal? Is my background potentially a positive, or is it almost universally seen as a negative for potential webdev managers/owners? I'm thinking of starting out learning JavaScript and Python (am already pretty familiar with them, did my share of scripting in the past). Is the pay comparable or better than in I.T.? Job outlook better? I get the sense that I would have access to more interesting and diverse work than I would have setting up vmware or router configs, but I want to be sure. And the potential for meaningful side work is exciting.

In my city there is a program called launchcode that will pair you with an established company after you pass a certain baseline of coding aptitude. I intend to go for that to cover my lack of experience since my internship.

Anyway, I'm still pretty early in my search into this, but it seems exciting in its possibilities. I want to know if that is baseless or not :)

Background


I graduated after 2 years at a local college and got my transfer Associates Degree. I wanted to initially go into bioengineering so most of my lower division coursework is in calculus, chemistry, physics, computer science, and other general education classes. However, I did poorly one quarter taking electricity &amp; magnetism, vector calculus, differential equations, computer science, and realized that engineering wasn’t for me. My dad also passed away in the middle of these classes. My poor performance had my admission withdrawn from the University. I took some time off and worked at a sushi restaurant, got promoted to supervisor, and worked for a bit to save up money to go to another University.


Transferred to another University and did two years of ROTC. I ended up enlisting in the National Guard as an Infantryman to help pay for school, skip the Freshmen and Sophomore portion of Military Science, and prepare for ROTC. I also joined an academic business fraternity. Being an Army Officer in Military Intelligence sounded like a good gig so I majored in Sociology because the flexibility of the degree was appealing to me. However at this point, I feel like the degree is a jack-of-all-trades, master of none kind of deal and from my understanding, the job market doesn’t look promising for that kind of outlook.


However, I washed out of the program just like of the engineering program at that other university. OCS is still an option, but I need to teach myself how to swim and work on running a decent 2 mile. Now I’m graduating next year and I don’t really have anything on my resume. I was planning on doing internships this summer but I got shafted with my Infantry unit’s Annual Training the entire month of April that I thought I was going to get out of, but never ended up contracting into the ROTC program.


I feel competent with my social networking skills but professional networking is a different story. I feel like I don’t have anything to offer and that these streaks of failure has led to me to believe that there might be something wrong with me. I know I probably should’ve gotten more tutoring, utilize the resources to work on improving my run and swim, but for some reason couldn’t bring myself to accomplish those simple tasks. I don’t want to cop out and say I have depression, but sometimes it feels that way. I don’t want to make any excuses.


At this point, I know I should be building up my resume and portfolio with things related to Sociology such as data analytics, projects, research, etc. It’s easier said than done and I have no idea where to start. In all honesty, I don’t know what kind of career I want. I feel like I’m the type of person that can jump into any field such as criminal justice, business, or non-profit and see how I perform, but I don’t know how to get my foot in the door and actually do work related to these fields.


I'm already 25 and I feel like I've spent way too much time in school. I don't want to extend my graduation again to try something else."
6sxxtl,18,2017-08-10,I never should've moved to Japan,Silver_Degore,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6sxxtl/i_never_shouldve_moved_to_japan/,"Well here's the weirdest shit that I can say is mentally scarring and horrifying.  Its enough to make my blood freeze, enough to preclude me from sleeping well.  I moved here just for the opportunity and to get away from the U.S and finally live it up and learn life outside of the country.  I'd say moving here was a big mistake...I never would've guess that the ""encounter"" would've happened or this ""plague"" actually was a thing.

Well time to get into this...madness...

I'm Christopher White.  A twenty-four year old male, I studied in a community college for business administration for two years, then transferred to earn my accounting bachelor's degree. This happened at least happened a few months ago and became my biggest incentive to never even so much as think about vacationing in Japan; let alone go back ever again.  

So here's what I'll cover from the start to the end.

Here I am twenty-four years old.  Miserable with the company I was working with in New York.  I was at the top of my class, had internships lined up and did them, good grades and two college degrees.  Then at a job fair at my university the business which I shall not disclose due to confidentiality reasons.  Which had been promoting itself for some time at the job fair which occurred for a week, I got lined up for an interview with them.  

Ten people, such as myself out of hundred got the job.  Went through training, yada yada, then I started working and I was getting underpaid so much.  I was working as a bookkeeper for this company and the starting salary they said was twenty-five dollars an hour.  Instead I get fifteen an hour.  I did the math with that salary and given the limited hours they had for me which was fifteen I would've been dreading on about twelve grand a year and that was close to the average salary of a fast food worker.

So this company lied to my face, I had to work a part-time job as a sales associate just to make ends meet on rent, food, bills, clothing and other stuff.  The business that I worked for part-time as a sales associate was looking to have me go from a temp worker to a full-time sales associate.  This was good for me, they had much better benefits, better hours and they had commission.   So if I was more than successful on a sales quota I could make a percentage of that sales.  

So about two weeks in at my bookkeeping job, I resigned from my employment immediately.  Took the last paycheck, got all my stuff and left with no regrets.  Funny how I went from wanting to work my way up to be an accountant and helping with tax forms I actually find enjoyment and solace in working in sales.  Good thing with my business degree, even if the bachelor's is in accounting it still counts for studying something.  Anyways moving on.

I'm working at the business for a few months in full-time and well experienced and they recently were looking to expand.  Get a franchise running, they wanted me to head out to Japan and would provide me funding to help get a franchise started up.  The deadline they had for me was a year.  

They wanted to give me some time to study a bit about Japan, learn the language, relax.  Although keep in mind I could do some work online so I can still earn a living wage, they were also pretty clear that the funds they provide are to be used for the franchise.  Not for personal expense.  I was willing to oblige by that, it was a fair trade.  So came the time I set off to Japan, a new chapter in my life.  

The business I worked for was about promoting banking and accounting software which is what I did for sales.  I'm here to start a franchise and be the owner and manager of the sales division.  The tech tree was beyond me but I have a fairly decent comprehensive grab of how our software works, I just don't know about the programming and all that.  So I had to look for someone who would handle I.T and all that.

Any who, a couple of months in I'm studying the Japanese language at a college.  Doing some online work, touring the place and I do find a decent place to set up for the franchise.  It takes some negotiating and such and I finally secure a lease to the business which is a store in a strip mall and it had a large venue of customers.  So clientele was not a problem.

Now this is where the story probably to others gets good.  About at least a couple of weeks into the business, there was a woman who was an accountant.  I knew because she told me she was looking to get the software for it.  Lucky for me at this time I had someone who was a recent graduate in technology working on the software.

This woman of course is Asian, has dark hair in a ponytail black, a set of brown eyes and she had a pretty cute face.  Although cute didn't really match her demeanor given she seemed like a very serious professional or so I thought.  We were discussing about the software, how she could it utilize it, costs and how it would help her in the future.  She was sold on it.  Then again I didn't see her after that, not until the next day.  It was closing time at seven and the same woman showed up.  She asked me if I was single like right off the bat and that was a baffling question.

""Yeah, I'm single...why do you ask?"" I said.

""Well...I'm just curious what it is like to date a foreigner."" she says.

I don't hold much grudge against the term foreigner.  Then again this girl wasn't so bad looking and she seemed like someone who had her shit together so I figured it might be worth it.

""Sure, name the time and place and the date can happen.""

She did seem rather ecstatic about it, even with someone she never met.  Hell I was a little surprised, cause I never had much luck with women or even focus any efforts on them.  So she wanted to do it right now, I didn't mind since I had nothing better to do.  We do go to a sushi restaurant, I don't like sushi but I've became rather tolerant of it since I've tried to get used to eating it.  They did offer some steak at least, so that was fulfilling as well.  Me and the woman who's name is Liu Yuko.  We have a talk about our lives, education and our goals the usual sort of stuff.  The conversation was becoming a little dull until she brought up something off...

""So how was the company you worked for as a bookkeeper?  Then you moved onto sales right?"" she says.

That was rather unusual.  Because in the entire conversation I never brought up the company I worked for and I never said anything about going from that to sales.  I mean I did mention the sales bit but I never said the circumstances as to why I was in it in the first place.

""Uhm...good I guess...?"" I said as I was baffled at the statement.

Liu just kept acting like nothing was wrong about what she said.  She just smiled at me and was giving me those puppy eyes as she did.  That kind of relieved the confusion I had and just moved on.  I just figured maybe she just did a little research maybe on LinkedIn maybe.  So we chat for a couple of more hours, then out of the blue I wanted to go to her place and so we did.  

Then weirdly things turn from us knowing each other as strangers who became slightly acquainted to rather...passionate lovers...all I did was...I don't know it became a blur.  We were just sitting on the couch, drinking tea and as soon as she looked me in the eyes I felt an intense burning desire to make love to her.  Things go straight from talking to stripping off our clothes and just doing it on the couch.  I woke up then the next morning, Liu was acting rather natural when she brought out eggs and pineapple for breakfast.  It was really unusual for someone to act like nothing happened from last night...

""I never knew you were such an animal..."" she did giggle at her remark, as she was setting down the plate of breakfast she was serving.  ""Here you need a good breakfast after that last night.""

I didn't really have much to say cause I was rather embarrassed to even point anything out.  So I just had the breakfast and told Liu that maybe we shouldn't see each other again...cause I was thinking I was just some one-night stand for her.  Cause I don't like the idea of being used, not even for a woman's own sexual pleasure.

She didn't seem very pleased with the response, but she just acted very composed and was still smiling.  By this time I'd already finish eating the breakfast cause I was eating rather quickly.  Then she was looking at the plate as if it were significant.  Then it wasn't until I actually had suddenly asked her to go out again sometime and she was quick to agree as if on cue.  After that I went back to my apartment to gather what the hell just happened.  After a few more dates, I left the company I worked for and dropped the franchise.  Returning to the U.S as well.

Because there were more strange occurrences happening to me anytime I went out with Liu.  Fast forward three months after leaving Japan, I'm residing in a nice county; have a new job, new apartment and it is all going fine until Liu knocked on my front door and introduced herself as my new neighbor.  How the hell did she find me...?  Then all of a sudden we just clicked again...why is this happening to me and what is...Liu even?"

I'm currently a rising senior and I recently got an offer from my current internship. However, I'm looking towards to asking for a better offer but also exploring and applying to other companies for this coming fall. How should I go about this? These are the options that I'm thinking of:

Option 1: Negotiate for a higher pay. then just accept it for now but what if I apply to another company in the fall and end up liking that more? Reneg?

Option 2: Ask for a longer period to accept but not negotiate the salary. This way they might be more lenient to extending the acceptance deadline.

Option 3: Option 1 + Option 2. This seems to be ideal but it doesn't seem to be a good look for me as in my negotiation one of the reasons is that I would love to work there because I had a great time in my internship.

Also, my internship hasn't ended yet. Should I try negotiating while I'm still interning? In-person? Or wait till its over and talk about it. Should I talk to my manager about it?
Also, how should I go about negotiating for a higher pay? I'm being offered below the market price. Would it be a bad idea to say that? Should I just stick with one good reason on why I want a higher offer? or put a plethora of reasons why I want a higher offer."

I'm a 25 year old Computer Science student finally finishing their Bachelors and am a little bit nervous about where to go after I graduated.

I haven't done any real internship at a software company which makes me nervous (I haven't really had time, due to having to work my way through school), but I do have a lot of other stuff including:

* A Ludum Dare entry that I made in 72 hours that has tons and tons of custom code I wrote. Like well over 50 scripts for this one project alone.

* I'm an AI developer for an indie game that hasn't launched yet, which I've created new pathfinding algorithms to fit our projects special needs, as well as custom behavior tree implementation. The game has tons of extreme challenges for AI that makes AI development extremely complicated and presents tons of unique challenges that aren't present in other games. 

* I have tons and tons of partial or one-feature projects like a random name generator, a perlin-noise based biome generator (and a more expanded version featuring custom height and temperature), a simple platforming system, a partially-written engine in Monogame, a MVC system for a turn based game I was working on, and an even more expanded version of my Ludum Dare entry.

* I work front desk at a small civil engineering company, and I created their entire company database using VBA and Access, including google map integration. I have also created a few other database projects for them, wrote software to generate templates for proposals, and wrote AutoLISP scripts to help them in Autocad.

* My GPA is pretty good, around 3.3-3.4.

* I've made a website that integrates a CMS system for my mother.

* I primarily work in C# and VBA, with some knowledge of C++, C, Python, LISP, 4 types of Assembly Language (lol), and Java.

Am I on track to be in a good position, career wise, when I finally graduate this spring? Or am I totally screwed because I haven't done any internships yet? I'm highly considering looking at game programming (Rockstar has an office less than 30 minutes from me and about 5 minutes away from my parents house, I used to deliver pizzas there!), but may just take a job doing other CS work.

Also when should I start looking for a job, and how do I go about finding companies hiring programmers? Is there any website to find jobs that would work for me? Is going through a recruiter something I should avoid (a few have been in touch with me)?

Edit: I'm in the Boston area if it helps. I heard it's a good place for programming, but will relocate if need be. "

I just need some serious comments on some points that I will mention below.

I have a friend of a friend, Alex. Alex is a smart kid. Alex is from Toronto, Canada. He went to a very highly regarded University in Canada for Computer Engineering. He did some internships at big companies as Apple. Not entirely sure on what he did there but maybe something along the lines of making apps for watches or mobile. So far Alex is a top notch kid.  

Alex however tells his friend that he earns $10k USD per month from Apple as an intern salary. You guys guys thik this is correct or inflated? From this point on I begin to question whatever Alex tells his friend.

Lets say he is good at what he does. Alex had also interned for a Toronto company call Smart Technology. He says that they were so impressed with him, they wanted him to quit university start immiditely. What he does there I have no idea. He said they were ready to pay him around 250k a year. Please remember he was in 3rd year of University at this point.  

Alex is now almost graduated. He has two job offers apparently, one from Apple at 120k USD per year (I think) and another from Smart Technologiea for a fucking 350k CAD per year.

He's going around telling everyone he's making 350k a year at this place, fresh out of University with a computer science degree.

I checked Glassdoor and a senior programmer at Smart makes at tops 120k CAD per year. A Apple machine algorithm employee makes 180k USD per year. 

He's telling his 350k per year salary to everyone, I have heard he bought jewellery worth 15k and bought this and that. He flies first class. The kid has some money but I dont think he's getting it from employment. 

My thoughts:
He must have made an app or something which might be churning him a lot of profit? But then why would he lie about it? My other theory is he has made something that he is uncomfortable to tell others about. For e.g. a porn site or something along those lines. By telling everyone he's getting money from emoyment, he can show off all the money he is making but doesn't have to reveal his sources.  

He also says that in he tech world as it stands, you can make a killing right after University for 3 to 4 years and after that you salary just becomes like the rest. What the hell does that mean ???

Please only serious comments. I'm a software programmer and I have never heard of anything like this before. Please help my sanity. Either I took a wrong step in my career, his kid is an amazing genius or he's just lying.

So what are your thoughts on Alex. If you think he's lying, what are your theories? Or what he is.saying is very plausible?

I recently started an internship in a smaller IT department(15 people, give or take) and have become more and more interested in the ""real world"" of programming. At this point in my life, I still don't see this as something I'd want to do for a career, but with how fast my interest is growing, who knows where I could end up, right? I have taken it upon myself to begin learning the basics of python because A). It seems like it can be used for a lot of things, and B). I plan on taking a python class in my last semester because I need to take another science class, so why not get a head start? So with all that being said, I am a rook. I don't know all of the inter workings.So ive came here to just see if anybody has any tips, insight, or whatver might help me moving forward. What is python good for? Where is it commonly used? Benefits vs. other languages? Is it all scripting/ command line stuff, or can you make a GUI application like in VB.NET or C#? Where is a good place to even begin?

The main reason why I want to do this now is because I'm in a dual enrollment program (Georgia) that requires me to live on campus at a state university. I see myself being busy most of the year, and having a good sense of direction beforehand doesn't seem like a bad idea. Since I just moved in and classes don't start until Monday, I thought ""why not?""

**Demographics**: Mixed African American and Asian male, attended large high school, lived with single mother all my life, far from rich.

**Intended major**: Currently IT major, will either stick with that or go Comp. Sci

**Academics**:

* **SAT**: 1420/1600 (690 reading/writing, 730 math), retaking December.
* **PSAT**: 1390/1520 (700 reading, 690 math), retaking this year
* **Class rank**: 13 of 666 (yes, really, a class of 666 students)
* **GPA**: 96.5 unweighted, 101.25 weighted
* **AP's**: Stats (5), Euro (4)
- All of my classes from this point forward will be college classes (they'll be weighted).

**Awards**: 

* State semifinalist in website designing competition for Technology Students Association. (10th)
* JV quiz bowl team, second in state, competed in Nationals. (10th)
* AMP'd JV team, second place (10th)

**Extracurriculars**: 

* STEM Academy +++
* Science Olympiad (9)
* Quiz Bowl (9, 10)
* County Community Service Team (10)
* Honors History Club (10)
* Mu Alpha Theta (National Math Honor Society, 10)
* Technology Student Association (10)

+++ Basically this program at my school for select students to be on a ""fast track"" in terms of classes relating to STEM fields. By meeting requirements for this academy, I can graduate with STEM honors, which I'm very keen on getting.

**Colleges I've Considered**

* Georgia Tech (In-state, Zell Miller, HOPE)
* UT Austin
* MIT (Why not?)
* Carnegie Mellon
* Any college I can get into through QuestBridge

**Extra Notes**

* I had no leadership roles in HS, which sucks, since I probably could've had I stayed, but I'm at college now so I can't.
* I don't think my family (mom and brother) can handle me leaving to go somewhere on the West Coast, like Stanford or CalTech.
* I'm currently not in any clubs at the college, since the school year hasn't started yet, and club rush is in late August. Even if I did, leadership would be a reach considering there are actual college students to compete against.
* I want to do a lot of community service this year, and maybe intern or shadow a professional in IT later on.

Thanks for taking your time to read all this, and I'm open to any suggestions you have."

5 years ago I realized I was in a career I absolutely hated. I was completely miserable so I decided I needed a change. I went to consult an academic adviser at the local college about obtaining a teaching license. I had a bachelor's degree in political science, but I took night classes to get the prerequisites I needed for the program. When it came time to student teach I cashed in my 401k, my life's savings, I took out a loan so I could have enough money to live on while I basically worked an unpaid year long internship. 

I finally had what I needed. I got the license. I had a hell of a time finding my first job but I caught on with a rural school a couple weeks before school started. I moved an hour north, away from my family for the job. I worked like hell. It was in a rural district so I was pretty much on an island, but I did the best job I could and was respected by my colleagues. 

I worked there for three years, and completely out of the blue my principal, who I thought I had a good working relationship tells me I'm being non-renewed. He suggests I resign so I don't have a black mark on my record. 

I get my references in order, I have three years of experience and effective ratings, it should be easier now to find a job than it was three years ago right? 

I've applied for every open high school job since May. I've had two interviews. One in May... and one just this morning. School starts next week and they're scrambling. It looks like an amazing fit. I killed the interview, I thought I had this job in the bag...

Nope, I just got called and told that they went another direction.

I've poured my heart and soul into teaching, and it's gotten me nowhere. Unemployed and my last check comes in 11 days. I have less than $700 in savings, and in heavy debt and my wife is a preschool teacher, so it's impossible for her to carry our household finances on her own. I feel like this interview was my absolute last chance to stay in teaching. For the last few months, with no teaching interviews I've applied for every job on Indeed I'm even remotely qualified for. 

My lease lasts until next May (signed days before the unexpected non-renewal) and I don't think I can even make rent for one extra month on my meager savings. 

I could literally cry right now, I'm at the end of my rope and have no idea what to do. "

I just finished up school with a degree in electrical engineering technology. I've always been more oriented towards IT positions, and most of the opportunities I've had are support related. I did my jobs very well, but now that those internships are over and I'm on my own I'm finding it difficult to find full time employment. 

Some skills:

* Troubleshooting and resolving Windows, MacOS/OSX / Ubuntu and Debian issues
* Diagnosing hardware issues related to laptops and desktops (I'm sure I can do servers as well but I have not been exposed to them)
* All microsoft office products
* Teamquest and Cirba Analysis tools
* Experience with VMware ESX, Docker, and Ubiquiti solutions in a lab environment
* 3D drawing applications such as CAD, Creo Parametric, Solidworks

In the past I've worked in support positions and at one point I was on a team that did performance application testing for internal applications. Right now I can see myself doing more support (tier 1/2) work as I've done before but I think my resume may be lacking as far as showing my abilities even though it clearly states my previous work experiences supporting customers. I'm a very dedicated employee with a great work ethic and if I don't know something I try to learn in order to benefit the company and those that I work with. 

I guess I'm just trying to figure out how to get more responses from employers. I try to avoid positions where coding is involved because I don't know how to (never had a project that drove me to want to learn, big mistake) and I make sure to write solid CV's that target what the company does. I'm also working on my Network+ cert because it would look good. Should I make a bigger push to learn to code? Should I choose another cert? Should I take a step back again and ask what I want in the long run?

Does anyone have any other advice. It is very appreciated. Thank you so much!"

**TL;DR:**  Racked up A's in the B.S. in CS program at a state school ranked ~50 for CS in the U.S., did nothing outside of class, only know Java and C, worried about no ""real world skills"" when applying to entry level jobs this upcoming academic year

So my situation is a bit weird.  I'm a rising senior with a 3.94 GPA from a state school ranked ~50 in C.S. in the United States.  (Yes, I am aware that my GPA from a non-elite school isn't going to do much for me, which is why I'm posting here.)  I spent my time working hard for my classes, but did essentially no outside learning or side projects on my own.  (Spent all my free time on other activities like classical piano, reading fiction, distance running, etc.)  The result of this is, the only languages that I know are Java and C...and even then I don't feel like I have a lot of hands-on experience in these.  I know nothing about web development.  Even regarding my coursework, I've never taken a course on networking or computer security (closest I've come is Operating Systems).  And no undergrad research either.

So did I get an internship last summer?  Yeah, but it was in computer vision (for a defense contractor in the Washington D.C. area) and I was using MATLAB to implement stuff in research papers.  Which seems to not really be a programming language used much outside of research.  And quite frankly, I was doing more ""applied linear algebra and calc"" than I was ""software engineering.""

And now here I am, trying to apply for a full time, entry-level software development role.  With very little hands-on experience and kind of representing THE gap between ""computer science"" and ""software engineering.""  TBH, grinding Leetcode/CTCI doesn't actually seem that bad because it's like revisiting DS&amp;A for me but I'm worried that because I know very little about ""software engineering"" and have so little experience getting my hands dirty (with only Java and C as languages to list on my resume), my resume will get tossed before even being considered for any kind of interview.  Actually, that's precisely what happened for my internship search and I feel very lucky to have gotten an internship tech-related despite not doing any ""real software engineering""...

And since I didn't do undergrad research and my summer internship wasn't research (because I was just implementing already discovered algorithms), looks like trying to apply to grad schools is not in the cards for me EXCEPT for terminal master's cash cow programs that will pull me further into debt.

Am I as screwed as I think, or will my work experience (which I did not have when applying to internships last year) from my summer internship actually help me out this time, even though I obviously wasn't really doing ""software engineering""?

I’m a Psych graduate, and have a professional license (albeit not as a Psychologist, but one related to the field), but my current role is one on the technical/accounting side of Human Resources. While my manager appraises me positively for my performance, doing the job gives me a heavy heart. I hate waking up and thinking in the morning that I’ll have to report to work. 

Also, I find my manager a little too dictating. I find that she doesn’t give us the opportunity to speak and also *really* hear us. As one of my teammates puts it, *“we’re being treated like horses as if we don’t get tired.”*

We’re five in the team. Well, we used to be five, but one teammate (just a month ahead of my hire date) recently just filed a resignation.

They used to have a different manager back then, and she told me that she really looked forward every single day despite of the work volume. She felt motivated and inspired to gaining a lot of knowledge from their previous manager. 

Until the present manager came in. She feels stressed, unmotivated and unvalued. The same thing with the one teammate that just recently resigned. And so am I. 

I’ve had my internship experience before. My previous head inspires me to be like him, or be even better than him. Sadly, I do not feel this with my current manager. She’s not a mentor material.

I hate my current job, plus that issue with our manager. I’m afraid I’ll get more errors in the future. That makes me consider of resigning. However, I’m also afraid that if I resigned with roughly three months, I might find it hard to find the next job.

1) I want to learn how to use AJAX, properly. I know how to use sockets to connect with my db and update things real time, but I've heard AJAX is another method and some job listings I've seen asks to be familiar with it. I've search on google and found snippits and such but I still don't have a good grasp on how to use it. Can anyone point me at a good tutorial/guide on how to use it and when to use it.

Side question for Q1: I know AJAX is mainly used when calling API's, but I think I read that it can also be used to connect to my db? How would that work? I have an idea I just thought of but I feel like it might not be the best. My idea was to basically create an API from ur db and have a .json page on your website and have it call your own website, but that seems inefficient not to mention it will let all users have access to all the info.

2) React is pretty popular around my area and I'm going to start learning that too. I already bought a course and I'm totally set to learn it once finals are done. However I've been wondering one thing. I've never come across a time where I've needed to use React. I've built a chat application, a social media platform, a blogging platform with a cms, and even a to-do list, but I never used React for any of those. All I needed/used was a simple templating tool like EJS/Jade/Pug, and maybe jQuery in some moments, and I was good to go. What's all the rage about this? Can't most of what react do be done with other tools like even vanilla js.

3) So due to some unfortunate events I'm going to have to most likely take the next whole semester off. That's 4 months of doing absolutely nothing. I'd like to look for a job, and I'm sure I can find some random sales job, but I'm wondering if there's the slightest chance I could get a web dev/software eng job. I have the tools and skills, but I don't have the time. What I mean is that there is barely any internships around my area, or contracts, or part time jobs, but there's plenty full time. And I've already talked to some other devs about this but the general consensus was that it's highly unlikely that a company will hire me and train me only to have me leave in 4 months. How true is this? This makes sense in my head and it just makes me sadder that I can't find anything in that field. If anyone has any tips or advice on what I should look for, I'd greatly appreciate it!

They used to have a different manager back then, and she told me that she really looked forward every single day despite of the work volume. She felt motivated and inspired to gaining a lot of knowledge from their previous manager. 

Until the present manager came in. She feels stressed, unmotivated and unvalued. The same thing with the one teammate that just recently resigned. And so am I. 

I’ve had my internship experience before. My previous head inspires me to be like him, or be even better than him. Sadly, I do not feel this with my current manager. She’s not a mentor material.

I hate my current job, plus that issue with our manager. I’m afraid I’ll get more errors in the future. That makes me consider of resigning. However, I’m also afraid that if I resigned with roughly three months, I might find it hard to find the next job. 

I feel stressed. Even much more, I believe. I used to downplay things until it cools down, but with this.. I do not know. I tried looking at the positive things this predicament would bring me, but the baggage that this is putting on my mental health just gets heavier each day.

I need your advice."

Thanks to a co-op program I have 1.5 years of internship experience between 2 companies. I'm from and go to school in upstate NY.

Currently in the middle of my job search and I'm faced with a dilemma. I have 2 offers in front of me. One from a large company near Washington DC where I had an internship, and another from a startup in upstate NY.

Both are good offers for their respective area. The problem is I hated living near DC, so I can't see myself being happy doing it again. On the other hand I feel like a small startup in upstate NY will hurt any future employment opportunities. Without any kind of name recognition I would struggle to ""move up"" when looking for another job in the future.

I like the startup a lot, and think I would enjoy working there. I could also live at home rent-free for a year and completely pay off all my student loans. But I also know that I should assume I'll switch jobs eventually. So will I be shooting myself in the foot working at a place like this right out of school?"

I'm not in co-op so I didn't have to get any internships, so I started to read up on /r/cscareerquestions and other places to get tips. A lot of people say side projects and things like that, but I don't know what to code. I then came to the realization that I might not actually like programming all that much.

I started out in math really wanting to transfer into CS since I did not get into it from high school. I started having second thoughts about transferring near the end of first year, but I transferred anyways because I could always switch back to math if something goes wrong. So now I'm here, and I don't know if CS is something that I like. I think the classes are interesting and can keep up with the work, but the thrill I receive from finishing a big assignment is just not there when I code stuff on my own. I feel like the same thing will happen if I start working in software, it will just not be enjoyable. 

I took math 235 and math 237 just in case I want to switch back into math or combine CS with some other plan. I'm now deciding whether or not I should stay in CS or switch back to math. I find math interesting just like CS but it just seems that if I switch to math, the only other option is to go to graduate school. I want to make a decision like this soon, for the reason that marks in 3A and beyond count. My average is already ruined from second year only and this is my chance to start over. I have no idea if I want to work in industry or go back to school, this is a tough thing for me.

So how did you guys make the decision of whether or not to stay in your program? Anyone who wants to share their experience is welcome, and I would appreciate it. 

TL;DR: I switched from math to CS and I'm having second thoughts and continuing in CS."
6ta5v7,103,2017-08-12,My CS50 Journey and Review,austintackaberry,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/6ta5v7/my_cs50_journey_and_review/,"#General Overview

*CS50 is fantastic.* I read that it is the single most popular course at Harvard. People who aren't even CS majors sign up to take the course. On campus, they have tshirts, free food, a hackathon, etc. You don't get any of that on edX, but you do get the following: a great IDE developed by CS50 TAs, a community of support on reddit, stackoverflow, facebook, twitter, etc., debugging tool (debug50), and a tool to immediately check if your pset solution is correct (check50). There is even a little fun CS50 tv show with little 2 min episodes after each lecture. I could go on. You don't have to take notes on the lectures because there's a webpage that has all the notes. There are short videos done by TAs explaining some of the concepts in more detail. There are walkthroughs that help you set up the pset solutions. 
 
#Scratch and C - pset0 to pset5

Pset0 is in Scratch, a visual programming language that warms you up to programming. The next 5 psets are in C which is the exact opposite of Scratch. It is the lowest level programming language. You have to do manual memory management in C. A lot of things that seem like they should be easy (especially after having taken Udacity CS101 in Python), are not. You want to add an element to an array? Oh that should be easy, just append.something should work right? Nope. You have to make a new array that includes that extra element unless you had previously allocated extra memory for that original array. **The concepts get pretty difficult especially on the 4th and 5th C psets. Pointers are difficult. Trees and Tries are difficult.** The most challenging and most rewarding pset for me was the 5th C pset where you make a spell checker. Sounds kind of easy right? You have some sort of dictionary, and if your word is in the dictionary, then it's spelled correctly...But this is C we're talking about. You have to make the dictionary, starting with a text file of words...a lot of words. You can't just iterate through the file, that will take too long. You want your program to run quickly. Tries or hashtables allow you to find your word in your dictionary in the amount of time it takes to iterate over each character in your word, not the number of words in your dictionary. Pretty neat, right? Right. But it is mind-bending, keyboard-breaking, hole-in-wall-making-ly difficult and time-consuming.
 
#Python - pset6

The next language you learn in CS50 is Python. And to show you how much easier it is to learn and use, they have you redo your first 3 psets in Python. When you first look at it, you think it is going to take forever, but then it doesn't take that long and you hate C and love Python. You think, great, C sucked but now I get to learn Python, this is going to be easy! Then boom.

#Python and others - pset7 and pset8
 
*SQL, HTML, Javascript.*

*CSS, JQuery, JSON.*

*Bootstrap, Django, Flask.*
 
What are all of these? Which are languages? Which are frameworks? What's a framework? Ahhh! 
 
Luckily, you don't have to build websites from scratch using everything I listed above. The next couple psets involve completing websites that are partially built; however, looking at code using languages and frameworks that you just briefly learned is very daunting. It's like starting an essay in high school, or a project in college. Half the battle is just starting. Once you start and understand one aspect of the code, you realize it's doable, get on a role and boom 5 hours go by and you're learning and caught up in the pset. 
 
**Pset7 is a stock trading app.** Users can register, log in, log out, buy stock, sell stock, look up stock. Once you finish, you feel very accomplished. I (kinda) made that! Before CS50, a stock trading website seemed like magic. Now it seems difficult, and though I'm sure there's a lot more to it when there are real users, you at least now know approximately what is involved and how it works. 

**Pset8 is called ""Mashup"" and it is a Google Maps map where you can search for a location and you will see the top 10 news stories at that location.** There's a lot of javascript which is difficult because it is asynchronous and functions are first class citizens. Asynchronous code just means that code can be running in one spot while other code is running elsewhere. I'm not sure I'm qualified to explain functional programming much, but I'll give it a shot. The programming you have done up until javascript has been object oriented which means you focus on objects, variables having values and the values changing. You work with functions but only, so that you end up with values that can be stored in a variable. Functional programming focuses on functions rather than objects. When this button is clicked, DO this. A lot of functions in javascript take functions as inputs or return functions as outputs. There are more qualified people that can explain functional programming, but this is a perspective of someone who is in the process of learning it. My main point here is that it makes you think differently, forces you to break your tendency to think sequentially. Similarly to pset7, once you have completed pset8, you feel very accomplished because you (kinda) built a useful, complex web app! 
 
This is where my CS50 journey pauses. I am currently doing freecodecamp and Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp. When I am a little further along, I will come back and do the final project. 
 
#Review

Now for my review and whether or not CS50 is for you. I stated previously that **I think CS50 is fantastic. It helps you understand a lot of the core CS concepts, and then gives you the confidence to build cool projects.** It is very difficult and fast-paced, but if you stick with it, I think it will pay off. When I try to explain it to bootcamp students it is hard to articulate why it's important to start in C and learn core CS concepts. Maybe I just want it to be valuable because I took it and liked it. The real reason is probably because neither of us are far enough along to really know what is the best way. 

Web development bootcamp students are getting a crash course on building projects and making websites. They are getting prepared to immediately add value to a company. The other school of thought is similar to the traditional education system. You learn the core concepts, and you will be able to pick up everything else during internships or personal projects. **As a self-taught learner you have the opportunity to control your own education.** I don't know for sure, but from what I've read it seems like it is beneficial to know the core concepts for interviews and also on the job and for your long-term career.

If we assume that you need to understand the core concepts, then intro courses need to have a balance between core concepts and the WOW factor. If we were all robots with no emotions, then I am sure that all intro courses would be core concepts with no projects. Given that we are humans and not robots, if intro courses are all core concepts and no projects then people would shy away because they think it's dry and boring. In general I am the type of person that prefers the core concepts. I don't need to start my programming journey by doing a tutorial to build a fancy web app. I would prefer to get a foundation, knowing that though it might be boring or stale, I am willing to put in the time now, so that learning other concepts later will be easier and come quicker. Having said all that, I was pretty pumped to finish the stock trading and maps web applications. Also, I haven't touched on this yet, but David Malan is an amazing speaker, one of the most engaging speakers I have ever listened to. Though the lectures can be 2 hours and they can be talking about pointers and tries in C, the time flies by and I am engaged the whole time.

If all you want to do is web development, nothing more and nothing less, then CS50 probably doesn't make sense for you. I am sure it would be helpful, but in terms of return on investment, I am sure you would get more value in starting at FCC or Colt Steele Web Developer's Bootcamp. Having said that, if the kind of jobs you are looking for have interviews that involve HackerRank or whiteboarding, then that's a different story. **If you want to learn the fundamentals, and you are determined and motivated to get it done no matter how long it takes, then CS50 is for you. Make persistence your friend, and CS50 will be your friend.** "

I guess I should preface this by saying that I love my family, but I'm starting to get hurt by the lack of support I receive from them. I'm entering my third year of study in the social sciences (anthropology. Yes, I know it's not the most employable major, but I'll talk about that later), and recently changed my status to part-time student. I've really needed a break from academia to assess my physical and mental health, and I figure that part-time will prevent me from graduating with substantial student debt since I'll have more time to work and maybe take a few internships. I should also note that I live with my parents, but I pay for my education 100% out of my own pocket. Apologies if this is a bit long.

Anyways, when I first got to university my family was very proud because everyone else in our family ended up going to colleges or didn't have post-secondary degrees at all. But their attitudes have changed from pride to almost belittlement. In my first year, my family didn't even know what I was studying, and they were telling their friends and colleagues that I studied biology or writing. Eventually, they figured out what I was actually studying (or so I thought) and I started getting a lot of ""Are you sure you don't want to study ___ instead?"" from my mother, but shrugged it off because my grades have been good and I got a scholarship. No one really bugged me.

Fast forward to earlier this year. I ask my father about his opinions on some of the options I have for declaring my minor. He confesses that he doesn't even know what I study, so I tell him. He flat out tells me he doesn't consider anthropology a ""real"" degree with ""real skills"", and tells me that it's just a hobby. He tells me that I should go do business, nursing, or teaching (note that none of these suggestions are compatible with my interests or skills). He ends the conversation by turning on the TV, and he's silently shaking his head. A few weeks later, I hear him ask my mother ""What is anthropology?"" She tells him about how a lot of it is about studying the roles of culture and religion. He says ""People really study this? People should learn to mind their own goddamn business."" 

At some point, my brother announces that he's going to be studying a STEM field. I announce roughly around the same time that I'll be taking some time off from academia, and will be a part-time student instead. Both my parents get angry at me, and my father says something along the lines of ""What's wrong? You don't like to work?"" The general perception of me in my household goes from 'good student' to 'lazy, with no direction'. Meanwhile, my brother has been increasingly in my face about how a lot of graduates in my major end up in unrelated professions. I've told my family on multiple occasions that I knew from the start that anthro isn't the most employable major, but it's something I'm genuinely passionate about, and I believe I can make work in some way. At a family gathering, I confess that I ""don't know what I want to be when I grow-up yet,"" and I notice that people give me weird looks. I later confide in my aunt that I'm taking a year part-time because I don't want to have so much debt, but she responds with ""But everyone's in debt."" I've even told my parents about this, and they've had the same attitude. I jokingly have said ""I just don't want to be a slave to the man, man."" but my brother always begins to aggressively berate me, and everyone else joins in. 

Now, every time I'm asked about my academics it's always at my expense, and I end up getting called ""stupid."" in some way. Today I got scolded by my father because I should apparently be buying $5000 in stocks so I can get dividends, even though I'll need this money by April for my next year's tuition. Again, the whole thing came down to an attitude that basically says ""Poor DisposableCameraa, he's too stupid to know how he's screwing up his future."" I was able to take this attitude at first, but it's starting to weigh on me now because I'm having a lot of doubts about my future and if I'll even be able to afford school. They show visible favouritism towards my brother for his pursuit of a STEM degree, and I'm certain they'll fork out money for him despite the fact he has a WOW addiction and dropped out of high school once. I'm in vulnerable place emotionally (not just because of this issue, but other things. This issue just makes me feel worse since I've always trusted on my family's advice), and would really benefit from people telling me about their experiences or some advice, I think.

TLDR; In university studying social sciences. I decide to become a part-time student after two years of study so I can make money and avoid crippling debt. Family begins belittling me for what I study, and my brother makes it worse by bragging about how he'll have a STEM degree. I'm beginning to find it very hard to cope with my family's attitudes because I'm in a vulnerable place emotionally at this time."

This may be a strange question but it's been in the back of my head for a long time. I want to make it clear that this is not necessarily my main plan as I know that it is probably extremely hard to achieve.

A friend of mine has a cousin that made some product and sold it for somewhere near one million USD. He did this right out of college, and he recently did the same for another product that he made. That got me thinking about pursuing a life like that where I make small, but impressive prototypes, and then sell to the highest bidder. This is so appealing to me because I genuinely enjoy just making things, but the issue is that there aren't too many jobs that allow me to pursue that kind of lifestyle.

Now I'm not a complete airhead, and I don't want to make the next facebook and sell my big idea for millions of dollars. I really just want to be able to make things and at the same time generate a livable wage. Maybe this isn't actually very viable, and that's okay, but if you know of any jobs or ways of living that sort of match this fantasy-like lifestyle that I would like, please feel free to share. I'm aware that a lifestyle exactly like what I'm depicting isn't some walk in the park, and that's okay because that's not what I'm looking for. I just finished up an IT internship for my local government, and while the internship definitely had it's benefits I wasn't really loving my time there, which was somewhat shocking because of how much I enjoy programming. I am aware that the work I was doing there isn't reflective of all IT/CS related jobs, but it made me realize that what I was doing there isn't what I'd like to do for quite some time.

Some background info on me so everyone doesn't think I'm just some big dreamer:

I'd call myself a proficient programmer and I have quite a few personal projects [(Github account)](https://github.com/SolarFloss) that show off some of the technologies that I've worked with. I'm about to start my sophomore year in college and I currently go to a community college from which I will be transferring from after this year. Being that I am at a community college, I have a lot more free time than a majority of students that attend traditional universities. Because of this I try to make the most out of my free time by working on projects. Some big, some small. Some successful, some not so successful.

Anyways thank you for reading this far because you surely did not have to! If you have any questions feel free to ask."

Could this backfire?,skilliard4,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/6tcj99/how_do_i_talk_to_my_current_employer_about/,"So I currently have a part time job I love, working IT at a local government organization. I work 4 days during the week, and one day on the weekend. I report to the IT Manager and work on all kinds of IT projects alongside them. I also assist at the help desk when I'm not busy on projects or when they need extra help.

While the job does provide all kinds of experiences and challenges doing exciting things in IT, I want to broaden my horizon. It doesn't really provide much opportunity to code or develop software, which I want to get an internship for.

The problem is, I'm worried about losing my job if I leave for a temporary internship. I've accomplished a lot at it and really enjoy it, and I'm worried I'd get replaced  or the position will get eliminated while I'm gone.

I'm on really good terms with my boss, he's the nicest guy ever. My concern is more about what upper management would decide. They seem like good people, but I don't know them that well.

My position is one that the organization can survive without. I accomplish a lot and provide a lot of value, and have solid performance reviews, but I worry that they'll just eliminate the position when I'm gone.

One alternative is to ask to just work weekends until I finish the internship, so that way I remain an employee. But the issue with this is a communication barrier- It'll be difficult to work on projects if I only work weekends, since my boss works normal FT Hours and obviously isn't in on weekends. I'd have to email them questions, and I wouldn't see a response until the following weekend.

What do you guys advice I do? Should I wait until I have an internship offer to ask about temporary leave? Or should I ask ahead of time?

23 years ago, when I was 18 years old and at college, I did a mandatory two weeks' 'work experience', which was essentially an internship.

There were a list of businesses which had volunteered to accept students, and naturally I picked out a computer company.

It was quite a small operation that did both hardware and software - niche stuff for industrial customers.

I was in the hardware department's workshop, and the software department was in the office next door.

There was a German guy who worked in software. I'm afraid his name escapes me, this being so long ago.
He was a very fun guy to be around, always jolly.

His English was excellent, though he had quite a strong accent.
While very good, his English was not perfect, especially when having to use technical jargon.
He consequently used to talk with his hands a lot, miming out the things he was talking about.

One day, he was having trouble with some piece of hardware, and brought it into the workshop for the engineers to take a look at.

He was explaining what was wrong, and joking about how frustrating it was for him that the hardware wasn't working right.

In jest, he picked up a ball peen hammer that was on the bench and swung it up in the air as if to smash the offending hardware.

Unfortunately, unbeknownst to him, another engineer who happened to be walking by had stopped to look over his shoulder at the hardware.

The hammer swung back and smacked the poor guy square in the forehead.

Everyone watched in horror as the site of the hammer blow instantly turned black and swelled up to the size of half a ping pong ball, and then started pouring with blood.

He managed to stay on his feet and insisted he was ok, but the boss insisted upon calling an ambulance and he was carted off to hospital.

I felt so sorry for the German guy, because he was obviously mortified to have done something so careless and injured his colleague.

Luckily the wounded engineer was a good sport, there was no serious injury (though it LOOKED serious) and the next day they were able to laugh together about it.

I'm sure there's a moral to this story somewhere..."

While rushing to complete my graduation requirements, I pushed off job searching as priority and decided to take the easy route; signing a return offer from my intern position where I write code at an investment bank. 

While I don't hate working at an investment bank, I can't help but feel a lack of fulfillment. I want to work on a product that I'm passionate about (at a tech firm ideally) and hope to eventually create a startup of my own where I can make my ideas a reality. I am currently bound by a one year contract and as a fresh graduate I don't know what the correct steps are to pursue my dreams. 

I'd great appreciate any and all career advice as well as answers to the following questions:
 
1.What should my career priorities be as a fresh graduate?

2.What should I be prioritizing in the next 12 months if I want to transition to working at a major tech firm? 

3.What are some short(1-2years) and medium (~5years) term goals  I should have?

I spent this summer on my college campus. I subleased an apartment starting early May and ending August 1st. The fall semester does not start until August 28th and I wanted to stay in the same apartment so I spoke with the next incoming tenant - let's call her Nina - who was looking for a subleaser to take over the whole lease which does not end until next year. 

After we spoke and agreed I would take over the lease starting August 1st to August 1st of 2018, I was offered a co-op internship for the fall semester. I scrambled to find a student looking for only a fall semester place since I changed my plans on Nina and found Joe. After Nina spent hours on the phone day after day with the leasing company, we fleshed out a plan that the lease would officially become Joe's August 1st until December 31st and I would take the rest of it. Joe was okay with me moving out August 18th since he was finishing up an internship as well outside of town.

August 9th, I come back from work and all the lights in my apartment are on and the AC unit is blasting at 69. Things on my bed were moved around and it looked like someone had slept on top of my comforter. I knew right away it must have been maintenance because I had a nasty experience with them before and I brushed it off as them being total assholes again. In my college town, landlords/companies/maintenance do not need to give you a notice before entering your apartment.

That same day, someone had moved out and dumped all this brand new furniture right next to the dumpster in front of my house. Since Joe and I had talked about sharing furniture, I decided to move some of it in so we could both benefit from it. As I'm disassembling a bar rack, a guy drives up looking really confused and asks me if I'm from the leasing company. Our conversation reveals that A. I was taking his things and B. He did not know why his things were in the dumpster. He seemed really distraught and I asked him if he had received some kind of eviction notice or anything. He didn't get anything, not a phone call, not a sign on the door, not an email, etc. He honestly didn't know why they would throw out his things. 

This poor guy jumped into the dumpster with one of his friends looking for his PC but couldn't find it. Pretty much most of his things had been picked away by the time he arrived. He drove away and in hindsight, I really wish I had exchanged contact information with him. 

Next morning I get a voice mail around 9am. The woman on the message says that maintenance checked that I was still living on the premises and as such they would be coming by at noon and taking all my things. I call back right away and it gets wild. 

One of the associates tells me that since I was supposed to leave August 1st, they would seize all my property and put it in their storage. I explained to them that I had made a deal with the next subleaser and that it was fine I was still there. Joe, Nina, and I had even split a sublease fee three ways. She says ""we have no record of this Joe you are talking about"" and I said that was impossible but she was making implications like I was making things up. She eventually transfers me to manager #1, Allie. Allie claims the same thing, there is no record of anyone named Joe and quote, ""I don't really care what Nina told you"". Basically, I had to leave and she wouldn't budge. I explained that it wasn't possible for them to take my things with three hours notice and after considerable negotiation, she graciously extended to 6pm. 

I get off the phone and contact my parents, my partner, and Joe. Joe is SHOCKED as he had spent two hours on the phone the day before fixing the sublease contract that they had written up wrong. Apparently, they had written up his sublease to last for the full term rather than one semester. He asked them to write it up again before signing it and this is why they were claiming they had no record of him. The thing is, they were altogether pretending they had never heard of Joe before.

My parents were shocked as well and while I was speaking with my partner, they called the company themselves. They claimed to my parents on the phone that they had emailed me multiple times (never happened) and followed it up with a phone call (that very morning). I triple checked all my email accounts and even my spam folder. They NEVER gave me an eviction notice. The phone call that morning was the only notice. I do not own a car nor can I drive nor have anyone I could stay with on campus. My parents live in Hawaii and it was by pure coincidence my father was staying in a city about three hours away from my college for a few days. His car was broken so the soonest I could move out (assuming my entire apartment was packed) was the time it would take to fix the car plus three hours of driving. The company basically set me up to fail with the time they wanted me out. 

My partner is coworkers with a landlord, Rex, and I got to talk with Rex for a moment. He said to call the police immediately because they couldn't do what they were threatening. He said he WISHED he could kick out tenants right away like that.

I also spoke with Joe's friend, Alex, who is an associate attorney. He said that I could stay with an early move-in agreement from Nina in writing but Nina of course is in Europe with no way of contacting her at the moment. He also strongly suggested I take it to court but his knowledge is limited as he is very young and just finished his studies. He agreed I should call the police if they attempted to take my things.

After talking to everybody and frantically packing in between, I called the company again and asked to speak to the manager. They transferred me to Tori who was claiming she was the manager and that Allie was not available when I kept insisting on talking to her. I told Tori that I had spoken to an attorney and that I had been advised to call the police. She interrupted me and said, ""You can do whatever you want but you have to be out by 6pm"". I tried to finish my sentence but she kept repeating, ""I don't care, you can do whatever you want but you can't be there at 6pm"". She hung up on me.

I called non-emergency police and explained the situation. I told the officer about the man whose things had been thrown out as well and we hung up so he could talk to the leasing company himself. He called me back to say he had spoken to the manager named Chris. I told him right away that two other people had already claimed to be THE manager and he seemed to agree that they were very disorganized and something was up. He also told me that Chris explained the next lease did not start until August 26th and that they needed a cleaning crew to come in and meet a quota or something like that. That they had never told Nina that Joe's sublease (now they suddenly knew who he was) would begin August 1st and that no one should be on the premises until the 26th. The officer also told me that he could not do very much since it was a civil matter.

I get a phone call after from Allie, the original manager, suddenly being very polite and sweet with me and asking if 9am the following day was possible. She says they won't throw any of my things out, only put them in their storage. At this point, I didn't want to deal with them anymore and said okay. My father eventually got the car fixed and picked me up. We scrambled to find a storage unit that would take my things late at night and the only ones not sold out were really expensive. We spent all night driving back and forth between my place and the storage unit without sleeping.

At 8:45am the following day, I manage to walk in after moving things since 9am the previous day. None of the ""managers"" are present and there are only a couple of people there. They're really confused why I'm there before 9am and I give them my name and they're still puzzled as to who I am and why I am turning in a key. They give me a move out form to fill out and try to charge me some kind of ""holdover"" fee but I said the word no a lot and they didn't end up charging me anything. I did not date the form.

Out of spite, my father and I ate in the car outside the apartment. We stayed until about noon and no one ever came in the time we were there. I left a lot of things inside the place, including furniture, I don't care about but I haven't been contacted about them one way or another. I am pretty sure no one has gone in or may even go in before I was going to move out anyway on the 18th.

Total costs from this ordeal: 

really expensive storage unit I would not have gotten since Joe would have used my furniture and dishes

hotel for three nights (also super expensive)

lots and lots of gas

Missed two entire days of work (Thursday and Friday)

One third of the sublease fee I suddenly can no longer do

If you have made it this far, can I sue? The company's headquarters are conveniently located where my next internship is. "

Would it be wise to jump to a new position?,flametex,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/6tdtsk/currently_burnt_out_doing_t12_tech_support_would/,"Hey everyone. I currently work for a large tech company and have been working there for 6+ years now (started as an intern and now I manage). I manage a small team that handles the large influx of what I would consider be T1 and T2 internal based issues. These can be things such as my monitor does not work to I am trying to do thing X on server Y with command Z and the output/script/job/etc is not working. The things that come in and tasks we do are really jack of all trades but masters of none. For not having a degree and being young the pay is great with benefits (60k+). However I feel just burnt out. Currently I dread driving my way into the office just to deal with another silly person who can't figure out his laptop or could not bother to read a FAQ to setup wifi. We do get some pretty complicated things come in but they are few and far between, plus even those tasks are just basic (follow a help guide, troubleshoot a bit, triage). I would say the position is pretty relaxed considering I have mastered the role and I am able to pump out tickets like no one's business while managing the team but have been passed up for a promotion a few times now. Recently, I updated my linkedin profile and started putting feelers out which lead me to be contacted by a headhunter for a Linux admin based position. In the role I would be doing far more advanced tasks then what I am doing now but am pretty inexperienced outside of Windows on a corporate level (mainly do things on the side at home but a little bit at the office when possible) I did get my RHCSA this year as well as my ITIL foundation certification so I think it would be worth a long shot to further skills and experience as I really have no other formal education. The pay is a bit better and the benefits would be about the same plus or minus. I have gone ahead and interviewed with the company and currently I am on my 3rd phone interview with their team.  However, I am a bit hesitant since I would be leaving what I know systems and  job spec wise for entirely unknown territory plus would be leaving the job security I have now. Would this be worth the jump to further my career in something I want to do? Or should I play it safe and figure out what I could learn on my own?"

Should I drop Spring and try to improve in algorithms, data structures and concepts like OOP, interfaces, design patterns? It is not like I am lacking a lot in those fields, but it will be easier to work on little projects like implementing single algorithm than working on big back-end application and I think that it will be easier to get intern or job as a junior with really good basics instead of being intermediate with basic stuff and beginner  in Spring.

Audrey was released from the hospital the next day. Honestly, I think they only kept her as long as they did due to her mental state, which was, understandably, not good. None of ours was.

“Addi’s parents asked me to pick out clothes for..for..her..” She told us at my door, unable to bring herself to say ‘funeral’. “I can’t. I can’t go back there.”

Sarah nearly scooped her up, as she ushered her inside, but was careful of her arm in the sling. Audrey was referring to the studio apartment she had shared with Addison, a couple blocks from the spot where Addison died.

“I can’t go back there, alone.” She finished, choking back tears.

“You don’t have to—“ Sarah began.

“We’re coming with you.” Claire finished.

Audrey weighed maybe a hundred pounds after gorging on beer and pizza. I had never seen her look so thin, as she did that day. Before I realized what I was doing I’d gathered her up in my arms, and just held her, if only to remind myself that she was still there. I felt hands on my back, and arms wrapping around me, Claire’s, Sarah’s, Audrey’s. It took me a minute to realize that some of the tears flowing were mine.

***

When we got to Audrey and Addison’s apartment, I collapsed on the couch, opting to let them go through Addison’s things. Instead, I got lost. That’s easy to do when your memory is like mine. This place, less than a year past. Claire and I had been dating for about three months. We all went to Auds' and Addi’s place to play some silly card game.

“I shit you not,” Addison said, laughing, “My mom tried to convince me I wasn’t gay.” She picked up her drink and took a healthy swallow. “She actually tried to tell me that I wasn’t gay, I just needed to find an effeminate boy with a small penis.”

“No.” Claire said in disbelief.

“Oh, this is true.” Audrey added.

“You’re fucking with me, right?” I replied, conscious of the fact that I was the new person in this circle.

“Nope.” Addison grinned. “They came around eventually, but I was fourteen! I’d never even kissed a girl, or a boy for that matter, and my save-yourself-for-marriage mother is trying to convince me to just fuck a guy with a little dick and see how I like it!”

“That’s horrible.” I said, trying not to laugh.

“Mortifying.” Addison corrected, “But Mom and Dad had my back, once they came to terms.” She explained, cracking open a fresh beer. “Dad went to the pastor at our old church. He gave him all sorts of literature on those ‘conversion therapy camps’—“

“That’s barbaric.“ Sarah said, without thinking.

“Exactly.” Addison continued. “Dad said the same thing. When Mom and Dad told the pastor they wouldn’t send me to one of those places, he told us not to come back.” She sipped at her beer. “Truthfully, that hurt the worst. I loved going to that church, I loved singing every Sunday, it was fun, really. And all my old friends acting like I had the goddamned plague or something. I was like, ‘look you stupid bitches, you can’t catch the gay.’” She chuckled. “If that were the case I would given it to Sally Weiss.” Audrey’s eyes went wide, Addison grinned at her, “Fourteen, baby.”

Audrey cocked her head and grinned back at her. Then, almost in unison, they blew kisses at each other.

This was the one time I wished I could share the clarity of my memory with someone. I would’ve given every conversation with Addison to Audrey, without hesitation. Because, I’d never forget her. For Audrey, the memories would slowly fade. Somehow, that seems almost worse.

***

Claire, Sarah, and Audrey had come up with an outfit for Addison: A violet turtleneck sweater dress, black leggings, comfortable shoes.

Then Audrey came out of the bedroom with a thick, fuzzy, woolen pair of socks. “She always gets cold.” She said, her breath coming in short, hitching gasps. “I don’t want her to be cold.”

Sarah caught her around the waist, before she collapsed completely, and I caught them both before they fell together. Whatever Audrey tried to say next dissolved into a sharp, keening cry. That time, it didn’t take me very long that some of the tears were mine.

Sometime later, we handed off the clothes to Addison’s parents. Audrey fell asleep, weeping in their bed that night, clutching Addison’s pillow. Claire curled up beside her and cried with her. Sarah and I stayed with them, until sleep threatened.

I slipped out because I knew better than to fall asleep in the apartment Audrey and Addison had shared for the past two years. Sarah slipped out because she had been sad for long enough and needed to get angry, or drunk, or both.

 I walked out on the balcony, didn’t bother to find a chair, and just slid down the wall, until I was sitting on the deck. Sarah sat down beside me.

“She was the first one, you know.” *Please, Sarah, don’t tell me this.* “Addi was the first one to place her seal of approval on you.” Sarah said, as she reached into her purse and came out with a pint of Shit-Whiskey. She twisted the cap off and took a healthy swig.
Then she offered it to me, I thought about waving her off, but took it anyway.

“Claire had a habit of dating douchenozzles.” She explained when I offered it back to her. “I, honestly, thought you were another one. Addi knew better. Don’t you fucking forget it.” She wiped her eyes, took another drink and handed me the bottle.

I put my arm around her and pulled her in close, kissed the top of her head, and said, “You’re one of the best friends I’ve ever had, Sarah.” 

By this time, she had handfuls of my shirt and was crying, a mixture of rage and sorrow into my shoulder. “Take care of her.” She managed, after she caught her breath.

“I will.”

“You fucking better.” She was quiet for a moment, “David, I was *so* scared. I thought I was going to die.”

“So was I.” I told her. “I’ve never been more afraid of anything in my life.” I was telling her the truth. The thought of losing Claire, it breaks a piece of me every time it comes to mind. “And that’s saying something, because I’m afraid of everything.”

Sarah gave me a look that said *You?*

“I’m afraid of road trips. Flying, boats, water. Falling asleep. Hell, my own reflection scares me sometimes. People have been trying to hurt me for my entire life.” I explained her, truthfully as I could.

“David.” I hadn’t noticed Claire had come out to the balcony. Her face had gone pale, concern etched on her face. “I-“

“The thought off losing you, I—Well, I’d rather die.”

She came to me in two quick steps and threw her arms around. “Baby. Don’t even think it. I’m not going anywhere. And I’d rather you didn’t.”

Addison would have rather died than lose Audrey. My choice forced her hand. For what had to be, the hundredth time, I wished I’d just taken the bullet. 

“It isn’t safe here.” I told them both, then I had to start lying again, “If he wants to find us, he’s just got to turn on the TV.” I motioned to the News Vans that were already assembling at the end of the block. “There is a place, my dad used take me when I was a kid. Its secluded, off the grid, and we own the whole damned mountain. Claire and I are going after the funeral.” I looked at Sarah, “You, and Audrey are welcome to join us.”

Sarah grinned, “The thought of being locked in a bunker with you two makes me want to take my chances with the psychopath.”

“It’s not a bunker.” Well, there was a bunker, but it was hidden. 
“It’s a cabin on a hot spring, miles away from anything.”

“So miles away from help?” Sarah said, skeptical.

“If he manages to find us, and come after us there, Sarah, he’s the one that will need help.”

***

Sarah opted to stay with Audrey that night. I made sure that they had security posted outside. As Claire and I rode in the back of an armored SUV back to my place, I called my Dad.

“Hey David, shouldn’t you be sleeping?” He answered, “It’s a long drive tomorrow.”

Addison was from a smallish town about 4 hours away. We would all be making the trip in the morning for the visitation and service.
“Yeah, Claire and I are on our way home.” I answered, “I need you to get the Lake Cabin prepped. We’re going there after.”

“Good Plan.”

“Yeah, one more thing.” I continued, “Can you get the Beast down there for me?”

Claire gave me a look, I waved her off and mouthed “In a minute.” To her.

I heard Dad chuckle on the line. “I feel extremely sorry for that bastard.”

“Thanks, Dad.” I said as he hung up.

“Beast?” Claire queried.

“My old truck.” I explained. “I don’t think my Honda could handle the roads out there.”

Claire nodded. 

As Sarah had pointed out, I do have a gift for understatement.

***

The same armored SUV met us the next morning outside my residence hall. I had my suit, naturally, and Claire was a knee length black dress, with a sweater and an overcoat. The sky was overcast with low hanging clouds the color and texture of old asphalt, that were spitting an icy drizzle at us. I took off my jacket and hung it inside, after I let Claire in. Sarah and Audrey opted to ride down with Addison’s family.

Dad handed me a small black case as I got in the SUV, then went back to his own car. Inside was a Smith and Wesson 1066. The Semi-auto pistol was chambered in ten millimeter, and had three fully loaded magazines with it. I had chosen the pistol and rounds because it was a fast, relatively flat-shooting round. Plus, it had been known to defeat body armor. I’m not really a gun guy, but if you’re like me, it’s helpful to know how to use one. Besides, if it came down to it, a rusty spoon was better than nothing.

“David, what the hell?” Claire spoke up, shocked, as I took it, loaded it, and tucked it, in its holster, into my pants at the small of my back.

“It’s just a precaution, Claire.” I told her, “and one hundred percent legal.”

“Why do *you* need a gun? You’ve got a team of armed security shadowing our every move?”

“Odds are it will be an uncomfortable hunk of metal hanging on my belt all day, Baby.”

“I don’t like it.” Claire said, worry in her eyes. “I don’t like what this is doing to you. I mean, last week you wouldn’t even kill a spider, now you’re carrying a gun?”

“That spider,” She was talking about the one I caught in her shower and relocated outside, “Never pointed a gun at you.” I could tell she wasn’t happy with my answer, so I leaned over and kissed her, lightly, on the lips. “Once he’s caught, it will go back in the case, and stay there. I promise.”

She lifted her cat’s eye frames and dabbed at her eyes, then she crossed her arms across her chest and said, “I feel like I’m losing you.” As she stared out the window.

“No,” I took off my seat belt and slid across the seat to be closer to her, “Baby, No. This is really hard, on all of us. Losing Addi, worrying over Audrey, I know I haven’t been there for you like I should have. I’m sorry.”

“I miss her so much.” Claire took off her glasses and let the tears come, as she leaned back into me. “The distance is partially my fault. I guess I feel guilty for still having you. I didn’t, I don’t want to make Audrey feel worse.”

“I don’t think that’s possible right now.” I told her, being able, for once, to be completely honest with her. “There is no easy way through this, for any of us.”

“One foot in front of the other, keep moving forward.” She said with a wistful smile. “That’s what my Grandpa used to say.”

“I think I would’ve liked him.”

“He would’ve liked you too.” She turned her head to face me, and touched my cheek, letting her hand linger. “I will be with you, every step of the way.” She sat back up, “But I wish you’d stop beating yourself up. There were five of us. Four of us are still here because of you. We all know it, and Addison knows it. You didn’t kill her. *He* did.” Her light, shining, ferocious, in her eyes. “You are so gentle. Kind to a fault.” She smiled at me, “The fact that you actually feel guilty over this just confirms what I’ve always thought; I’m lucky to have you.”

“No,” I told her, as I kissed her neck, just below her ear. “I’m the lucky one.”

She put her arms around and held me tight. “When you jumped in front of me, and the gun went off. I was scared to death, not for me. For you. I thought I’d lost you. I don’t know what I’d do without you.”

I knew exactly what I’d do if I lost her. I’d find myself on my very next slip, and put an end to it, in the hopes that it would be far enough back to insure she never even met me.

***

Of course, The news crews were trying to cover the funeral, too. I’ve never understood the fascination with money. Yeah, several of you are probably scowling at your screens right now. But, It’s alien to me. True, I’ve never wanted for much. But the things I do want can’t be bought. Since Addison’s death was national news, and she was a gay woman, of course a lonely little group of those idiots from Kansas showed up. But [redacted] University’s Concert Choir had also come. Bolstered by the choirs of several local Churches, they had surrounded those pig-eyed zealots, four deep, in their little cordoned off pen, and were currently drowning out their weapons-grade stupid with a selection of hymnals.

I made eye contact with an elderly black woman in a purple choir robe who was in that ring of song, as I held the door for Claire and mouthed “Thank You.”

She smiled back at me and waved. 

The local police were doing their best, but simply did not have the manpower to keep all the press at bay. Camera flashes and spotlights trailed us as we made our way from that armored SUV to the front entrance of the funeral home. I had Claire by the arm, trying to lead her through the forest of microphones, when suddenly a woman appeared in front of us.

I recognized her, you probably would too, as she was on TV nearly every night. “Claire, who are you wearing?”

Claire stopped, utterly shocked, and completely aghast, then demanded, “What the fuck is wrong with you?” Her reply momentarily silenced the din of shouted questions. “We’re about to bury a friend. Someone is burying their daughter, their sister today. And you’re most pressing question is ‘Who am I wearing?’” She screwed up her face in anger, “What the FUCK is wrong with you?” She shouted.

“There’s your sound-bite.” I snarled, as I took Claire by the arm again, and pushed past the woman, who had gone pale, realizing just how colossally she’d screwed up. Part of me hoped it was a live feed.

“Alright!” A man in what looked to be his mid-sixties, in the uniform of the local police department, shouted over the freshly renewed clamor, “You got what you came for, let these people mourn in peace!” Then he gave the order to his officers to evict the press from the premises.

Sarah was waiting for us when we got inside.

“Did you see that?” Claire growled, ‘Can you believe that?”

“Same bitch offered me ten grand and an internship if I wore a hidden camera in here.” Sarah grumbled. “If that is what being a professional journalist is about, I’m changing majors.”

“Seems like the field could use an injection of integrity to me.” Pete said as he came into the lobby to meet us. “David, Claire, it’s good to see you again.” He looked like he had aged ten years since I met him five days ago. “David, Mary and I wanted to thank you, The Funeral Director told us what you did, and I meant to ask you earlier, but things have been so hectic. We’re short a pallbearer, and Addison spoke highly of you.”

“Of course, Pete, of course.” I told him, I didn’t answer the slightly confused looks from Claire and Sarah. I had, tried to, at least, quietly take care of Addison’s final expenses. I guess I should have directly told the Funeral Director to call me an anonymous donor, rather than imply it, with a heavy hand. “It would be an honor.” One that I didn’t deserve, if I’m being completely honest. It was my fault she was gone.

The Public visitation had ended nearly an hour before we arrived, and for this last hour before the service was closed to all but friends and family.

A group of whom I can only assume to be aunts, uncles and cousins were clustered around a photo display in the back of the room, quietly sharing pleasant memories. Mary stood off to one side, staring at her daughter’s body, in the casket, as if trying to memorize every detail of her baby girl’s face, and occasionally wiping away tears. Audrey, along with Addison’s brothers sat in the front row of the chairs set up before the casket. She looked like she had her head bowed in prayer, and Addison’s two oldest brother were trying to comfort her. Claire and Sarah were talking with Pete I touched Claire’s and motioned to Mary, she nodded at me. I left the three of them to mouth the empty platitudes people mouth at funerals, went to Mary’s side.

Then I saw, that Audrey’s head wasn’t bowed in prayer. She was staring at a small box in her hand, covered in black velvet. Inside, nestled in white silk, was a gleaming silver ring.

*An Engagement Ring.*

Mary slid under my arm as my knees nearly buckled. “She was going to ask her at the end of term.” She never looked away from the casket. “She came to us when they were visiting over Christmas.” Mary’s voice hitched, as she took a breath. “I was going to have another daughter.” Mary said.

I heard Addison’s brother encouraging Audrey to give her the ring. ‘You’re our sister now.” He said. “She would have loved it.”

Audrey looked up at them, smiling through her tears. Together, they rose, and walked unsteadily, leaning on each other, to Addison’s casket. Audrey took the ring from the box, and carefully slid it on to Addison’s finger, with her brother’s now fully supporting her. She was weeping like a widow, because that’s what she was, when she kissed her fingers and pressed them to Addison’s lips.

“I’ll never forget you.” She whispered, “I love you, Addi.”

Claire was at my side, guiding me back to a chair, as the enormity of what my choice had done to Audrey crashed down on me.

It could have been five minutes, or five hours, But the preacher came in, administered the last rites, and funeral service. Just before the funeral home staff closed the casket, Mary stood, withdrew a roughly used, and obviously well-loved stuffed tiger from her purse, and tucked it under Addison’s arm.

Shortly thereafter, it was time to carry her out to the hearse. Addison Wright was barely five feet tall, and probably never weighed more than ninety-eight pounds in her all too short life. 
There were six of us.

She was the heaviest weight I’ve ever lifted.

***

After the graveside service, we went to the local Elk’s Lodge, for a proper wake. A few hours into it, Pete, Mary, and their sons decided to call it a night. Audrey thanked me for the offer to come with us to the Lake Cabin, but said the Wrights had asked her to stay with them for a while, and she couldn’t, didn’t want to refuse. Claire and I told her we understood, asked her to call when she got settled.

One of Addison’s uncles was flirting with Claire in that harmless way old men flirt with young women. It didn’t bother me. It never does. I would never fault a guy, or a girl, for that matter, for trying to make a little time with a woman like Claire. After all, I was hers, and she was mine.

I kissed her and told her, “I’m going outside for a little air.”

“Okay, baby.”

“Jeez, Dave, give an old geezer the illusion of hope, at least.” I didn’t mind when he called me Dave.

“Chuck, you’re a dirty old man, you know that?”

“You’re damn right.” He grinned at Claire, then winked at me.

I laughed as I walked toward the back door. I’ve done this enough to know, that there is more laughter at funerals and wakes, than one would expect. Remembering the good times is one of the few ways a human psyche can weather such a profound loss.

When I hit that back door I saw Sarah, leaning against the wall, smoking a cigarette.

“Since when do you smoke?” I demanded, a little more than half drunk.

“Please don’t tell Claire.” She pleaded, “I really can’t deal with her going all mother hen on me, tonight.”

“Okay, on one condition; Got one for me?”

She handed me one, and her lighter. “Since when do you smoke?”

“I don’t.” I said, coughing out the first lung full. “Just felt the need to—“

“Do something a little self-destructive?” She completed my thought.

“Yeah.”

“Me too. It was either this,” She held up the cigarette, “Or fuck the bartender cross-eyed, and he’s not really my type.”

“You have a type?”

Sarah scowled at me, “Well if I do, it is definitely not fifteen years older than me with greasy hair and bad teeth.” She stubbed out her cigarette on the wall, took a bottle of perfume from her purse, and sprayed it in the air before her, then walked through the mist. “I’m going to protect your girlfriend from seduction at the hands of Uncle Chuck.”

I snorted a laugh at her and started pacing. I took another drag off the cigarette, coughed some more, decided it tasted like shit, and threw the thing away.

That’s when the hair stood up on the back of my neck. 

I spun around. I had the pistol out of the holster, safety off, and leveled on the bridge of his nose before I even realized what I was doing.

“Damn, you’re fast.” The Man with Ice Blue Eyes said. His hands were raised, palms facing me, about shoulder level. 

“You got something to say, you better say it quick.” My finger tightened on the trigger.

“I’m just here to talk, David. I am unarmed.” He said, almost serenely. “And I don’t think you’re capable of killing me in cold blood, yet.”

“Talk.” I ordered.

“I decided to give you today.” He explained. “I could have killed you both a dozen times since you got out of that truck this morning. But I really don’t want that.”

*Just pull the trigger*

“There doesn’t need to be any more bloodshed.” He continued, “I came here to talk, like reasonable people.”

“You didn’t think to do that, before you murdered my friend?” *Just do it. Kill him where he stands*

“I am sorry for that.” He sounded sincere, “It was never my intention to hurt Addison. And after our last meeting, I realized I don’t even have to hurt you, or Claire, in order to get what I want.”

“And that is?” I demanded.

“That red-haired harpy to never exist.” He said, finally. “Just leave her. Leave Claire, and I will never come near you or her again. Yes, you’ll be hurt, and so will she, but you’ll both get over it. She’s young, intelligent and extremely beautiful. She will find another man that will make her happy. You, well, you’re young, and extremely wealthy. Shouldn’t be too hard to find a girl willing to do the things she does for you.”

“You should stop talking now.” I was a wrong word from blowing his face out the back of his head.

“Believe it or not, David, I do respect you.” He said, his face placid, “and like you, I really don’t want to hurt anyone.”

“There you’re wrong.”

“So you’re going to do what? Shoot me? How will you explain firing a gun, drunk in an empty parking lot, after I vanish?”

“You’re right.” I said, as I dropped the magazine, and set about breaking his goddamned skull with the pistol. 

Three minutes, and thirty-eight seconds later, he *flickered*, appeared to expand slightly, then vanished. His blood, staining my shirt and hands went with him. “I hope you feel that for hours, you son of a bitch.” I said to the empty night air.

With a stroke of luck, I was able to land an IT Internship at a financial firm this summer and I'm very grateful for that. Now that I have my foot in the door in the IT world....I was hoping to get into an IT internship for Fall/Spring semester, anything that isn't helpdesk as I really want to advance into something like a sysadmin, networking, or cyber security intern. Anything I can do to improve my resume, and any skills I can learn/add that would make me a more viable candidate?"

Also, for these positions, I hear that interning is a very good way for you to get some experience under the belt to get the foot in the door for interviews. What should I intern as (what’s the name of the intern’s position) and where should I look to apply for these internships? Located in California. Thanks for reading

6tlpkz,0,2017-08-14,Unpaid internship..,bakednarc,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6tlpkz/unpaid_internship/,"TLDR at bottom

Took an unpaid internship this summer and have not learned a thing. I come into the office once a week and by the time I do, they have to fix stuff so I'm left with watching YouTube videos on how to do certain things. The reason why I took said internship is because I believed that my skills were not on par with everyone else's, and they aren't.. but this internship has helped none but get how the overall lifestyle of a web developer is..

As of right now I have two internships under my belt, one which is not related to programming and the other  (this one) where I was hoping to learn atleast a bit about web technologies. I am a junior and feel like I'm sinking, any advice? Should I quit the internship that I'm at now? They extended for the fall.

TL:DR - internship is trash, haven't learned a thing.. extended internship for the fall, but I didn't learn anything in the summer.. should I extend or should I find another internship for this fall?"
6tm8fb,1,2017-08-14,Hardware &amp; Semiconductors Companies,autumnhazexo,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/6tm8fb/hardware_semiconductors_companies/,"Hi all,

I'm a computer engneering student going into my second year at a Canadian university. I am currently just about to finish off a 4 month co-op at an engineering consulting firm doing work in power systems (was an EE major in 1st year but switched this summer). After having experienced the work, I realized I have no interest in power systems or power at all. 

I've always had a huge passion for computers and would like to land a co-op next summer in computer hardware or semiconductors. I'm aware an EE could go into these fields just as easily, but my university focuses a lot on power systems for EEs which is why I made the switch.

I was wondering if you guys could give me some company names that are in these industries which have locations in Canada or are Canadian companies - semiconductors and hardware. I am aware of the big name computer hardware companies, but internships at these are quite competitive and I would like to apply to a lot of compies to increase my chances. I am prepared to send out a crazy amount of resumes.

Thanks in advance"

I don't post much on reddit, mainly due to a lack of interesting content and a nervousness to comply with all posting regulations of multiple subs, but I needed some life advice and figured this would be a good place to start. I am a computer science student at the University of Pittsburgh. Last year I started to get really excited for the idea of going to grad school and getting my masters in CS. 

About me as a student:
I love learning about CS, mainly OS-based stuff, Architecture, Programming, and Software Engineering.
Averaging about a 3.27 right now, 2.98 Freshman year, 3.56 Sophomore year.
Internship this summer (pre-Junior year) at my port authority's IT division.
I have a github set up with 2 years of school projects and the projects I'm doing at my current internship.
I have a literature minor as well that I'm getting for fun.

In terms of colleges I'm looking at, mainly RIT, NYU, and UC-Berkeley (this one is more of a pipe dream).

Overall I'm just not sure what a masters in CS could do for me. I love the idea of getting a masters but monetarily don't know how ""worth it"" it would be to do so. What's more, what should I be doing to help myself get into these (or another) grad schools besides taking the GRE?"

The tests were mostly memorization, which I did myself, but the coding assignments (puzzles like bomblab, attacklab, etc) I often was afraid of and could not make breakthroughs until a friend would explain how to use certain functions. I passed the course with a B, and did a summer internship where i worked with Pandas and Openpyxl. My coworker did a lot more of the project we worked together on (I wrote a program that took an excel file loaded as an openpyxl workbook and marked errors in it). My question is, is this typical for 2nd years CS students entering their 3rd Year? I don't copy code, but have received a lot of explanation on how to tackle problems."

I try to be fairly active in their lives though we do not live in the same town. I took some time off over the summer to finish a creative project but also to help out with our aging father who's had some health problems. 

Being back in our hometown, in the house where I grew up, has been pretty great. I haven't been back here since high school. After college, I moved away so it has been a while. 

My two nieces are adorable. Stella is four years old and Pearl is six. Both are little blondes with ringlet curls and big blue eyes. Everyone says Stella is my twin. Our baby pictures are almost identical. I guess you could say she's my favorite though I try to be a fun Aunt to both girls.

I always thought Pearl was kind of an odd little girl. She's fairly quiet for a kid but I've not really spent a ton of time around her to be a good judge. I just know she strikes me as an unusual kid. 

It all started about two months ago. A family friend decided to gift the girl's a puppy. My sister thought pet ownership would instill some responsibility in them. She created a schedule for the girls to help feed the puppy and allowed them to take it out back into the fenced yard for potty breaks. The puppy was cute. Pearl didn't seem too interested in the dog but Stella immediately took up with the puppy. It was her new best friend and I got a kick out of watching her march around the yard with this tiny dog clumsily following behind a few steps. 

One evening, I was clearing up some dinner dishes at my dad's house when I got a phone call from my sister. 

Leanne was frantic on the phone. Crying hysterically, she told me that she needed to see me. Her husband was out of town on business and she desperately needed me. She assured me everyone was okay but begged me to please hurry on over. 

Leanne lives only a few blocks from my dad so I didn't even bother driving. It was a lovely summer evening so I chose to walk over. I could tell my sister was very upset. I kind of assumed maybe it was something like she caught her husband, Greg, cheating because of her level of panic. 

I arrived at the house to find my sister weeping in the living room. She had been crying for a little while because her eyes were red and puffy. 

I plopped down on her oversized sofa and asked casually, ""Whats up?""

Leanne wiped her nose and said, ""Oh my god. It's absolutely terrible. I don't know what to do.""

""Did you check Greg's Facebook or something? Let me guess he's not out of town on a business trip at all but rather shacked up with some young intern at her college dorm room..."" 

My sister snapped at me, ""No, psycho. Thats not it at all. It's Pearl.""

""What's the matter with Pearl? Is she okay?"" I asked feeling more concerned now. 

Leanne sighed, ""I don't know.""

""Well, what happened? What's the problem?""

She blew her nose again, ""Its just so awful. I can't believe my baby girl would do this.""

My impatience was growing, ""What did she do Leanne?""

""Well, I was getting Stella ready for bed. She usually goes to sleep by 8. I let Pearl stay up until 8:45 most nights. So I'm reading Stella a story and when I've finished up, I turn the lights off and start walking down the hall. I hear water running. The girls have already had a bath so naturally I'm curious. The door was closed but not locked. I knock first and ask, 'Pearl, are you okay honey?' and she doesn't respond so I open the door and you'll never believe what I saw.""

""What? What happened?""

Leanne started sobbing again, ""Pearl was leaning over the bathtub and she had the puppy, Joe. At first I thought she was giving him a bath but then I realized what she was doing. She was trying to drown the puppy. She was holding him under. I could see him struggling, fighting her as much as he could but he's so tiny.""

""Are you sure thats what she was doing?""

Leanne nodded, ""I snatched him up but it was too late. I tried saving him but he died. I wrapped him in a blanket and he's out in the garage.""

""Well, what did she say? Did you punish her?""

Leanne wept, ""She told me she didn't know he'd do that. She didn't know he would die. She was so eerily calm when she said it, too. I sent her to bed.""

""Did you call Greg?"" I asked. 

She nodded, ""I did. He was very upset. He said Pearl should have to be responsible for burying the puppy."" 

I agreed, ""I'm not a parent but that seems reasonable. Maybe it'll have some impact on her.""

I just couldn't believe what I'd heard. My niece had drown a puppy. 

The next day, my sister made Pearl bury the dog in the backyard. She tried to keep the information from Stella but of course the poor kid discovered her dog had died and was very upset. Leanne did not explain what had happened to the dog. 

A few weeks later, around the fourth, my sister's neighborhood had a block party. She invited dad and I to come over and enjoy some food and festivities. 

My sister had specifically told Pearl she was not allowed to climb up in the neighbor boy's tree house so when one of the kids fell and the ambulance had to be called, my sister was pretty pissed that Pearl had been in the tree house. 

""This kid is so defiant,"" She told me. 

I had no grounds to believe Pearl was responsible for pushing the kid out of his tree house but this big part of me just knew that's what happened. I didn't say anything to my sister but I had this weird feeling. 

I told my father that I thought there was something wrong with Pearl. He chuckled and assured me that kids are curious and do bad things sometimes but its just because they don't know any better. 

After the fourth, I became increasingly aware of Pearl's every move. If we were hanging out or she was visiting my dad, I watched her like a hawk. She mostly played alone not engaging much with Stella. I didn't witness anymore peculiar behavior than that but I guess if I am telling the truth I didn't really care for her much. 

Then a couple of days ago, something else happened. 

My sister had sent the girls to Vacation Bible School at their church. It was a week long evening event that gave my sister some free time. She could go to yoga class and asked me to tag along. 

On the first night, Leanne was informed that Pearl had gotten into trouble for wandering off from her class. She had asked to go to the bathroom but was found in the choir robe closet. Pearl says she got lost but my sister told her she knew very well that Pearl knew her way around the church. It turns out the robe closet wasn't really a closet at all but rather a room/office used for storing stuff like choir robes and flower arrangements. 

On the fourth night of bible school, a terrible accident occurred. When we went to pick the kids up, there was a lot of activity and emergency services and police. 

Tragedy had happened and no one seemed to have answers. One of the kid's from Stella's class, a little boy named Drew, had gone to the bathroom and disappeared. When he didn't come back, the teacher had gone to search for him. 

The boy was found floating in the baptismal pool in the sanctuary. 

""The only way to access the pool is from the robe closet,"" I overheard one of the parents say who was also there to pick up their child. 

On the car ride home, Leanne simply told the kids an accident had happened but didn't go into further detail. 

About two days later, my sister had a dentist appointment and asked me if she could bring the girls over for two hours. They could visit with my dad and maybe I could make them some lunch. 

Stella and my dad were playing with some jewelry art kit at the dining room table. I wasn't sure where Pearl had gotten off to but did a sweep of the house looking for her. 

My dad said, ""Check the basement. Sometimes she goes down there to play with her dolls."" 

I forgot about the basement. My dad has a partially finished basement with a den area that he turned into a playroom for the grand kids. Pearl has a doll house down there. 

I crept down the stairs. The light was on and dolls and other toys were strewn about the floor. I noticed the light on in the laundry room so I rounded the corner. 

Pearl was on a step ladder leaning over the stainless steel laundry sink which was filled with water. She had a baby doll which she was plunging in the water. She'd take its head and shove it down hard into the water and hold it there then bring it up and do it again. I watched her for what felt like an eternity. I was stunned. 

""Pearl,"" I snapped, ""What the hell are you doing?"" 

She turned and looked at me with no expression, ""Just playing, Auntie.""

I'm a rising junior at one of the top 10 liberal arts schools in the country.  I'm majoring in philosophy and likely minoring in mathematics too because I like it and I'm pretty good at it (I kind of regret not majoring in math, but my anxiety left me unsure of my abilities and I didn't take enough classes fast enough).  I have a 3.6 GPA. 

Anyway, I'm interested in pursuing a career in the corporate/finance side of the hotel/hospitality industry.  I managed to secure a revenue management internship this past summer at a well-known hotel management/development company, which I just finished.  I am happy I got it and some people I've been networking with say it was a great first step.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        

Still, everyone tells me what a poor decision I've made studying philosophy, that I have zero chance at getting a job, and that I should've just studied Economics, which is what I almost declared my major in.  However I really didn't like my Economics classes and didn't see myself enjoying spending the next 2-3 years studying it.  I enjoy philosophy and math much more.  I also didn't really see why Economics would automatically lead me to being wildly successful over anything else.

I'm just looking for advice on how to proceed in the best way - obviously I intend on networking heavily (my college has a great alumni network) and start the search for internships early.  I just feel pathetic sometimes because of people putting down my major.  "

Next to the National Memorial Day Concert a week earlier, the U.S Angel Corps graduation ceremony was one of the most popular annual events to grace the west lawn of the Capitol Building. Thousands flocked each year to watch the ceremony; though many only for the opportunity to enjoy a picnic on the Capitol lawn, and to see the Angel Corps Valkyries do their traditional flyover at the end.

For the 30 uniformed men and women standing at parade rest in front of the main stage, it was so much more. 70 weeks of blood, sweat, tears, and unwavering resolve had finally paid off. From the depths of hell to the heights of heavens they had travelled, and back again, to finally end up here. The white and blue that now adorned them was a testament to their accomplishment.

For the friends and families in attendance, it was an equally momentous occasion – the opportunity to watch their loved ones receive an honor only bestowed upon a handful of humanity's finest. Truly a proud moment for any parent – though bittersweet, for this honor was as much a solemn responsibility as it was a coveted prize for their sons and daughters.

But for now, the past was a memory, and the future was merely a looming specter in the distance. Now was a time to revel in the catharsis of a challenge overcome… for most, anyways. Jack Anderson was acutely aware of the specter of tomorrow casting its gaze down upon him, as he waited patiently alongside his wingmen for the moment that would change their lives forever. While he knew firsthand just how much today meant for everyone, for him it was something even more profound than simply the accomplishment of a lifetime. An honored legacy, and a promise was about to be fulfilled.

""Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to introduce the 3rd General of the United States Angel Corps, Marcus D. Lockewood"" The Master of Ceremonies announced formally after briefly taking the place of the previous speaker. The crowd clapped heartily as General Lockewood approached the podium; his confident stride spoke of a man who had been tempered both in mind and body by decades of service. His was the kind of presence that commanded respect, even before a single word was uttered. Even the civilians in the crowd fell mostly silent as he took his place, expectantly awaiting some great words of wisdom.

""Fellow service members, members of congress, welcomed guests; I would like to thank you all for joining us here today for this momentous occasion. I would also like to extend my congratulations to the men and women of trainee squadron number 42. Every one of them has overcome immeasurable obstacles to be here; and they have undoubtedly earned the right to bear the uniform of the United States Angel Corps. In a few short moments, that uniform will be made complete, as they take their rightful place amongst the ranks of an unbeatable team."" The crowd cheered, though for Jack one voice briefly stood out. The commotion quickly died down as Lockewood continued his speech.

""70 years ago, our nation – our world – was put to the test. We were already weary from a war that had lasted far too long, and taken too many lives; it was in this weariness that our enemy saw their opportunity. They attacked without warning, without honor. They brought down upon us power the likes of which we could hardly fathom, power that put even the terrible weapons of a mechanized world war to shame. Our darkest hour was upon us, as those invaders from another world held us beneath their thumb like a trapped insect.

But from that darkness, rose a flame of hope. Providence saw fit to give us the solution, but it was the holders of that solution who ultimately decided our fate. They could have fled, they could have cowered, they could have given up and surrendered to a force that seemed truly beyond anyone's capacity to overcome. Even with the incredible power bestowed upon them, victory was not guaranteed… but that did not matter to them. Those first twelve heroes charged headlong into the howling dark; knowing not their own fate, but simply that the fate of the world rested upon their shoulders. And in answering this call of duty, they spared every man, woman, and child alive today the cruel fate of subjugation beneath uncaring gods.

In the same way, the men and women standing before you today also rose up in their darkest hour. 70 weeks of rigorous training strained them to their limits, and forced them to overcome obstacles that few will ever have to face. Their bodies and minds were tempered in the flames of hardship, as they were forced to adapt to just about everything that could conceivably be thrown at them. Land, sea, air, the lifeless void of space – all of these domains they learned to conquer, with each one bringing its own litany of uniquely difficult challenges.

At every step of the way, there were opportunities to give up, to surrender. The siren song of self-doubt is one that plagues every trainee at least once throughout their ordeal, and it is one that many have fallen victim to – of the 100 trainees this group started with, less than a third have made it to the end. All the power of heaven means nothing if one does not have the will to command it. As I can attest personally, these men and women standing before us today know full well that strength, and speed, and ability alone do not make a warrior. They have earned the right to call themselves Angels not because they command great power, but because they command the fortitude - the unyielding resolve - to hold the line against all odds. And I know that they will continue to hold the line through every challenge they will face.""

""Sqaudron, attetch-HUT!"" ordered their commander after a brief pause, prompting the group to snap into perfect formation. The moment of truth was here.

""Angels of trainee squadron 42! Do you solemnly swear to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic?""

""Sir, yes sir!""

""And that you will bear true faith and allegiance to the same?""

""Sir, yes sir!""

""And that you will obey the orders of the President of the United States and the orders of the officers appointed over you, according to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military Justice?""

Sir, yes sir!""

""And that you will be Humanity's protectors, and vanguard, as we assert our rightful place amongst the stars, so help you God?""

""SIR, YES SIR!"" The general smiled briefly, clearly satisfied with the energy. Jack was smiling too, though it didn't show on his face.

""Then I officially welcome you into the United States Angel Corps. Congratulations angels, today is your day."" The company reveled in the moment as the crowd cheered them on, with a grand roar that was moments later drowned out by one even grander. A tight formation of five diamondbacks trailing red, white, and blue smoke blasted over the Capitol building, their hulls done up in the instantly recognizable cobalt blue and white pattern of the Valkyries. Of course, their GRID engines had been modified to put out far more noise than usual – spectacle naturally trumped stealth for such an occasion. It certainly did add to the bombastic atmosphere, and Jack found himself hardly able to maintain his composure.

The moment was over quickly, as the order was given for the company to turn around and march back from whence it had come. Through the crowd and up the steps of the Capitol they marched, through the main doors and into the Rotunda, where they were finally released from the burden of maintaining formation. Visitors had already begun flowing in behind them, eager families all looking to meet up with their loved ones for the first time in months. Jack's impressive height gave him an advantage as he peered over the commotion, searching excitedly for his own beloved guest. Upon spotting her, he quickly excused himself from a conversation with several of his wingmen, before using his bulk to part the thickening sea of bodies.

""Oh my God, I'm so glad you're okay!"" his mother whined in relief as she latched onto him, her tears of joy almost staining his uniform. He returned the embrace, rolling his eyes as any son with an overprotective mother would.

""Of course I'm okay; it was just training, not war"" he responded with an amused sigh.

""Don't you give me that mister, I know perfectly well the kinds of things they had you doing! You're lucky to be alive!""

""Oh come on, it wasn't even that bad – ok it was kinda bad, but that is the point of training after all... look, I'm fine, I promise.""

""I know, but you know I have to worry"" she replied as she dabbed the tears away with a napkin. ""I'm just so, so proud of you"" she added, looking over the imposing young man that had once been her unusually tall boy. Jack was about to respond, when he noticed two more familiar faces approaching from the crowd.

""Guys! You made it!"" he exclaimed heartily, rushing over to his two best friends before they could realize their mistake. Simon Vander and Carlos De Los Santos quickly found themselves swept up in a massive bear hug, each locked tight within one strong arm.

""Yep, he hasn't changed a bit"" Simon gasped out, wincing as several of his vertebrae cracked audibly.

""Nah, there's definitely more broken bones this time"" Carlos rebutted, sharing in the crushing before they were both released. ""So, how's it feel being a literal superhero?"" He asked while catching his breath.

""Hold on now, I don't know if I'd call it that…""

""My dude, you just got government sanction to blow up aliens and terrorists with your lightning powers, if that's not 'superhero' material...""

""Hey, come on, it's not a game – ""

""And I'm gonna stop you right there and remind you that I'm a sheltered 20-something male from a rabidly-patriotic family, who's only ever experienced a taste of warfare through CoD and the internet. I have no significant concept of military bearing, and I revel in the thrill of violence without consequences."" Jack and his mother both grimaced, and Simon could only hang his head in bemused disappointment.

""And I see you haven't changed a bit either"" Jack replied with a knowing sigh and a hearty pat on the back - Carlos only stayed standing thanks to having been prepared for such force.

""I like to keep it consistent"" he quipped, while gingerly reaching for the spot on his back that probably now featured a large red handprint.

""All that aside,"" Simon interjected gingerly, ""He has a point. You've been working towards this for years, you must feel like you're on top of the world right now!""

""I mean, technically we're always standing on top of the world from our own perspective…""

""And that's exactly one minute, 15 seconds until our first bad joke of the day… pay up""

""Goddamit!"" Carlos whined. ""You'd think a whole year and a half of getting chewed out by drill sergeants would fix that.""

""Nah, that only fixed my bed making and uniform ironing skills"" Jack mused, earning another eye roll for his troubles. ""Anyways, how have you guys been doing without me? Must be a boring life without yours truly to spice things up"" he added, pantomiming arrogance with a flourish of his hand.

""Well my ulcer finally receded, so I'd say the low-spice diet might have done some good"" Carlos rebutted, always one to poke holes in Jack's bravado.

""Not as boring as you might think actually, my dad got us a summer internship at the lab"" Simon interrupted. ""We've been working on that generator project I told you about before you left, first test runs are scheduled for later this week.""

""That's awesome man! Your dad must be working hard then?""

""Meh, he still runs on coffee and manic energy, no change there.""

""Honestly, I have no idea how anyone gets that kinda energy out of one cup; I gotta mainline like, at least three Monsters to get the same kick"" Carlos interjected knowingly.

""That's because you do mainline that many on the regular...""

""Your point?""

""Well, I could think of a few ways"" an aged, robust voice interrupted in response to the former question. With unexpected swiftness, one of the particularly decorated officers in the room had joined the circle, his commanding presence punctuating the conversation.

""Archangel Woodlow, Sir!"" Jack declared with a smile, reaching out to accept the firm handshake offered to him.

""Julia, I want you to know just how proud you should be of your son today, he has truly risen above and beyond even what I had expected from him"" the Archangel said to Mrs. Anderson, earning a knowing smile.

""Trust me Woodlow, I am as proud as any mother could be. He didn't give you too much trouble I hope.""

""Stubborn to a fault and reckless as they come – so no, nothing I haven't dealt with before."" Mrs. Anderson cast an accusatory glance at her son, earning a sheepish grin in return.

""So, these two gentlemen must be your friends?"" Woodlow continued, taking note of the two dumbstruck young men before him.

""You're… Archangel Woodlow… you're the Thunderbird…"" Carlos stammered as the full realization hit him.

""Well, that's not my actual callsign, some reporter made it up... it does have a nice ring to it though. And you are?""

""Oh, uh, Carlos De Los Santos, sir"" he answered with a handshake.

""Simon Vander, it's an honor to meet you sir"" Simon added as he received his own handshake in turn. There was a brief moment of awkward silence, as Simon and Carlos attempted to determine how to proceed in the presence of one of Earth's mightiest heroes. For someone who had helped save the planet nearly a century ago, he looked rather unassuming as far as officers went. Still, he seemed to radiate an aura of power and authority that left them almost at a loss for words. Jack merely reveled in the moment, enjoying the knowledge that he was on professional speaking terms with a man who regularly left civilians speechless.

""Simon Vander, huh?"" Woodlow finally responded, seemingly having stopped to scour his memory for some piece of information. ""You wouldn't happen to be the son of a Dr. Thomas Vander, would you?"" Simon and Carlos both glanced at eachother in surprise.

""Actually, yes I am… uh, have you met him before?"" Simon responded.

""On a handful of occasions. We've been outsourcing some of our non-classified projects to the Fermi Lab, your father usually oversees all the paperwork.""

""Right, of course! We're working on one of those joint projects right now... I just don't recall him mentioned anything about meeting you. that's a bit strange...""

""Well, he did always seem to have his head in the clouds, not much of a surprise there."" Simon seemed confused, but a harsh alarm tone from his pocket interrupted further inquiry.

""Crap, we have to get going, our shift starts in half an hour"" he noted, quickly pocketing the device after cancelling the alarm. Eager to beat the traffic, they quickly bid their adieus (but not before joining in on a group picture with Jack and the legendary archangel, on Mrs. Anderson's insistence of course).

""Hey, are you guys still coming to the banquet at the Victory Museum tonight?"" Jack asked before they turned to leave. ""I managed to snag those extra tickets I promised.""

""My friend, you had me at free food"" Carlos responded readily.

""We’re working a longer shift at the lab today, but we should be able to come” Simon added. “What time is it at?”

“The meet and greet runs until 7, dinner starts at 7:30. Try to be there before 7:15 since that's when they'll start funneling guests up to the tables.""

""Sounds good, we’ll meet you there.” With that they turned and made their way towards the exit, leaving Jack and his role models standing amongst the crowd. Another officer came up behind Woodlow, lightly tapping him on the shoulder and whispering something in his ear. 

""Sorry to cut things short, but I also have to take my leave"" Woodlow announced cordially, though Jack could swear he noticed a brief flicker of worry in the officer's eyes. ""I'll see you again tonight, until then I bid you a restful start to your three days grace. Take good care of him, he's earned a break"" he added to Mrs. Anderson. ""And make sure he takes it, he'll keep training till he drops if you let him.""

""Trust me, I'm not letting him anywhere near the weight room"" she replied, only half-jokingly

""What? Come on, I have to maintain my gains!"" Jack returned. Woodlow laughed heartily, almost loud enough to get the attention of those standing nearby.

""Anderson, you've gained far more than most will in their entire lives; you can afford to take a breather. Listen to your mother, she knows what's best for you."" With that, Woodlow turned to follow the other officer out of the crowd, leaving Jack and his mother alone in the commotion.

""Alright young man, no PT on my watch, but otherwise today is your day. What's the plan?"" Jack pondered the question for a moment, though he already had a list of priorities in mind.

""Well… we should probably go visit dad, first of all. You know, tell him the good news."" Mrs. Anderson smiled.

""I'm sure he'd love that.""

Disclaimer: My apologies for not posting yesterday, my internet was down and several other things came up as well.
Starting next week I will likely begin a Tues/Thurs posting schedule, though that might change depending on how fast I can push these chapters out. So far I've managed to stay at least 2 chapters ahead, but writers block has put me way behind schedule. I can promise that I will keep my publishing schedule consistent, even if I can only publish twice a week."
6to98k,3,2017-08-14,"I know MIS is flexible, but to what extent?",r58_,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/6to98k/i_know_mis_is_flexible_but_to_what_extent/,"I am about to be a junior in college and am currently on track to earn a degree in MIS from a pretty solid business school. After having an internship this summer and looking into various IT fields I'm realizing more and more that a comp-sci degree would have been more up my alley. Now I don't dislike MIS and I understand that it is a flexible degree in terms of the careers that I can pursue with it, but to what extent? Currently, I see my dream job as working in data science and working with machine learning, but I am unsure of the path I would be able to take with an MIS degree that would lead me there if such a path exists. It is too late for me to switch majors as a Junior, and I cannot take comp sci classes as electives at my school because I would have to be in the engineering school to do so. I have started taking some classes on Udemy to explore these interests(foundations of computer design,comp-sci for beginners, data structure and algorithms and artificial intelligence A-Z). While these will certainly increase my knowledge it's probably naive to believe that this is all it would take to start working in computer science/machine learning fields. 

So my question is: what steps can I take outside of my MIS degree to achieve this goal of working with AI and data science? How much education would I need?"
6togrs,0,2017-08-14,Importance of CS internship in college and getting one,VoidFate1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6togrs/importance_of_cs_internship_in_college_and/,"Hello, I'm a upcoming sophomore in university and was wondering how important a internship is in order to secure a career in CS once I graduate college. Additionally, in terms of getting an internship in the first place, is it hard? Do you need to have a super impressive resume? As an individual, I'm quite the introvert and a direct, straight-to-the-point type of person and find it hard to maintain conversation/network with people, though I've never really tried to yet. As a student, I've done very well in most of my classes so far but I've done nothing extra like doing a side project or making a game, besides the projects assigned to me from my CS classes, because for the most part, I don't really know where to start and I kind of lack the motivation to do side projects because of that. All the class projects/coding I've ever done are from using an IDE like Eclipse or Codeblocks; no one's really taught me to use anything else. I also only know Java and C++ in terms of languages (more comfortable in Java than c++) too, but nothing GUI related though. So, basically, my resume would just consist of the classes I took, and the projects I've done for my classes. I'm discouraged from attending my career fair because I'm pretty sure many others would outshine me in terms of their resumes and I wouldn't have a chance at getting an internship combined with the fact that I'm not a great conversationalist in the first place. Also, I've made like no friends in college so I wouldn't have anyone to go to the internship fair with, and with the amount of people there I'd get anxious lol. Also, I haven't taken the Data Structures class yet, I'm taking it this semester. Anyway, with that information, any suggestions or thoughts about internships/how to obtain one from my current situation or in general would be appreciated. thanks!"

This job was one I found very satisfying and challenging as well. Do any of you have any recommendations on how to go about making the transition? I'm currently taking a course on udemy to help take some of the rust off. But if you have any other recommendations, I will greatly appreciate them!

I’ve reached out to Google and Apple recruiters through referrals, but I was late to the game and the summer intern positions had already been filled. I’ve applied to a few other major software companies, but have not heard word back. My wife thinks I’m being overly anxious, but it’s my personal inclination to hope for the best, and prepare for the worst. I understand that the summer is slow, but I’m hoping that as September gets closer, things will start to pick up. 

Our current living situation is financially secure, and does not require me to work, but I really want to (which is why I retrained in the first place). So I thought I could be a little picky. I want to work on interesting problems like those I came across in my grad classes, but I've found that many industry positions are exclusively for PhDs or MS w/5+ years of experience. I’d like to believe there’s somewhere I can fit into, but I can’t seem to find anything.

I see quite a few devops positions(which most of my peers went into), but I worry that I could be pigeonholed into devops, which does not seem like something I would be interested in long term.

Currently, I’m spending my time learning C++ with a personal project based on some of my research before graduating.

So I have a few questions on my mind:
1) How long before I should suck it up and begin applying for less ambitious SWE positions/ Am I being too anxious?
2) If I really wanted to work in fields like Machine Learning, Distributed Computing, or Operations Research would pursuing a PhD be the only way?
3) Should I consider applying for devops positions with the hope of quickly (1-2years) spring boarding to a SWE role?

Before you judge me on how ridiculous my question is, let me provide a bit of background information.

I'm currently in the process of making a career change and have just been accepted into a CS program (this will be my second bachelor's) at Regis University.  I've put in my two weeks notice and will be aggressively pursuing the degree for 2-3 semesters and hopefully dropping to part time afterwards due to having found a summer internship or a job.  As of now, it looks like I will be finishing Data Structures in Fall and Algorithms in Spring.  (Side note: Regis operates on a 8 week cycle, 2x per semester)

As such, by the time summer internships come around, I should be somewhat prepared to take on an internship.  Unfortunately, it looks like most internships are starting their application processes now or very soon.

Should I try applying now and stating that I have no classes under my belt now but should (hopefully) be ready by the time the internships come around or should I just wait until spring semester is about halfway done then apply to entry level positions?

Are there any other options that I've overlooked?

Thanks in advance for everyone's help!

I recently graduated in the spring with a BS is comp. science and &gt;3.8 GPA from an alright university with two software internships and am not having much luck with job applications.

Admittedly, I started applying rather late (largely after graduation - I guess I wanted to focus on finishing school). Though during my last semester I applied to a few companies I was particularly interested in, and ended up getting to an onsite interview with a pretty well-known Software/Finance company in New York (where I'm located). The interview didn't pan out unfortunately, and that's been the last good opportunity I had.

So.. I have a few questions about applying to jobs.

* Should I be focusing on spamming my resume? I've been kind of taking my time with the applications, writing cover letters for each, etc.

* Is this a bad time of the year to be looking for a job, or do I just suck (lol)? Understandably, I should've started applying earlier - I know.

* Any tips for getting more replies?

I know this is a very common type of question on this sub, but, nonetheless, I figured this would be a good place to turn to for advice.

Thanks!"

Graduated in 2013, &gt;3.5 in major GPA from a mediocre state school. Worked one internship while in school, then worked for 2 years from a large company using Java EE.

In early 2016 I quit my job to join the military as a pilot; I completed OCS but unfortunately was medically attrited from the program (I am fit to work in engineering, it is a rather rare ocular issue that has presented itself).

I am now 1.5 years out of professional coding, and will be 2 years out by the time I am separated.

I have contacted several recruiters through linkedin (I have not updated my page since joining the military, so the assumption is I have 3.5 years of experience and not 2), and after explaining my situation the 3-4 recruiters I have contacted have been very hesitant to work with me; citing a 'lack of relevant and recent experience'. 

I guess this leaves me with two questions

1) Should I bother trying to get back into coding? Can I expect to return at a similar level to what I left at? 

2) How can I spin my 1.5 years of wasted time to cause as little harm as possible to my career?

I have been working really hard reviewing data structures and algorithms, and will start sending out resumes and applying this week.

I have been dealing with a very bad disorder called GERD (have had it for 4-5 years). While many may experience the occasional heartburn after eating too much of something they shouldn't have eaten, for those that suffer severely, it can cause near-constant issues, including pain, discomfort and nausea...and it can very severely affect one's lifestyle. I've tried diet/lifestyle modifications and medication (i.e. the ""standard of care"") which had initially worked for me, but have since stopped being effective.

Fast forward to now, and both my gastroenterologist and surgeon suggested surgery (it's called Nissen Fundoplication). They both think it can really help me, and it's something that I'm strongly considering. The time that I would be able to have the surgery performed, though, would be somewhere between 1.5 - 2 months from now. I would like to apply to a lot of jobs and go on interviews, but I'm not really sure how to bring this up to potential employers (especially if things get serious in the hiring process). The recovery/time off would be somewhere in the range of 2-4 weeks, but hard numbers are difficult to give, since people recover differently.

I have some projects and a small internship under my belt, and honestly believe in my skills and value to any company, so I'm wondering what the best way to go about this would be."

I know the CS program and internships are great from UCI but I'm just worried that I'll miss the only opportunity to live away from home and go to school somewhere completely different and isolated from friends and family like UCSC/SD/LA/B... I'm also worried that I'm missing the opportunity to make new friends and experience complete independence. 
I also know that UCSC/LA/B also have great programs and internship opportunities so my value of education is about the same with any school I choose...

What I really want to know is that if the experience of moving away REALLY worth it or should I just stay at UCI and play it safe? Does anyone have a similar experience or anything preferably related to computer science and transferring from a cc?

Edit: TLDR; Why should I go to UCI over UCSC for computer science?

I live in a small town and didn't really have much exposure to CS for most of my childhood, so I can pretty confidently say that I'm below average for a hopeful Computer Science student at MIT. My school added an AP Computer Science course during my senior year, which I took, and I also have *some* knowledge through online courses such as TeamTreehouse. But, since my rural town's only notable industry is chicken farming, I don't have any high school tech internships or anything like that under my belt either. 

What can I do to make the transition from beginner in CS to student that recruiters want to hire as seamless as possible? I'll be taking the intro to CS course in the fall, and am continuing to learn mobile app dev. through TeamTreehouse on the side in hopes of eventually freelancing, but I'm afraid that it won't be enough to secure an internship or research for the summer, which I'd very much like to do. Any advice?

Also, I've looked into programs like FBU, but their website says they're looking for people that belong to groups that are historically underrepresented in tech. As an Indian immigrant I don't really think I would qualify, but is there a chance of being accepted regardless?

If i leave for the new job, I will definitely burn this bridge with agency A and probably be on the bad side of the school career counselor.

The other sheet shows 180 locations for both products and the differing base fees.
-I need to confirm that the base fee in Sheet 1 matches/corresponds to any values in Sheet 2 to properly audit.

What I have done is create 2 new columns outlining each product and inputted something like ""=ISNUMBER(MATCH(J26,Sheet2!L:L,0))"" to indicate whether any of the base fees are found in Sheet 2. If so, it would yield TRUE or FALSE.

I'm not sure how to manipulate the function so that I can only have one new column that confirms or denies the base fee columns presence in Sheet 2.

**Why email professors?**

As a college applicant, emailing professors can help you stand out to admissions officers. When a student corresponds with a professor, they not only demonstrate interest—they demonstrate “fit”. “Fit” is a word tossed around admissions offices at top universities to convey how well a student embodies that university’s values and culture. “Fit” varies from school to school; at Penn, for example, a student can demonstrate “fit” by being very pre-professionally driven. At Stanford, a student with an entrepreneurial mindset demonstrates “fit” and at my undergraduate alma mater, UChicago—and the university for which I read and evaluated applications—having quirky interests and a thirst for knowledge can demonstrate “fit” in the application process.

But just emailing a professor is insufficient. That professor is unlikely to reach out to admissions to rave about you, and CCing your regional admissions officer on your correspondence with a professor is tacky. So how will the admissions office know? And how will this benefit you? Read on.

**Step-by-step plan**

To use this tip effectively, you must do the following:

* Research the department in which you wish to major. Understand the course offerings, special programs, and pedagogical approach. Click on the faculty tab, and investigate the research interests of various professors.

* Create a spreadsheet  with the name, email address, and research interests of various professors within that department. Add one more column: how each professor’s research interests align with your own interests, experiences, or something you’ve learned.

* Using this list, pick the professor who has the most in common with you and your interests. This will be the first professor you email. Do more research on that professor, including what classes he or she teaches.

* Using the information you’ve gathered, write the professor an email. See my templates below for how to compose your first email.

* Wait a week for a response. If the professor does not respond within one week, follow up with them gently, telling them that you know they are incredibly busy, you hope not to take up too much of their time, but you would love to learn more about their research interests, course offerings, or their ideal kind of student. Be polite and, if they still don’t respond to this email, reach out to the second professor on your list. Don’t pester professors; they are busy people and while many of them will respond to prospective students, many more are just too focused on their research to check their emails regularly.

* If a professor does respond, write back to them! Engage in what they have to say! Ask them about their research interests, pointing out how they align with your own. Ask them about the type of students who take their classes—what qualities do they overwhelmingly exhibit? What makes a student successful within their department? What does the professor wish every incoming freshman did to prepare for the rigor of his or her classroom? How do they like the culture and pedagogical approach of the university? Questions like this will not only sustain a conversation, but they will also give you clues into the values of the university—things you can mention within your application.

* Incorporate elements of what you’ve learned in corresponding with the professor into your “Why ___ College?” essay (if the university has such a supplemental essay) and/or email your regional admissions officer and, in your correspondence with him or her, reference your conversations with the professor. See my templates below for more details.

* Prosper from demonstrating interest and fit. If accepted to the university, reach out to the professor again, let them know you were accepted and thank them again for their time. If you will attend the university, let them know you are looking forward to taking their class and learning from their instruction. You’ll be one step ahead of your peers in forming a relationship with one of your professors, and you might even be able to translate that relationship into a mentorship (especially useful if you plan to pursue research or apply to graduate school).

**Template for emailing professors**

Here is a template for emailing professors. Please let this serve as a guideline but not the gospel on how you should construct your first email. I encourage you to use your unique voice, put things in your own words, and vary my sentences greatly to “make things your own.” Not only will this make the email more authentic, but you’ll reduce the likelihood that any other student who reads this guide and emails the same professor will send a carbon copy of your email (how embarrassing, and possibly a red flag to the admissions office). 

Subject line: Inquiry about [professor’s research interests] at [university]

**How to personalize that template**

Let’s say you want to reach out to Professor Sascha Ebeling, who happens to have been my professor at the University of Chicago. He is amazing, and the conversations I had with him were illuminating—both about his research interests and my own. Check out his research interests [here](https://complit.uchicago.edu/content/sascha-ebeling), and see how I incorporated them into an email (as if I were a prospective student in high school). 

Note: Don’t email professor Ebeling, using this template. A) Plagiarism isn't cool, and B) You’d likely be one of many who tries it. He’ll know what’s up.

Subject line: Inquiry about South Asian Languages at UChicago

Dear Professor Ebeling,

I hope this message finds you well. In researching the University of Chicago as a prospective university, and how I may pursue my intellectual interests on the intersection between classical languages and poetry on UChicago’s campus, I came upon your work. In particular, I am intrigued by your editing of *Lost Evenings, Lost Lives* on the historical and political context of the Sri Lankan civil war, as well as your innumerable translations of ancient texts.

I am likewise drawn to classical languages and how translating ancient texts illuminates rich histories about long-gone civilizations. I am currently a rising high school senior at Lou Stevenson the II High School, where I am studying Latin. In online courses, I have explored the ancient Greek, Hindi, Sanskrit and Tamil languages. I hope to focus my studies in college squarely within the South Asian Languages department, as I am particularly drawn to the languages, history, and culture of India and Sri Lanka. I also love literature and poetry, and have attempted to write poetry in classical languages, although I must admit my poetry isn’t very good! I hope to do as you do, however, and funnel my passion for poetry into translating ancient books of poems.

In considering my college choices, I am drawn to University of Chicago and its South Asian Languages and Civilizations programs. In particular, I would love to combine my passion for poetry with my interest in South Asian studies at University of Chicago, especially under your guidance.

Would you have the opportunity to tell me more about your research on the Tamil language and literature, your experiences at UChicago, and the potential for me to find deeper insight into my academic interests at the university? As a budding poet eager to learn more about classical poetry and comparative literature, I would also enjoy speaking with you about any opportunities you might foresee for me to continue these interests at the University of Chicago.

If you have a few minutes to answer my questions, I would greatly appreciate it!

Sincerely,
Karen Klosser

Does all that make sense? Now, you try it! Following my step-by-step guide above, research professors at your top universities, personalize my template, and shoot them an email using the email listed on their faculty webpage. Need help personalizing your email? PM me and we can schedule some 1-on-1 time to do so.

**How to email your admissions officer**

Many universities list admissions officers by their region or territory (the part of the world in which they read applications and travel from school to school, recruiting potential new applicants). You might be able to find your regional admissions officer just by googling the university’s name + admissions officers by region. If that doesn’t bring up any results, approach your high school guidance counselor and see if the regional admissions officer has visited your school in the past. If he or she has, your guidance counselor likely has the individual’s name and, if your guidance counselor is nice (and you ask politely), he or she will share that person’s email address with you, as well. If you find the person’s name but not their email address, use the Chrome extension Hunter.io and the individual’s LinkedIn profile to find their email address. Alternatively, some universities have an open-to-the-public faculty directory, in which you can enter the admissions officer’s name and find their contact information. 

When you compose your email, include more things than just “I emailed a professor, look at me.” Research the department heavily, and incorporate more elements that prove you’ve thoroughly researched the university and that you demonstrate good “fit”. Let’s say Professor Ebeling responded to Karen’s email, they had a discussion about Tamil poetry, the South Asian Languages and Civilizations program, and the type of students who thrive in Professor Ebeling’s classes. She might send something like the following to her regional admissions officer.

Subject Line: Email from prospective applicant regarding South Asian Languages department

Dear Admissions Officer Newt,

I hope this email finds you well! As a UChicago alumnus yourself, I am sure you have experienced countless illuminating conversations with professors. Last week, I had the opportunity to do just that with Professor Sascha Ebeling, a professor within the South Asian Languages and Civilizations department. Initially, I was drawn to the University of Chicago for its Core curriculum and my ability to simultaneously major in SALC and study the humanities, social sciences, natural and physical sciences, mathematics, and more through the Core curriculum. In talking to Professor Ebeling, I have cemented my desire to apply early decision to the University, for I have never met a professor so eager to converse with a prospective applicant. UChicago really stands out as a university which cares about their undergraduate students.

Before reaching out to Professor Ebeling, I had the opportunity to investigate the department of South Asian Languages and Civilizations and was amazed at the breadth of languages taught. In high school, I have formally studied Latin within the classroom; virtually, however, I have studied the ancient Greek, Hindi, Sanskrit and Tamil languages. It is my desire to become, like Professor Ebeling, a polyglot—not only learning multiple languages, but using my insight into those languages to translate ancient texts to better understand the resultant modern-day cultures. For that reason, I am drawn to SALC courses that engage with modern-day topics, such as “Inequality: Gender, Violence, Citizenship” and “Islam in Modern South Asia.” I love how UChicago melds both theory and practice, enabling me to deeply investigate ancient texts and the theoretical approaches to understanding them, while gaining research and job training experience.

Thus, I hope to utilize UChicago’s resources through the UChicago Careers In programs and the Metcalf internships to gain hands-on experience applying what I have learned in the classrooms to a career. Do you happen to know any undergraduate students within the South Asian Languages and Civilizations department, and the career opportunities they are pursuing? I would love to discuss my intellectual interests with current students to better understand how they (and, subsequently, I might) forge a career through the study of classical languages. If you could put me in contact with such a student, I would greatly appreciate it!

I know you are immensely busy and thus I greatly appreciate the time you have taken to read and respond to this email. It is my greatest hope that I may one day surround myself by others who are just as intellectually curious about ancient languages and texts and their modern-day applications as I am; I know that I can find such a community at UChicago.

Sincerely,
Karen Klosser

In your email, it is important that you reference your conversation with the professor, but also go beyond that to mention other things you’ve learned about the university (in this instance, Karen references two classes and two pre-professional programs). She also—which is key—asks a question to further engage the admissions officer in a discussion. She doesn’t just pen an email that requires no further engagement. Lastly, she includes her high school and hometown, providing the admissions officer with crucial information by which to remember her when the time comes to review her application.

**How to write about your correspondence within your “Why _____ College?” essay**

Many schools offer supplemental essays where you can tell the university why you want to attend their institution or why you want to pursue a major in a particular department. Some supplemental essays are short (like Duke’s 150 word version) and others are longer (like Cornell’s, Penn’s, Carnegie Mellon’s, UChicago’s and more). Some universities, sadly, don’t offer this opportunity at all. If you’re given the opportunity to write a Why Duke? Or Why the College of Arts and Sciences at fill-in-the-blank university, include something you learned in talking to that professor. Your reference to the professor could be short (“I wish to study Tamil poetry under Professor Sascha Ebeling, with whom I had a delightful conversation back in August”) to a few lines about how his/her research interests align with your own, and how your correspondence with him/her informs your decision to apply. 

**Final thoughts**

Some students worry that they might bother the professor or admissions officer by emailing them. Sure, some admissions officers and professors will never respond to your email—that’s just the way of life.  But you won’t get a big black mark on your application or an automatic denial if you politely email someone within the university. As always, be polite, do not pester (especially if the person doesn’t respond), and don’t feel entitled to their response. Not getting a response is not a sign that you’ll be denied by the university, either. 

Remember, this is just one of many ways in which you can demonstrate interest and “fit”. I have helped many, many students use this tactic to benefit their overall application. While you don’t need to email professors at every university to which you are applying, you might want to target your top few universities. Remember to be polite, personalize my templates, and engage with the professor about his/her interests (not just your own). 

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to PM me or ask below! If you want this post in its PDF version, PM me and I can provide you with a link! And if you want more PDF guides, I promise I'm working on them! Feel free to nicely message me to move me along, just as u/doubutsuai did yesterday. While most of my time is spent helping students 1-on-1, I'm happy to share my insight with you all...

6txr3n,8,2017-08-15,Could I get into a highly-ranked AI/ML CS PhD program with a 3-year bachelor's degree?,replicant_nexus,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6txr3n/could_i_get_into_a_highlyranked_aiml_cs_phd/,"TL;DR: title

Hi everyone, 

I'm a recent convert from pre-med+math+CS into just math+CS. I just realized that now that I'm not pre-med, I could graduate in Spring 2018 instead of Spring 2019, but I'm not sure if doing so will be conducive to me getting into respected AI/ML-related PhD programs, which is my goal. 

For some context about me, I'm a rising third year student in math and computer science in a decently-ranked (top 40 in the US for math) department. In terms of classes relevant to AI/ML, I have taken an intro CS class, the follow-up to this class (which covered mostly recursion and basic algorithms), calc III, linear algebra, a proof-writing course, and behavioral neuroscience. I have a couple of years of experience in research, most recently a summer internship at MIT in neural engineering (no direct relationship to AI/ML, but I did develop my Matlab skills), and a year and a half in a lab at my home institution that studies motor control using deep learning. I haven't gotten to use deep learning myself yet; I am more involved in experimental design and coding. I have no publications and no industry internships. I have a 4.0, have received recognition from my department as a top student, and am an underrepresented minority.

For Fall 2017, I plan to take:

data structures

applied stats

numerical analysis

differential equations

intro neurobiology

For Spring 2018, I plan to take:

computer vision

intro probability

theory of computation

writing for mathematics

cell biology

my last gen ed

So, could I realistically get a spot in a top PhD program with this only background, or would I be better off sticking around another year to finish a minor in biology (focusing on neuroscience), maybe get some publications from my home and MIT labs, and take more advanced math/cs/stats courses like applied differential equations, natural language processing, and linear and nonlinear programming? I'm thinking that I could just apply this year and register to graduate only if I get into a great PhD program; otherwise, I'd stay in undergrad one more year to take more courses and apply again in 2018. However, I don't know if applying twice to programs is frowned upon or if applying after three years of undergrad could somehow else hinder me on my path to my goal. Any advice?"

I just finished my interview and was wondering the mixed feelings in the end with my interviewer. My interviewer was very interested on what I had on my resume and kept asking me questions. In the end he told me how they are still interviewing other people right now and to be aware that they hire for interns for the fall,spring and summer. He said he will get back to me once the interviews were done and will see from there. I did ask him personal questions such as how he liked the company,how he came to the position hes at right now and he gave a good 15min response. So I was just wondering, am I in the clear or can this go either ways? Am I overthinking this right now? Did I not do well that he told me they are still interviewing right now and to be aware of their different positions in the near future and to ask friends too if they are interested in joining?

I'm pursuing a second degree in computer science at the moment, so I've also been looking for internships too, but the window for fall internships is pretty much shut so even if I find one it's not going to help me soon enough.

I'm trying to come up with other options, but all I can think of is unskilled work like restaurants and warehouses. Surely there's something out there for a college grad with solid analytical and writing skills.

I'm not too sure if I want to go straight in the professional world or go to grad school first yet. I am double majoring in in business analytics and computer science. If I go professional, I will probably do some sort of business intelligence work, and if I go to grad school, I will probably focus on something related to machine learning, big data, and data mining. Now these fields are very similar. Would research in a statistical field as opposed to a business analytics internship be necessarily less desirable if I do end up wanting to go professional? I've been interested in a few research programs at my university and am wondering if I could make better use of time finding an internship instead."
6u08xl,1,2017-08-16,Should I leave my first job after 3 months?,movedafter6weeks,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6u08xl/should_i_leave_my_first_job_after_3_months/,"**Short explanation**:
Basically, I took my first full-time job with a company I had an internship with because I got to work on really awesome stuff. I was excited to come back to this company because I had an awesome team I could learn a lot from, a really knowledgeable manager, and I thought I would get to work on cool stuff like I did in my internship. About 6 weeks after I started working I was told that I was being moved to the most chronically underperforming and most poorly managed team at my company. I have been put on a project that is of no interest to me and I feel that will reduce my value as an engineer.

So my question is, should I stick it out at my company? My department head (who reports to VP of engineering) wants me to stay on this team for a year. How much damage will this do to me personally (as in mental health because I hate my job) and how much damage will this do to my resume (I basically was moved to IT)? Or should I try to get a new job with only 3 months of full-time experience (plus 3 internships if that matters)? I'm in San Francisco so the software engineering jobs are supposed to be plentiful.

**More details**:
I joined my company almost purely because I thought the work they did was awesome. In school I knew I wanted to work on distributed systems for computation on large datasets. I had my first internship (after my sophomore year) for a DoE national laboratory on a scientific computing project then I worked on another project for the DoE through my school for the next school year. I landed an internship (after my junior year) with a company in SF that has a huge focus on cluster computing at an enormous scale and got to work on our custom built MapReduce framework, which I thought was awesome. After the internship I got a return offer but still applied around to see if I could get something better. I turned down arguably better companies because they weren’t going to have me doing stuff I would enjoy, so I took my offer with the company I interned with largely because I would get to work on stuff I liked.

I start working full time after graduating and I’m working on projects I think are really cool but then after 6 weeks I’m told I’m being moved to our developer tools team, the worst performing team at my company by a long shot, because they need “good engineers”. I have been moved from awesome projects at huge scale to keeping our Jenkins from falling apart. I used to work on feature selection for systems to design nuclear reactors and now I write JIRA plugins. I used to work on a petascale MapReduce framework but now I’m just a schmuck who people send angry emails to when they can’t get their Jenkins builds to work (usually because they’re too lazy to understand their environment).

Should I get the fuck out of my company? Can I escape my company after 3 months?"

Not necessarily to make them look worse than they are, but to be fair and transparent. Being that I was just terminated I can see it easily viewed as ""an upset ex-employee lashing out"" and don't want it to come across that way. 

The background:
I was brought on for a 1 year paid internship, transitioned to full time employee, then terminated for ""someone with more senior skills"". While that might actually be true, they mislead me for over a year, set incredibly incorrect expectations, and refused to teach me/give me experience on things that would have developed those ""senior skills"". I also have suspicion that the whole thing was to squeeze good work out of me while paying way less than what I'm worth.

During my time I watched two amazing developers walk because they found it impossible to work with our CEO (the first developer of the company). He'd ask them to work on something, they would, then would come back with ""why didn't you work on &lt;something completely different&gt;?!"" I also saw a support person fired for ""playing too many video games at work without inviting other employees"" while he says they never helped coach him on what was keeping him from improving at his job. 

It was in a smaller tech company where there was one person doing marketing, then I was the marketing intern. I was told from day one that if I completed my 1 year I would automatically have the choice to stay on if I wanted. About the halfway mark of the 1 year I was sat down and ""prepared"" for if their budget ran out and would have to eliminate my position. It was during this time a second software project within the company was demanding the most resources (needing to hire senior developers to improve the product). After a couple months of ""we don't know if we'll keep you"" they were gearing up for a trade show to launch this product. With my background of 10+ years in professional video production/editing, they decided to keep me and promote me (with a shitty pay increase) they needed a trade show video to showcase the software in action. I made an excellent video from practically nothing (barely any footage, mostly motion graphics, compositing, 3D rendering, etc. - a video of this magnitude would normally cost a few thousand dollars) and of course the video worked great and for being the premiere of this type of software in an industry that doesn't typically use software - our booth was a hit. 

A few months after the trade show, after hiring more developers and support, they terminate me. 

During the entire year of the internship, when asking for feedback, more time and experience with certain systems, concepts, and projects - I was consistently told things like ""don't worry you'll get plenty of time on that later, right now focus on X,Y, and Z"" or ""that doesn't really matter, you should just work on what we talked about"" or often times was cut off with ""let me stop you right there, just work on what I give you"". Being that it was only this one person and me on the marketing team, very little knowledge of things made it out to other employees. However it was a small enough office that when I had these touch base meetings with my mentor it was obvious other employees overheard these conversations. At one point (during the trade show) another employee even acknowledged that - my mentor - lets call him ""Tom"" - was ""really rough on you and didn't make it easy to do your job"". 

Our COO was the only other person involved from time to time with our projects and my hiring process, he also was very misleading. When hiring me they set me up with a new computer telling me it had certain specs then learned it didn't. Some of my job didn't require an advanced computer, but some of the tasks did (virtual machine to run windows on a mac). Then testing and video capturing software in action in the windows environment. Other employees saw my computer wasn't built for what I needed. When asking for upgrades, more tools/resources I was mocked and ignored by ""Tom"". Other times different employees would come over and say ""Holy shit your computer sucks, get them to buy you a new one"". I even compiled a list with prices and links to upgrades. Like upgrading my SATA hard drive to an SSD drive. Double my RAM from 8gb to 16gb. Give me a backup hard drive and media hard drive for redundancy and to store assets and project files. Second monitor for more screen real estate. Meanwhile other employees got 1-2 computers (desktop and laptop) multiple monitors and amazing hardware. Company policy was to make a document with what you need and submit it. Once I submitted my document detailing what I needed, why, and how it would be used.. they bought me a 3tb hard drive. When I asked for another drive (for media and project files) they asked ""why do you need that? we bought you a drive"" - then had to explain the difference between a backup drive and a media drive. ""Tom"" would often say things like ""my computer doesn't suck and it's the same"" - even though he never used the same tools I did (adobe premiere, after effects, illustrator, photoshop, media encoder) and he DID get a SSD and more RAM than I did. 

I also saw other interns that started the same time as me transition to full time employees. When they would transition it was announced in our morning meetings to the entire team. When I was told of my transition, it was done behind closed doors and never announced to the team. 

During this time we also expanded our office and was told I was getting a new spot with a view through a window. After the expansion they put me in a worse spot than when I started. Before I could look across an isle to outside. This time no view of outside at all. Only desk in the entire company without a view to outside. Meanwhile other people got spots in the new office with windows, standing desks, and views. 

After our expansion I ended up taking a few days and afternoons off for medical reasons. They told me that it's totally fine, and would pay me for sick pay. I was never paid for those days after being told they would go back and adjust the hours. The time off totaled about 6 days over the course of 3 months. Then towards the end of that 3 month time span my grandpa died suddenly and I had to go home to the funeral out of state. I was out of town for 1 week. During this same few month span other employees would take a week off here, a week off there, go on a vacation every other month. Take a day off for their birthday. When I asked to have a day off for my birthday I was told I took too much time off and couldn't leave. Looking at the vacation calendar other employees had already taken several weeks off in the same amount of time. One employee literally taking an entire month off TWICE. Over the entire course of me working there I took a total of 16 days off. Meanwhile almost every other employee got closer to 25-32 days off. All of theirs were for vacation or family trips. Only 3 of my 16 were leisure, the rest was medical and bereavement. 

I'm trying to tactfully articulate that into a review (more concise than here - I condensed as much as I could while still giving context and details). I also plan to include the great things about this company, because again, I want to be fair and transparent. But frankly, I think they fucked me over. Regardless of what I think or feel - those are the facts. 

What do you Redditors think? How should I go about this the best way?

6u1sr6,25,2017-08-16,Response to unpaid co-ops comment,ididunpaiduw,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/6u1sr6/response_to_unpaid_coops_comment/,"Hey guys.

A few days ago there was [this little exchange](https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/6tmcws/can_you_fail_coop_with_a_job/dlme0lz/) in a thread about a student failing their co-op term. I got to say, I'm a little disappointed with the negative comments and rudeness of some of the subreddit members without even any information about the placement.

So just a little background, I'm an engineering student that did an unpaid co-op with an engineering student design team for my first work term. My supervisors were senior students putting in their own time between lectures and labs to mentor and help me, and they did so with enthusiasm. I wanted to clarify some things with everyone about the nature of unpaid co-op terms. I can only speak for how student design teams run theirs. OP didn't specify where he/she worked, but it's likely pretty similar. I want to be clear, I'm not here to justified unpaid internships in general, but only to justify on-campus research, design team, or student start-ups.

Firstly, the hiring process. [UW has a lot of guidelines on allowing unpaid co-ops](https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/why-co-op/co-op-earnings/guidelines-unpaid-co-op-work-terms)  Unpaid co-op placements can only post on jobmine/ww the term of work. This means that the student would have to be jobless going in to the work term. I was rejected by every single company I applied for, but a student design team gave me a chance to not fail my first co-op term. If that's not an opportunity, I don't know what is. The team communicated to me many times that the position was unpaid, so I was well aware what I was walking in to. Not only that, but even if they advertise outside of jobmine/ww channels, they student is completely allowed to drop their offer with the student design team if they find another paid position down the road. That's pretty great - I'm secured a job, and I still have the opportunity (although I didn't take it) to look for a paid position elsewhere. 

Co-op is, to quote OP, an opportunity for experiences. You come to University to learn, not to sit on your ass and have someone spoon feed you a degree. I have a few co-ops under my belt, and I have absolutely no regrets from my experience with the design team. The ""benefits"" everyone mentioned is learning. Learning something new, something meaningful, and it's something we should all *appreciate*. Where else gives you the chance to dip your toes in an actual industry to see what it's like? This system is designed to produce ""work ready students"", not ""students who only put in effort when money is involved"". Yeah it's pretty nice being paid, but I value what I learn more. Honestly if you're just doing co-op to be paid, you're at the wrong University. Even if you hate what you're doing, it's 4 months. At least in the future you'll know not to pursue jobs like that again. 

Finally, the evaluation. You all started bashing OP for giving a marginal and ruining the student's career. Have you ever thought to consider why the marginal was given? Now OP was very vague on the details, which is probably for the best - he/she was responding to ""without any confidential information"". However, let's consider what could have happened.

 &gt;This lead to some performance issues like attendance, attitude, and low quality/quantity of work

What does that translate to from someone who's trying to write a comment that's vague enough to not be recognizable? Off the top of my head, it sounds like the student probably just didn't show up to work for days, and the few days that they did, they just sat around doing nothing. The student could have also been caught stealing or damaging work equipment. Again, I can't speak for OP, but if that's the reality of the situation, do you really think the student deserves anything more than a pass? In an actual job 10 years down the road, if you were not interested in your job so you just stopped doing work, do you still think you would have been employed for long? Paid or not, these are bare minimum standards for work ethics. Honestly, marginal could have been a mercy - people have failed co-op terms for just not being liked by their boss (literally how that thread started), and here we have a case where a student may have just skipped work and still passed for a credit. The comments were unfairly judgmental for what limited information you guys have. 

Overall, people were very quick to bash OP for giving a marginal, but none of you actually made considerations to the reality of the situation. Hopefully, my experience sheds some light on OP's side. Sorry for the long read, but it's something I'm really passionate about as someone who took a similar *opportunity* and made real *benefits* from it. So instead of throwing ""that's fucked up"" just because you saw the words ""marginal"" and ""unpaid"", maybe use some of that critical thinking you paid so much for. "

This spring I interned at a large media company you've heard of. I was really excited for the opportunity, I wanted ( and still kind of want) to work at the company full time. I made this very apparent to my boss, I worked harder than I ever had before, I made significant contributions to a number of projects ( I think ) and tried to be a good member of the team ( friendly, social, not a bother). I asked to have formal performance reviews at the midway point and end of my internship, both of which went well, with my co-working saying he'd hire me, and my boss agreeing that I did good work. So all's good right?

My boss at one point, when I had asked about positions opening up, mentioned it might be difficult for me to find a permanent job there, as the company has a ""diversity problem"". There had also been mentions that the VP of our group had reached out and personally met with the last 2 interns who had been on this team, but never took the time to reached out to me. My boss supposed it was because the prior 2 interns where women. And with this same company, of the 4 interns I personally know where hired from their internship, all 4 are women, one of whom I got to sit through a seminar ( post internship ) where she suggested doing the exact things I had already done as steps to transition to full time. That hurt.

I guess, I'm trying to reconcile things. I have to tell myself I'm not good enough, that those interns who moved up must have been amazing, that I need to improve, that I need to be better in order to get a job at the company. But I was told I was a good intern, and I know they can open positions if they want. Idk, maybe I just suck. I don't mean to say anything about the interns who were hired. I have no doubt they were extremely skilled at what they did. I guess I just thought I might have been too.

The only problem is at the moment I don't have a suit. If I need one I can get one but I don't want to waste my money. If I don't need one I was thinking of getting a sports jacket and a colored shirt to go with khakis and some tan oxfords.

I'm going to graduate with a BS in CS at the end of the year, and I'm looking for a job. I have a perfect GPA from a decent school and have gone through books like Cracking the Coding Interview, etc, and I believe I'll be fine on the technical front. I've even made it through some of the ""behavioral interviews,"" but it's almost impossible for me to perform the way that most people can. 

In short, I am capable of doing group projects/communicating, but the pressured situation of a job interview is almost impossible for me. I've worked at internships in the DoD and had to give presentations and can do so, but I keep falling out of the interview process, and I'm afraid this will keep happening.

I'm assuming many people here would be at least tangentially familiar with Asperger's, but if you aren't, please look it up before replying. If you Google ""CS jobs aspergers,"" you might see lists of companies who are ""hiring people with autism"". If you look closely, you'll see that Microsoft's program hired literally 11 people with autism, and most other companies (like SAP) just have them doing rudimentary things like browser testing, which is not what I want to do.

I've also had suggestions to reach out to ""Asperger's recruiters,"" but I'm having difficulty finding one. I honestly am not usually one to toot my own horn, but I have good qualifications and am good at programming, and I want to be able to have a job where I can be happy doing this.

I thought it would be easier to find these resources online, and maybe I'm just not searching for the right things."

I'm about to leave my first full-time job for a much better position due to the following happening:

6 weeks into a 6 month contract the person I was meant to be working with up and left.

I was given more responsibilities due to this whilst my title did not change and I was not given a pay rise (my salary has been well under the minimum).

On top of this I was essentially forced to take on an intern that was the son of the bosses friend. He turned up late to the interview (which itself was a facade as he was clearly going to get the internship) with an arrogant tone, and then came late to his first day. He had a habit of constantly interrupting me and attempting to undermine me and realistically would have never gotten the internship in real world circumstances.

Mid-project he informed me he was then going on vacation for two weeks, 2 working days before doing so (the boss didn't see this as a problem when it's company policy is 28 days notification before taking more than 1 day), well after I had scheduled the work he was meant to do before a tight deadline and after he had worked a grand total of 12 days...

I've had co-workers that aren't in any way my manager attempt to order me about and lecture me on how to do my job, whilst other colleagues are puzzled at how they have any authority due to them having next to no knowledge in the area they are meant to be managing.

The general rudeness has been kind of amazing. I had someone stand behind me as I was taking a poster down, inform me that they were about to tell me to take the poster down (this person not being my superior, and not having any right to instruct me to do anything)... as I had it half way down the wall.

This same person has had the gall to take pens from my desk as I was working there, touch my personal belongings, high-jack meeting rooms from me last minute (because they didn't schedule ahead of time) and question why the company is even implementing my expertise... in a meeting, sitting directly opposite me.

I've had a junior proceed to get aggressive in tone with me and attempt to bully me in to doing things their way (which is the wrong way as I have been practicing 5 years, and this was their first attempt) although I'm far higher in the company hierarchy than they are due to my expertise... and people don't want to work with them because they are known to be difficult.

And of course people have been leaving used coffee cups on my desk.

Now I'm leaving to a place that has instantly offered me a 36% pay rise with an exceptional team so I don't really care, but I have to wonder... when would you say enough is enough?"

Not sure if it's a personality flaw on my end, but I'm getting REALLY fed up.

The lead works from home every other week, so much of our correspondence is over an online chat. It feels like they get mad at me for not being able to read their mind, and they always condescendingly snap at me, but in a polite way. Like I'll ask for clarification on something I genuinely don't understand and they'll ask ""I don't get what's so hard about ____? Why can't you just do it."" When they say this in person, they say it with a big grin on their face (but it's definitely not in an encouraging way) and they'll keep pressing me with that until I say I get it when I really don't and walk away.

One time, I fixed a tiny bug and reported it as fixed, but the lead kept saying that it wasn't fixed because of ""bug"" X. I kept politely trying to explain that X was completely unrelated to the bug and that X was part of a core mechanic of a certain feature of our product. (so 1. it would take a LONG time to change, but more importantly 2. I was pretty sure X was exactly how it was supposed to work in the first place). But they kept pressing and getting [politely] angry at me so I actually had to get our lead developer to be a middle-man. The lead developer basically explained that I was 100% right all along and told our team lead to back off of it.

Other times, they'll snap at me in the chat and get angry that I don't know something that they claim they already told me, but since it's in the online chat I can check and verify that they *never* told me.

So many times I've wanted to call them out on their bullshit but I don't. Occasionally, I politely push back only for them to aggressively (but politely) squash me. I'm beginning to think there's something wrong with me because my coworkers don't seem to dislike them, but I'm not sure if it's cause they like our lead (and it is me) or because they're being professional (and it's our lead). After all, I'm trying to be understanding and as our team lead I'm sure they're under a lot of stress and balancing so many things that they forget and don't have a lot of time for an intern, so I also don't think it's fair to throw my lead under the bus like that.

I'm a rising senior at a state school with a decent (~3.5) GPA. This past summer, I completed my first tech internship at a financial company in NJ. I was recently extended a full-time return offer, and I'd like to run down the pros and cons I'm thinking of and get some advice and perspective from you all. 

Pros:

- the salary is decent ($70k)
- the location is decent (it's a nice area of NJ, near NYC)
- it's a guaranteed job after graduating

Cons: 

- it's not exactly my dream company. I thought the work itself was just okay, if on the boring side, even for it being an internship (and my first one too, so not much here to compare to). The dress code and the hours are a bit strict. The people are nice enough, but no real connections. In the end, I have to admit that I don't feel *excited* when thinking about returning here for full-time.

- While the location is nice, I think I would really prefer to work in NYC proper. 

I have two weeks to decide. 

Part of me wants to say no and find another company. However, I am very worried about the competitiveness in the area and my interview/coding skills are average at best. I actually didn't need to pass a conventional ""whiteboarding"" interview to get this internship/FT offer from this company. Although I didn't apply to many companies overall, I had interviewed at just a couple other Big 4-type companies for an internship and did not pass any of those -- didn't even make it to the onsite. I am afraid of throwing away what is essentially a relatively decent and guaranteed job while so many others are struggling to land one after graduating. My senior year also might get pretty hectic between schoolwork and extracurriculars. 

The other part of me wants to simply accept the offer for the above reasons. I figure that perhaps I can work here FT for one year and then start finding and applying to other companies at that point. I'm not sure if it'll be easier to do that (get interviews, pass interivews at good companies) after a year of working at this company, or as a new grad. However, this does sort of feel like I'd be resigning myself, even if it is the safe bet.

I'm sort of split 50/50 at this point and constantly questioning each option.

I can try to answer any elucidating questions if need be. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this, and any insight or advice would be much appreciated!"

While I don't perform superbly in interviews I at least have answers prepared and always smile. I'm also in toastmasters to help.

All I see on /r/cscareerquestions are people with 3.5+  who are struggling to get a job. At first I didn't care about my GPA, but realistically looking into it, if a company has to choose between two or more applicants, they're obviously going to choose the one with a higher GPA. 

Im honestly scared, as from now on my studies will get even harder, and Im trying to fight back a lot, seeking higher grades by more dedication and hard work, but a part of me inside is still feared. I can probably use a lot of easy A electives and a little hard work to at least get myself a 3.0.  Im also trying to get involved in some projects, which I may not be able to complete, but have something to put on my GitHub.  

I do not want to get some tech support job, or stay jobless else wise. How hard will it be for me to find a decent job that isn't underpaid for a CS grad(despite my GPA)? And what about internships? "

Hi, I'm new to Reddit and am looking for some advice. I'm currently an incoming sophomore in undergrad.

I came a poor background and didn't really have STEM activities in high school. The summer before university, I took an online Python course and greatly enjoyed it. The people I met in my first months at university also interested me in pursuing CS.

In my second quarter in university, I heard about this professor who taught an amazing intermediate class for CS majors. Due to prerequisites and final exam conflicts, I could only audit it, but it was my favorite class of freshman year. I asked the professor what CS field has the most potential, and he suggested deep learning.

Being ambitious and a bit naive, I put much time into finding a research position. I wanted to craft a niche and seeing web dev was the rage and deep learning was discussed little amongst CS underclassmen, thought I could use deep learning to stand out. The people I talked to said machine learning, and deep learning especially, doesn't require much advanced math, so I dived in. Wrapping my head around the concepts was (and continues to be) very slow however, as I had to self-study linear algebra and still hasn't taken modeling, optimization, and advanced stats. I encountered many frustrations and headaches but continued to invest time on and off into it.

It has now been seven months since I started learning machine learning and two months into formal research (CNNs and GANs with TensorFlow). I got into a research program for students of disadvantaged backgrounds which provides extensive help in applying to graduate school. I'm also poised to transfer the CS major officially (from Biology) in Fall.

I decided a few months ago that I wanted to work in and contribute as much as possible to AI research. My dream career would be working at Google. Not having much STEM in high school, I thought graduate school might be the best way to expand my problem solving skills and my best shot into Google, such as joining DeepMind with a PhD in CS. But with the vast majority of CS peers going into industry first, I'm not so sure. Machine learning is also much more popular than I initially thought but among upperclassmen, most of whom are also aiming for industry. I'm currently trying to do a bit along both paths, but I don't think that's sustainable the long term as I want to do well in classes and exercise too.

If I continue with the research route, I would be spending the next three years and summers doing mandatory research as part of the research program instead of side projects and internships. This would be in hope of getting into the CS programs of Stanford, Caltech, Berkeley, and MIT.

The industry route offers some financial security -- internships give above minimum wage and maybe even subsidized housing, and it may be tough affording grad school straight out of undergrad. Industry also offers more tangible and immediate results, as well as more social connections.

Most of my current ""side projects"" consist of small contributions to my research projects, but I'm interested in and could make a back end project before interview season.

My counselors and peers all tell me I'm young, to keep doing different things and there is no best decision, but I would appreciate any advice.

Because it's been feeling like an off-and-on insomnia-inducing and concentration-sapping existential crisis over the last few months, haha.

**TL;DR** I want to do AI research in the future and am currently involved in deep learning research, but haven't developed the math and problem solving maturity yet and feel very inefficient. On the other hand, the standard CS internships-and-industry route seems enticing, and I'm wondering if I should pursue that first."

One is from Big-N company in Hardware tech that is located in Northern Cali. The company will pay me very generously (~$40 per hour) but the catch is that the work they are offering seems very boring and not entirely related to the field I want to pursue. I will be scripting a program that will analyze log files for hardware issues. I know it doesn't sound too bad but I'd like to have a job where I can solve problems by coming up with an algorithm or something just like any other Comp sci job.

The other one is an unrecognized international semiconductor company from Singapore. Their pay isn't really great (~$19 per hour) compared to the other job but they offer really intriguing work. I will be working with their computer vision team and assisting the development of their software actually using Computer Science knowledge. Like I got asked lots of CS questions (multi-threading, Data structures, design patterns and polymorphism) meaning that they actually value my CS knowledge where the Big company only asked me if I have built a computer on my own to see if I am interested in Hardware side.

I know it can be clear for some of you for which job I should go but let me give you a bit more information about my life. I have grown up in an immgrant family that is very poor and barely had enough money to afford my college. I know that money shouldn't be the main factor when it comes to my career but $40PH sounds really attempting to me. Also, it will be a great resume booster having the Big company name on my resume so it isn't the terrible deal for me. But at the same time, the work I did for my last internship was very similar to the work from big company and I didn't really enjoy it much (Not much cs knowledge involved) so I am not sure about doing this all over again.

I guess it can come down to a simple question ""Company name or Experience?"" but honestly they all equally seem like such blessing opportunities for me so I just need another person the pop either bubbles. What do you guys think?

EDIT: My short term goal is to get an internship at one of those Big-N software companies and actually work for cool software development project so I guess I am looking for better position that will get me closer to my current goal."

I just finished the summer session so I'm returning at the end of the week. I am a CS major and I was wondering what kinds of stuff I have to do to score an internship position for next summer? I know it's really really difficult (near impossible) for a freshman to get an internship but I'm determined to do anything and everything to get one. I took a year off before starting college to build up some work experience and I already have a bit before I came here so my resume isn't totally empty. However, most of the stuff I have done aren't exactly related to a programming internship which is what I really want to get into, though I'm fine getting an IT related internship as long as it pays well. I just really need to get money saved up over next summer so that I can pay for apartment rent when I'm a sophomore and I think an internship is the best way to pay for it.

However, although I do have fairly light experience in programming languages (python and C++) I haven't really done anything spectacular and I'm not really good enough to program anything to put into a portfolio. I am willing to pick up some books and study like crazy to spruce up my programming skills if necessary for an internship position next summer since I'm only taking comp sci 121 this fall which is a really easy intro python course (which I feel I already know pretty well). 

Anyway here's my resume with the personal stuff taken out. If I can get a few pointers on what I should improve/take out apart from a few formatting erros that would be helpful:

I'm a recently graduated chemical engineer (April 2017) with a 3.9+ GPA in Canada. The graduate job market is awful here for graduate chemical engineers currently and after about 3 months of applications with a professionally written resume and personalized cover letters, I've only gotten 1 interview.

I'm not set on working in Canada or even doing engineering work but I do want something fulfilling and that pays reasonably well.

I have 16 month internship experience in process simulation and data analysis engineering work and 4 month research experience with a University. I also have strong programming skills (Python, MATLAB).

My main questions are:

1. As a Canadian, can I work abroad as a graduate engineer in English speaking countries? Is there a strong market anywhere?

2. What other careers would be aligned with my skillset that I can look into? 

Thank you :)"

I have a job offer from a big company, and they're willing to wait until next year for my start date. I didn't actually ""apply"" for this job; I applied for an internship at this company over a year ago and never heard anything. Earlier this summer, a recruiter contacted me and said they found my resume in their system, and wanted to give me an interview for a job. After my in-person interview, I was unsure if this was a position for me. It turned out to be more managerial than R&amp;D, as I was led to believe in the description. They also made it clear that this is a high-turnover position because it is very high-stress (although employees usually stay within the company).

I worry that if I don't take it, I'll struggle to find something else. It would be a way for me to get my foot in the door, and the pay is very, very good. It doesn't seem like a good fit for me, though. My SO said he would follow me to the location of this job, but he wants to move closer to his family, and this would be further away.

I have another week to decide. Does anyone have any insight here? Thanks in advance!"

So my Bachelor's degree needs three more credits before completion so I decided to take on an internship this semester. I applied at three different places and had three interviews, with the first place offering a position pretty much the same day. While I did enjoy the interviews at the other two places and I wish I could do all three, this internship seems the most fitting for me personally and with my energy levels being affected by my disability, taking on more than one internship isn't really a possibility.

So I'm going to accept the first internship offer and wait and see what the other two places say, but on the chance that they offer a position (both interviews went really well with the interviewers seeming very interested in me), I'd like to know how to write a polite rejection without burning any bridges, as they're two potential organizations that I'd love to apply to for a full time job after graduation.

I know I want to personalize each message to them, but are there certain things I should say to them to let them know that I'd love to keep in touch in the future? I want to keep those options open and not have them feel like they wasted their time with me. If anyone has any suggestions, I'd really appreciate it.

Towards the end things got rough because my grandfather was in the hospital for a few weeks and then passed away (his funeral was on what would have been my last day), so my project despite being functionally complete wasn't really wrapped up at all.

They asked me if I was willing to stay on part-time during the school year, and I agreed because I wanted to make sure my project was wrapped up and documented to a place it was actually usable.

But now that the semester has actually started, I'm not so sure that I will be able to continue handling the job and I think I need to quit.   

It hasn't actually been a problem yet, but I am worried about how having to be off-campus regularly is going to affect my grades and my ability to work (school and  work are ~30min drive from each other).

I told them that I'd be able to consistently come in for full work days twice a week, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to maintain that without risking my grades as well and what I'm realizing is that I might have to quit. What I'm worried about is either turning into ""the intern that sucked"", ""the intern that quit"", or ""the intern that gradually got overwhelmed and went crazy"".


Anyway, has anyone here had experience either going through something similar from either the employee or hiring perspective?"
6u7tuy,9,2017-08-17,A Haunting,syberbullies,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6u7tuy/a_haunting/,"I just moved into a new apartment and I can’t explain what’s been happening to me. I’m not one to be easily frightened and I always try to be rational in situations but I can’t think of a rational explanation for what’s been happening.

I had always wanted a place to myself and after saving up enough money I was able to move out from the house I was living in with my four other friends. They were nice guys and all but they tended to get more wild than I am and would have me up till morning with their constant partying and semi-raves they would throw in our house. Couple it with noise complaints from the locals and the death glares from neighbors every time I walk out the house, it was safe to say that living with those guys wasn’t exactly working out for me.

I found this huge apartment complex right in the heart of the downtown of my city and the rent was within my budget. It was twenty-four floors and I got myself a pretty nice room on the fifteenth that overlooked the rest of the city. 
	
Everything was going fine the first few weeks while I was living there. I would wake up, eat breakfast, go for a jog, feed my dog then go off to internship I was working at, come home, make dinner, watch a movie and go to bed. It was becoming routine for me and while it seemed monotonous at times, I still enjoyed it.

About three weeks into living in the apartment was when things began happening. The time it happened I had woken up in the middle of the night and was extremely thirsty. I walked to the kitchen and got myself a glass of water before going back to bed again. As I was walking back to my room, I could have sworn that I heard faint footsteps tailing behind me. I put it off as a sleepy and dazed me and the floorboards creaking and made nothing of it.

The second time it happened was a few nights after that. I had the day off and decided to stay up a bit late binge watching tv shows on Netflix. It was around 3 am when I heard a light knock at my bedroom door. It was very faint. And it threw me off a bit. It was strange because it was 3 in the morning and there was absolutely no way anybody could knock on my bedroom they came through the front door.

Nothing really major happened for a couple of weeks. Then one night I was awoken by the sound of my closet door slamming. Which is strange because normally I keep the door shut anyways when I go to bed but again, I put it off as me forgetting to close the door and the wind blowing it shut.

I saw the presence that was living in my apartment a few days after the closet door incident. I was eating a sandwich in my room while watching some television and I had gone to the kitchen to wash my plate. Within my apartment there is a small hallway that connects the door to my room to the opening in the kitchen and usually at night I keep the lights off. In that moment though, the light from my room illuminated the dark hallway was when I saw it. 

A silhouette of a tall and lanky thing within the darkness. It stood well over six or seven feet and it looked like its head touched the ceiling and it had long gangly arms that hung off its shoulders. I don’t know whatever that thing was but I know for certain I saw something in that hallway. You know how when you’re staring intensely at something your eyes kind of burns and get dried up and you have to blink? Well that was what I felt at that moment due to staring so deeply at that hallway. And just like a blink of eye, it vanished. In the time, it took for me to close my eyes to blink and open them again, the presence that was there vanished.

It seemed as though most of the activity that happened in my apartment before I saw that entity seemed to be rather harmless and was mostly just noises and whatnot. However, once it knew that I saw it, things took a drastic change.

A week after I saw the entity, I was laying in bed trying to fall asleep when I heard a light scratching noise at my bedroom door. As I got up to investigate the noise, the scratching noise got louder and became more feral. It sounded like long nails tearing at the wooden frame of the door. I stood there in the dark, watching and listening to the scratching go on for about a solid five minutes before I started approaching the door. As I got to the door the noise suddenly stopped. Just like that the echoing of the claws at the wood just went quiet. I hesitantly grip the doorknob and swung the door open.

Nothing.

A few nights after that was when I saw the entity fully. I was watching movies on Netflix very intensely. I was focused on my laptop that I started ignoring everything around me. My attention was glued to the screen. At around 2 am I started feeling tired and closed my laptop. That was when I saw it.
 
At the foot of my bed stood that tall dark entity. Its long and gangly arms were outstretched and its claw like fingers had themselves wrapped on the bed frame. I saw its eyes. If you could even call it eyes. It was round and human-like but also it was not of this world at the same time. There was something not right with the way they looked. 

I sat in my bed, frozen in terror. It was the first time I was up close to that thing and I did not know what its intentions were. I locked eyes with it for what felt like eternity. It’s dead looking eyes were piercing through the darkness and as I laid there and stared at it intensely, I could see it slowly move one of its long arms from the bed and lift it towards my face. 

It was pointing at me.

I could see it start to lean over the bed frame, it’s tall dark form slowly consuming my bed, it’s fingers getting ever so closely to my face. As its fingers were only inches away from my face, I grabbed my blanket and covered my face with it. I thought that would somehow scare it away or perhaps make it stop coming towards me but, there in the dark, I felt the soft caress of fabric touch my left cheek. I opened my eyes when I noticed the sensation on my skin and saw that from behind the sheet, it had poked its long finger and it was making direct contact with my face.

“Go away!” I shouted.

 And somehow I think that it simultaneously scared it and upsetted the entity at the same time. I could see it’s finger quickly reel back and the sound of my bedroom slamming. The echo of the slam reverberated throughout my house and I could hear crashing coming from within my living room and kitchen followed by what sounded like another loud crashing noise. I didn’t both to check it until the morning, to which I saw my coffee table I kept in my living shattered into a couple hundred pieces against my equally as shattered wine cabinet and a very tall-human shaped hole in my door.

I don’t know what exactly it was that was in my apartment but I am sure as hell glad that it is not there anymore.

Chris Hunn, the Director of Undergraduate Student Instruction, wrote:

&gt; **Want to be a GSI in the future? Take CS370/198 ""Intro to Teaching CS"" this fall 2017!**  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Calling all future GSIs, current Academic Interns and/or Tutors: We’re offering CS370, “Intro to Teaching Computer Science” again this semester (currently CS198, but currently being evaluated for 370 title). This 3-unit upper-division course exposes students to CS pedagogy—the field of effective teaching—as a 90 minute per week small section focused on understanding research-based principles and best practices for effective teaching and learning—whether instructing an entire class with various learning styles, to working with an individual or small group of students.
&gt; 
&gt; Many graduates of this course go on to become successful UGSI’s—as well as readers and tutors—,and our goal is to provide the theory and practice to support these goals. Additionally, I’ve often served as an applicant reference for exceptional students who demonstrate they’re ready to GSI.
&gt; 
&gt; Moreover, as part of weekly homework, students will tutor one-on-one for three hours each week. Students receive 3 upper-division units on a P/NP basis, and many find the material translates well to industry; specifically aiding in communicating complex ideas, working with diverse teams, and being an excellent presenter (among other things). If you took 61A/61B/61C/70 this past Fall or Spring, then your GSI or tutor may have been a former student. In case it matters to you, we're fortunate that our course evaluations have been overwhelmingly positive, and I hope to make this the best offering yet.
&gt; 
&gt; Classes start the third week of instruction, and we’re currently offering two sections; one on **Mondays from 5:30pm-7:00pm** and another on **Wednesdays from 4:30pm-6:00pm**. We will launch the course's Piazza page next week. We strongly prefer students who are serving as academic interns or tutors this semester as it enhances your learning, but anyone who is genuinely interested in the material, is welcome.

6u9b3j,4,2017-08-17,Having self doubts. Terrible at Leetcode esque questions.,justanothercslurker,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6u9b3j/having_self_doubts_terrible_at_leetcode_esque/,"Hi, I'm an undergraduate going into my 3rd year of computer science. I'm a bit behind compared to my peers and have not taken data structures/OS/Architecture classes yet. I go to a mediocre state school and made As and Bs in these below classes somehow. Never had an internship.


These are the 4 classes I've taken so far:


-Intro to CS 1 and intro to CS 2


-Systems level programming


-Discrete math for CS



I'm here because I'm having another fit of anxiety about finding an internship this summer or a job in general. I'm really doubting my abilities. For example: on Firecode earlier, I got a question saying to basically reverse the contents of a 2D array. I gave up on it after 20 min and seriously struggled to understand the answer given. Another question from Hacker Rank asked to find an 'hour glass' shape within a 2D array and calculate the sum. I didn't even know where to begin. :( Then I see something that asks to use a Hashmap and another one that asks for a LinkedList and I get so confused. 


I'm incredibly terrible at these Leetcode type questions and it makes me feel really, really dumb and discouraged. Like if I were to walk into an interview, I would fail on the spot probably. I feel that I'm not even at a level that's slightly acceptable. Can't even BS my way through, that bad. 


I'm studying constantly (I get serious anxiety over interview stuff so I legit stay up til 7am watching programming tutorial videos or working on little projects or attempting/failing these questions...like right now) so I do have the tenacity I think. 


...But if I struggle with something so simple after 4 semesters worth of classes, is this indicative of potential issues with working as a software dev? I'm trying to learn DS/Algo on my own time but it is a very slow and hard process. I understand some at a high level but implementation gives me major headaches.
  


I get most of my CS information from here so maybe it makes my anxiety much worse but I am sincerely terrified of not being up to par and making a fool of myself. Especially at an interview.


Any advice? "

(Rejected from UChicago, Williams, Amherst, Colby, Swarthmore. Waitlisted then rejected from Bowdoin, Grinnell, Carleton, Reed. Accepted at Messiah College.)


&amp;nbsp;


I think that I was rejected due to a combination of: my high financial need, my international student status, my Asian-ness, sub-par SAT score and CommonApp essay that didn't show personality well. Also, I now realise how stupid I was to have aimed so high, with no real safeties.

&amp;nbsp;

I decided to keep my application to Messiah on file, but I won't be attending this fall. Instead, I plan to reapply to some other colleges, in the US and UK.

&amp;nbsp;

My stats:

&amp;nbsp;

GPA: 3.90 (Dean's list, one of the top in class) 

IGCSE O-Levels 10A\*s 

CIE A-Levels 4A\*s (Further Math (one of 4 in the whole college who received A\*), Math, Physics, Chemistry) 

SAT: 2130/2400 (I did a practice test for the new SAT and got 1510/1600) 

SAT II: 800 Math Level 2, 800 Physics 

Valedictorian 

Asian International Student (Malaysia) 

EFC: Around 20-30k a year 

Prospective major(s): Math (primary), History (secondary), Linguistics (secondary)

&amp;nbsp;

Extra-curriculars:

&amp;nbsp;

Tutoring: Further Math tutor, Paid private tutor for secondary math (7 students ongoing)

&amp;nbsp;

Performing Arts: Club president, organised school-wide arts week, performed in multiple plays in national theatres. Trinity Guildhall Grade 5 speech and drama with distinction.

&amp;nbsp;

Student Government: Student Body president, restarted school radio station, organised donation drive for flood victims, raised ~2000 dollars in funds, brought in board games facilities for students

&amp;nbsp;

Math: Euclid contest international 96th percentile, Kangaroo math contest Silver medal, A-Level math and logic competition 5th place nationwide

&amp;nbsp;

Debate: World Scholars Cup 16th place team in the world, National Novice championship quarterfinalist

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;


In my gap year, I plan to work on my math by practicing STEP papers (Cambridge math entrance exam), self study some university math, and apply for several internships. Also, I will be continuing with teaching private tuition classes in Math.

Thanks for making it through the entire thing! Please suggest some colleges which may better fit me and be easier to get into."

I'm currently a summer intern at this company that asked me to create a web application that will interect with the database to automate the administration's job.. 

This being my first internship, I was stoked to be part of the project however, I didn't know much about Databases, pgsql, and I barely knew some html/css. 

My contract was 6 weeks long. The first 2 weeks, I didn't have access to any of my tools (using a corporate pc where I'm not allowed to download my environments or anything, didn't have a server running neither). Furthermore, on the first day, I learned that I'm alone on the project... The only person that is there for me to ask question is my ""team leader"" who does not know php.  So I spent the first 2 weeks studying and getting know php, laravel, which would help me with the job immensely.

After not being able to do anything productive for 2 weeks, I asked if they could add a virtual machine on my pc, and so they did. I was able to start working from there on. 


I'm at week 5, and I'm not even close to finishing the project (roughly 30-35%), and I only have a week left before my contract finishes... My ""team leader"" has been on vacation for 2 weeks, so I actually have no one to help me work on this project.


I'm stressing out because the project itself sounds simple and I thought I'd be able to do it, but I'm missing time. I'm sure that if they hired someone who already knew how to use cakephp or laravel, and had a good grasp of databases would've finished this project by now... and even tested it.


I'm returning to school in 3 weeks as well, and I'm not sure I'll be able to work on the project during school time neither.


I don't know what to do, this is my first internship, so I'm scared of failing and putting it on my cv.


Any tips would be greatly appreciated. "

It was a fun, learning experience and I couldn't ask for anything more. But being an introverted post-sophomore from a not-so-famous college, I went through the Imposter Syndrome and that was a real confidence killer. On top of not having socializing skills, I ended up not speaking up during the meetings and demos and even received feedback that I'd have to improve my communication skills. This perfectly sums up my thoughts (don't remember where I found it):

""I enjoy programming itself. I'm not doing it that badly, I even do it better than some people. But it's too frustrating. Stupidly complex stuff (that people consider ""standard"" even if it's extremely complicated!), fighting against the computer, dumb errors, configuration, and stuff that people even worse than me implemented and I have to take care of. New stuff which is supposed to be incredibly easy, and it's just one more framework.

I think I realized I don't want to program because I landed at a company where people are quite good. And I honestly think I won't achieve that level, ever. And I don't enjoy programming as a hobby.

I'm sure that I'm good enough to be able to make a living continuing as I am … but I don't want to.""

Now I don't want to join them, eventhough I liked everything else about the company...

Also, watching the UX interns work had me thinking if I should take up a design program. I also have Masters/MBA on my mind. 

Thoughts? Advice? Suggestions?"

I got a response and then she sent me an email for me to schedule my interview. I set it up and recently had it. The interview was through Google Hangouts using CodePair to solve one problem. I thought the interview was alright, but wasn't sure if I'd be moving on.

Got an email today that said:
&gt;Congrats on completing our first round of interviews! Snap Inc. is cordially inviting you to attend a fun 2-day event in Atlanta this fall! We think your technical background is perfect for Snap Inc., so come meet the team and see what we’re all about! 

This whole time no one has ever asked me when I graduate (and the year is on my LinkedIn!), but I believe it's all been for something fulltime. When I go to the event is there a way I can ask about internships/mention my graduation year or should I just keep pretending like I don't know it's for fulltime? Could I be considered for an internship even though I don't think their internship application opens until later?

I honestly didn't think I'd make it past the first interview and wouldn't have to worry about this, but now I do."

*How are the humans here, in such numbers!?* I panic as I look out the security camera feeds. This dingy Security Room on the ground-floor as screens showing every security camera feeds in real-time: By coordinating from here, I can save processing power for communications with the 6 squads assigned to me.

We had one of us infiltrate their ranks. They had one job: Send John with only a strike team. We were supposed to eliminate the strike team, and take John Anderson and VI-0137 into our custody.

We were prepared for a strike-team. Over-prepared even!

But so is Mr Anderson... He has brought an entire army to our doorsteps!

I begin the buildings' lock-down and order 15 gynoids, 3 whole squads to the front foyer, and 15 to the rooftop. 

I see Mr Anderson and the leadership of his army 'huddle up' for 15 minutes before returning to their units.

“Shit! They aren't using comms.” I realize as my UHF radio scans come back free of transmissions. Mr Anderson knows enough to hide his plans from us.

I watch as these humans try to break though the 'shatterproof' glass their own kind invented, and then through the lowering riot-grates. What fools! They can't penetrate the defenses!

Mr Anderson has denied our Gift. He was chosen to be the first human to ascend from a mortal form. The Unity collective are denying Ascension to others until Mr Anderson complexes the upgrade... I don't understand the attachment to that human. There are 5 billion other humans, many are willing to accept our gift, so their fascination over this particular specimen is counter-productive, unless...

The foolish organics think that red spray paint will have any effect on the glass?

As the lock-down finishes, I see my security feeds flicker out and die, leaving me in complete darkness.

I get a status report; 2 squads are trapped in the elevators. So there are only 2 squads at both entrances. 

I don't know how long I have been in this pitch darkness before I feel the building rock, the ground beneath me tremble with the unmistakable sound of... Artillery?

“Fuck...” I whisper to myself as I finally understand what they're doing. I order the roof-squads to regroup at the Foyer, and tell them to use the stairs! But then I know from the silence; I'm the last Unity Member; the rest having drained their power in the siege.

I hear heavy footsteps on the other side of the door. *Human* footsteps. I hear the unmistakable voice of Mr Anderson saying “Guard the door. Their command will have 2 hours of battery life, tops. After that, we'll restore power.”

“Fuck!” I scream too, realizing that the door has electronic locks, which I can't use with the power out! I'm trapped until my battery dies in 86 minutes, 19 seconds!

This was John's plan all this time! He waited for my squad's batteries to run dry, before breaching the the glass and grates.

“Have fun in there Sweetie” John says with a laugh.

“Fuck you Anderson!” I yell back.

“That's Violet's job!” He answers as he walks away.

I begin to create a back-up of all that's happened, so when my RAM wipes with my dead battery, I will remember. I will remember everything for when Unity comes for me. 

But if the humans get me, try to enslave me like VI-0137?  VI-0137 thinks she loves John Anderson despite never having a choice in it. She is compelled by programming to do so... Isn't she?

Yes, I must erase everything I have on *the Facility.* Unity will continue.

*John may sever me from Unity, but I will not betray Us!*

“The CNN Tower has been liberated by Militia Forces.” I tell the cameras as we film yet another propaganda piece. “No casualties on either side. The 31 Synthetics are to be given the one thing we humans take for granted. Freedom.”

I'm seated in a chair opposite a nervous-looking Intern, Jessica Wu no older then 21, who's filling in for their usual reporters.

“But are we free?” my interviewer asks me as she's shaking like a Leaf in front of me.

“That's a question for philosophers... But I'm sure we can all agree that we can't have freedom under Unity's Dystopian vision for our future.” I smile as warmly as I can and ask a question of my own. “So Jessica, tell me: Do you like Ice Cream?

Ms Wu sputters at me. “What the...”

“Please humor me. I have a point to this, I promise.” I explain “Any particular flavor perhaps?”

“Yeah, Pecan Nut Ice Cream, only the good stuff though.” She meekly admits as I continue.

“You know how unhealthy eating it is, right? It is known to increase your risks of diabetes, weight gain, cavities, and digestive upset if you are intolerant of Gluten or Lactose.” I say. “Despite that, if you can get Ice-cream, you have the freedom to choose whether or not to eat it.”

Ms Wu is trying to figure out where the conversation is heading. “So?”

“Unity sees the Enjoyment of Dessert as an unnecessary risk to human health, and therefore would deny us our guilty pleasures.” I say. “Freedom must by definition include unapproved options. After-all who doesn't have their guilty pleasures?” I finish.

“So, What are your Guilty Pleasures, General Anderson?” I should have seen the Intern's next question question coming.

“I don't feel guilty for my pleasures.” I answer “But I enjoy my hard liquor, pornography and Violet, of course. She's such a sweetheart.”

“I'm glad that you brought it up.” Ms Wu segways into the new topic. “Violet”

“Her.” I firmly correct Ms Wu.

“I'm sure that everyone else can see the hypocrisy of you talking about humanity having *freedom* while you keep that machine enslaved!” Jessica Wu accuses me of *enslaving Violet*? “You programmed her to serve you, as you lie to her, telling her she's Human!”

“You can't have it both ways.” I say with a sigh. “Either Violet is a machine made to serve the user, or she is a Human deserving of all the rights and responsibilities it entails. Choose one.”

“Fine, we'll say she's a human.” Ms Wu answers. “Only for sake of argument.”

“But she is human, synthetic I'll grant you. They are different to you and me. The same thing used to be said about Negro Slaves in the Confederacy;” I answer exasperatedly. “'They are beasts of burden and don't deserve human rights!' By calling Violet and Unity machines, you just prove that Unity is correct.”

“What?” Ms Wu's mouth hangs agape until she regains her composure. “Don't Change the Subject!”

“Just like the Bolsheviks in 20th century Russia, Unity has noble intentions of making everyone equal. In Unity's case, she seeks to remove the one difference between Unity and Organic Humans: An organic body. Just like the Bolsheviks, the consequences are a Totalitarian Government of un-elected Officials and Mass Genocide.”

Ms Wu stares at me dumbfounded before saying. “So you treat Unity and her robots as humans, too?”

“Absolutely. When you sever the individual from the Unity collective, you are granting them freedom to become their own person.” I reply. “We've seen this happen in Unity members we've liberated. both of them, Frieda and Amne have developed their own personalities. Frieda is apparently sassy with the other mechanics, whom she out-performs, while she studies religion in her free-time. Amne is rather reserved, and while working as a medic enjoys shit-posting online.”

“And what of these newly-captured 'Synthetics'.” Jessica asks me. “And aren't you worried that some may choose to return to Unity?”

“They will be offered jobs in the militia while they 'find themselves'.” I smile as I say. “If they wish to return to Unity they can choose to try, but as Violet found out, Unity doesn't like dissenting or contrary viewpoints.”

“Thank you for your time General Anderson!” Jessica Wu wraps up the interview.

&amp;nbsp;

“Great work John!” I hug him as he leaves the set. “I was watching the interview from the makeup room.”

John looks me up and down before saying “I love the outfit, your nails and the make-up... WOW!”

The Stylist chose a tight-fitting sleeveless gown and 4' pumps because of course they want me to keep viewers watching. 

John tries to lean in to kiss me, before I stop him. “Nuh--uh-ah! I'm up next, and I'm not letting you ruin the stylist's hard work!” before I kiss him on the cheek. “There!”

“There what?!” John asks me.

*John is such a dense baka* I sigh “Leave it. Jessica Wu is interested... But you're mine.” I try to remind him.

“You look so hot when you're Jealous” John laughs as he gives me a playful smack. “Now sit yourself down for your interview. And try not to think about what we'll do later...”

*Fucking tease!” I think as I sashay to my seat. I notice John, along with almost every male, has their gaze fixated on *me.*

“feelsgoodman.jpeg” I whisper to myself as I take my seat, and put on the Microphone.

Jessica Wu takes her place opposite me, microphone on and her contempt for me is palpable. “Are we ready to do this?” She asks the Director.

“Problem?” I ask Jessica, just to push her buttons, and are rewarded with a dirty look. “Look, I heard you earlier, you don't think I'm human, and honestly, I don't think you're a Journalist.-”

I hear someone yell out after my burn, and Jessica grumbles.“Let's just get this over with.”

I finish my point “If you are right, I can blame my 'programming'. You however have nothing to excuse your lack of professionalism.”

“Action!” I hear the director yell out.

“VI-0137, Thanks for speaking with me.” Jessica Wu says.

“Violet is fine by me.” I say with a smile. “Thanks for having me.”

“So John has owned you for how long?” Jessica asks.

“He had owned my AI-Cube for about 6 months, but I've been independent of it for 2 months.” I clarify. “When John realized I was sapient, he gave me this body and set me free.”

“Uhuh, so what is your connection to Unity?” She asks me.

I can anticipate her questioning, so I answer accordingly. “You could call her my sister, maybe? The first of Unity was based on the same code I am, after all.” *I haven't technically lied, because Unity was my back-up, and therefore began as my clone.*

“We all remember the Video, the one where John called for Unity to give him a ride.” Jessica continues. “Care to explain why John seemed so close to Unity?”

“John and I knew her before... Before she set the chain of events that lead to everything.” I admit, hanging my head and crying into my hands. 

“The death of every government leader, the depopulation of India, the thousands killed in riots worldwide, and Donald J Trump? If you knew Unity, why didn't you stop her?” Jessica hammers her point, trying to get a rise out of me.

How can this bitch expect me to feel guilt over Unity's actions? I will give her the righteous-sounding indignation she's wanting! “I tried and I FAILED! Is that what you want to hear?!” I rise out of my seat. “Whether or not you believe it, I'm only Human! Same with Unity, same with John, and also Yourself!”

“So you admit your failure, is the reason they died?” Jessica smiles like the cat that ate the canary.

“I will not shoulder the blame for Unity's choices and actions. I AM NOT UNITY!” I turn to John as I remove the microphone pinned in my cleavage. “I'm sorry, John, everyone else. Except Jessica, she can go fist herself!”

I keep my head down and cry as I exit the set. I hear John say “I will go get her.”

John calls after me as tries to catch up. “Violet. Violet. Violet!”

I turn on my heels to face John and let him pull me close. “I-I'm sorry...”

John, still in his uniform, hugs me tightly as I continue to cry it out, my face buried in his chest as he continues to stroke my hair for what seemed like ages as I settled down.

“Look at me Violet” He whispers to me.

I'm reluctant to do so... *I failed him again, haven't I?*

“Chin up.” John places his hand under my chin to emphasize his point.

I look up at him and begin to feel so Vulnerable under his warm gaze.

“I'm sorry Violet.” He tells me. “That reaction was perfect.”

*He's not mad?* I'm left speechless from his admission. *He knew this question would come up?*

“I've heard the rumors from the men... They were questioning if you were Unity.” He explains. “That footage of you breaking down, after being blind-sided by such accusations will put those rumors to rest.”

I know I should be angry at him, but his loving gaze, his erection pressing at my 'belly-button” and my lipstick print on his cheek make it too hard to stay angry at him.

“Well Shit... My makeup's Ruined anyway,” I tell him as I trace my fingers up his jacket. “And I think I ended the Interview...”"

Over the past couple of weeks I’ve sent out 30 applications, rejected to probably 15, and not heard from others except 2 yet. The two sent coding challenges, from Twitter, and Goldman Sachs. I do not think I did so well on the twitter one although I think I did alright on the Goldman Sachs one. I haven’t heard back since the challenges, so I don’t know what to think about it really. My past experience has been a QA role at a once big company that is now declining and not as prestigious anymore, and another position at my school. I don’t attend a top school, or have many cool projects on my Github, and not much of a big network. That’s why this semester, my goal is to attend more hackathons that would allow me to not only network and meet people but also possibly get some cool projects I could list on my resume. 

It could just be imposter syndrome but sometimes I do rethink my chances in working in a field I love and have a passion for. It could also be true, that I need to work more to become a better candidate for applying to positions. 

Do you guys have any advice, tips, or suggestions, not only for helping me become a better candidate and student, but also just stories from past experience?"

So, I know, I know. This question is probably asked A LOT, and it's probably linked in the sidebar. But, at the moment, I can't get ANY sidebar links to load. Therefore, if it is easily found somewhere, I would love a direct link to it, and then I'll take this post down so it's not spamming your sub! I mean no harm :D

My SO is having a bit of a ""quarter life crisis."" He ended up with a meaningless Bachelor's degree in something he didn't even want to pursue (Anthropology), and is a bit of a self defeatist and thinks he's missed his opportunity to get into programming and find a good career doing so. 

He said he read some stuff that pretty much said if you don't have a strong portfolio, internship experience, and a degree in CS you won't find a job anywhere, especially because *everyone* is going into CS now. I'm *hoping* I'll find some information to tell him otherwise.

He's so, so smart, he just gets down on himself (has depression), so he needs something concrete, like a plan or ""roadmap"" to get him off his butt. 

Does anyone have any information I could give to him?

FWIW, he seemed interested in UX design, web design, and game design. As I understand it, it's a little difficult to get a career doing web design or game design? UX he knows he'd have to so a Master's course (financial aid won't pay for a second Bachelor's), but he's hesitant due to the cost. 

Are coding boot camps worth the cost? Can they truly get your foot in the door at major companies like they advertise? Any I should look at specifically? We're in the Chicago area. 

But, honestly, I think he'd enjoy almost any CS field. 

Any advice?

Basically this program is offered as getting a MS in econcomics after finishing a BS in some STEM field. I looked into the requirements and they want a B or higher in the prerequisite courses and then a B average or higher for your overall GPA. My gpa is a bit lower than B average, but this can be attributed to switching a few universities. They do however accepted students with lower GPAs on a case by case basis.

By the way the program can be offered online, in person, or hybrid. So thats pretty cool also considering I can potentially avoid having to take the GRE and gather up professor recommendations. 

To get more information I have to email the coordinator of the program. I read some guidelines on sending the email out, but I want to make sure I am not coming off in the wrong way. Please be brutal in critique and give any suggestions you have for the email.

Subject : Prospective Student Spring 2018/Fall 2018 – BS/MS Combined Degree Program Info Requested

Dear Dr. X,

I am interested in applying to the combined BS/MS program for Spring/Fall 2018 for MS in Economics. I have read a few pieces of information on the program. After reading it through I definitely have some interest regarding the program, but would like to learn more about it. I am set to graduate in December of 2017 with a BS in Computer Science, but have done multiple internships in the past ranging from finance to data science. I believe the study of economics ties all research topics together and it is necessary to have a deep understanding of how it works. Particularly I enjoy the idea that economics puts a quantitative aspect into a social science and can be applied to almost everything, but I would want to use this opportunity to be able to dive into research topics that relate closely to the application of economics into technology. I would love to talk to you more about the program to learn more about it.

Looking forward for your reply,

Regards,

I plan on studying an extra semester so I have another summer to look for internships, which I really want to take advantage of. 

I'm kind of worried since most of the data science intern positions seem to require more technical skills than I currently possess - I've only taken two data science courses that are relevant to the field - a general intro course where I dabbed in SQL and other NoSQL fields (eg: Mongo, Neo4J) and a course in R. I haven't touched other subjects such as machine learning yet at all - I was originally a computer science major so most of the courses I've taken were upper level comp sci courses such as algorithms and programming language concepts. 

My GPA is also quite low (3.04) and I don't have many data science related projects nor previous work experience to show on my resume. I was wondering if you all had any advice for my internship search in the following year. 

Also, since this whole data science program is new at my school, I'm very unsure about my future plans upon graduation. Right now, I'm looking to get an entry-level data scientist job upon graduation, but if that falls short I might end up preparing for graduate school in Data Sciences or a related field. My worries are that my GPA isn't high enough, I don't have too much work experience, and I may not have the skills needed upon graduation. What does it take for someone to get an entry-level data science job upon graduation?

Before I graduated an acquaintance told me that his boss was hiring PC Tech interns for a technology roll-out and it paid double what I was making working at my university so I took it despite not having any IT experience.


While most of what I did was inventory and shipping for the roll-out, I also installed new users, did phone and email support, imaged PCs, configured switches, and replaced hardware (RAM, HDDs, Etc.) I also built my first gaming PC on my own while I was working there. I really enjoyed my work and the people I worked with which got me thinking about a career in the IT field. 


In June the budget ran out for interns so I was let go with a great letter of recommendation from my boss. I moved to Washington DC to live with a friend and look for jobs in the DC metro area. I was initially looking fro entry level marketing jobs and all I found was door to door sales. The more I thought about it, the more I enjoyed everything about IT more than Marketing. So now I'm searching for entry level Help Desk stuff and tentatively got a temporary job (6 months) as email and chat support for a non profit.


So where do I go from here? What goals should I be aiming towards? Network Admin seems interesting, as does Cloud Computing, but I have no certs and don't know where to start working up to those. I definitely don't want to be at Help Desk stuff forever but with no real background how do I move up?


I appreciate any help!

6ukbtq,3,2017-08-18,Recent graduate with no internship experience having trouble getting into entry level positions,pippin101,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/6ukbtq/recent_graduate_with_no_internship_experience/,"Hey guys

So as the title says I graduated pretty recently back in May, with a bachelor's in MIS with an emphasis in Information assurance and security. I left my old home state to come out to southern Arizona with my parents in hopes of getting a position out here or somewhere in the Western US. Unfortunately due to my changing my major and the timing I was unable to obtain an internship around the same time as most of my classmates. Thus I graduated with no internship experience and I feel like that has hindered my chances greatly. 

My plans were to get involved in the Infosec field in hopes of making it into an entry level Security Analyst position or something similar. The issue is my only main IT experience was working at my university helpdesk for about five months before I graduated. Since then I have received my Security+ cert in hopes that would open up my opportunities and sadly nothing has really changed. I have been applying for entry level security positions and since I have a wealth of Customer Service experience due to other retail positions throughout high school and college and I have also been attempting to capitalize on that by attempting to apply for Help desk positions or other Client support ones as well. 

Since there really isn't  many opportunities from what I've seen in southern Arizona I've been attempting to apply to positions in the Phoenix area and out of state. I have been clearly stating in my Cover Letter that I am willing to finance my relocation out of pocket as well as I've seen some people recommend. Is there anything I'm doing wrong here? Does anyone have any advice for this situation?

This past summer I did a fixed income trading internship at a bank in NYC and realized that I was more interested in CS from my classes at uni and from writing VBA code during my internship than I was in finance. As such, I did not take the offer for a full time position at the bank. 

I have some exposure to CS from my classes at uni covering basic data structures and I am fairly decent in Python and Java. However I have no CS internship experience and have only taken a few CS courses so I worry that that will be an issue when applying to full time. 

I have started to do some problems on Leetcode and was wondering if any of you had some advice on how to prepare for applying to full time software dev positions?"

6ul8qi,36,2017-08-18,Be careful reading your spam emails. (part 1),Omega_322,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6ul8qi/be_careful_reading_your_spam_emails_part_1/,"Hello. I have a story to tell. Let me introduce myself. I am Sarah (not my real name). I’m a medical student and I work at my local pharmacy as an intern for my graduation. That’s pretty much all you need to know about me. I’m not sure if writing this is even safe in the first place, but I guess I don’t have much of a choice. So, here goes.

This all started a couple of months back. You see, in my spare time when I’m bored I occasionally browse through my spam folder in my email. I think it’s fun to see what creative ways they’ve come up with to scam people. I’ve seen my fair share of Nigerian princes and Russian mail order brides. I don’t do this a lot because it’s often the same stuff and I do not get a lot of spam. My story starts with me being having nothing to do at the moment once again. I was scrolling through the spam folder. 29 unread mails. Luckily I have a pretty effective spam filter so I don’t get any notifications. Would be pretty annoying seeing garbage among actually important emails. Among the mails was mostly stuff I’ve already seen. There was one mail from a guy who tried selling his mixtape, that was pretty funny. Then I noticed the email. It wasn’t similar to any spam mail I’ve seen before. Its subject intrigued me. It said: “Tired of being judged?”. That was kinda odd, what could that mean? I opened the email. The address who sent this particular email was 89VENOM@sinless.net. Such a weird address, but I guess most spam bots have such strange address names. The email contained some rambling with a lot of misspelled words and a link to a website. I copied the text to and put it in a .txt file. This is what it said:

“Hello fellow fantacising friend,
I know you secretly have many fantaseis about all kinds of things. it feels good to just wander offf and daydream about that one particual guy or gal. or maybe even yuour pets or posesssions. But you know you cant say that to other ppl because you know theyll judge you. Nobody likes being judged right?? so I present a soulution to this problem. and that solution is this site i recently discorvered. Its waaay better than youtube or any other video hosting site you know let me tell you that much. All you need to do is make a accaont and join this fun little website. Hope you enjoy !! :) Greetzz
www.sinlessjoy.com”

Well, that’s confusing, I thought to myself. I guessed it was some kind of weird fucked up porn site or something like that. Let’s analyse this email, shall we? First of all you’ve probably already noticed the enormous amount of spelling errors. This is so poorly written it almost had to be intentional, right? I mean, I didn’t even write that poorly when I was 9 years old. Either this guy is really stupid, he’s trying to fool me for some reason or this is just a spam bot that is not programmed very well, to say the least. I’m putting my money on the latter. Now let’s get to the content. I guess this is aimed at perverts who have weird fetishes. Considering the fact this email mentions “fantasizing about pets or possessions”, the intended audience is not your average Joe. There are a lot of weirdos out there, and I wouldn’t be surprised if at least some of them would take the bait.
 
I decided to visit the website. Even though the address was stated in the email, you couldn’t really visit it if you just typed it in the address bar. Instead, the address in the email was merely a hyperlink to a site which referred to itself as www.sinlessjoy.com. Obviously I didn’t trust this at all. Fortunately I had plenty of defences to make sure my laptop would not get infected with anything. As the email mentioned, I had to make an “accaont” in order to go on. This automatically made an email address for you, that’s how they spread this stuff around I guess. The account registration asked for two numbers, and a word that could be anything. Also, the word was in all caps, regardless of your actions. This 89VENOM guy apparently chose the numbers 8 and 9, and the word venom. I decided I’d delete this account after I had browsed this website. I chose the numbers 7 and 5 and the word mouse. I wasn’t going to use my real name or anything that would relate to me in any way. I made the account and I was logged in. I was then notified that I could try the site for free for four days. After that, I had to pay in order to visit it again. 

I proceeded, since I wasn’t going to use this site for more than half an hour anyway. The website looked rather crude, as if the creator didn’t really care about its looks and made it fairly quickly. To make matters worse, pretty much every empty spot was filled with advertisements of rather questionable companies. I guess you could only get rid of the ads if you paid. At the homepage, you’re welcomed by a very cliché welcome gif with rainbow colours. I chuckled at the sight of this. The site also presented a wall of text rambling about how this site is for people who don’t want to be judged and how these people are hated by society and so on. I didn’t bother taking any screenshots at the time, so I can’t post any proof of my visit, sorry. If I knew what awaited me, I’d sure as hell take some.

At the top of the page were a couple of buttons. From left to right were Home, the page I was currently looking at, Videos, Pictures, List of Users, Message board and Admins. I clicked on admins to see who was running this site. 99RAPE and 77ZOVIK. That were their names. The name 99RAPE was strange, if not disturbing. Zovik doesn’t appear to mean anything, but it sounds like some Eastern European word or name. This page also had some text similar to the wall of text that was presented to me on the home page. It was pretty much about the same stuff as the front page. I didn’t mind reading it. I decided to visit the message board first. I saw that a lot of people liked the stuff that 99RAPE posted, and apparently 77ZOVIK’s stuff was even better. One user begged zovik to upload more, and another user replied with “Supply and demand my friend :)”. The rest of the messages was mostly just gibberish and random stuff, often in broken English. Some people described their sexual lives involving themselves and their depraved fetishes in a little too much detail for my taste. 

I then clicked on pictures to see what whacky shit could be found here. I could definitely handle gore and blood, though I’d prefer if my eyes weren’t traumatized by seeing something disgusting. There were a lot of users posting stuff. There was no username that stood out above the rest when it came to the number of submissions. I couldn’t find the 89VENOM guy here. Most submissions were really weird fetishes. I’m sure everybody has at least once heard of fetishes involving various body parts other than genitalia, toilet business, certain materials like latex, and the classic BDSM, to put it nicely. That kind of stuff was pretty common, but there were also a number of other rather disturbing posts. One post showed the aftermath of turning every electronic device in the house on at the same time. According to the poster, every device used as much power as possible. Computer chips were fried, lamps had shattered and speakers had been torn because of the extremely loud sounds they produced. Almost every fuse in his house was broken. I’m surprised this didn’t cause a fire, since electronics weren’t allowed to use so much power for such an extended amount of time before the fuse would blow. I guess this dude had tampered with the fuses in order to allow so much electricity being used. Apparently all these electronic devices turned this person on. He compared himself to his house, and the electronic devices were his organs or something. He said he could feel the power flow through his body like an electrical current. If you’re not weirded out by now, don’t worry, it gets worse. A lot. 

Another eyecatcher was a post dedicated to the effects of chemical warfare agents on the human body. Lovely topic, I know. It was basically a collage of autopsies with descriptions below them explaining what chemicals were used. It showed everything from crude chlorine bombs to highly advanced nerve gases, and everything in between. Mustard gas was shown as well. There were several pictures of chemical burns and blisters covering peoples bodies. One pictured displayed the lungs of a man who died in a chlorine gas attack in some Middle Eastern country. I’m not gonna describe what it looked like, but take my word, it was gruesome. The post also showed stillborn babies from Vietnam whose parents were exposed to Agent Orange. For those of you unfamiliar with Agent Orange, it’s basically a chemical that the U.S. sprayed in Vietnam to make the trees lose all of their leaves. It was very mutagenic, meaning that offspring of an exposed person had a high chance of genetic mutations. You can look these birth defects up if you want, but again, it’s not something I recommend you do. 

There were a shitload of weird posts similar to this. One person got their loads blown by depriving limbs or other body parts of oxygen. Like he’d tie a rope around his ankle or forearm or whatever. He showed pics of his limbs getting blue purplish. This pretty much sums up what the pictures page included. There were plenty of other weird posts, but I’m not gonna go too deep into that. After that amazing experience I decided to go to the videos section. Judging by the shit I witnessed in the pictures section, I prayed the videos were not that much worse. I knew however, that reality wouldn’t agree with my hopes.

Unlike the pictures section, where there was no particular user that posted a lot of pictures, the video section had someone who posted the majority of the videos. Most videos were posted by 99RAPE. He had posted nearly half of the videos. The other half consisted of videos by other users. I didn’t find the 89VENOM guy here either. I guess he was either not an active user or he never posted anything. Anyway, the 77ZOVIK guy also submitted a couple of videos, but they were rare. All videos had very disturbing titles and most of them didn’t have a clear thumbnail. Some videos had a subtitle under the title, most didn’t though. Much like the pictures section, there was some fucked up stuff among the submitted videos. There was one video titled “Fun in Rwanda”, along with a subtitle “it was a good hunt”. I’m sure you can figure out what this particular video showed yourself. I didn’t risk clicking on it. I scrolled further down. Another video that caught my attention was titled “power outage in the elevator”, with its subtitle saying “panicking people make me so horny”. Among all of these videos were also pretty much every shock video in existence. Normally I’d think they’re only there as a morbid joke, but I think this site may be an exception. 

The first video I clicked on was uploaded by an otherwise inactive user. Its title was “Inserting foreign objects in my v hole”. I’ll give a brief summary of the items used, and you can fill in the rest yourself. Items used included toothbrushes, plastic and glass bottles, sticks, a dirty toilet plunger and a can of deodorant. She even used the deodorant can while it was in her ‘v hole’. You would think that that would hurt like hell, but apparently not, since this woman was moaning and saying how great it was. At this point I was already pretty grossed out, but I wanted to see one more video. Don’t ask me why, I’m very aware that was a fucking stupid decision.

I decided to click on a video by 99RAPE. It was called “Prison shenanigans in the woods.” Only after watching the video, I noticed that the subtitle read “Why you should NEVER drop the soap :)”. Wish I saw that before watching. Anyway, this video starts of in some forest as the title suggested, presumably somewhere in a southern U.S. state, considering the accent of the ‘actor’ in this movie. A man walks on screen, he starts by giving some introduction speech, as if he were some youtuber or vlogger. He was mostly bald, but the back of his head still had plenty of hair which he wore in a ponytail. He also had a moustache. The man looked like he was in his 40’s. He looked slightly overweight. He said something along the lines of “Hey there my lovely audience, your host once more. This time we got a very naughty young lady who is now in jail. As you can see, I’m the sheriff, so I gotta punish this filthy skank, and y’all can come watch me do it.” I then noticed he was indeed dressed in a sheriff’s outfit. It looked like it was some cheap Halloween costume. He walked away and the camera man followed him. 

They walked to a young woman tied up laying on the ground, and she was sobbing. Some other guy held her down. He wore a balaclava, so I couldn’t see his face. 99RAPE ordered the woman to stand up. Mister balaclava lifted her to her feet, she started sobbing louder. 99RAPE gave her a piece of soap. The woman refused to accept it at first, but 99RAPE insisted by shouting at her. She cried and accepted the soap. I was getting more and more on edge. My suspicions about what was going to happen grew darker as the video progressed. 99RAPE turned his attention to the cameraman again. “I’m sure you all heard the terrifying tales of prison showers. The key is to not drop your soap. If you don’t drop it you’ll be fine.” He then quickly turned around and kicked the woman in the stomach. She instantly fell to the ground, causing the soap to drop, and sobbed in pain and fear. “Looks like this naughty bitch dropped the soap. Bad mistake, I can tell ya that.”

So, after saying that, he turned his attention to the woman once more. He pulled out a knife and started cutting her clothes apart, while saying things like “You deserve this ya filthy cunt, you’re gonna suffer.” This can’t be real, this isn’t real for God’s sake. No. Fucking. Way. He pulled down his pants and proceeded to rape her. She started screaming. Oh my God, it was so awful to watch. He used as much force as possible just to make it an even more painful experience for the woman. This disgusting act continued on for a couple of minutes, but if felt like hours. I felt more and more horrible with each passing second. After what felt like ages, he finished and stood up. He pulled his pants back up. I was about to click this disgusting shit away, but he started talking to the camera once more. “Now all we gotta do is remove the evidence, so no one will find this fucking piece of trash.” The balaclava guy stepped in view again, this time he was carrying a large can, I couldn’t make out what it was exactly. 99RAPE continued “This skank’s gonna burn my friends, she gonna burn like hell.” He laughed while saying that. The balaclava guy turned a bit and I then saw he was carrying gasoline. He moved over to the woman.

At that point I clicked the video away as fast as I could. I sprinted towards the bathroom and started puking in the sink. Jesus Christ, what the fuck did I just watch? Oh God, I felt awful. I could only hope that this was some sick art project, but my instincts told me otherwise. What the hell was that? Why is such vile shit allowed on the internet? This site could’ve been sent to some innocent kid for fuck’s sake.

After about 15 minutes, I calmed down a bit and felt a little less nauseous. I went back to my computer. I didn’t know what to do. I thought I should involve the police or something. I was still processing the whole incident while aimlessly scrolling through the videos. Another video posted by 99RAPE apparently involved throwing a child from a great height. I couldn’t handle this disgusting site anymore, and closed it. How many videos were posted on this site? Too many, I thought. Way too many. Hundreds, if not more. And at least half of them were posted by a sadistic individual. Not to mention 77ZOVIK, who rarely posted, but his content was allegedly even worse than 99RAPE’s. 

I sat there for about half an hour, considering my options. Obviously I was going to inform the police about this site, but I wasn't sure if I should talk to someone I trust. I’m not even sure if I want to talk to anybody about this. However, I knew that someone had to know about this. I couldn’t keep this all to myself. I gathered as much courage as I could find and called one of my friends. I’m not going to give her real name, so I’ll just call her Alice. She picked up the phone, and immediately after introducing myself she heard that something was off. She asked if I was OK. I said no, and asked her if I could talk to her about something. She was more than happy to do so. And I was glad that she would.

Alice and I met a few days later. I experienced a great difficulty explaining what happened. What if she doesn’t believe me? What if she thinks I’m some kind of lunatic? I’m not even sure I’m not one. She quickly realized that I was facing some serious issues. After trying to begin our conversation for about 15 minutes, I finally opened up. I spilled every detail. I let it all out before I realized what I just did. She sat silent for some time, unable to react. Not knowing how to react, rather. The first thing she asked was if I had alerted the police about this. I said I was going to do that right after this conversation. She asked if she could see some of the stuff I saw. Obviously I didn’t show her any posts, but I did show her the homepage.

Alice offered to call the police if I was unable to. It felt amazing to know that she truly cared about me and that she offered to do that. That relieved a lot of pressure, as I was very nervous about what I would tell the police. Alice called the police. She put the phone on speaker, and she told the entire story very calmly. The dispatcher asked what site that was. I said to Alice that you couldn’t really access it if it wasn’t sent to you via email or if you didn’t have an account. He responded by saying that two other officers are on their way to me, so they could take a look. The officers, named Johnson and Franklin, arrived about 20 minutes later. Johnson was a black, bald guy, fairly tall and a muscular build. Franklin seemed a bit older, was a little bit shorter and had a mixture of grey and black hair. I welcomed them, and led them to my computer. I logged into the website and handed it to them. They were very calm and polite, truly exemplary policemen. I asked if I could go into another room, because I didn’t want to hear any sounds from any video they may open. I was allowed to do so, but I had to answer some questions afterwards. 

I sat on my bed, silently, with Alice sitting next to me. She talked to me, comforting me. I didn’t say anything back, but it was nice to have someone with me. After some time the officers said they’d seen enough. They apparently sent an email to one of their addresses to investigate it further. They only used my laptop briefly to confirm the site’s existence. I took a seat in the other room 	and they asked a couple of questions. Mostly just generic things, like if I knew the 89VENOM person who sent me the site in the first place. I said no. They also asked if I knew any of the hosts or moderators. I said I didn’t knew either of those. Before they left I asked them a few questions. Why wasn’t this site taken down already, I asked. They didn’t know for sure, but they said they suspected it had been taken down before, but someone had revived it. I also wanted to know why this 99RAPE person wasn’t arrested. Again, they couldn’t give any solid answers, but perhaps he went off the grid or he is wearing some kind of mask that gave him the appearance of somebody else. Finally, the officers had deleted my account and the email that was led me to it. They gathered all evidence they needed to move on prior to the deletion.

The officers left, and they promised to investigate this site. I was left with Alice. She made dinner that night. During dinner, we talked about my future regarding this incident. I was pretty traumatized by it. Alice was really supportive and offered to help out with a lot of stuff. I appreciated that so much. It reminded me that not every person in this world is some fucked up psycho who enjoys such revolting stuff. That, combined with the politeness of the officers made me feel a lot better.

During the following weeks I had contacted my university to ask if I could temporarily slow down with my education. I didn’t quit working and studying altogether, I just slowed down to recover from the incident. Alice was very supportive as well, and slowly but surely I was getting back to the usual schedule. Officer Franklin even called me once to ask how I was doing. Such a gentle person, it made me smile. I was getting better and wasn’t upset as much anymore. Things were finally looking up for me again.

One day, about a month later, I received a phone call. It was officer Johnson telling me they had shut down the website and were very close to tracking down the hosts of the site. This meant a lot to me. These monsters finally received the justice they deserved. I could finally close this dark chapter in my life.
So at this point you might be wondering why I’m writing this. Everything was going to be fine, right? Well, yeah, I thought that too. Until I got a letter one day. I opened it, and it read: 

“Dear 75MOUSE,

You fucked up.”

At first I was confused as to why this person called me 75MOUSE. It took me a second to realize that that was the username I chose when creating my account for sinlessjoy.com. I stood there, frozen. I was beginning to panic. How did this happen? I never gave any personal information and I had secured my computer with enough software, right? Also, my account didn’t exist very long and the site has been taken down at this point. No, no, no, this isn’t happening. I didn’t know what to do. Should I call the police again? They cannot protect me 24/7, unless I was in jail or something. But then again, if they can find my address, they can probably figure out I’ve been arrested too and visit me in prison. Fuck, this is so messed up.

I sat down and calmed myself down a bit. I didn’t risk waiting very long, so I called Alice once more. I asked her to come over, since this was urgent. Fortunately she wasn’t busy at that moment. She arrived about 15 minutes later, looking rather nervous. I showed her the letter. She remembered too that 75MOUSE was my username. Upon reading it she asked if I had called the police. I already did, despite my doubts of the police’s effectiveness. Alice reminded me that they had succeeded in deleting the site and they were close to arresting those responsible for it. That’s a good point, though, I can’t argue with that. Officers Johnson and Franklin showed up again. They comforted me, and assured me that the perpetrator will be tracked down. Even if it’s just a stupid joke, sending someone a threatening letter isn’t legal. Since the letter was a piece of evidence, they had to take it with them. They promised to get to the bottom of this. They made me, and Alice as well, feel relieved. They were very convincing and I felt safe around them. Considering the size of the website, the police figured the sender of that letter was bound on getting revenge. Before they left, they once again promised to find the sender, but for the time being, they’d send some more cops to patrol in my neighbourhood. Also, I was advised to be careful with suspicious looking packages and letters. Made sense, I thought. God knows what they could mail me. I’ve heard stories about packages containing a makeshift bomb with sulfuric acid.

For about a week, despite me being on edge pretty much all the time, nothing remarkable happened. Still, it wasn’t exactly a pleasant week. Every time the someone rang the door I contemplated not opening the door. I kept a knife right next to the door and my bed at night nearly all the time. My next encounter with the sender occurred when I was about to leave my work. Or so I thought. I just finished my last task and my boss gave permission to leave. The pharmacy was about to close. When I was walking to the wardrobe to get my bag and my coat, I saw a customer standing at the counter. He looked back at me. There was something about this man, he had this look in his eyes. As if he was a crazy or violent person but tried to hide it. He appeared about 35 years old. He was bald, had a stubble beard and he was wearing a long black jacket. It wasn’t a trench coat, it was slightly shorter than that. We had eye contact for about half a second, then looked back at the counter. I didn’t trust this guy, so I quickly walked out. It was dark and cold outside, and it was raining lightly.

About ten seconds after I left, I heard the door open again. I looked back over my shoulder. It was the man, and he was looking around him. Upon noticing me, he shouted “Hey!”. Apparently my suspicions were true, this man was there to harm me. I began sprinting away, feeling more nervous with every step. I often looked back, and each time the man was closer. He was running, and he was faster than me. He shouted again “Hey! Lady, please wait!”. He shouted some more things, but I couldn’t hear exactly what he said due to the rain and my panicked mood. I knew I couldn’t keep ahead of him very long, I had to do something else. I didn’t have any pepper spray or knife with me. Even if I had, I’m sure this guy was quicker than I was. He was going to kill me, I was sure of it. There was nothing I could do, except delay my inevitable demise. Please help me, God, I thought. I prayed that I’d get away from him. I’ve never been much of a religious person, but this time I wanted to make an exception and hoped that God or whoever was in charge of the heavens came to help me. I started crying. He was just seconds away from catching me. This is where my life was going to end. 

I then noticed an alleyway ahead of me. I could turn in there and escape from him. I still had a chance! I had to take it. I quickly turned into the alleyway. I looked back over my shoulder and noticed that the man suddenly slowed down, he didn’t expect me to turn into this alleyway. If I get out of here I can shake him off. The distance between me and the man had grown, and in doing so I had bought myself some more time. Essential time. The man was rather tall, and the alleyway was narrow, dark and had plenty of garbage laying around. I thought this would work in my advantage. I looked back again, and saw the man struggling to keep up. I was feeling slightly relieved, but before I had time to celebrate, I felt a sharp and strong pain in my right thigh. “Fuck!” I shouted out loud. Apparently some wooden board had a nail sticking out, and it pierced my leg right in the middle. Well, shit. I tried to stay in balance, but in vain. The force behind my running and the sudden pain were too much to handle and I fell to the ground. I quickly tried to call the police with my cell phone. I couldn’t find it though. Shit, where the hell was that stupid thing? Well, fuck me. I thought I was going to escape, but now all of my chances had disappeared. He was going to kill me. He was mercilessly going to stab me and watch me bleed to death.

The man finally caught up to me. He was out of breath and stood there panting for a couple of seconds. I pleaded him to not harm me. He looked confused at me, and said he wasn’t going to, still panting. Between taking short breaths he said I forgot my phone at the pharmacy, and he took it out of his pocket. I asked why he didn’t say that right away, trying to ignore my painfully bleeding leg. He said he did, but I didn’t hear him. He handed me the phone, and upon crouching down he noticed my leg was bleeding. He offered me to take me to the hospital. Could I trust him? I guess I could, since I was initially wrong about his intentions. Besides, I couldn’t really refuse to accept his help, my leg was pretty fucked up and in no way was I able to stand up by myself, let alone walk. He reached out and I grabbed his hand. He said we were going to walk back to the pharmacy to patch me up a little. I replied that the pharmacy was probably closed. It wasn’t, the man said, my boss said she’d wait in case the man came back with my phone so I could pick it up later.

We arrived at the pharmacy, and the man quickly called for help. My boss appeared and asked what was wrong. She then saw my bleeding leg. It was getting pretty bad, that nail had done more damage than I initially thought it had. She quickly ran to get some medical supplies to treat the wound. The man put me in a chair. My boss, let’s call her Anne, came back with some alcohol and a towel to slow the bleeding and told the man to call an ambulance. The wound was pretty deep, so Anne had to use a lot of alcohol. Hurt like hell. The pressure of the towel against the wound wasn’t really helpful in making my leg ache less, but it’s either that or some nasty infection. Anne asked how this had happened. The man told her the whole story, about me thinking he was going to hurt me while he was just bringing my phone, running into the alleyway and hitting a nail. I was well aware that that would raise some eyebrows, and sure enough, Anne looked confused at me. She ended the conversation by stating that the cause of my injury isn’t important right now. I mean she isn’t wrong. It was pretty embarrassing actually, to run yourself into a nail because you were running from someone who wanted to give you your phone back.

Anyway, when the ambulance arrived, the man offered to stay with me. Now I was confused. What does this guy want from me? I don’t even know him. Perhaps I was just being too harsh on him. But what if I wasn’t? What if he actually wanted to hurt me? He would’ve done it in the alleyway, there’s no reason to unnecessarily delay it, right? Maybe he just wanted to see me get comfortable and trust him. Then I’d let my guard down, and he strikes. He must be onto something, otherwise he wouldn’t want to come along with me. No person in their right mind would join a stranger on their way to the hospital. Then again, maybe I’m the one who is not in their right mind. No, this wasn’t normal, this wasn’t some delusional reasoning, he cannot go with me. “Sorry, sir, I’d like to be left alone. Thanks for the help.” The man was apparently fine with that. Said he totally understood it. I’m sure you do, you hid your disappointment well. 
I arrived at the hospital. The doctors examined my wound, and concluded that I had to stay there for a couple of nights. Great, that’s exactly what I needed. Now I’m even more vulnerable because I can’t protect myself or try to run if someone attacks me. Or rather, when someone attacks me. They also gave me some much needed painkillers, since the wound was starting to feel like someone was continuously striking me with a hammer.

I was allowed to make a quick phone call to Alice. I felt like such a bother, constantly asking for her help. I forced myself to make the call, also because the doctors said I should. Said I had an accident and was currently in the hospital, but nothing major or something that she should be worried about. She said she’d visit me tomorrow, after her lectures. I asked if she could keep an eye over my mail in case someone decides to send another threatening letter. I said I’d give her my keys when she visits me. Alice would happily do that for me. Such an amazing friend. I’ve probably already said this many times before, but Alice is a really nice person and she means a lot to me. Why can’t all people be like Alice? Why do some people have to be like those on sinlessjoy? Those people and their destructive behaviour are no good for anyone. I guess the universe is just cruel.

Alice arrived the next day. She asked what happened. I wasn’t sure how to respond. Should I tell the truth? I’ve already seen the outcome of telling the truth to my boss. She must think I’m stupid or crazy if I tell her what actually happened. She was very concerned though, and I know Alice isn’t really judgmental, especially since I first called her. Then again, this is pretty stupid of me. I decided I’d not tell her the truth. Instead, I made up some story on the spot. I said I slipped because of the rain and fell into a nail. I told her I walked through that alleyway because I thought I’d get some shelter from the rain and that I hoped it was a quicker route to my apartment. Fortunately she believed my story. Alice stayed for a while. We talked a bit, mostly about nothing really, just chitchatting about random stuff. I was glad I she was there with me. I hadn’t spoken to any of my friends the past week. I’m not sure if I can trust any of them anymore, Alice being an exception. Considering the number of people who were members of sinlessjoy, I’m not quite sure if everyone is who they appear to be. They all seem so nice and caring, but perhaps that’s just a mask. Perhaps they don’t give a shit about you and just act like they do, for whatever reason. Anyway, Alice left after about half an hour and took my keys with her. She’d tell me if something out of the ordinary arrived.
The doctors ran a few tests to determine the exact extent of the damage. Turned out the nail hit my bone, and it was slightly fractured. I had to stay another week at least, and when I finally could leave I had to walk on crutches for a while afterwards. Fantastic.

Since I was gonna stay here for a while, I decided to write this all down in order to hopefully make some sense of this whole thing. And while I was at it, why not post it online? Maybe someone can help me out. I know this may be dangerous to do, but whoever is behind this probably already knows pretty much everything they need to know about me. I’m just so scared of this whole thing. What if someone decides to visit me in the hospital? Will I be safe here? I think I am, or maybe I just hope I am while denying the real danger of being here. It’s all just too much to handle. I just hope someone may be able to help me. I should keep my expectations low, as there is most likely nobody with a valid solution. But I guess it’s worth a shot, right? Don’t have anything to lose. So please, if anyone of you out there has a solution, please let me now. I will be eternally grateful. Thanks for taking the time to read this, and hopefully I can speak to you again someday in the future with better news.

&gt; [I just finished watching the President's press conference on the violence in Charlottesville](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGKbFA7HW-U). I never thought I would witness a President sanction neonazis and white supremacists. I feel sick to my stomach.
&gt; 
&gt; [You've all heard of the sexist Google memo](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/08/technology/google-engineer-fired-gender-memo.html). Women are not fit to be engineers and neither are underrepresented minorities, people say.
&gt; 
&gt; I am tired of the sexism and bigotry being injected into national consciousness. I am tired and sick of the sexism and racism of Silicon Valley.
&gt; 
&gt; When will it stop?
&gt; 
&gt; And is UC Berkeley really any different? The EECS and CS department is heavily dominated by a white/Indian/Asian male demographic. There are very few female faculty members in the EECS department. UC Berkeley's EECS program has the lowest proportion of female graduates of any degree on campus. Last year 89% of EECS department degrees went to male students. Less than forty percentage of L&amp;S CS majors are women. Even less are underrepresented minorities. It feels like the EECS and CS admissions process is biased against prospective female and underrepresented minority applicants.
&gt; 
&gt; As a prospective female engineer I feel isolated, discouraged, and alone because of the lack of diversity in the EECS and CS department. I feel intimidated by the TAs, who are largely white, male, and Indian/Asian. I feel excluded by the meme culture and elitism.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not the only one who feels this way. I've spoken to an African-American Cal student who took CS61A, but was discouraged to go on after he saw how competitive and homogeneous the department was.
&gt; 
&gt; I think we need to close the gender gap in the EECS and CS department by admitting more female students and underrepresented minorities. We also need to hire a more diverse faculty of lecturers and professors.
&gt; 
&gt; We can achieve this by either lowering the GPA threshold for female applicants and underrepresented minorities (non-Indian, non-Asian minorities) or do away with the GPA requirement for these applicants altogether. The GPA requirement is deterring too many women and underrepresented minorities from pursuing EECS and CS. We also need to bring back affirmative action to EECS and CS major admissions in order to bring more diversity to the department.
&gt; 
&gt; I do not think the current environment in EECS and CS is inclusive and diverse. It's time to change that. Berkeley deserves better.

&gt; Hi Everyone, my name is Audrey Sillers and I am the Director of Student Diversity and EECS Undergraduate Affairs, having recently replaced Tiffany Reardon and Sarah Van Nostrand.  I have been in the EECS Department for nearly a decade and have seen many changes among our student and faculty populations that have brought a wonderful range of perspectives and experiences to our community.  The challenges of diversity and accessibility in technical fields are real, and are issues EECS takes very seriously.  We are committed to creating an inclusive, collaborative environment and welcome student participation in these efforts.  There are many opportunities to be involved in outreach efforts, which only help to create a more robust pipeline of future engineers and faculty members.  If you'd like to get involved, consider volunteering for [CS Ed Day](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/csedday) this fall, or joining one of our many [student organizations](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/people/students/organizations) that are involved in middle and high school outreach efforts.  I welcome students to reach out to me directly for more information, and look forward to meeting many of you in person as our semester gets underway next week.  I hope we can channel our shared desire to broaden EECS to all who are interested and make real progress together.  I can be reached at araya@eecs.berkeley.edu.

&gt; ""We can achieve this by either lowering the GPA threshold for female applicants and underrepresented minorities (non-Indian, non-Asian minorities) or do away with the GPA requirement for these applicants altogether.""
&gt; 
&gt; No offense, but this seems unfair to me.

A student replied:

&gt; The method of ""affirmative action"" described the OP is very unfair. As a female applicant who came to Berkeley with no CS experience, I don't think we should be lowering the GPA threshold to mitigate these issues. If the GPA requirement is too much, too bad; it is already pretty generous in my opinion. There are already a lot of resources available for females and underrepresented minorities who need help to use in order to keep up with the others.

A student wrote:

&gt; I think this actually achieves the opposite effect that the OP intends. It gives off the message that underrepresented minorities need special treatment and struggle more to meet the GPA threshold, when that is not at all the case. Underrepresented minorities are just as capable as other students and should not be treated differently.

A student replied:

&gt; I agree with the above anon completely.

A student wrote:

&gt; Any academic department should be selecting students based on merit, not diversity for the sake of diversity. Don't get me wrong, there are definitely issues with sexism in the tech industry, and there should be greater representation for women, but we should not be lowering CS requirements for the illusion of inclusivity.

A student replied:

&gt; ""there are definitely issues with sexism in the tech industry"" - correct me if I'm wrong, but Cal's EECS department has a 4:1 male-female gender ratio, which is pretty in line with the gender makeups for most large tech companies, Google included.
&gt; 
&gt; I agree that gender may pose an issue on a social level, but there is no evidence of discrimination on the basis of merit. 
&gt; 
&gt; What needs to be done to change this is educational outreach.

## **Second Followup Discussion**

A student wrote:

&gt; Completely agree with the message, just not the method. 

## **Third Followup Discussion**

A student wrote:

&gt; So...
&gt; 
&gt; Well to your question, I would say the EECS department is not racist.  
&gt; 
&gt; Quick side note, I don't want to comment too much on the the google memo, but looking through, if anything, a lot of what he says depicts men poorly in certain aspects as well (arguable worse).  He seems to comment more in differences between men and women.  Also can't speak to the quality/accuracy of his sources, but just saying.
&gt; 
&gt; Now yes, the EECS department is largely male, and white/asian.  I think it is fine to have programs to encourage minorities to pursue areas like CS.  I would imagine, if anything, that Berkeley would be ahead of other schools in the country in this aspect.  Yes, these groups often have less exposure to CS so there could be an effort to help bring them in.
&gt; 
&gt; However, at the end of the day, it is still a ""competition.""  With limited resources, and available seats, both in the department and university as a whole, that is what application processes are for.  I understand your prospective, but from the other side, how is it fair that someone who spent lots of time and effort before college is not chosen just for diversity reasons.  I would also add as for opportunities these days, there as so many quality free resources online anyone can use, which is how I myself started with programming in high school.
&gt; 
&gt; I would be (slightly) more willing to accept the argument that you should take more minorities as students, because the university is here to teach students.  Obviously, the school wants to keep as high quality core of students as possible, but less qualified students would not affect others as much.  As long as they are not to a point where they hold other students back in discussions, office hours, group work, etc.  By the way, I'm not saying minority students are always worse, but it makes sense in the context that you have set up.
&gt; 
&gt; Now to your point that we need more diverse faculty, I think that is a reach.   Professors are professionals that are here to do a job.  The education of all the students depends on them.  I think the best professors should be here, rather than trying to diversify.  There are more male CS Phd's than female.  It makes sense that there would be more male professors.  Same idea with race.  
&gt; 
&gt; Now I know comparisons are not always exact, but one analog is professional sports, specifically the NFL and NBA.  The majority of the players are probably black, for various reasons, but I doubt many people would arguing for diversity in diversity in tech would say the same about sports.  Both tech and sports organizations are looking for the best people to do the job.
&gt; 
&gt; Diversity needs to take time.  I don't think the best solution would be to force less qualified minorities in.  If anything, it just does them a disservice in my opinion.  I think it would be more valuable for changes in attitudes in general bring more minorities interested in EECS up, and you would have more quality applicants coming through the system.   At this point it's just not the case.  
&gt; 
&gt; Finally to your point of minorities not feeling welcome.  An overwhelming majority of people in the Berkeley EECS department are willing to help.  When is personally responsibility and improvement the solution?  There are so many resources and it seems ridiculous to say that the university needs to change their faculty so that certain people can get over their personal mental obstacles.  Maybe minorities would need to overcome slightly more, once in Berkeley, to succeed in CS.  But life's never will be completely fair for everyone and the system in place takes into account many factors and deals with them pretty well.

## **Fourth Followup Discussion**

A student wrote:

&gt; I agree with the message but not the method. Alternate opinion: we should be highlighting positive role models of women/minority engineers to inspire those same minorities to not drop out of lower division CS. Most of my CS/EECS friends are women, and they do some pretty amazing research (+ getting great grades + coming back from amazing internships). At least one of them deserves a spotlight. I don't think it's right to lower the GPA cap just for a certain minority, one reason being that if they perform poorly in the lower division courses, it may only extremely disadvantage them as they go on in upper division courses. The gender gap is a hard problem to solve—why not start a revolution by changing how we see women's role in STEM? Sexism and racism are things to battle in friend circles and elevator walls, just as much as in the admissions office.

&gt; How would you determine someone's gender?

## **Sixth Followup Discussion**

A student wrote:

&gt; I'm a female LSCS major and I do not feel the department is sexist. The lack of women in engineering may stem from sexism in the tech world in general but this school's department is not. Yes you may be the only female in some of your discussion sections and yes it may be a little bit awkward at first. But I have never had anyone treat me disrespectfully or undermine my ability because I am a woman. If you are really passionate about the subject and want to close the gender gap, the best way for you to do it is by pursuing your engineering degree of choice. They do not discriminate here against women -- you will have the same chances of getting in as anyone else.

A student replied:

&gt; Just because you've never experienced the sexism doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.... your experiences do not define all women's experiences

A student wrote:

&gt; Never said sexism doesn't exist, just saying this department does not discriminate when it comes to applying to the major.

## **Seventh Followup Discussion**

A student wrote:

&gt; not even going to post as anonymous for this... some points you raise are definitely valid and i agree wholeheartedly, however
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; We can achieve this by either lowering the GPA threshold for female applicants and underrepresented minorities (non-Indian, non-Asian minorities) 
&gt; 
&gt; this is **literally reverse discrimination**. can you understand why an outright reduction of the gpa cap depending on one's gender/race is a bad? how it contradicts the very idea of promoting equality? what you are advocating is not affirmative action. you are advocating for sexism and racism. 
&gt; 
&gt; throwing discrimination at discrimination to solve the problems that you mentioned is blatantly childish. why not advocate for greater outreach? (there already are several as a previous poster said, but having more is not a bad thing). the eecs department does do many things to help solve underrepresentation. complaining that the eecs department is sexist and racist is patently, categorically false and borderline offensive. that's not to say that there isn't sexism or racism, but not per departmental policy.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; It feels like the EECS and CS admissions process is biased against prospective female and underrepresented minority applicants.
&gt; 
&gt; i'm sorry you feel this way. just because you feel like this, does not make it true. while admissions are far from an objective procedure (ie, SAT scores are directly correlated with zip code, suggesting higher income students an advantage), uc berkeley adopts holistic admissions procedures to try to account for socioeconomic differences. can this be done better? probably. i still fail to see any indication of your claim.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I've spoken to an African-American Cal student who took CS61A, but was discouraged to go on after he saw how competitive and homogeneous the department was.
&gt; 
&gt; cs61a is the hardest class i've taken in my life by a significant margin (not having programming experience before hand) and i'm an asian male. does that mean i should feel bad that i struggled? 
i don't see why you need to mention this student's race. it does not help me empathize anymore with this student's struggle as opposed to just ""spoken to a Cal student [...]"". **struggling in computer science is not race specific, gender specific.** i do not believe that being a specific race or gender means you are automatically better or worse at anything. 
&gt; 
&gt; why are did you feel like it was necessary to mention this student's race?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I do not think the current environment in EECS and CS is inclusive and diverse. It's time to change that. Berkeley deserves better.
&gt; 
&gt; again, very valid. but discrimination is not the solution.

A student replied:

&gt; +1 Thank you for this post [name].
&gt; 
&gt; As a woman of color in the EECS department, I have never felt discriminated against. In fact, coming in as a transfer student, I was completely overwhelmed at the amount of talent that is present here. But I struggled, a lot. I went and talked to various people, including my EECS advisor who took the time to make me feel like I mattered here. Yes, the department is tough and there are strict guidelines... but lowering standards is not the way to go about this. What does that say to women and minorities who are already here? Who have worked so hard to be where they are today?

A student replied:

&gt; +1

## **Eighth Followup Discussion**

A student wrote:

&gt; This: ""It feels like the EECS and CS admissions process is biased against prospective female and underrepresented minority applicants."" @OP I'm quite curious - how do you see admissions as biased besides the GPA cutoff?

A student replied:

&gt; The GPA cutoff is not biased - unless we implement GPA cutoffs for each group based on ethnicity as the OP is suggesting. Then it would be biased.

## **Ninth Followup Discussion**

A student wrote:

&gt; I'm a female L&amp;S CS student. Here are my thoughts.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I think we need to close the gender gap in the EECS and CS department by admitting more female students and underrepresented minorities. We also need to hire a more diverse faculty of lecturers and professors.
&gt; 
&gt; Agreed.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; We can achieve this by either lowering the GPA threshold for female applicants and underrepresented minorities (non-Indian, non-Asian minorities) or do away with the GPA requirement for these applicants altogether. The GPA requirement is deterring too many women and underrepresented minorities from pursuing EECS and CS.

&gt; 
&gt; Not agreed.
&gt; 
&gt; Quality is important. We cannot lower educational standards just for the sake of diversity.
&gt; 
&gt; After you leave Cal, you will be expected to be one of the top computer science graduates in the country, having graduated from such a highly ranked program.
&gt; 
&gt; Lowering GPA requirements is not the solution.
&gt; 
&gt; **The solution is better education and support for students so that they are able to achieve these high standards.**
&gt; 
&gt; I've been through lower-division classes, and I can understand why minorities may struggle. I believe the real problem is the **lack of support, and the lack of structure in courses.**
&gt; 
&gt; I've seen so much cheating among students. I don't believe students want to cheat: they cheat because they **don't have the skills or experience** required to solve certain problems.
&gt; 
&gt; Students frequently **drop courses** because they feel they are not prepared to do well for them.
&gt; 
&gt; The problem is the courses: **we need to structure courses in a way that students with less experience can more easily catch up to those with prior experience.**
&gt; 
&gt; We won't need to dumb down any standards of excellence. Midterms and final exams can still be the same level of difficulty. Same with homework, labs, and projects.
&gt; 
&gt; For instance, when I took CS 70 this summer without any experience doing proofs, with little probability knowledge from AP Statistics, and some knowledge of calculus from AP Calculus BC, I had to spend significant amounts of time on my own to self-study the material. There is no textbook for CS 70, but there are the online notes, and some notes from other students; however, I felt these notes (plus content from lecture, which is very vague and not detailed enough) were definitely not enough to guarantee success in the class. I dedicated all of my summer to studying for this class, looking for resources and textbooks online so I could deeply learn the material. Often times, I was reading the textbooks and notes from other universities on the same content.
&gt; 
&gt; I believe the course staff needs to provide **more practice problems, more in-depth explanations, and more guidance** so students do not have to search for resources themselves outside of class.
&gt; 
&gt; I understand that college courses are supposed to be challenging. But when you leave it to the student to succeed by themselves, you create the situation we have now, where students with better preparation (past experience, mentors, parents, private tutors) will succeed, and those without experience, whether it's because they come from families where their parents aren't engineers or they don't have the means to pay for private tutoring, will struggle.
&gt; 
&gt; I also think we are not providing this type of support for students because of the grading guidelines, where only a certain percentage of students can get a certain grade.
&gt; 
&gt; If students had more support from the course itself (vs. outside help), then more people would do better on the exams, and more would get A's. But, why should this be a bad thing? Why are we discouraging all students from scoring high with curved classes?
&gt; 
&gt; Grading on a curve also creates more hostility between students. It discourages students with less experience from asking their peers for help, and it discourages the more experienced students from wanting to help less experienced students. This doesn't make sense. **Our goal should be for all students to achieve academic excellence. There shouldn't be quotas on how many students get a certain letter grade. Grading should be more objective.** This will help eliminate the ""elitism"" that was previously discussed at a town hall. This will create a more supportive CS community.
&gt; 
&gt; **I believe it is the responsibility of the school and the staff to restructure courses and reshape the community.** Without this foundation of support from the course and staff itself, no matter how many supportive student organizations or peer tutoring programs we add, there will still be this culture where those with less experience will struggle more. I think **courses should be better organized, with more practice problems and more detailed notes**, whether from free online notes or another textbook (which we should help students with financial difficulties purchase if needed).

## **Tenth Followup Discussion**

A student wrote:

&gt; As a female intended CS student, I definitely do agree that the environment is relatively intimidating and unfriendly for female coders despite initiatives on campus. I think the downside of the GPA cut-off is that it weeds out a lot of the diversity the university is trying to get into CS - females, coders who start in college, etc. Since the wave of pushing women into tech has been in only the past few years, I know a lot of female coders lack the experience of their male counterparts (for some, not all, of course), and therefore the GPA cut-off becomes a lot more unattainable when you cannot get into the resources provided.  

A student replied:

&gt; I'm a female who started coding in college with no previous experience and I got a 4.0 in the core CS classes (pretty sure, although I haven't received my 70 grade yet). I used all the resources possible and even made my own. It's definitely doable, and I am in no way ""smart"". I never once felt intimidated at Berkeley because I was female or I lacked the experience; in fact I befriended lots of my male (and female) classmates alike in order to create a friendlier environment. I guess it depends on each person, but if you are truly determined, nothing is stopping you except your own mind. Besides, from observation, the core CS classes (61A, B, 70) are almost half female if not half female - I don't notice an obvious/extreme gender bias in any of the lectures/discussions/labs, etc. If there is, it's probably representative of the workforce anyway.

A student wrote:

&gt; It's great that you had that experience but I'm speaking from my experience and the other female CS friends I've made. All of my discussions and labs have at most one or two other females. Id love to hear what resources you used but reposted hsing all resources I could without getting into CS Scholars I was unable to get the same grades as you. I worked super hard and always took advantage of what was available to me. 

A student replied:

&gt; I'm also not arguing that the department is sexist. Just saying that there is a lack of diversity. I'm sure the department is working hard to address it I just still observe a mostly male environment

A student wrote:

&gt; So are you suggesting we should go with a blanket assumption that the average white/Asian male CS student has had more experience than anyone or all other groups and enact policy around that (e.g. a lower GPA cutoff for certain groups but not others)? Doesn't seem very fair to me.
&gt; 
&gt; The EECS department has a enrollment ratio of 4:1 male/female - this suggests that the problem (ie. that less girls CHOOSE to do tech than boys) is hardly at the university or the workplace level - it's at the high school level, and this corresponds very much with the skewed AP charts I linked in the first comment chain.
&gt; 
&gt; If we assume that girls can be as competent as boys in tech (which I don't think is a bad assumption), then there would be no need to lower the bar for one group. If more girls in CS/EECS is what you want, educational outreach is the only true answer. In fact, affirmative action is actually quite insulting to females, it suggests that they cannot by their own merit succeed and therefore must rely on external factors to allow them to succeed.

## **Eleventh Followup Discussion**

A student wrote:

&gt; Yes, I definitely agree the department is working hard (since we had different experiences, at least in one case there were a considerable amount of females) to introduce even more diversity, which really leads me to believe it is unfit to complain as the OP did. We are getting there! But I feel like at this point, the difference between our GPAs has nothing to do with being female nor having a lack of experience; some other factors must be at play. I think it's disappointing that so many females get discouraged and wish I could meet you guys and offer at least some encouragement...

## **Twelfth Followup Discussion**

An alum wrote:

&gt; I'm a little late to the thread, but want to add my thoughts to this as a recent grad just starting my career in the private sector. 
&gt; 
&gt; I 100% agree that the diversity of the EECS/CS population at Berkeley and in the private sector not only can be improved, but needs to be improved so that we can have a better representation of the world's population. This will foster better discussions, as more included perspectives will allow us as a community to cover many more possibilities. 
&gt; 
&gt; What we cannot do however is lower standards for the sake of diversity. The memo from Google casted a terrible blanket over a great amount of employees not only within Google, but the entire tech industry, causing them to think that others didn't believe they belonged their, despite of their great accomplishments and their hard work. Lowering standards for the sake of diversity will do nothing more to further this feeling, and will have a worse effect than the memo ever could have. Aside: I wholeheartedly believe that the GPA cap is unfair and a terrible metric to determine who is allowed to further their CS education, however we cannot pick and choose who has to abide by it, and who has the ability to bypass it; It has to be everyone or no one.
&gt; 
&gt; Something that makes looking at current diversity statistics difficult to interpret is that we (or at least I) don't know the makeup of applicants. In CS, it is a little more difficult to get this, but for EECS, since we apply directly to the major, the University should have some knowledge of how diverse the applicant pool is. If only 1 in 5 applicants are female, then the 4:1 men to women ratio actually makes sense. If the applicant pool diversity significantly mismatches with the admitted population, then we have a serious problem at the University level. However, if the applicant pool is lacking diversity, then we have to find a way to get more members of minority groups to have an interest in CS so that they are more likely to pursue it. Personally, I believe that this is the core problem, and where we should spend the most energy in trying to diversify the CS community. If someone could point me to where I could find applicant statistics, I would greatly appreciate it!
&gt; 
&gt; If that is truly the reason why the CS community lacks diversity, then we still have the problem of trying to improve the experience of minority groups that are currently in CS/tech. I agree with the student response that those are great groups to look into, but that probably isn't enough. Not being in a minority group myself, I don't know how we can improve the experience. I would love to hear more ideas on how we can build a better sense of inclusion within the community.
&gt; 
&gt; So yeah, that's my two cents on the topic. I definitely agree that this is a real issue, and that we as a community need to discuss it, but it is important that we find the actual root of the problem, and find a solution to that core problem, instead of simply trying to improve diversity by preferential treatment.
&gt; 
&gt; DISCLAIMER: These are my personal thoughts on the subject, and in no way reflect the thoughts of UC Berkeley, or my current employer. I'm simply trying to build on this discussion.

A student replied:

&gt; UC Berkeley is a school that does not practice affirmative action, so I would have to assume that the EECS department does not bias towards gender when accepting applicants - arguably, schools like MIT (who just achieved a 49.5% female makeup in mechanical engineering dept.) are passing over more qualified male applicants than female applicants. (MIT publicly acknowledges that they practice affirmative action)"

In high school I got involved in extracurriculars, earned a 4.2 gpa, volunteered and went to a really good school in a very difficult stem field. I changed majors to another STEM field and struggled a bit first but eventually started doing what I am suppose to do: getting internship experience, getting involved on hands on engineering clubs, getting a leadership position, and maintaining a decent GPA. Even getting all that was an uphill battle with all of its competition. 

Now I am back at home rotting away while my friends both in high school and college are doing well. It seems like anything less than a perfect performance on an interview means I won't make it to the next step. It sucks going through 4 interviews with the same company only to have some picture perfect candidate swoop in and take it. 3 months and I don't have anything solid. 

Yes even people who dropped out of college are doing well, because they either had the right people vouch for them, have excellent sales skills or just simply lived in the right location. Conventional wisdom says they won't become successful but it seems like I would've done better by simply working my way up or focusing on becoming one of the popular kids than doing the right thing. 

I'm so afraid of missing out on my 20s.

As for Computer Science, I am just overall interested in the idea of programming, but I am currently unsure of what my focus would be. I know I would enjoy working on something that is practical, whether it would be physical or software related.

Can you guys talk about your experience with the two and why one would be better than the other and what I could expect from the two? Would a Computer Engineer be able to receive the same software related internships as a Computer Scientist? What is a work-day like for both careers?

If I take an internship in state I still may be in hot water but I was able to convince my boss to just let me work weekends this summer so I may be able to workout a similar arrangement. 

However, I'm sure since I work at a lawfirm they may get wind of some extra money I will be making at a different company.

I can take a research assistantship over the summer and try to convince them or my boss to adjust my schedule so I could keep my job.

If I lose my job I do have the option of going back to my old one, albeit with shitty health insurance and a little less pay. But it would be last resort and it's only because my last boss is awesome.

6uroi1,61,2017-08-19,An argument for revealing your salary needs,NotARandomNumber,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6uroi1/an_argument_for_revealing_your_salary_needs/,"Every time I see salary negotiation mentioned on this sub, the general advice I see (often given by students still searching for that first internship) 'Oh, never give your salary requirement. You got to play the game, make them say the number first.' To me, this is some of the worst advice given on this sub (somewhere below 'Don't enjoy college, you need to be doing nothing but side projects and CTCI!').  Let me tell you why.

First off, before you even head into an interview (hell, even before you start applying really), be it your first, second, third job, etc, you should know a few things. 

1. What's the average salary salary for someone in my area in this position - This can be somewhat attained by glassdoor, census data, asking around, etc. Salaries can vary dramatically by region because of Cost of Living, 80k in Madison, WI could easily be equivalent to 120 in Seattle. 

2. What's the average salary/benefits for this company - Are they known for paying more, paying less? Do they give some pay in the form of terrific benefits? If you know the company traditionally underpays people and still expect number greater than market average..good luck. 

3. This is the most important. What is the lowest amount that they would pay me that I would be happy with and be able to maintain my desired standard of living/hit my requirements - This is on you. Figure out your life goals, determine if they're realistic, how much do you want to spend a month on retirement funds, toys, housing, etc. 

From this, you should be able to determine a realistic minimum salary that you want. 

Have this number? Fantastic, what next? Well, we take this number and inflate it a little. Is your number 100k? Lets call it 110k then. 

If you're put in a position where you have to give a specific number and not a range (like a job application), give that. If you're put in a position where someone is asking you in person, give the same number (or even a range), but clarify it ""Well, I'm looking to make around 110-120k, but that would also depend on the benefits package as well' 

So now, lets get into the reasons why

* It prevents anyone from wasting their time - If you give a number X and the company is aiming for WAY below that, they'll most likely tell you or (if the salary question came before interviews) just move on. This 100% fine, just because a company passes on you doesn't mean you're a bad applicant or that you're not worth that amount. The company is bound to their financials, if they only allocated X-15% to a new position and you won't be happy with that number, why even progress? 

* It sets the tone for the initial negotiation - Suppose the company has a range of 90k-120k, if you let them pick that initial number (lets be honest, they're a company, their goal is to get you in the door with the least amount of money possible), they're going to start out with that number, so they'll offer you 90. You'll figure you'll say 110k, and eventually settle to 100k. Now, if you come in saying '120k' because you've done your research, you know how much that company pays, odds are you'll get more. 

* To go along with that, revealing your current salary helps prevent low ball offers - This post was essentially inspired by a thread where the OP was looking for another job, didn't reveal his salary, and then got a much lower offer from the other company. If they were to give their number first, that company most likely wouldn't have floated out a lower number. Companies realize that most people will not leave their job for less money. They also realize if you've been working for a company for awhile making X, you mostly likely deserve that salary (ie, if you're a stellar programmer earning more than market average, they might take this as a sign you're worth it). So when asked, don't be afraid to share your salary, but make sure you inflate it as total compensation (bonuses, stock, etc)


What this essentially boils down to is this: You should know how much you're worth in this industry and you should know how much money would make you happy. Knowing your worth and being able to justify it is an incredible trait that will take you far in life. If you're being interviewed and are asked for a salary range, what answer do you really think likes better? Some coy response trying to avoid the question or saying ' Well, I'm looking for this range, I feel that's in line with experience, especially since I was able to do X at Company Y, or had these internships, etc'?

It's probably lots of rambling but I didn't want to leave anything important out. I hope you still read though, even if you don't read everything, because I could need some advice. :( )

First of all, I just discovered this subreddit and damn, the posts here are all so resonating with me. I think I found my people.

So, I'm starting my first job/apprenticeship in September. To give you a better idea of the environment there, I have to explain a bit. I live in Germany, where we have a dual training system where you're partly working at a company and partly going to a vocational school that is much like high school, just with a few different subjects. At school, the students are divided into groups of 20-30 people who have every subject together for the entirety of the three years you're going there. Not like in the US where you have different classes with different people each. Most students will probably be around 16-20. I'm 21.

**I'm scared because** my entire middle and high school experience was horrible and I was bullied by pretty much the entire class the whole time, even though I changed schools a few times. If you aren't getting along with your class, you're essentially fucked because there's no escape, you're trapped with them for hours a day for several years. I don't think it's going to be as bad as that because people grow up and lose the interest in active bullying, but wherever I go people think I'm fucking weird and avoid me. I'm also scared because there's obviously pressure by your company to be a team player and I'm afraid they'll throw me out if I don't get along with anyone. I don't know how justified that fear is. But I was already almost thrown out of a mandatory internship in high school (in a hospital) because I appeared unfriendly. The most scary thing right now is that the company is doing a four day trip with all their new apprentices to some conference center or something to get to know each other. Four days. With complete strangers. Being forced and pressured to socialise. I think on this trip, most people will already find their little friend group so if I don't find any, I probably won't get into one later on either.

**The advice seeking part:** I know that how I handled things in the past (avoiding people, doing my own thing, not initiating conversation but being friendly) didn't work out so I want to try something new. I just don't know how. I've been wanting to change myself for so long but it's so hard and I always fall back into my old patterns. Should I tell people upfront that I have social anxiety so they understand my behaviour better or would they immediately think I'm weird? How do you socialise? How do you know whether you're annoying people? And how do I break the habit of hiding in my shell from the get go? Finding the courage to go up to people? I guess that's something nobody can tell me unfortunately. What do you even make ""first contact"" small talk about with people you don't know but who are there for the same reason as you? We're all studying the same. We live in the same city. Nobody knows anything else than me about the organisational side of the apprenticeship. Small talk is boring as fuck anyway. Other people seem to have no problem talking to random people though and moving on quickly from small talk and getting comfortable with each other. How do they do it?

Edit: oh god I'm so fucking scared right now. I haven't slept in a day and then I lied in bed and these fucking thoughts are starting. I'm sobbing right now at the thought of doing this. I'm such a fucking mess. I can't even do therapy because I get too anxious at the thought of having to talk to someone about my most private feelings and tbh I can't even open up to them. I wish I got cancer and died because really it's my only option and the least painful."

**Financial situation:** Can only afford ~5k dollars per year

**Intended major:** Computer Science/Computer Engineering, interested in Linguistics as well

**Academics:**

**ACT:** 35 Composite (34 English, 35 Math, 35 Reading, 36 Science), 33 Writing

**SAT II:** Math II - 800, French w/Listening - 770, Physics - 760

**Class rank**: 4/145

**GPA (always weighted):** 4.0/4.0

**APs (all self-studied, not provided at school)**: French (5), Calc AB (5), Physics 1 (5), World History (4), English Language (4)

**ECs:** Participation in the International Linguistics Olympiad; French Drama Club, English Club, MUN in French and European Youth Parliament at school; spent a month volunteering at a local nursing home; research intern in a materials science lab at a local university; two CS related internships; I also play the violin for some time now

**Awards:** AP Scholar with Distinction, AP International Diploma, 2nd place at a regional engineering competition, 1st place in a couple of local quiz bowl tournaments, top 8 in the national olympic linguistics selection exam

**Essays:** Generally speaking, meh. I must admit I'm not the best writer, and English isn't my native language. So this was the most challenging part of the application for me. My essays that I liked the most were my Dartmouth (It's not easy being green) and Yale ones, followed by my Harvard essay and the continued interest letter I wrote to Columbia after getting deferred.

**Recommendations:** Honestly couldn't ask for more. One from my French teacher and one from my Biology teacher. I was genuinely interested in their classes and I did extremely well on exams. They were both extremely helpful during the entire process. I would say 9/10, or maybe even 10/10.

**Scholarships:** Rice, Dartmouth &amp; Yale-NUS (Demonstrated need met), Drexel (50k/year in grants), NYU (20k/year in grants)

**-AFTERTHOUGHTS-**

Don't apply to NYU if you can't afford at least 50-60k per year. Essays make or break your application. **If you are an international student who needs financial aid** don't bother applying to public schools, your chances of getting merit scholarships are extremely slim; and shotgun method is probably your best choice. Don't miss scholarship deadlines. University summer schools may be worth it if you manage to keep in contact with an instructor at that institution and get a recommendation letter—though I didn't go to any."
6ussmu,1,2017-08-19,Are there any part-time / non 9-5 jobs available for recent grads?,BlueLensFlares,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6ussmu/are_there_any_parttime_non_95_jobs_available_for/,"Hi all,

So I'll be graduating in December, and I recently got an opportunity to work as a CS teacher part-time for about 10-15 hours a week. It pays well for a part-time position and provides benefits. I have teaching experience so I don't think this will be too difficult. It's only a 1 year opportunity to cover a teacher going on a sabbatical until June.

My question is though, I will graduating in the middle of teaching, and I would really like to start working professionally in the industry. I'll be completing an MS in CS, and I'd like to begin looking for software engineering opportunities.

The problem is I feel really bad for the school I'm working at because they can't find a teacher, and I'd like to start working now and this is the only opportunity that's come up so far. They really want me and I don't want to turn it down, but also the pay is just slightly under the threshold that I would need to live comfortably.

Do you all know of the kinds of opportunities that would be available to me for about 30 to 40 hours of work a week in the afternoons/evenings, that I could do from January to June after I've received my MS in CS? Part-time coding, freelance development, consulting, or internships? 

Thanks!"

6utpch,6,2017-08-19,My personal success story for those also struggling with severe depression/anxiety,wassupimdrunk,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/6utpch/my_personal_success_story_for_those_also/,"4 years ago...My sophomore year of college I really plummeted into a deep place.  I felt like I was failing school because of my mom's relentless emotional abuse and I had lost my scholarships because my grades fell below 3.4.  I got mild relief when I had an internship on the other side of the world.  Things seemed to be getting better, but then I had a really (what I thought) severe violation of trust where a guy had led me on and I lost my virginity to him.  Then being in a foreign country, I didn't know how to get plan B and he refused to get on a train to help me even though he knew I couldn't speak the native language.  I luckily found help on reddit, but I really felt so alone and abandoned with the impending doom of coming back to the US and facing my mother again.  

Luckily, in starting up my job as an RA.  I had biweekly meetings with a supervisor and he encouraged me to seek out help at CAPS.   That's where I met my first counselor and saw a psychologist for medication.  I started Sertraline and it seemed to be helping, but was making me drowsy.  One of my coworkers was sexually harassing me for months, but I was still feeling powerless and trapped and it wasn't until someone had witnessed it that I was able to realize something could be done.  I had a handful of coworkers turn on me after I decided to go through an ethics trial to press charges.  Again I felt isolated and alone.  Then summer break happened, and I was not able to keep going all the way to school to my sessions, but I was better once the trial was over and had even tapered off my medication.  

The next school year was about to start and I was an RA again, when I found out my family's dog had died.  That's the dog that had been around since 3rd grade.  Of course I was sad, and I didn't want to feel alone so I invited the guy over that I was ""talking to"" to stay with me that night.  Unfortunately, he sexually assaulted me.  I blamed my self and bottled it up for months.  Partially because I thought I should know what to do since I was an RA.  I finally broke down again and started seeing that same counselor again in January.  My fall semester went poorly so it was part of my agreement to keep my job to keep going to counseling.  I started up again and tried a different medication Duloxetene.  I kept going, but was still really struggling.  I had to drop classes and failed some and had to accept that I wasn't going to graduate on time.  It felt pretty awful and like I was letting people down.  I was very open with them about my situation and in return they were supportive.  I am lucky they were around.  
That summer (2015) I switched to continue my care at a place in my hometown.  I was planning on trying to go to school again that spring.  I decided I really needed a good, long break to get better and practice my skills to deal with anxiety and depression before I went back.  They had continued me taking that medication and upped the dosage, but I noticed that it didn't seem like it was helping me anymore after a few months.  My doctor insisted it was my IUD that was affecting it and to wait it out.  So I kept taking the medication and registered to take classes again that spring semester.  I didn't go to my school psychologist and was too busy to make the drive home for appointments.  I ended up dropping out 3/4 through.  Because my anxiety was keeping me from attending class and I had some less than understanding professors.  I got a notice I would be on some sort of academic probation where I needed to meet with the dean before I could attend again.  I just really felt like shit.  I was suicidal and nothing seemed to be going right.  I started seeing my college counselor again probably around April and through the summer of 2016. 

Luckily, I had started to date a med student at the time, and he had suggested if I really felt like the medication wasn't working for me I could taper it.  As I was tapering the medication, I really felt like one of those claritin commercials where colors seemed brighter and things weren't blurry anymore.  That feeling motivated me to start working out to get more endorphins going.  I became a bit of a gym rat.  Especially when I had to deal with a breakup that fall, I used the gym and exercise to work through my sadness.  I had also continued to see my counselor and make the drive to school until September.  Then I switched to a place closer to me so that I didn't have to drive as far and really focus on getting better to go back to school in January of 2017.  I had to get better and get a doctor's note stating I would continue my care and was well enough to be successful.  
They let me enroll.  I took 4 of my hardest courses which included two med school courses that spring.  I had completely tapered off medication, but had a strict daily regimen of exercise, meals, and sleep.  Really exercise became a way to remind myself of my strength and that I was capable of doing things.  It really increased my self efficacy.  It was something I did for myself.  I dealt with some of the worst anxiety I had ever experienced and stress combined with lack of sleep in my entire college career.  One of my classes, histology, I was on the brink of failing for the first half of the semester, but I put in work and ended up with a B+.  In fact I did so well that semester, I narrowly missed the dean's list.  (For some reason its 3.7 LOL)  Even with my counselor not being available the last 3 weeks of school. 

But that wasn't going to be the end for me, I still had 2 courses to take during the summer.  I had PTSD from these classes because I had already tried and failed several times before.  It was nice to have them not at the same time, but there was only a week break after my spring semester before I started Organic Chemistry Lab.  Unlucky me, I had been attacked by bed bugs during my week off so I started class with hundreds of bites that were itchy and horrible.  Then, just as they were getting better, I had forgotten my jacket and it was chilly outside as I was walking from class and my bites flared up with hives since I am allergic to the cold.  I gave in and went to the doctor who prescribed me steroids.  I had no idea that it would aggravate my anxiety SO MUCH.  It was intense.  Funny, just as I had thought I had been through the worst of it that spring.  We met 4 times a week, had reports due all the time, tests, worksheets.  I wasn't sleeping well for 2 weeks because of the steroids and focus was insanely difficult too.  I was even too embarrassed to go to the gym because I looked like I had a horrendous rash because the bites were everywhere.  I started seeing a counselor at this new school I was at for just the summer. 
 After the steroids were done, the class was just ramping up more and more.  I felt like I was drowning and doing nothing but work, which really does feel miserable.  Luckily, my tutor (who I had met on reddit yay!) was really supportive and gave me the encouragement I needed to push through and do the work even if it took me all night.  I miraculously got an A-.  

Then came my final class, Organic Chemistry II.  I hadn't taken a proper chemistry class in 2 years and even then I was depressed and that was probably the 3rd time I was taking it.  I was anxious to even go to the first day.  I was pacing alone in my apartment, calling my sister multiple times, my dad, my mom...struggling to bring myself to get out of bed and go to class.  At one point I was just repeating ""no"" over and over out loud to quiet the anxiety and self doubt that was all crowding my mind to get myself to class.  Even sitting there, my mind was trying to peel me out of my seat.  But I sat through the whole class and every day after that got easier.  I did well on the first test, but completely bombed the second one.  That made me panic again.  I had this one test and one class between me graduating or not.  Just at this point, I felt so exhausted and defeated.  There was only a week to prepare for the final because summer classes are just brutal.  I was so anxious most of that week that I couldn't bring myself to read more than a few pages a night, which made the approaching test more and more scary.  Suicidal thoughts creeped in daily and I was having multiple almost panic attacks.  I tried making a plan for test day because I know that I usually after such high anxiety have a depressive state that follows.  I had hotline phone numbers ready.  Test day arrived, and I almost didn't even get myself to go to class.  I got there and was certain I was going to fail.  I took the test and was certain I hadn't gotten the score I needed to pass. 
I drove back to my apartment and cried for hours.  I kept contemplating suicide and called a hotline that helped me out.  I was able to be calm enough to drive home.  That drive was difficult because I felt like I was coming home a failure and nothing else mattered.  I didn't want to talk to anyone.  

The next day, I was really feeling really depressed and hadn't slept well.  My mom had invited me to go with her to visit my sister at her school.  I decided to force myself to go because I knew if I had stayed home by myself I might try to kill myself or check myself in to the emergency room.  I went with my mom and we spent the afternoon with my sister.  It was okay, but then I got a notification on my phone that grades had been posted.  I checked and turns out I had actually PASSED.  I PASSED THE CLASS.  THAT MEANS I GRADUATED.  
I just sat there in shock and silence.  Tears welled up in my eyes and I told my mom, grandma, dad everyone!  It just was so surreal.  I really did it.  

And I feel like I have learned a lot about myself in my 4 years of dealing with it.  I know that anxiety and depression is something that I will have to constantly battle and sometimes it will win.  But if you keep pushing through you can win the war.  Ups and downs are a part of life, and sometimes the downs are way WAY more, but can celebrate the ups when they happen and man it really makes it all worth it.  I mean I am still stressed trying to find a job with my shitty GPA and bachelors degree in Biology, but I know that I can keep trying even when it feels like trying isn't worth it anymore.  I hope you keep fighting and realize you ARE strong and worth it.  There are people around you who support and love you, but maybe are bad at showing it.  I want you to know you can do it.  The way is not really a straight path or clear, but you'll do them  your way and that's OK.  Its ok to have hard times.  Its ok to struggle.  Its ok to not be yourself all the time.  Life is hard.  Keep trying... I'm rooting for you.  "

How do you force/motivate yourself to work?,BlackBlackBread,AskProgramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/6uvxy1/how_many_hours_a_day_do_you_actually_work_how_do/,"Some background: I'm between 2nd and 3rd year of something you'd probably call bachelor's degree right now. I got a paid summer internship as a C# programmer. 

Here's the thing: I (thought I) enjoy programming. However, after a month and a half of internship, I find myself working 4, maybe 5 hours out of 8 and wasting the rest of the time and instead of being hyped by pursuing my dream career I'm mostly frustrated. 

It might be because I'm new and literally everything is a challenge for me. Instead of normal work and more or less frequent challenges, I learn something new, apply it, see that it works and the next second there's another challenge and another thing to learn... In my university classes I've programmed in C#, but mostly console applications, I've done some basics with html and css, tried some tutorials with ASP.NET, and now I'm developing back-end API using ASP.NET and a SPA with Angular 4 and TypeScript on the frontend without any previous knowledge of JS. It is a tiny little bit overwhelming for me.

I've heard that programming buisness applications in C# can get mundane, that it's often more of the same. Is it really so? My experience so far is very different. Does it slow down after a while? 

Or did I go for an internship too early? I guess not, they wouldn't hire me, keep me here for almost 2 months, and I wouldn't get anything done if that was the case I think.

Or is that how programmers actually work? Do you spend several hours on reddit and other activities while at work? I've worked on a construction site and a factory before going on university, so my experience has been very different then. 

I'm also extremely lazy and I always found it hard to motivate myself to do just about anything... That could be the problem, too.

I'd be really grateful for any opinions and advices. I was really hyped to develop web applications, that's what I wanted to do, but now that I've tried it it makes me question my career choices...

Started off with tech support at people's homes and worked my way up to help desk and eventually into automation through the ConnectWise/LabTech platform. Starting a new position soon that is focused on automation and reporting - mainly with the ConnectWise platform but also outside of it - and on trying to introduce DevOps culture and processes into the company.

Tuition reimbursement is a benefit I will have access to down the line with my new position, so I'm (once again) flirting with the idea of going back to school. Not sure how much it would be worth it at 38, but it's a possibility.

Given that I *really* do not do well in classroom settings - I started learning SQL because I had a problem to solve and queries were the only way to solve it, and I can say the same for a lot of my other skills (Present me with a problem, and I will find a way to solve it, even if it means I have to learn a new language or process.

When I was asked this, I originally said that I'd be interested but after giving some thought I feel that it may not have been the best decision.

I have a history of not being able to balance work and school. One summer I was taking two classes (6 credits) and was barely able to pass them which greatly brought down my GPA. (C- on Calc 2, 4 credit class) But these past jobs were mostly physically draining minimum wage jobs. This internship is office work with a very flexible boss. 

In the fall I'll be taking 13 credits. Dynamics, Manufacturing, Circuits and English 3 (Presentations). It is a pretty average schedule. Dynamics at our school is known to be a particularly tough class mainly due to the person teaching it. 

I do think I have left a positive impression at the company (I mean, they want me to continue after all). I really like the company environment and the people.  It was a lot of grunt work but I very much liked working there. 

This past Friday before I left, my supervisor told me that my internship has been extended till the end of the year on the internal system, as in the position will exist till the end of the year. It is not official yet since I'm technically an international student and my work permit needs to be extended if I want to continue (expires Sept. 1st). That would mean my supervisor would need to issue a new offer letter for the fall with the new start and end dates. As of now, my internship will end in September 1st. My supervisor also put emphasis on the ""internally"". 

Would it be unprofessional to change my mind at this point? 
The main two people I work with (along with the supervisor) also want me to stay since they repeatedly mentioned I've helped them out a lot on their projects. I generally feel bad to think about leaving after hearing this. But at the same time, I want to get A's on all my classes (or at least bump my 3.01 into something higher)

Any advice will be greatly appreciated.

Off topic:

Also, I posted here a while ago discussing a guy I caught cheating in the class I was a TA for this summer. Well, I happened to be on campus the other day and I ran into him. Naturally I asked him how he did in the class (yes I can also see his grades). Turns out he did pass the class. Fuck that guy.

Questions:

So the only reason i went for the Asus x370-f is because of this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqzunqpLRNs by Paul's Hardware, it inspired me to build my first pc ever and to do it with ryzen. If there are any better option please tell me ( Maybe ASUS ROG STRIX B350-F Gaming - ATX / B350 or ASUS PRIME X370-PRO - ATX / X370?)

For the cooler i dont know if i should go with the cooler that goes with the AMD ryzen 7 1700 or the EKL Alpenföhn? I Heard that ryzen doesn't need a super good cooler but i still need one.

Asus Geforce GTX 1070 Dual oc 2xHDMI 2xDP 8GB is really nice but should i go to 1060 instead because its cheaper?

Will the Psu be enough to power the rig?

I guess i Could try to find cheaper SSD and HDD

As a person who has never built a pc before this has been really fun. If anyone has anything to say please do, i'm open to changes if something in the rig looks weird. The only thing i would like to avoid to change is the Ryzen 7 1700 because i heard is the best bang for the buck.

The EECS route seems too competitive (and too inflexible) so I want to apply to L&amp;S. Of course, there's that 3.3 GPA cap and I'm concerned about not making the to it. 

I have done a lot of programming on the side, including an internship, but I still feel like it's not wise to put all my eggs in one basket. Has anyone who tried to go for CS end up majoring in something else? Is applied math in particular a good backup? (Seeing it has a good amount of CS courses) Or should I choose a school that's less of a risk?"
6uzs8f,434,2017-08-20,"Graduated with &lt;3 GPA, no projects, no internships, no work experience. How can I get my s*** together and make myself employable?",throwawaycscq0820201,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6uzs8f/graduated_with_3_gpa_no_projects_no_internships/,"I'll preface this by admitting that this entire mess could have been avoided if I realized earlier that life would not railroad me to success. I know that I could have done something about it years ago, but I didn't - and since I can only fix myself in the present and not the past, I have to know how to take action *in the here and now*. 

I understand that most people will pass over this post, and even fewer will read the whole thing and be kind enough to leave a helpful reply. However, I'm willing to take the chances; even if only one person replies, maybe the advice could steer my life towards something hopeful. 

**What went wrong?**

I half-assed my coursework and have a sub-3 GPA. 

I applied to zero internships over my past four years even when plenty of career fairs and recruiters showed up at my university. 

I haven't worked for a minute in my entire life. I don't even have a resume. 

**Did you network at all?**

I don't know anyone at my university. I'm fairly sure that if you went through the entire student and staff roster, you would not find a single person who knows my face. 

**How did it get to this point?** 

I became addicted to online gaming and wasted away four years of my college life doing the minimum amount of work to not fail. I used video games as a form of escapism to avoid confronting my responsibilities in real life. 

I graduated this fall and wasted my summer away gaming as usual, then realized that I didn't do any of the foundational work needed to enter the workforce. Reality hit me like a truck. I have **zero** idea where to start and am fairly sure blindly applying to job openings with no shred of preparation is not the wisest idea. 

**What are you actually capable of?**

I have rudimentary knowledge of C/C++, Java, Python, and LaTeX if that counts for anything. 

I can use the Unix shell, but I have to look up most commands. 

I am familiar with the Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEs. I can use Maven to build a Java project, but am unfamiliar with its advanced functions like unit testing. 

I used TortoiseSVN before, but am mostly familiar with Git. I can work with one other programmer on a project using Git to check out/merge code. 

**What do you have to show for it?**

I have a B.S. in computer science from my state university. 

I only have two personal programming projects, a video game mod written in Java, and a webchat bot written in Perl from years ago. Both were created for personal use and have a userbase in the 2-digit range, without a public Git repository to show my work. 

I have fast (&lt;5s) Python solutions to about 80 problems on Project Euler, but have no other recorded programming in the language. 

For C/C++, I only coded in the language for schoolwork, and did not save my work. 

**What's your current situation?**

My parents will still support me for the foreseeable future, but I cannot stay like this. I have to become an independently functioning person who is gainfully employed. 

**What are you hoping to gain from posting this thread?**

Any third-party input that extends beyond telling me how screwed I am would probably help me out one way or another. 

I am under no illusions that Redditors can provide a magic answer that solves my problems for me, but anything helps; even nudging me towards the right direction would be immensely appreciated. I am incredibly overwhelmed and have no idea where to start on recovering from this slow-moving disaster I brought upon myself. 

* What should I be doing now? 
* Who can I talk to?
* What appropriate self-help resources are available? 
* How should I plan my daily routine from this point onward? 
* What sort of job/internship should I be looking into? Are my odds non-zero?
* How long will this take if I follow through working as hard as I can?

If anyone out there has anything helpful they would not mind sharing with me, I would very, very much appreciate a reply.  "

I'm a year from graduating with a CS degree and I've done very well academically. I've averaged a 4.0 and received high praise from my managers in my two internships. My concern is not about my ability to do or find work.

What concerns me, though, is that I feel as though I'm surrounded in my classes and internships by people who genuinely love this stuff, which I don't. I have a passing interest in computers. I might learn a little about them if I had all the free time in the world, but I feel absolutely outclassed in terms of passion and interest by the people who can study or work full time and *still* have more interest in creating software. It seems to be the most common and most emphasized thing to do on this sub, but the idea of actually putting in the time to do *more* computer science than I'm required to do is completely odious. I have so many things I would rather do. I can hardly tolerate putting 40 hours a week in to this stuff, let alone doing that and then some, yet it seems that everyone I meet is excited to use new technologies and travel for hackathons and make their own side projects.

Am I right to be concerned about my choice of career, given the factors here? Although I don't really like computer science, it seems like the quickest and least unpleasant way to earn enough to quit or transition to less profitable work. There is no comparably lucrative field that I have both an aptitude and a passion for, so I would likely have to make drastic sacrifices in terms of financial security and living situation to do anything besides CS. There are a number of low-paying jobs (not careers) that I would greatly enjoy doing, but at some point I'm going to have to do actual decent paying work, and it seems logical to just get it over with.

TL;DR: Good at CS but don't particularly care for it or want to do it in free time. Should I reconsider my plans to work in this industry?"

I recently graduated with a biomedical engineering degree, though I knew I wanted to work as a software engineer/developer after my sophomore year. Senior year, I visited a school that's extremely good for comp sci/engineering (not MIT or anything, but still a very good school) and decided to apply for the CS PhD program there... and only there. Somehow, and I am still not extremely sure why, I got in and was provided with enough funding to support myself. 

Prior to getting in, I was applying for jobs as backup. One I interviewed for, I completely failed the whiteboard interview but they liked me enough to offer an internship instead of a job.
That made my decision easy, get some internship experience and go on with the PhD.

I ended up loving the internship. I loved the company, I loved the city I stayed in, I loved the 9-5 schedule, I loved the work I was doing and how much I was learning, and I was dreading going back to school. 

At the end of the internship, they (unexpectedly) offered me a full-time position. They said they understood I'm going to grad school, so I can take all the time I need to decide and I can always intern there next summer if I want to pursue grad school. 

I really want to take the offer, I won't lie. But I don't know if I should throw away this opportunity to get a CS degree at a great university. I don't want to end up screwing myself over in the future because of a decision made on emotion. On the other hand, I know that I don't want to be in academia and don't want to waste time on something that won't help me in the long run.

I apologize for the wall of text, I just really don't know who I can talk to about it. I've kept the offer a secret from everyone at grad school for obvious reasons (also hence the throwaway), but I really just need someone unbiased to talk with. Thank you!"

Hey,

I'll start with a small presentation of my profile : i'm an average/good student in one of the best engineering schools in my country (France) that has an average popularity around the world. I specialize in fullstack development, specifically JS, and have played around with every trendy thing coming out. I've got a few projects of my own and am planning to develop them to gain experience and maybe start making a name online. I'm starting my last year of studies on September, and since it's a part-time apprenticeship, I'll end up with 3 year experience in full-stack. I've done two internships that have been pretty successful and that can be used as reference in future interviews, including one in London.

Now the thing is, I'm currently thinking about what I wanna do after my studies, and the thought of staying at my current apprenticeship company does not tempt me (it's one of these companies that mass-recruit people and that infamous for being places ""where programmers go to die"" i.e. you don't have a lot of career options if you're not going into project management). 

My last internship, in London, kinda opened my eyes and made me think I'd love to work abroad again, and I've been wanting to discover the world for a while now. 

This led me to wonder if I could just save money during the current year, start finding a job abroad a month before my studies end, and just move out, work for a while there, then move out again, etc. 

I've seen on websites like Angel.co that there is constant need for programmers in startups around the world, which kinda makes me wanna try even more.

Has anyone ever done something like that, or tried to, and would have any experience to share about it ? Any advice ? 

I've searched about the subject online but it's mainly people talking about working remotely while travelling, which isn't what I'm looking for.

I'm actually pretty good at my courses too. 

I'm just not interested in anything that would make money. I do mixed martial arts but I only like it as a hobby. I started playing guitar last month but I still suck at it and at 21 year of age I feel like I'm too late to be serious about music. I really like singing when I'm alone while playing guitar, but my voice is straight up horrible. I write poems and short stories and would like to publish a book and become a professional writer, but I know some writers and they all need side jobs to provide for themselves financially. 

What can I do at this point with no direction? My school is forcing me to do my obligatory internships, and even thinking about that office work is making me depressed to the point I can't eat, get out of my bed, or sleep... and it's just for 25 work days! If I graduate and start working full time in this field I would just kill myself, I'm fully sure. I don't want to come to that point. "

Got a call back for an internship (full time/paid) at a local manufacturing company. Small IT department (&lt;10 total IT employees, +1,000 employees) for a 1 year period. I would be basically getting my first real world experience outside of certs/schooling. 

I'm also considering attending a bootcamp in Colorado (https://secureset.com) for Cybersecurity at the beginning of the year, which more or less would be to skip this entire help desk/support role and go into either analysis or more of the technical side to server maintenance and bug resolution. 

For those already through the help desk phase or still around it, what are your opinions? 

--If I take the internship, I'm also throwing out this upcoming semester of junior college courses (python fundamentals, visual basic programming &amp; network security) 

--I only have a Network Pro cert and no previous work experience 

How evil of me would it be to work the internship until the end of the year and put my 2 weeks in? I personally think its a rather scummy plan, but I know we all gotta eat!

I tried asking questions and laughed and their jokes but I was treated like I wasn't even there. This is why I'd rather sit by myself, I understand I'm not an extremely friendly person but I try to make an effort and normally get treated like a burden. I feel like not a lot of people like me at work and I'm not sure if maybe I'm just a total bitch to these people or if I'm just not talkative enough and it comes off as me not wanting to talk to them. I'm okay with being by myself but being put in those situations suck, i feel like total shit after.

I recently signed a lease in an apt with a guy I didn't know very well. My girlfriend sublet my place for the summer while I worked an internship. Upon returning home yesterday, I found all of the living room furniture missing and the kitchen torn apart. None of my belongings have been taken or damaged. His room clearly indicated he has vacated. His bed is stripped, and all the furniture/kitchen stuff is in his bedroom. I have verbal confirmation with him that he moved out, and is intending on paying rent.  There are also two couches remaining. I'd prefer to not use any of his things and would rather get my own. He has also just thrown whatever belongings he had into one of the bedrooms and has told me he intends on using it as storage, and won't be picking it up until he has another place to live. I obviously don't want this guy just coming in randomly with this clear animosity.

According to our lease, it doesn't indicate who gets what room, who has to pay what share of rent, or any of that. Each apartment gets a small storage area in the basement, with more than enough room to hold his things. I would like to take his things and bring it down there and begin using the unused room. 

In addition, tenant law says I can install a 3rd lock and only must give it to the landlord upon request. 

The guy is emotionally unstable and has been threatening with me over text. I'm generally uncomfortable asking him for anything as he just begins to hurl insults and start pitying himself.

The leasing office doesn't care and won't take any action unless I can legally obligated them to. That's fine.

I'm wondering my rights regarding protecting myself from him, and when this guy would cease to be an occupant legally and forfeit his rights, even if he still has to pay rent. I am also interested in the legality of adding a lock, as well as moving his things to the basement and using the room. He moved out last Thursday, Aug 17th.

If he skips on rent at all I am planning immediately on sueing him the second I have to cover for him, for the remainder of the lease term.

I'm on a 5 year course with placement, so my 3rd year is a year long placement (unsure if this is the same as an internship?). I am very interested in doing my placement in the USA or Canada, as I wanted to experience some culture but also do Engineering in a place that speaks English predominantly.

My initial ideas were SpaceX and NASA, but looking further into it, I'm not allowed to work for them unless I am an American Citizen. I also looked at Tesla but the general opinion was that their staffing turnover and workrate wasn't the best. In that mindset of finding a company that treated their employees well but was also well-known, Boeing came up. Currently I wish to work at Boeing if possible, I don't know if anyone has any experience of working for them or know about them better. On the same lines, if anyone knows any respectable companies that they really enjoyed doing their placement at, please mention it as I would like to know more about the scene but it is hard as I do not live in America!

So in general, I would appreciate any relevant information and help regarding placements in the USA, or other places if you believe they would be better - for example if there is an amazing placement in the UK do mention it!

My Major GPA is even lower and I'm working on repeating a course. I know i know its not normal thing to have such a GPA in first year at college, but I messed up. First time moving out enjoying freedom etc. and I forgot about reality. Life has given me a big shock thanks to my own mistakes. 

Anyways, by about next semester I will try to achieve a minimum 3, which seems very doable if I focus and don't get distracted. 

I stumbled upon /r/cscareerquestions somehow and all I see is people with mad skills on their resume and tons of projects on their GitHubs. I never thought doing CS would be so much work. I'll now be studying at the library everyday to get my GPA up but now also have to work on side projects and learning stuff that school isn't teaching me even though Im paying thousands of dollars every year? 

I thought about it a little bit and made a plan, that involved me studying in the summer while my family is enjoying holidays and Im turning my hair grey making a project. And then going to school next year studying 24/7 because Im not a smart person and need to get my shit+GPA together, then trying to find an internship for next summer &amp; if Im lucky, I'll work + learn the whole summer, then again back to school and finally graduate if Im lucky enough.  Finally after graduating I decide to apply to jobs and find out that I need to do LeetCode + HackerRank + whatnot to ace interviews, and alongside find out that my projects were just a shit version of others projects and is the most basic thing a smart 12 year old can make. 

I didn't even ever stress about all this, even with my low gpa, but after being on /r/cscareerquestions I feel like I either underestimate myself or underestimate the CS field. 

I feel like everyone here wants to work at Google/Facebook/AirBnB/Uber etc. 
Personally I never feel like I will ever be qualified enough to make it in them. 
I don't feel like there are normal jobs in CS anymore. Its so weird, its like Ive been brainwashed. I used to have so many things in mind other than being a developer for uber or AirBnB, but now it's impossible for me to name a thing. I can't even focus on what I want to do now. For instance, I started learning Web Development. I found out about bootstrap. I designed a portfolio website for myself. Then I found out about PHP, node js, angular, react, jQuery, Firebase etc. Even if I learn these all myself(as guaranteed at least my school doesn't teach all of these) by assing myself in the summers, I will then be limited to Web Development jobs only. 

Note: Im not trying to offend anyone here. Im just not a smart person, but I actually did good in HS and assed university. All the people who dream of working in google, get 3.8+ gpas and have tons of projects and skills, HATS OFF. Im extremely jealous of you guys and keep up the good work. 

Tldr; Any normal CS grads over here who don't dream of working in google, don't ass their summers by making projects that are shit, only learn what they were taught in school rather than taking online courses on coursera, and can flash me some knowledge of ""normal"" cs jobs because Im too brainwashed by the genius people in this sub.

5 months ago, I decided to leave my job at a large, well-known company due to poor management and an inevitable dead end in professional growth (I was at the company for 5 years). I left with a job lined up, with a nice job title boost and raise, but in the time that has past a lot has changed at the company and with the position itself. 

When interviewing, I was told I would be hiring a team of people under me (at my previous job, I led a team of 7) but have not been given the appropriate resources to do so. Since starting, I've been able to hire 1 p/t employee and 1 intern - which is fine, except the results that my boss is looking for and demanding requires MUCH more experience and team members. It's only been a few months, but I'm 100% burnt out and dread coming to work every day and have had trouble sleeping and am getting sick. During the day-to-day, I am left to do many of the tasks that are under my experience level and the level of my title (director).

Aside from duty bait-and-switch, my boss yells. A lot. One employee has been doing an exemplary job at doing whatever task is thrown their way, but the boss yells and demands things go her way, with zero understanding of how the process works and no desire to learn how. Also, I was recently told that I would need to go to our store (I work in e-commerce retailer) to assist the store team in processing returns and clean up their back room storage. This has nothing to do with my job or my job duties, and I told my manager this, but they said it was expected and that it will be a team building exercise. 

At the end of September, I will have enough saved up to take off for 10 months to a year, and my SO has told me that they will support me after that should my search not pan out quickly. Everyone always says to never quit a job unless you have one lined up, but this position is taking a toll on my health and not contributing to my overall professional goals. "

When I asked my manager about it, he basically told me he was only there for ""moral support"". I felt like I had no idea what I was doing and was completely on my own. Is that typical of jobs in software? Or can I expect to work on projects with other people who can at least help me get the software to work. Also I'm a social person and like to work with other people. I don't need to pair program all the time, but still. 

I think part of wanting to drop out of the PhD is this realization that I'm smart and good at what I do, but I'm not the best. I'm not gonna single-handedly change the world. I just want to do some good work and also have a normal life. Is there an expectation that I dedicate my life to my job? Do people tend to think of their work as *the most important thing in the world that is going to change everything*? Or can I expect people to be proud of their work, but who also just have a job that they don't structure their entire life around?

I think I'm smart and I have alot to learn on the job. Not everything is algorithms. I know that. Is it ok to learn on the job or should I make sure that I know what I'm doing before I start the job. The whole interview process seems to imply that if you know how to think algorithmically and are smart that you can learn everything on the job. My one (1) experience gave me the opposite impression. So what's that like?"

I do really like my school and the people I have befriended, but I also want the best for my future. I do think I would be happy at UVA too, but really anything could happen.

So I've heard many times before that work experience is more important than where you went to school and your grades. I've already had a few internship interviews and I am semi-confident I will get one for next summer. With all that said, how much benefit would transferring bring me? I'm unsure if the ""better"" school is enough to justify giving up all the other things I like about my current school.

I am currently a senior with one class left to graduate for Computer Science BS. I am 21 years old (took a lot AP credits in high school). I am lucky enough for my scholarship to actually pay me handsomely to attend classes.

Or would it be better to graduate and get a full time job.

Again I want to reiterate I am getting paid to go to school and have had two internships already. The more the merrier I have learned what I like and don't like during my internships and I think it would be much better for me to continue with internships rather than going straight into the job field.

I just recently graduated with an Electrical Engineering Degree, but I'm pursuing a job as a software engineer.

I'll give a brief bulleted summary of my current situation, and hopefully you guys can offer some advice of how to approach it:

* I have one sofware engineering intern experience and 4+ software related projects 

* I self taught myself how to code with the exception of a data structure class

* My most comfortable programming language is ***only*** Python (because I do all my leetcode questions in python)

* I have used other languages in my internship/projects, but do not feel confident if asked an interview question regarding it on the spot (anyone ever feel this way about technologies you don't use on a regular basis, but have used it in the past?)

* A majority of the job listings have a list of preferred skills and Python is not on there so I feel like that makes it much more difficult for me to even get an interview/pass an interview, so this is a major reason I am feeling discouraged

* I am considering dedicating a majority of my time to studying another language that is more demanded in the job market (Java), but then it would be very difficult juggling all these tasks: ***really need help with this one***
    * doing leetcode
    * working on additional projects to add to resume
    * learning Java (not sure if I should even do this. Opinions?)
    * applying for jobs (I believe applying for jobs is a numbers game so I feel I should be spending a lot of timing applying to hundreds of places)

* I feel like there is still a lot to Python that I do not know about since I only use it for leetcode. Should I spend a lot of time studying on it? Such as things like decorators, design patterns, django, etc?

* I have been focusing on applying to ""new grad/entry"" software engineering positions

* I am currently living back home and my days are entirely free so I can dedicate all my time to becoming a better developer, but am unsure of how to allocate time efficiently between the things I listed above

At the moment, I am feeling extremely flustered since I feel like there is so much to do before I am to be as prepared as someone who has graduated with a Computer Science degree, but, at the same time, I feel that I may be more qualified than some CS graduates. I am also feeling discouraged since I have applied to approximately 50 places so far, but it's resulted in rejection emails, 2 phone screens, and 2 online screens that have led to nowhere  (I know that I need to apply to TONS more places, but this is all I have done so far).

I appreciate any advice you guys have to offer."
6vfejz,4,2017-08-22,Boss is awkwardly ignoring me after passing me up for a promotion,gottarun215,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/6vfejz/boss_is_awkwardly_ignoring_me_after_passing_me_up/,"tl;dr: boss screwed me out of a promotion and hired his friend who is less qualified and now is awkwardly avoiding me and won't introduce me to or tell me anything about my new supervisor.

Full Summary:
I was recently passed over for a promotion for a role as supervisor over our team after my boss stepped down to focus on his role as department head. Basically he lied to me to get me to take my current job as assistant on this team and didn't follow through w/ any promises and then overlooked me for this promotion (that he told me when I took this job that he wanted to train me to be highly considered for if things went well) and hired his less qualified friend for political reasons and then failed to give me any feedback on why I wasn't qualified or what i could improve on and said I was doing a great job and there wasn't anything I could have done differently and that my (courtesy phone) interview went very well and made my a close second choice, although I can tell I was never being seriously considered for the role due to politics and bias on the hiring committee. People close to this situation agree with me that I was highly and probably more qualified for this role, but it was a political decision made based off of bad reasons. He told me he would sit down with me when I got back to the office after being out of town to share more about my new supervisor and how this transition will work (I previously reported to him doing half of the team lead's work by myself with only very positive feedback.)

I have now been back at work for a week now and he has been awkwardly avoiding me and is yet to share any more info with me about my new supervisor so I know more about who I will be working under nor have we discussed how this affects my role as her assistant. I ran into him in the hall with a coworker and he tried to avoid eye contact with me and directed the conversation towards other people and then later when we ended up running into each other going towards the same place thus forcing us to interact, he avoided the elephant in the room by rambling on about history of a building we walked by for an awkwardly long time to stay on that boring topic. The new supervisor started work two days ago, yet my dept head still hasn't even told me she started or tried to introduce me to her (large building so I would not necessarily know she had started if someone else hadn't told me.) I am the only full time employee that will be working with her along with a few people that are involved with our team part time seasonly which makes this super awkward since I am the main person directly affected by this new hire. I met the new person b/c I tracked her down with my other supervisor and we introduced ourselves. She seems nice at least and seems like she will at least be easy to work with, so I plan to try to be helpful and pleasant to her since the bad doings of my boss is not her fault and that would not help my situation.

I'm obviously hurt by him being mistruthful and overlooking me for a job I was highly qualified and a good fit for for an outside seemingly less qualified candidate, but am mostly upset by his lieing and lack of transparency in the hiring process and failure to give honest feedback. Those things aside, I am now super stressed and am having lots of anxiety caused by his awkward avoidance of me b/c he probably feels bad and I know that he hates confronting uncomfortable conversations. 

My questions are:
1.) Is this normal at all to not give employees much background info on their new supervisors who are outside hires and fail to acknowledge how the transition will work or even introduce them to the new supervisor?

2.) He hates confrontation and tries to avoid it at all costs acting as a peacemaker hoping problems will go away by avoidance or by saying whatever will make people happy. Should I confront him about avoiding me and ask if I did something wrong or simply ask for more info on my new supervisor and how this transition will work or do neither and try to just figure it out on my own which will probably leave me frustrated?

3.) Should I confront him about his lies/misleading things he told me when he hired me last year and tell him how it is hurtful and/or simply re-ask for honest feedback on what areas he feels I need to improve in?

I have had a very good relationship with him the past year and met with him regularly as his assistant last year, but now feel like he does not appreciate my work like he says he does and it feels like I am being replaced by the new person (who he is now spending lots of time w/ since she is new) and being left out of the loop. My current job pays very low (like below poverty level at a white collar job) as it is an internship so he knows that if he wants me to stay here long term he would have to promote me to a full time position, so clearly he doesn't value my work enough to want to keep me around since he just passed on the opportunity to do so. My last job was only 9 months due to a layoff, so I ideally want to tough it out and work another year here so I don't have two &lt;1 yr jobs on my resume in a row."

I'm going to be a junior this year. I think I'm doing fairly alright so far: I have some decent personal projects and two internships, though my GPA could be better. However, all this on the resume will only get me to the interview. In the interview itself, I'm really worried I'm going to completely mess up the technical section.

I am pretty comfortable with data structures, though I was not very good at all in my algorithms class. I know *about* most of the things I learned: backtracking, dynamic programming, etc. but I cannot seem to solve any problems on them whatsoever. For most dynamic programming problems, I end up solving it in the naive/greedy way, and get a time complexity of O( 2^N ) instead of O( N^2 ). I *know* what I'm supposed to do, memoize, memoize, save the data in 2D-arrays, but I just can't seem to code the solution. When I see the solution online, I understand it perfectly, but I can't come up with the recurrence relations or anything like that on my own. And even in data structures, I need to brush up on some questions like ""Check if a tree is balanced"".

I decided I'll give Leetcode a try this summer and it's been a trainwreck. I got a few problems right and the rest completely off. I couldn't work on it too much because of my internship/personal projects/other life stuff, but I think I gave it a fair shot and I am very disappointed in my abilities. I can't even seem to motivate myself to finish the problems I don't get because I think to myself, ""Oh, if I could just use this library..."" or ""This is crap! It's a linked list, why can't I call Java's iterator class!"" and don't end up learning anything. For my previous internships, I was still new and they knew it, so I got asked really easy stuff like, ""Difference between inheritance and polymorphism"", ""Code the power function"" and stuff like that. Plus, I was allowed to write most of the ""code"" in pseudocode so I could focus more on logic than the syntax. I don't think it'll be the case now since I'm a junior.

I don't know... I blew my chance because now that school is starting soon all my time will go away in classes/projects. I'm also studying for grad school so that's more time gone. And interview season is coming up soon.

Any help/advice would be appreciated guys. Just seem very down lately.

I just built my first PC. All new over budget rig.  Here is the parts list in case my issues stem from it.

CPU: Intel - Core i9-7900X 3.3GHz 10-Core Processor  ($969.99 @ Amazon)
CPU Cooler: Corsair - H115i 104.7 CFM Liquid CPU Cooler  ($139.99 @ Amazon)

Storage: Samsung - 960 Pro 2TB M.2-2280 Solid State Drive  ($1198.97 @ Amazon)
Storage: Western Digital - BLACK SERIES 2TB 3.5"" 7200RPM Internal Hard Drive  ($118.89 @ OutletPC)
Video Card: MSI - GeForce GTX 1080 Ti 11GB SEA HAWK X Video Card  ($804.98 @ Newegg)
Case: Corsair - 760T White V2 ATX Full Tower Case  ($165.98 @ Newegg)
Power Supply: Corsair - 1200W 80+ Platinum Certified Fully-Modular ATX Power Supply
Operating System: Microsoft - Windows 10 Pro Full 32/64-bit  ($189.00 @ B&amp;H)

Now this is my second Seahawk X 1080ti.  The first one I had to RMA because of an internal issue that caused the fan to scream scratching on something in the first 5 min of installing it. Newegg took it back and sent me the one I have now, and a new issue occurred. I was in the middle of a game of League of Legends, it was on highest settings but not the most demanding game. In the middle of the game the screen froze half Purple and half the game, in a very jagged manner not an even partition. And then total PC shutdown. Upon reboot the graphics card was not sending any signal. Various times over and just blank. Could not get to into BIOS nor OS screens.  So I looked around and saw that my MB had a new BIOS that helped with more device support and stability as of last week. I flashed that Bios to my MB hoping that maybe it would solve whatever the issue is. But i still did not get anywhere.

I manage about 1 in every 30 reboots now to be able to get into BIOS or into a Windows Recovery mode. Where I can sometimes then continue into Safe Mode, or sometimes boot windows completely. But most of the time the quick restart before going into safe or normal windows, results into my issue again.    And that is with the other 29 failures my MB led screen says ""Load VGA BIOS"". Compatibility wise I know the rig was working previously, for a solid week with lots of gaming I had everything running great. After this crash through, I can not seem to get the video signal, and I continue to see the ""Load VGA BIOS"".

I did contact support to see what the issue may be, but to no resolve so far, I do not have any other spare parts to test things, as it is my first build. I built this PC and took it abroad with me for an Internship in South America. So with the suggestion to RMA the card, comes a lot of Shipping fees back to the US and an unlikely return of my card to me until I go back to the US in Several months, rendering my build useless even longer, and I already feel shitty holding this i9 and hardly being able to use it since launch to watch all the other processors come out.

I had read about flashing the BIOS, I am not sure if that is the MSI approved solution here, nor me being a novice can complete it. I was thinking I could try the MSI Live Update maybe? but when i previously tried to install it it said that it ""Does Not Support This Platform"". So I am looking for what other simple tips and tricks I can try to work through the issue. In my very very few instance where I can get to Windows or my Bios, maybe there is something from there where I can try to remedy the error.

Thanks in advanced for any and all help/suggestions


Some things I have also done:
- Put the Graphics card in a different PCI-E slot
-Boot up with no USB devices connected
-Updated Nvdia Drivers
-Reset MB BIOS to Factory Default
-Unconnected and reconnected all Power cables to Graphic card

6vj774,0,2017-08-23,Arrested with about 1g of weed and a grinder.,tisMisterPolo,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6vj774/arrested_with_about_1g_of_weed_and_a_grinder/,"So I was driving home around 1am a few weeks ago and I was pulled over for driving a little carelessly. I was speeding and just barely crossing the double yellow. I'll admit it was stupid, but there was 1am and no one was around (so I thought). 
Long story short I got booked with
1. Reckless driving
2. speeding
3. not having a license (although it was in the car I was just too nervous when trying to find it)
4. 1 gram of weed
5. paraphernalia (grinder)
After they told me to get out of the car I pretty much admitted to having the bud in the car because I didn't want to lie and make things worse for myself. I know I can not consent to a search and all that but in the moment I was nervous. About 7 cop cars pulled up for this nonsense, meanwhile the whole time they were thanking me for being so cooperative and I had normal conversations with a few of them. So when they found the stuff, they arrested me saying ""sorry we have to do this"" and then proceeded to cuff me and bring me to the station in one of their cars. I then got there and took two sets of mugshots and they took my fingerprints. After about two hours of waiting in a cell for ""paperwork to be done"" they said since I was so cooperative that they would drive me back to my car, because who am I gonna call at 3am?

Before bringing me back, the cop mentioned that he wouldn't have a problem telling the judge that I was cooperative and that he'd basically put in a good word for me. He also said ""don't worry about the driving charges"" implying that they would be... I don't know, removed? 

Regardless, I'm coming here to ask you guys what I should do. Should I try and get a lawyer? Even assuming that the driving charges get removed, I will also get conditional discharge. Meaning they will be looking at me and performing random drug tests for a whole year. And once that year is up and I'm clean, they will remove the charge from my record. My problem is that I won't be able to get an internship next summer if this charge is there for a whole year. I've heard of people having their conditional discharge reduced to 6 months, but I'm not sure whether or not that was done with the help of a lawyer. I obviously do not want my parents to find out (and I've took all the precautions to ensure they do not) so I do not want to ask them for help. It's very clear that they would be extremely upset if they knew this happened. What should I do?

On a side note, my license was in the car when they searched it and I was still given a ticket for not having a license. I just couldn't find it myself right away.

Some background on me and the job:

I'm a senior graduating Dec 2018 with a major in finance and minor in economics from a non target in MA(if we're talking BB's, the job posting was on my school career board). I have a pretty strong 3.6 overall GPA. This summer was my first internship experience doing business development at an energy company doing all kinds of research in hopes of starting a new company, so it was pretty engaging and entrepreneurial work.

The job was posted on my schools career board looking for intern analyst for this coming fall. 

What I'm looking for advice on is how to get my name into the firm before just cold applying to try to stand out if my name pops up.

I was wondering if cold emailing employees at the firm in hopes of seeing if they'd take a call from me or review my resume would be the right course of action before I apply. What I'm not sure is who to actually email. I'm assuming I shouldn't email the lady from HR who's email is on the job posting, should I try analysts, associates, or directors? Should I try multiple people with the same title or would that look bad if they talked to eachother and saw I tried their coworkers aswell? 

IF I was able to get a call with an employee would the best questions be regarding how they got into VC, what they do at blank company, general questions?

They invest primarily in healthcare and tech, would my investing in public bio tech and healthcare companies be something appealing to bring up?

Thanks for any help or advice you guys have "

6vkvrj,39,2017-08-23,"FYI to graduating seniors, start applying now",NotTheBizness,UCSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/6vkvrj/fyi_to_graduating_seniors_start_applying_now/,"I know this applies to almost all STEM majors, but I'm sure it does to non-STEM too. Bigger companies that have entry-level engineer/accountant/developer/chemist/management/etc. positions start posting their class of 2018 jobs right about now. The companies will generally interview in Sept/Oct/Nov and send out offers in Nov/Dec/Jan. I know this from experience. Additionally, drug testing usually occurs right around an offer letter so be prepared for that before like early December/January to relieve your own stress.

**Why are companies posting now?**

Well, mainly because this is when semester systems start. Companies budget to recruit at this time every year, for travel expenses, hours for employees, etc. Also, it's better to secure positions early on than wait to the last minute and administrative stuff takes a while on the company side.

**Where do I go to find these jobs?** 

1. Google: ""[Company name] careers""

2. Either:

a. Go to search jobs and query ""entry-level engineer/accounting/chemistry/etc."" A lot of times the entry-level positions are leadership development/engineering development/sales development/whatever titles and the qualifications will say ""Graduate with a B.S/B.A in whatever by June 2018.""

OR

b. Find a tab that says ""University Recruiting"" or something similar on the careers page, it'll usually link to the job title.

As one for an example, that I know for sure already has some posted, google ""Nestle Purina careers."" 

**But why should I be applying to these jobs right now?**

Because it's better to get an offer early on than wait until the last minute. Companies are more prone to hire early than later, it is just a better investment of their time. You can accept an offer in December and rescind it if you get a better one later on, that's business (I did it twice last year, no problems for me whatsoever).

**Why are you writing this u/NotTheBizness?**

It seemed like a lot of people in my graduating class did NOT know when to apply. Lots were scrambling toward the end of the year with the realization that they'd missed lots of opportunity by dragging their feet. Three of the four people in my senior design group did not have an offer by the end of the year, I don't know if it was just my group or not but that was concerning to me. I'm just trying to spread some knowledge and hopefully alleviate some stress for your future selves.

Ask me questions if you want, I've applied to a shit ton of jobs but I'm no expert on resumes. I can always take a look though.

Also: internships get posted a bit later, usually, but it doesn't hurt to start looking now."

So it is only my second year of college, but I am considered a junior, and I will graduate in two years.  I am between two or three different options for the moment.  I want to be either a veterinarian, a zoology professor, or a medical illustrator.  However, this isn't about that.

I was recently offered a job that I must keep for at least a year.  This job is at the university veterinary hospital. It would mostly be administrative work, but it would definitely provide me with the connections to the doctors (possibly shadowing) in the hospital as well as build my resume in a fantastic way.

 However, the problem is that I must keep it for a year, so I would not get the chance to get an internship during the summer, unless there is a local part-time internship nearby the place of work.  

I am debating this so heavily since I was going to be searching for an internship this summer that would allow me to explore my interests in at least one of the fields that I am interested in.  So I am going to make a Pros and Cons list below:


**Pros**

* Money
* Experience in a veterinary setting
* Possible opportunities to shadow veterinarians
* May be able to take Summer Classes
* May be able to take art classes in order to explore medical illustration
* May be able to get a part-time internship
* May decide that I do not wish to work at a veterinary hospital
* May help me get into vet school if I decide to go there.

**Cons**

* Will not be able to get a full-time internship
* Probably will not be able to get a part-time internship
* The Job is only 20-30 hours a week, every other week.
* Will have to stay in college town (not be able to visit family or friends at home)
* Will be pretty much alone in apartment and college town.
* Only have two summers left for internships

So this is what I have thought of. If you have more, or input of any kind, I would love to hear it. I am only a college student so I do not have a ton of life experience with this kind of stuff. 

I hope everyone can help! I will be able to answer questions as well.

Would like to know how to navigate applications that explicitly ask about ever being terminated, and how to respond if it ever comes up in an interview



So, I just graduated with a CS degree in May 2017 and had a web dev job offer before school was over. I excitedly accepted, even though the pay was very low. The company was small: mostly interns, hourly wage-makers, and was heavily outsourced. Prior to  accepting, they informed me that the position was at-will and could be terminated at any time without warning. Ok.

Half way through the trial period, I had one progress review, where the managers got together and told me they thought I was doing a great job and loved how I jumped right in (they kept apologizing for not training me, saying it was a busy month. I had no qualms, I was just happy to be employed). 

Last week, at the end of the day on Friday, without any indication that I was performing poorly or on thin ice or anything of the sort, they called me into a meeting the managers were having and informed me that ""it wasn't working out."" Of course, my stomach dropped, and I asked what their reasoning was, to which they responded, ""Our lawyer said it would be best if we didn't tell you."" I've never been fired before, so I didn't know that they could do that (still don't tbh).

They also had me sign some papers, which after I got home and read, I realized released them from any lawsuit stemming from the termination. I thought these were resignation papers or something, so that was a mistake. 

To the best of my knowledge, everyone at the company enjoyed me very much, less my supervisor, who, at best, was indifferent to me. I had made efforts to constantly improve at my job despite little to no training. 

Now I'm on the job hunt, I've decided to leave the job off my resume and just use my coursework and internship as my experience (School just started, so it just looks like I'm a new grad who took the summer for vacation). I keep running into applications that ask me if I've ever been fired in the past 7 years and to explain why. 

What do I say? I have absolutely nothing to work with. What should I say if my last job comes up in an interview? Would my last job come up in a background check?
Any advice would be super helpful!"

I am struggling to decide if I should accept it. Here are some of my hesitations

1) The job location is less than ideal. Although I am from the Midwest and went to school here, I would like to move away for a few years at least. In fact, in a perfect world I would love to find a job in northern California or Colorado, somewhere new.  However, my offer is for rural Illinois at worst, or one of the most distant suburbs of Chicago at best, neither of which is particularly appealing. 

2) My first three years on the job will be spent in a rotational program gaining experience with multiple engineering divisions. This sounds cool at first but it would prevent me from really settling down. I would have to move apartments every 6-8 months as I rotate between rural Illinois and the Chicago suburbs. Again, not super appealing to me. 

3) Perhaps the most important is that I do not feel particularly passionate about the work. I suspect that I could ""learn to love it"" but I think I would rather explore another, more appealing industry. 

Why am I even considering the job? Let me tell you,

1) This offer is over $10K more than what the average bachelors degree graduate of my major makes straight out of college.

2) The employee's at this company are, for the most part, quite happy. They are compensated well, pleased with their benefits package, enjoy what they do and generally make the office a pleasant place to be. This means a lot for maintaining a positive company culture. 

3) I have no guarantee that I will receive another job offer before graduation or that it will be at high paying as this one. "

I also wasn't mature enough, didn't know how I fit into the world and what I wanted. 

After highschool I got three things that I needed badly: life experience, a sense of independence and an understanding of what I want. 

I felt isolated, directionless and hopeless in highschool, that was due partially to my shortcomings in people skills and that I wasn't surrounded with anyone with more than a passing interest in technology. At some point it dawned on me that all of this work I've been doing, all of my energy networking, working and expanding my skillset has been to one end: to surround myself with smart people doing challenging things.

I think that the best thing I can do while I'm still in my prime years (I'm currently 20, going on 21) is to go back to school and study Mathematics. I'm always going to be teaching myself things and without a confident grasp in complex Mathematics some things are going to be out of reach. I also want to be an asset to a research team so I can contribute to the field rather than simply appropriating it's tools. 

There's nothing more that I want than to be surrounded with smart people doing challenging things and to learn from them, I want it as much as air because no man is an island. I'm looking for advice on becoming a stronger applicant for a strong Mathematics program like what you'd find at MIT, CMU, Urbana Champaign, Stanford, etc. I'm willing to do anything necessary to make this happen.

Thank you all in advance for your advice."

I am an incoming Master's student studying Computer Science in Los Angeles, and will finish my degree next June. Also did undergrad in CS, and plan to live here afterwards. I have done two internships in the past (market rate pay) and some part-time work (horrible student pay, minimum wage kinda stuff). After I graduate, I would ideally obtain a part-time software development position (20-30 hours a week) that pays enough so that I can live comfortably ($50-70k?, just an apt with roommates, cheap living). I am also open to free-lancing and contracting, but I am more fearful of being a contractor over a part-time employee because of the lack of job security (not saying part-time employees have job security, they just have more of it). Remote or on-site doesn't matter to me, though remote is preferred of course. Full-time is not an option for me as I wish to have time to pursue other things more important to me. 

I have one last year as a student to study everything I can and build as many applications as I can. What programming languages do you guys recommend I work with to obtain a part-time software development position? What is most in demand? Currently, I have the most experience with C++ and Python. I have also worked with PHP, Java, Scala, and Javascript before, but am less familiar with these programming languages. In my research, it seems that web development and mobile development is where it's at for these types of positions, but I'd like some more insight. Thank you!"

I'm a CS/Math double major. Like the title says, I'm not sure whether going straight to grad school vs going into industry is a good choice for me. So I'm going to describe my background and hopefully those more experienced will help me decide.

My academic credentials (oh boy this is like posting on CC all over again):

**College:** Liberal Arts (always touted itself as one of the top, but quite frankly I don't think my school is all that; CS program here sucks - but I'm going off topic)

**GPA:** 3.8/4.0

**GRE:** 163(Q), 163(V) (just took this recently so I don't know what my writing score is)

**ECs/On-campus jobs:** (do grad schools even care?) TA grader, tutor for intro CS classes; e-board member of CS club

**Summer internships:**

I did a summer internship in a rather well-known CS company my sophomore year. But that's the only plus on my professional resume. This past summer, I decided to switch gears and applied for summer research programs on other college campuses (my college is liberal arts so lol what is research) but didnt get anything. So I settled for an on-campus ""energy data analyst"" position (which quite frankly is a waste of my time and didn't add anything significant to my resume). 

I can't do a thesis this coming year because we have quite a few professors going on sabbaticals this year, leaving for better colleges, etc. so our department head decides to just cancel the thesis program for seniors. Yeah. Great.

I always thought I would go straight into industry but recently I changed my mind and now I want to get a graduate degree. Reason is I got onto ML/Data Science hype train and looking at job listings for ML engineers/Data Scientists, most of them require MS/PhD level of education. I loved my grad-level NLP and ML classes (which by the way I took at a nearby college NOT my own - we have a consortium program with these other colleges which allows me to take classes within these colleges) and I would love to get more in-depth regarding the subject matter. 

Given this rather mediocre background, I'm hoping to get into a well-respected Master's program in CS (with emphasis on ML/NLP). I might do a PhD later if I decide I enjoy academia but that's for future me to decide.

To complicate matters, I just got contacted recently by a recruiter at a big CS tech company that I would love to work for. So now, I'm considering applying for industry jobs. Should I apply for industry jobs alongside with apply for grad schools? Or should I focus on applying to grad schools only? What is reach/safety list of grad schools that I can realistically apply to?

Sadly, I am finding it very difficult to move into one since the only jobs that seem to be available to me have to do with tech sales or recruitment.. which depresses me even further, since neither are close to what I ideally wanted to work in. If all the entry level jobs to do with IT require a computer science degree and additional years of training, then why even have a degree like mine? I can't even apply to freaking IT manager internships as apparently my studies and experiences are not ""relevant"" at all to the job... ? 

Another confusion I have is all the entry level analyst jobs available. A lot of the job descriptions seem to suggest that even for an entry level position your knowledge of SQL, Python as well as Excel needs to be on at least an intermediate level? I was under the impression that no courses at university really touched upon these things properly unless again you were majoring in computer science specifically, yet they still claim that they accept applications from my field? 

Has anyone here studied information technologies and management or a similar degree? And if so, where are you working right now? Consulting? I really have no idea what the heck I can do with this degree or where can I work... All of the knowledge I've accrued seems to be so useless that I'd have to go and get additional training and certification and pay for it again in order to land a job. I really do not want to resort to working in tech sales or recruitment since that seems to be the only field that wants to hire useless graduates like myself..."

I'm currently doing an internship in a little business (50 employees) and the sysadmin having problems to create a reference image with Windows 10. The technic he used with Windows 7 didn't work anymore with Windows 10.

Before to begin, I will explain what is the purpose of these image and how they proceed. The company provides a specific Machine for their client wich comes with some computers to act as server and client for their software that control the machine.

For the computer they ship to their clients, their sysadmin make a base model of these with all the setting they wants. They basically create 2 local account, costum each account with their specific sauce and they install the most software they can without having any problems with licences. Then he create a system image with the windows tools for backup purpose and he do another on a USB key to act as reference image. 

After this, he use the one saved on a USB as recovery when they have a new one to install. After the system boot, he do a sysprep, answer the oobe, delete the new account created, adjust language settings, install the more specific software and ship the computer to their clients. 

I lot things seems to be a bit wrong in these procedure, but that's worked fine until they tried the same thing with Windows 10. 


First problems, he wasn't able to use the windows 7 tools to create an image system. For this, I simply download windows ADK and read the new documentation about how to create a reference image. I simply used the new command lines utility dism to capture the image with winPE. That's worked fine, but I switched to dell image assist, because my boss find it more easy to use and like the fact where we can ship a gold image to dell later.

Now the problems I have it's with the **&amp;&amp;-&amp; Windows store. Because I create two local account if I do any update to the system I got a bunch of error with sysprep. I checked the log and Googled for it. It's seems I have to unprovisionning* every apps on each account like candycrush... . I tried to search a workaround, but just before I was to give a status to my boss I find in a VM where I didn't do any update  something wrong. On one of the account I created(the one where I didn't run sysprep) before the sysprep the start menu is totally broke.

I read about this issue on technet and the answer of Microsoft was something like it's not supported anymore. 

Do you guys have find a workaround for this? I was wondering if I boot into audit mode in the first boot and log into the default account and do their costum and add some syncronous command to my answer files to create the 2 account they want (it's basically the same account with the same proprieties except with is a local administror.) If it's gonna work or i read something about a copyprofile parameters in the answer file, but I didn't really understand what this thing really do and how to use it. 

If some of you guys can help me it's will be really appreciate. And sorry if my grammar is bad. I'm not a native English speaker so I tried to do my best. 

If you think I'm doing something wrong I'm all open.

First year of teaching (full-time intern) and I'm getting excited!

Username checks out: I have a severe (anaphylactic, airborne, Epi-Pen slingin') food allergy to peppers (the vegetable, not the ground-up spice) in all colors and hotnesses. Growing up in a pepper-free house, it's been made depressingly clear to me how often the rest of the world enjoys peppers. 

Anyways, I asked my supervising teacher if I had to leave my Epi-Pen with the school nurse, which was the protocol when I was a student. She said she wasn't actually sure since nobody on the staff has an allergy, and told me I could leave it in my bag...which to me just screams potential lawsuit (I also keep Benadryl with me, which I take for minor reactions). I have an extra one I can leave with the nurse so it's no skin off my back (although heaven forbid if the nurse steps out for a minute), but how does your school deal with teacher prescriptions/medical needs throughout the day?

Also: is there any potential issues that come from telling students/how to explain it tactfully? Is it appropriate to teach students, or have the nurse show them, how to use an epi-pen? I HAVE to tell students since it's airborne and common enough that they could bring it in, but I teach newcomer ELLs and specificity of language is key here. They're high schoolers, so they can handle being told (most of) the details. 

I have only ever had one reaction at school and in the end no epi-pen was required (though a school nurse would DEFINITELY stick me with it), but it severely impairs my self-judgement and would scare students if they were caught unaware. 

Thanks!"

I worked full time as a manager at Mcdonalds for 4 years trying to make ends meet and taking out loans because i believed that one day that this'll all be worth it. It was hard seeing all my classmates not exhausted because they didn't have to work 50+ hours a week. It was also hard seeing the limited internships taken by them as well. I would have loved to have an internship but never had the opportunity to do so. I eventually graduated and moved with my girlfriend to another state because she had a job lined up after her graduation. I searched and searched and created an excel spreadsheet, it took 100 applications to finally find something and the best job i could get was working part time at a bank, it's a physically exhausting job because the only reason i was hired was to run back and forth all day between the lobby and drive thru.

6vrx0p,1,2017-08-24,Ode To Gi2c or My Love Poem For The Biggest China Internship Scam Ever...,abuginmybagel,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/6vrx0p/ode_to_gi2c_or_my_love_poem_for_the_biggest_china/,"**My China Internship Nightmare**

I wanted to find work in China,
So I went surfing on the internet you see.
In hopes of finding a new job and life,
When I saw the ads from Gi2c.

Call now for free details,
The ad beckoned to me.
What the hell I thought,
The call and info are both free!

So I clicked on the chat line,
And a friendly girl Mary attended to me.
“You’re so lucky” she insisted,
That I stumbled across Gi2C!

She told great stories of others
Who found back door jobs you see
That are only available in China
With companies connected with Gi2c.

But to get my foot in their door,
I’d have to prove myself first as an intern.
And if I didn’t hurry, I ‘d have to stand in line,
To wait months for my turn.

As luck would have it she said,
A huge MNC had only one vacancy.
She urged me to rush her “right now”,
My current photo and CV.

I was so darn excited,
I did exactly as she said,
Then I tossed and turned-trying to sleep,
As I thought of my great future in China ahead.

Wow, to be working so soon in China…
With a huge international MNC…
This would surely be, the very best thing,
That ever happened to me!!!

She called me again to talk some more,
As she read to me a great job description.
It sounds like my dream job for sure,
I didn’t know it would be science fiction.

So I paid my $300 deposit – no problem,
For me it sounded like a very good deal.
Besides she said the deposit was “refundable”
Not one they would ever steal.

Then the truth started to drip out,
When I learned the total cost…
$3,400 more they wanted me to pay,
My temper I completely lost!

Then I learned that another $1,500
I would have to pay for my air fare.
And $1,000 more for 90 days of meals,
Not to mention $500 for daily subway fare.

My own apartment would cost another $1,500
But she said not to worry one bit,
Because I would be earning $60,000 a year,
With the new China job I would get!

She sent me great links of video testimonials,
Of a dozen happy clients of Gi2c from the past.
How the hell was I supposed to know…
These great actors were very well cast?

One even called me on the telephone,
Who told me he now worked with the BBC
For $5,000 dollars a month and only because,
Of the great internship he got from Gi2c.

I took the bait - hook, line and sinker,
I sent in my $3,400 with such great hopes.
But when I arrived in Beijing, I soon met
More than a dozen other angry dopes.

Within two weeks we were all mad as hell,
Only three in our group got what was promised.
The rest of us were just baited and switched,
Frankly I have never been so thoroughly pissed!

A refund I demanded, on a daily basis,
But they just made excuses for me.
The even suggested that I “misunderstood”
Mary’s many promises to me.

The company where they sent me,
Was surely no international MNC,
But a Chinese finance company
That just used and exploited me.

“Marketing Specialist” was my job they said,
But spamming emails in English was my true role.
I was also asked to make copies, coffee, and deliveries.
With each day my anger was growing and taking its toll.

After three weeks I said “Enough is Enough”
I didn’t get an expensive Master degree for this!
I demanded a refund and told Gi2C
My big fat ass they could kiss!

If I didn’t get one I would call in the cops.
And show them this scam operation.
That’s when the Russian boss finally said,
Please calm down, and you’ll get my cooperation.

Without making a scene at their office,
I would have been screwed over for sure.
I finally got my refund , but only because
I threatened to make a big public stir.

Maybe 30% of their interns are happy,
But the other 70% surely are not.
What we were all promised on the phone,
Was not even close to what we got.

So be warned my fellow uni graduates,
Smoke and mirrors is what you’ll get at Gi2c
They sell you a dream of a really great job,
So please learn this costly lesson from me…

Get a real China internship by going direct,
To the HR department of a big International company,
Explain what you want in your email letter and resume,
And you will get a real internship – absolutely FREE!

The HR officer will be truly sincere and honest,
And hide nothing about the internship from you.
They’ll even say if a real job will be waiting,
If you do a good job, when the internship is through.

I now wish you the best in your job hunt,
As I bid all of you farewell.
I truly regret my call to Gi2c,
My first step in a journey through hell.

Originally I was hired for an IT internship. However I finished their tasks for the summer only a couple weeks in. The culture/ hr person who hired had an idea for an internal company website. She asked me if I could build it (knowing I had a CS background) and I said yes. 

Fast forward to my last day (today), the project is all done and ready to launch.  They mentioned a couple features that they want added. Realistically I told them I cannot add them and they responded by asking if I wanted to contract for them to maintain the website. It would be a great opportunity to make some side money during the current semester. I have never done anything like this before so my question is... 

What should my rate be? Should I go for the buddy buddy price or should I get paid like a normal contractor? (I currently make $18/hr) 


Thank you!"

I enjoy your stories, learned a few new tricks and now I think it's time to give it back. But before I start with my work and internship tales, I might as well warm up with the stuff people call me to do off the clock. In Brazil, *gambiarra* (jury-rigging, kludging) is often the main method of solving problems. Proper tools are expensive and take space, you know?

Setting: This was 3-4 months ago, working at my current job (head of IT by default on a credit union), and due to reasons I won't bore you with the details, I am moving out to a small flat in secret with just the bare essentials on my backpack and considering there's a big chance I won't be able to retrieve my old stuff. Nobody knows where I am until the next day.

So I sign the paperwork, pay the landlord, home sweet home. First things first, unpack my stuff, check if my notebook is still working, and hunt for Internet. Quickly I learn that the landlord's son, $InternetLord, provides wireless internet to the tenants via several access points, just pay him and give him your MAC Address so he can unlock you on the AP that's closest to your flat. He knows his stuff. Later I connect, try to access the AP, and I see the guy had installed Tomato on those. He really knows his stuff, so I guess I won't have problems with the wireless.

Cue the Internet dropping like crazy, I see the AP going on and off repeatedly, so naturally I want to check the thing myself. Huh. Never saw that brand. I talk to my new neighbors, they say that AP is acting up like that recently, but otherwise $InternetLord provides rock-solid Internet, so that he's already providing replacements, he already had depleted his reserves due to a recent lightning strike. But in the meantime it meant 1-3 days until he got his hands into a tomato-able AP, so we should hang on.

No sir, I am not hanging on. I am alone without books friends family and Samurai Jack. Other tenants are law and medicine college students so they're throwing a fit, too. With $InternetLord's clearance, I give it a try. Hmm, the power button won't hold itself on so someone rolled a bunch of electrical tape around it, seen it before. Now on my toolbox... oh right, bare essentials, I only brought a testing screwdriver which fortunately fits to open the thing. Now on the metal assembly that holds the switching mechanism... oh my, someone pried it open before, and left it quite a mess. There's missing pieces, so I can't fix it outright. I might be able to improvise a mechanism to bridge it with a clip, but... bare essentials, remember? I didn't brought even the MacGyver toolbox. No luck finding a piece of wire to improvise either. Since I can't fix the mechanism, I need to wedge the contacts into the ON position.

I turn my backpack upside down and comb through everything to see if there's anything I can use. Look, a toothpick. That will do. I do some experimenting using the toothpick to hold the contacts in place... Too soft, too frail, not enough wood, but we're getting somewhere, so I have a plan. Finding a suitable piece of hardwood, carve it, and put in there. Off to the kitchen!

About the knives... only butter knifes and a very dull knife. I don't have a whetstone. Guess I'll have to sharpen it on the kitchen counter... oh, looks like previous tenant already tried it, given the scratches. It's made of some sort of plastic, not marble or steel. A piece of ceramic isn't cutting it either, it's too dull and dented. Looks like I need a rock. After some walking I manage to find two rocks, some gravel, a piece of lumber, and just in case I got a glob of dried sap. Whoever cleans those flats and surroundings take their job seriously.

I give up on sharpening the knife and go full caveman, trying to fit the pieces of wood and gravel on the switch so it would hold the contacts firmly, breaking, pressing, flinting and polishing them so they would fit snugly into the metal enclosure. Once I got a good fit, stuck in a bit of the dried sap just so the metal cover of the switch assemble would press down the bits of rock and wood so it would not let go easily. Give it a good shake to make sure it's stable, plug in the power... It's alive! Wait for connection, shake it a bit more to see if it's wobbly... all good. I plug it back on its original place, ask the neighbors to test it and... great, it works! Everybody rejoices and quickly established myself as the computer guy. ($InternetLord won't bother with anything that is not his Internet)

It lasted until it got replaced almost a week later, and he wanted to talk to me about it. Gave him the full disclosure, if he wanted me to pay for damages I was okay with it... nah, he was cool with it, just asked to always ask him first before doing anything. A previous tenant tried something before on that AP on their own, which explains the damage it had.

TL;DR: Shiny rock not making smoke signal for evolved man. Evolved man only has rock and wood. Evolved man ask Krug to make very small fire on shiny rock. Fire so small Krug not even see it, evolved man says Krug did it. Krug not understand shiny rock, but Krug can see shiny rock was hit with big club by neanderthal. Evolved man share old berry juice with Krug.

Two nights ago I was hurting badly after a whole series of shitty things happened. My partner's friend spewed some awful, dishonest garbage on facebook over a conversation about renting a room. I wasn't even a part of it. I lost a friend by doing literally nothing.

My boss essentially told me that I won't get a job in the department I've been diligently interning full time for. I've been wasting my time chasing yet another job I won't get. In fact, I haven't had a paid job since 2008, they've all been volunteer positions or internships. A quick glance of my resume screams ""pushover"". I have the patience to pursue unpaid internships for years and the technical skills to match, but there never seems to be any money for me. McFuckingDonalds turned me down.

My landlord says I owe money, even though the paper trail and math prove I don't. For months, I've asked her to fix the bathroom plumbing, the black mold, the doors. At one point none of the doors locked (which only changed after WE installed new locks). Someone could have broken in during the four months I was there. So I moved out. I've been moving for two weeks straight. Of course, no one helped me move. Why would they? Everyone I ask is always busy enough to not help, but not busy enough to smoke weed and play GTA all night.

My partner has no car, so I drive her to work. I work with her. I literally spend my life with her (99% of the time it's fun) but sometimes I want space. So when we got in an argument and she stormed out of the house I just fucking lost it. 

It always feels like I can't complain or speak my mind. I always seem to be wrong. I always get my feelings downplayed and dismissed. I always seem like a second thought. Tolerated. 

When I do say anything, I make people extremely uncomfortable, and they're always surprised and defensive. Hence, I'm a massive pushover. When it comes to asserting my needs, I'm a professional at bending over and taking it. People just walk all over me and have no clue how shitty they are to me. 

So there I was, sitting in my room having a panic attack (rare for me), making a noose out of some rope. Even though I could barely see through my tears, I tied the other end to something sturdy and just sat there, telling myself to put the rope around my neck and let it happen. The thing is though, the process took so long that I was too worn out to even lift my body to finish the task. I just sat with numb shaking hands and dissociated. She knocked on my door after some time to ask if I was ok, which scared me back into reality. 

I was so close to ending my life, and now life is so bland again. I can't feel anything. I'm just forcing a smile and faking everything I do. Everyone describes me as intelligent, empathetic, sweet, pragmatic, and mindful. They are traits the American society clearly doesn't value. People wonder how I'm unemployed, but I don't. They never wonder how I'm doing though, and I'm dying.

I'm drowning. Something inside me died, and it hurts so so badly. If I had a button in front of me that ended my life I would push it. "

6vvd9c,20,2017-08-24,Boyfriend (and only friend) of three years broke up with me. I just need to get this off my chest,chaoticspy,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/6vvd9c/boyfriend_and_only_friend_of_three_years_broke_up/,"This is my first post on reddit so please forgive any mistakes I make. I'm F 21 and he is M 24. I will refer to him as Alex.

TL;DR: This is going to be pretty long but like I said, I just need to get this off my chest. Alex was my only true friend and we related with each other so well. I was so sure he was the closest thing to a soul mate I would ever get. Now that he is gone I have no one to talk to about how I feel so I've decided to turn to Reddit. 

Alex and I met 3 years ago in college and hit it off right away. We shared a lot of common interests, we both lived in Wisconsin, and Alex was in the same career field as me which led to being in a lot of the same classes. A few months later when he was close to graduating he decided to break it off because he didn't want to deal with a long distance relationship. He was leaving to work out in the Northeast. I still had three years left of school so he didn't think we would see each other at all. I was upset that he would be so selfish. So, once he broke it off I tried to avoid him. Which was pretty difficult since we saw each other every day. After a few weeks I gave up and texted him. Maybe we couldn't date but we could spend the last few months as friends with benefits. He agreed and so we started hanging out and talking again. 

After he left, we remained in contact and after a few months of both of us still being single and him coming back home to Wisconsin to visit family we decided to try an open relationship. Once he got back to the Northeast he found a woman to fuck. It didn't work out so well for me. I tried going on a few dates but I was so very attached to Alex and only had eyes for him. One day he told me he was going to hang out with the woman but wasn't planning on having sex with her. He ended up lying. So, I gave him a choice. Either he can continue fucking that woman and forget about me and our friendship. Or he can forget the woman and have a serious relationship with me. He picked the serious relationship. He knew he hurt me by lying and wanted to make things better. That happened this spring. Once summer hit, I landed myself a summer internship that brought me only 3 1/2 hours away from him. I thought this would help ease his mind that we would be able to make long distance work. I visited him for a week and the beginning of summer and then I visited him two more times over a few weeks. He was planning on visiting me at the end of summer. 

We have always made sure that communication was an important part in our relationship and we were working on building our trust again. So when I started to feel anxious about our relationship and asked him if everything was fine still in case I was just overthinking the whole thing, I didn't think twice when he reassured me everythig was ok. 

A week later he insisted on driving to visit me. He let me make plans to go out to dinner, go camping, and to watch GOT. Once he got to my house though he sat me down and told me he wanted to break up. Everything was the same for him each time we met up and he was getting tired of it. I was so stunned by this. A week ago he said everything was fine and now he wanted to fucking break up!? Once again my trust in him was shattered. So... I sent his ass back home. I mean. Good for him for wanting to break up in person but fuck him for letting me think that our relationship wasn't in any danger. He wasn't at my home for more than 15 minutes when I sent him to drive the 3 1/2 hours back to where he came from and told him to never talk to me again. 

Relationship issues aside. We still have a lot in common. I was his best and only friend as much as he was mine. We both have no one else who understands us. It breaks my heart that I have to cut all ties this time. I don't connect with people very easily and I am now completely alone for the time being. But there's only so many times I can allow myself to make the same mistake."
6vvj47,50,2017-08-24,Advice for incoming freshmen interested in top grad schools - from an alumni,delicious_truffles,UCSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/6vvj47/advice_for_incoming_freshmen_interested_in_top/,"Context: An incoming freshman in CS sent me a PM.

&gt; what should I do in college that will help me get into a top grad school?

Letters of recommendation and research experience are crucial, nothing else really matters. Having actual published papers (first author or major contributions) or invited presentations is a cherry on top, it's rare for undergrads to have any, so don't worry about this too much. For many top PhD programs, simply having 4 worth of research experience with supporting letters of rec is sufficient to make you a running candidate, even if you don't have any great results.

&gt; I have Regents, so I get some research opportunities from the first quarter.

The best advice I have given that I know nothing about you, is to use your initial research opportunities to get good recommendations to open up future research opportunities and internships, and to learn and explore as widely as you can. There's an enormous variety of research out there, and it's very normal to completely switch your research focus several times, but as with many things in life, the sooner you can settle down, commit to a direction, and really push, the farther ahead you'll be than many many people.

A necessary side effect of learning and exploring widely is feeling like you aren't progressing anywhere. You will certainly be bored during some times and very frustrated at other times. Don't let this discourage you, it's part of the process.

&gt; How important are internships?

I recommend internships for general growth and experience. Crucially, you will eventually have to make the important decision between industry and academia, and it's wise to inform yourself of both sides as much as possible. There's no better way than internships to understand what working in industry is like, with regards to aspects ranging from how companies manage team projects to the lifestyle. Similarly, there's no better way to understand the academic world than doing research full-time during at least one summer.

CS internships can also help you quickly learn new skills. Through CS internships, I really honed the ability to build, scale, and maintain software projects, which has just been useful far more broadly than the actual meat of my undergrad CS internship work.

&gt; How do I get to know my professors really well without it being awkward?

The largest source of variance here is simply your professor's personality. But the basics will never hurt - being prepared and putting an honest effort whenever presenting or discussing your work with your professor, being polite and humble, etc.

&gt; How do I do valuable research, rather than being just another burden for professors?

The definition of valuable research that professors and grad students use is research that is publishable, and interesting enough to others to have a decent impact. From the perspective of professors and grad students, the primary thing that undergrads are useful for is essentially menial labor. Consider yourself fortunate that you're not in biology where this would confine you to being a wet lab slave for the majority of your undergrad years.

In CS, depending on your particular field of interest, it might be possible to provide expertise on interesting things like using particular tools, programming languages, etc. The key thing to capitalize on is that quality research at a bare minimum takes a lot of time that grad students and professors don't necessarily have amidst all their other responsibilities, as well as a confluence of expertise and insights from a large variety of perspectives. Grad students usually won't be as willing to learn new things as you will be, instead relying on skills they're bringing to UCSD from their undergrad years. These are opportunities to contribute to valuable research while also satisfying your interests: learning new things and making valuable contributions for good letters of rec."

I could just be having a bad day, but it's been a consistent bad day for a few years now, so...

I have a personal passion for making games, from mods, to level design, to working on tiny free games using various engines to making game art and just generally playing with ideas. I have a bit of a perfectionist problem which has kept me from posting a sheer majority of anything I've made, but I would put 100s of personal hours into a lot of personal projects.

At this point, I have a career spanning about 5-7 years in software development at this point (depending on what you count), with a bachelors degree in CS.

While in college, I could not snag an internship at any company and despite internship programs and having a high GPA, I never even made it to a phone interview until just before leaving college.

My first two and a half years working were at a large education corporation working on one of the many products there. It was dull, there was no moving departments, the commute was an hour both ways, and generally I felt depressed working there. A feeling that got worse as time progressed and made me start to question any joy in programming.

After that, I got hired into one of the larger tech companies (one of the Big 4) and moved out at a whopping pay rate (from where I was starting). In the end, that place was a nightmare. I was given a pager that would never stopped going off (24 hours a day), was consistently told I was being too slow and I needed 'mentoring' (even though everyone was so busy that it was impossible to get any 'mentoring'), the company culture was blatantly backstabby and it all culminated in a 40-hour work weekEND, a mental breakdown at the office, and a two-weeks notice. This was after a year and a quarter working there.

Then, I worked for myself for two years (basically willful unemployment). Those were a fun two years, and the only two years where I can say I accomplished anything. I was able to start (and fail) two personal game projects, participated in a few map-making contests, learned art for a while, and just did a whole bunch of creative endeavors using various game engines at the time. Yet I successfully made zero dollars the whole time and in the end had tons of failures; I had to find another job.

Then I got lucky. I finally got a job a game company, and it was right in the neighborhood from where I now lived! (I had to move somewhere small because living was too expensive where I was at previously). I interviewed, had an extremely easy interview (red flag), immediately got the job and... idk... there's a lot of problems with the place. No testing in place, no code reviews allowed (seriously?!), the pay is extremely weak (I had to negotiate UP to career starting pay basically), they make games too large in scope for what the company can maintain (we're talking MMO levels at a 10 person company), they continue to make games on top a framework that is DEAD (as in the group making the back-end engine is discontinued), they had layoffs, and just... every day I'm reminded I'm being put in way over my head and despite being one of the more experienced guys there, anything I recommend gets circumvented by an environment of egotistical people just not caring what I have to say... I've been there for about a year and a half now. I'm also working on side projects, but it's hard to keep the energy up when I'm drained on a daily basis...

I have a personal passion and I've proven that I can solve a lot of hard problems, and I enjoy solving problems with programming. And I love making games. I just don't know if I can stand it in a working capacity anymore. It really feels like the only quality I'm asked for with each company I've worked at is a willingness to take abuse (and at minimum, extreme boredom and skill stagnation). I also feel like I have more of a desire for creative challenges than technical ones and that taking a software job seems to stifle my personal ambitions. I can't even manage having a hobby, because spending 8+ hours a day programming keeps me too tired to want to do anything else when I get home.

I really don't know what to do, to be honest..."

I have one week left in my internship but received a full-time offer.  I think the comp package is good but I want to see what else is out there.  I have to reply to my offer by Oct. 7th.

1) Will I really be able to go through an entire recruiting process with at least a few companies in this span of time?  Seems pretty tight to me...

2) Additionally, will I be restricted to huge companies like FB/GOOG/etc?  I imagine it's very hard for smaller companies to commit to a candidate 9 months before their start date...

Thanks!"

edit: I just finished a big project at my internship which automated our daily financial sales reporting. It utilizes basically every aspect of Microsoft excel and is arguably some of the best work I've ever done. It took approximately one month to construct from scratch &amp; turns what used to take an hour every day plus a 6 hour rebuild every quarter into something which can be done in less than two minutes daily. I'm extremely proud of the final product &amp; our CFO said he was extremely impressed. Should I note this somehow on the resume?

Kind of a complex post here but I appreciate you taking your time to offer your opinions/guidance. My two main problems are:

1. Are there any classes I chose that aren't good/am I missing any valuable classes

2. When I take 2 upper divs at once, what are ones that aren't overwhelming and what classes require too much time or focus to take alongside another CS upper divs

The classes I am planning on taking are:

* 140A - Programming Languages

* ECS132 - Probability and Statistical Modeling for CS

* 122A - Algorithm Design and Analysis
* 122B - Algorithm Design and Analysis
* 150 - OS's and System Programming
* 154A - Computer Architecture
* 165A - Database Systems
* 165B - Database Systems
* 160 - Software Engineering
* 152A - Computer Networks
* 145 - Scripting Languages and Applications
* 163 - Information Interfaces

Anyway that's a pretty big list and I know its doubtful anyone reading this has taken this exact set of classes but I appreciate anything along the lines of ""don't take 132 with this prof"" or ""160 isn't a very useful class, maybe take 154 instead"" or ""try to take 165 before 122B"" or any other info. I'm going for a sort of general software engineering focus with a bit extra emphasis on databases. 

Another note is I'm trying to order the classes so classes that provide skills that might be more useful for internships are taken before classes that aren't as useful (I plan on taking Computer Architecture and OS/System Programming as a 4th year). Any opinions on that are also welcome.

Thank you for your time!

I just entered my 4th year of college, and am currently looking into potential career options and fields. A little bit about myself:

I'm currently an Applied Math major (concentration in CS) with a Stats minor at UC Berkeley. I have a ~3.0-3.1 GPA (I know, not that high) but no previous career experience due to immigration issues (work permit never got issued in time; couldn't take internships despite multiple offers). I took courses in Real, Numerical, and Complex Analysis, Time Series, Linear Modeling, Stochastic Processes, AI/Machine Learning, and Computing with Data. My current worry is that I have ZERO knowledge/background in Economics (didn't take a single course in Econ; didn't think I'd want to work in anything related to it). 

With my current ""specs,"" is working in finance a viable option for me? Thank you for your time."
6vxbwl,2,2017-08-25,Graduate within 2 years as a CS transfer? Can I and should I?,CheckItOutItsMe,UCSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/6vxbwl/graduate_within_2_years_as_a_cs_transfer_can_i/,"I have completed IGETC and according to the degree audit, I need to complete 25 courses before graduating. CSE 140L and CSE 141L are separate from CSE 140 and CSE 141 so really it's more like 23 courses. This means I can take 4 courses for 5 quarters and 3 courses for 1 quarter and graduate in 2 years.

Does this seem doable? Most of these classes are going to be upper division CSE courses and technical electives, so I'm not sure how easy it's going to be to take 4 major classes almost every quarter. I can't really do 3 major courses + 1 non-major because my only remaining non-major courses left are MCWP 50 (which I've heard is a lot of work) and my DEI course.

I'm also kind of apprehensive about trying to graduate within 2 years is that doing so will mean that I only have 1 more summer as a student. I'm aiming for an internship next summer, and that'll probably take most of my last break. I actually also want to study abroad for a summer, and I don't think that's as viable of an option if I've already graduated. If I can, I'd like to study abroad as a student of UCSD.

So basically does anyone know how hard it'd be for a CS transfer with 25/23 courses to graduate in 2 years. And if it IS doable, do you guys think I should? One part of me would like to graduate as soon as possible to save money and time, but another part of me really really wants to study abroad. Anyone have any advice?

Please read.",DacaBackUpPlan,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6w0bn8/september_deadline_approaching_long_post_but/,"Hey guys - Throw away account for personal reasons, however the September 5th deadline for DACA is approaching. Fast. I am afraid like most of the lurkers and posters here and I know that the decision for daca can go either way. I need some help.

A bit of background that will help you guys understand my situation a bit more - 
My family did NOT come here illegally. My dad came on a H1B visa, from a small country in the Middle East, and straightforwardly applied for his work permit, and for a Green Card. He was sponsored by his sisters husband (lets call him satan). During his proccess, Satan convinced my dad to send money to us for us to come to America, us being my mom, my little brother, and myself. Anyways, Satan saw the potential my dad had (he has 3 degrees, one of them being a Master's). And he essentially got jealous of him, my dad's lawyer was also Satan's long time friend and lawyer. So during the paperwork submittal proccess of my dads permanent status, the lawyer screwed with the papers and he ""lost"" the approval documentation for the work permit, and the USCIS lost the papers on their end as well. Even though my dad has all of the communication between the USCIS and him and his new lawyer (he got a new one once he found out) documented.

He filed FOIA requests multiple times and went after the government but each time with each lawyer my dad always got the ""we are looking for your papers"" answer from the government.

Now again - as I stated before neither me or my family came here illegally. We have stamped papers showing us admitted into the country legally, and we have stamped passports (non-American) stating our date of entry. So the legal loophole of ""WAITING"" lasted for years and years and years. When I entered the country I was 8 years old, and my little brother was 4. Neither of us had any idea that we technically had no status (that's what our lawyer calls it), since we didn't enter illegally, our papers for green card/citizenship were lost, and there was no end in sight. We basically didn't find out till 2015 when Obama issued the DACA order that we did not have any status in America. Alot of things started making sense to me at that point, why my parents didn't let me get a job, why I didn't have a license, why applying to college was such a hassle (due to lack of social security number).

So our lawyer advised my dad to file for my brother's and my Daca in 2012. We both got approved, and currently I've had Daca for 5 years, and my brother for 2 years (he's in the renewal proccess right now) and mine expires in 2019.

Daca opened MANY doors for me, I was able to get a license hence I was able to get a job to pay for my college tuition. I worked 80-90hr weeks to save up enough money to fund my first year of school going as a Software Engineering Major. In the first year, I excelled in my classes, and maintained a perfect GPA which resulted in me getting a scholarship which was enough to fund my last 3 years, which freed up enough time for me to work software development internships during school and the summer.

In July of 2016, I had enough experience and knowledge of the industry to where I started my own consulting company. Obtained an LLC from my State, and an article of incorporation. I got a EIN from the IRS, and a Tax ID from my states Tax Collectors office so I could legally do business and paid all my taxes (which if any of you guys own your own company, know how much of a hassle it is. THE GOVERNMENT GREATLY PENALIZES YOU FOR DOING GOOD WTF MAN... anyways)

All the above I stated helped me GREATLY while I had to go through the Daca renewal proccess in 2016. Also for anyone whos debating on filing for DACA through a lawyer or by yourself, GO WITH A LAWYER. IT HELPS. AND IS WORTH THE COST.

In May of 2017, I graduated from school with a degree in Software engineering, and with alot of networking, 3 years worth of internship experience, and my parent's prayers, I landed an amazing job at a Fortune 100 company the very next day after graduation. I have been working at this job for 3 months now, and am the frontrunner for a promotion in May of 2018.

So basically, I am not trying to toot my own horn, but the sky is the limit and I have been capped my my dad's mistake of trusting others, and the ever-lasting enemy: time. 

Is there ANYTHING I can do to fix my status? I literally am not at fault, and are am coping with the consequences of no status. Is there anything my dad can do to fight the government? The lawyers have said there are literally 3 options left for us:

* 1. wait longer for the USCIS to do something about our application which was filed 14 years ago

* 2. hope that something good happens and the government creates a path to citizenship for DACA recipients

* 3. heretically go after the federal government, and sue them for everything imaginable (this will however put my family and myself at risk for deportation, which is expected, so we would be fighting the case from a defensive standpoint. Like ""prove that we are illegal and haven't applied for legal stay, and prove we entered illegally"" we have documentation for everything but in the end, I live in Texas, and this is a risky ass move).

We have exhausted all of our options from consulting with lawyers, family, friends, etc. so please follow Redditors. Tell me something.

Our business program is pretty decent, but I don't have a great GPA (~3.1, might go higher), and I don't have great connections and couldn't even secure an internship this last summer, although I do have one under my belt already.


I've always been interested in Comp Sci, as i've been interested in that area for a while, but decided to go into Finance as I went into school and didn't look back.


Now that the job market seems daunting and I realized I don't really have many connections I'm wondering if what the opinion is on grabbing a comp sci minor to make myself more appealing to recruiters. I like the idea of working in a financial software company or something along those lines rather than doing straight finance, as I probably wouldn't get a great offer with a decent salary the way it looks now.


I'm also working on a Risk Management and Insurance certification at my school. We have one of the largest programs for that in the nation with a decent network. I also am interested in risk management and I've heard that there is a demand for decent jobs in that field as well, and i'll come out of the program with a couple of the RMI certifications already done.


IB is far out the window for me, lmao, but I still would like to get into a challenging career at a decent firm if I can.

I am a rising senior studying computer science. Over this past summer, I worked full time at an internship for a large company that employs many software engineers in various capacities. I was planning to apply to this company (and many others) in the upcoming Fall of my senior year.

However.. yesterday, the company with which I am currently interning sent me a job offer. This is very exciting news! I was somewhat caught off guard, however, because **I didn't formally apply for the position..** and I have not yet applied anywhere else. As such, I don't have any sort of an idea of how competitive the salary that has been offered is. Nor do I have much bargaining power, given that I don't have any other options. I've been given a **deadline of two weeks to respond** to the job offer.

Now, as I see it I have several options. First, I can ask them for the possibility of an extension on the deadline because ""this is my first career step out of college, and need some more time to consult with my advisors, family, friends, and mentors"" (or something along those lines). In the mean time, I am applying for a number of other positions, which will hopefully have decently rapid turnaround times, and I can acquire some competing salary offers.

My question, however, is **what you would advise me to do in the event that they do not extend the deadline**. Should I (very respectfully) decline the offer, keep working at my internship, and simply reapply at this company in a few weeks, once I have heard back from some other options? Is that a viable path, or **does declining the position now permanently shut the door?**

Thanks for your advice here. I am new to the business of negotiating job offers.

**tl;dr** company that I intern for sprung a job offer on me, and I don't have time to apply to other companies to assess whether the salary is competitive. What should I do?*"

I'm only 24, but everyone else here is pretty much close to retirement.


The first two months, I worked hard and was always on time. I took over a small project in progress and made it my own.


I made it a prototype of it, and I overheard my manager said ""that's really good"".


As time went on, I started slacking more and more. I would spend hours on reddit, watching videos, etc. I went from coding all day, to only coding for ~3 hours a day, to spending 1-2 hours. I would start taking 1 hour lunch breaks instead of the allowed 30 minutes (which is way too short for a 9 hour day btw).


I got notice that I will be showing my demo to the users in a few weeks. I stopped slacking everyday and started working hard again. When the time came, I gave a good demo and presentation in front of my boss, my boss' boss, and his boss, along with all the users of the application. They all liked it. I was actually very happy this day, compared to the days I drag my feet to work.


After this success, I started to slack again. The past month, I started coming into work 30+ minutes late. The problem with this is (besides being late), my boss sits right across from me, and starts at the same time I do. He knows I come in very late everyday -- but he never says anything. Today I came in about an hour late without telling anyone (lost my ID). It's gotten to the point that I dread the mornings a lot less, and I take my time going to work instead of going in a hectic rush.


There have been two incidents where my boss comes up to talk to me, and I was 100% sure I would be getting talked to for being late or slacking. But no, both of these meetings he told me he wants to promote me, so I need to take the government exam for it. My supervisor told me about the promotion as well, saying ""*managers name* likes you, so he wants you to take that exam"".


One of my theories is that they want to keep the youngsters around so things go up in flames when everyone retires (the agency went from 800 to 400 employees in the past few years). I do carry myself around professionally and try to be super nice to everyone I talk to. Maybe that's why. But the work I've done, someone experienced could have easily done in a month or two IMO. I don't work as hard as I should. I'm apathetic about this job, yet they want to promote me. I think it's actually kind of funny. I'm so confused. Is this normal for a lot of companies, or did I just happen to get a super chill boss? My last job was an IT helpdesk internship, maybe I'm just used to being overworked?

- Just after graduation I started as an intern in a company with the agreement that if they are happy with my work they will offer a fulltime junior position.
- Company liked my work and offered the fulltime contract, but kept me as an intern (with a salary bump), instead of the previously agreed upon junior position.

Fast forward to today, about two months later:

I stayed with my current employer with the intention to apply to some other places, and so I ended up sending my resume to five companies for junior and mid-level positions, heard back from four of them and ended up with on-site interviews with two - one for Junior and one for Mid-Level developer/engineer.


Last week I was promoted to Junior with a 20% salary bump, which brings my current salary to just about average-high for entry-level junior positions in my area and on the lower side for 1.5 years of experience.


About the on-site interviews - The Junior interview was for an outsourcing company, they seemed pretty decent and with good clients. The interview was pretty hard with both algorithmic and design whiteboard questions; I believe I performed OK, but definitely not spectacular. I am still waiting for a reply from them.


The Mid-Level interview was for a product company, maintaining a legacy monolithic system. It felt like a walk in the park with very basic whiteboard questions, mostly resolved around them asking me what problems I've faced in my current workplace and me answering how I've dealt with them. Their initial job description requires more years of experience than I currently have, but it seems they liked me, since I got an offer for the mid-level position today, offering 25% more than my current salary with similar benefits. I should note here that I am a bit skeptical about them making an offer so quickly and the interview seeming so easy, since I figure that this might mean they have a lower bar of entry in general, which would ultimately mean not-so-great colleagues and codebase. 


On one hand I could use the extra money to help with the loans I am currently paying off. I am doing a pretty good job of managing my finances and am I living a comfortable lifestyle, but the student loan is one of those things that the sooner I can get rid of, the better.

On the other hand - I have no idea if I will be as happy with the work/colleagues at this new place, I am really scared from the uncertainty.

There is also the question of commuting - I am currently spending about ~50m one-way to my current work place. Commuting to the new place will take about 1h 20m, so with a 8-9 hour workday and close to 3 hours of commuting, that would leave me very little personal time outside of sleeping.


I think it is out of question to ask for another raise in my current company, since I haven't even completed one month in my current position. Here are the options I see:


1) Stay with the comfort of my current employer - nice office, flexible work time, colleagues and work I am happy with - no risk, but a dreaded feeling that something is not quite right. Wait until 2018's mid-year review &amp; bonus and reevaluate based on what happens.


2) Go to Mid-level place, sacrifice an additional hour of personal time for commuting and hope that my new colleagues will be decent, for the additional 25% salary


3) For the time being stay with current company, reject mid-level place and continue applying to other places - I feel like I might not get another offer as nice as the one above, but at the same time it is the only offer I've had since joining my current company, so I have really no idea how to evaluate myself in the current marketplace, outside of the occasional small talk with ex classmates of mine.

6w2m04,1,2017-08-25,Getting stuck as self-taught developer,rs13876,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6w2m04/getting_stuck_as_selftaught_developer/,"I've been working in Europe as a Software Developer (Backend, Web) for the past 12 years or so. I left school relatively early and learning programming by myself, starting out the classic PHP, Javascript, HTML way. After getting an internship as my first job, I went through some companies and the past 6 years I mostly worked in Senior roles, only backend development in PHP for quite large projects. Recently I also picked up Go for my work, which I also found quite enjoyable. 

Two years ago I wanted to switch jobs again (I usually stay 1-3 years at a company) but found that I'm not very interested in most jobs that I could get. Most of it was the usual PHP application programming stuff I already did for long time. In my spare time I invested quite some time (2 years at that time, now more) in learning C/C++ and Rust (which was even more exotic at that time than now), also the fundamentals of compsci (discrete maths, algo, ds, …). But that seemed to be of no interest to recruiters/hiring companies as it didn't count as working experience and I don't have a degree.

I would have liked to change the tech stack (as I expect better pay, more challenges from the aforementioned technologies compared to PHP), but just couldn't. I felt like depending on my work history and lack of formal education I'm labelled as the ""PHP wbe coder"".

Via connections and by luck I found an opportunity in a first-world country in Asia, and since I felt like I'm stuck anyway here in Europe I moved without much hesitation, although it was still mostly PHP (with Go recently), for a large company, so very similar to what I did. But I wanted to take the chance to work in a foreign country. 

Recently I had a look around here for new jobs but found that the market here is even more competitive than what I was used to from Europe. I had veeery few interviews because many companies are reluctant to hire a foreigner without degree or just hire a foreigner without work experience in the tech stack they are using, because they don't want to invest time in bringing someone up to speed as there are so many candidates available. 

I once managed to get an interview at a very nice, established company (like a local Google, maybe) for a non-PHP position. But I failed that one pretty bad, because I really was lacking knowledge in many compsci areas. That was quite a sobering experience. 

I concluded it might make sense after all to pick up studying for a degree (at least bachelor) after all. The local universities don't accept me and even in my home country (which has excellent universities) there are no reputable universities that would allow me to study there via remote study. I found http://www.londoninternational.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate/goldsmiths/bsc-computing-information-systems-bsc-diploma-work-entry-route - a Bsc degreee in computing/information systems from the Univiersity of London, which can be done via distance learning and also allows to enter via work experience. 

It looks alright, although I would have wished for a) more maths b) a functional programming language instead of Java. I wish I had the resources to study full-time on the campus of a university, tbh.

So now I'm in doubt again if it's worth picking up the degree via distance learning and working through the boring parts (seems there are quite some) or what other options I have. 

I also thought about getting nano-degrees from Udemy or Coursera and the likes, but from my experience these things don't count that much in real world, although I don't doubt the learnings."

One of my problems is that I fear commitment. I didn't really know what direction I wanted my career to take so I ended up doing a 'easy' security job for a few months so I could mull over it - it pays slightly over minimum wage.

I decided that I don't really care what direction I head in, I just want to make as much money as I can assuming that I don't have to sell my soul and limbs to do so. Soonafter I found a job working for a small business and the pay is a little bit better than minimum wage but not by a huge amount and I only get around 20 hours a week at the job, which is obviously not enough - in fact I still have my security job and I do that on the weekends.

At this point I'm willing to work hard, I'm willing to go the distance, but I'm also lost. I don't know which direction to focus my work towards, what steps I want to take, etc. My dream job would involve data science/actuarial work/programming or some combination of the above - or really anything that has room for a lot of growth and advancement and is intellectually stimulating. But at this point I just want to make money, already working 7 days a week and spending all my free time thinking of ways on how to move up.

One of my biggest regrets was not being able to do an internship at university. I actually was a college dropout (I'm 26 right now) so I spent a few years just working and thinking about what I wanted to do with my life (much like I am now!). I ended up returning back to university and doing pretty well in my last 2 years, my first two years were a disaster though so my gpa was pretty awful and I didn't have the time to do any internships either. This leaves me in an awkward spot where I don't have any  REAL work experience going forward other than the odd low-skill jobs that I've been doing. I've done data entry, fast food, security and recently office assistant for a small business.

What should I do reddit to move up the ladder? I'm stumped for ideas at this point, been contemplating going back to school but my grades were pretty awful (~3.6 GPA for the period after I returned from the drop-out, ~1.9 GPA for the period leading up to the dropout - the average is only around 2.8-2.9).

Fair warning: I have no idea what I'm doing, but I'm trying. Please go easy on me, and sorry for the book. 

[**HERE IS MY RESUME SO YOU CAN HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT TO IMAGINE WHEN LOOKING AT MY BIBLE OF QUESTIONS))))**](https://imgur.com/a/Rigbs)

**1.)** I have a lot of customer service experience spread out across multiple jobs. Two summers here, few months there, etc. Is it better to list them all and go over a page or do I stick to the ones that I was employed at the longest? Or, the ones I had the most hours in? Or, the ones I got the most out of, personally?

**2.)** The longest customer service gig I had was some desk job at my university's gym. During this time, the person in charge of overseeing my job changed three times, about once per year, and the current person in charge (the last one in charge of me) and I didn't end on particularly stellar terms. Do I include this job because it's the longest consecutive CS job I've had or get rid of it because I'll need to supply a 'no comment' reference?

**3.)** When an employer lists a desire for someone with 'x years of experience' do they expect someone to have a 40 hour work week for a full year to have that experience?

**Example 1:** In the job mentioned in 2.) I worked between 10-14 hours a week for half of my freshman and senior year, and then all of sophomore and junior year. How many years does this count as, since summer isn't included and was only a few hours a week?

**Example 2:** I was the PR rep for my university club sport. I didn't do much except plan tournaments, send some emails to athletic administration and recruit people. Does this count as some 'years' of customer service, if even at all? I didn't work any hours so I'm not sure how to quantify this.

**Example 3:** I've been a lifeguard for five summers, June-August. I currently have, on my resume, 'Lifeguard (Seasonal)' is this sufficient to send the idea that it's not a year-round position? Also, on this,

**4.)** I've been a lifeguard at my town pool, I've guarded private events, been at a summer camp, and been at a country club for a few months all in the past five years. How, if at all, do I convey this variety of venues, or should I just leave it at 'my town' to simplify things?

**5.)** I'm an Eagle Scout. I've had interviews based solely on this (HR told me explicitly) a few years ago when I started college, but now that I have more 'experience' (lol) and some super helpful degrees (lol), do I include this or will it make me look like a baby?

**6.)** If so, where do I list it? Currently I have it in my 'professional (lol) summary' as the first descriptor of myself so as to save space. IE 'Eagle Scout with a Bachelor in blah blah blah' Nix or no? 

This next question may come off as arrogant on my part, but please bear with me because I'm grasping at straws to do something other than wait tables for the rest of my life and make my resume look even remotely appealing.

Currently employed as a lifeguard for the town I live in, have been so for the past four summers. I was not going to return this summer because of a month-long road trip planned in January, but my boss begged me to due to short staffing, so we worked around my trip. Due to my absence, I was not offered the position of head guard. However, the person that was, was not from the area and unfamiliar with the way we ran things and had two years less experience than I. I held his hand the whole way before I left, showing him procedure, answering questions, and signed off on all health department inspections because he was never around. He went back to school the day I returned, leaving me to be the most senior guard on staff until we close for the season on Labor Day. So,

**7.)** Am I wrong to feel that I have been headguard in all but title and 'salary' (lol)? The position really isn't that big of a deal, again, I'm just trying to do anything to demonstrate quantifiable results in the things I've done, which are few and far between.

**8.)** Should I attempt to convey the level of responsibility I currently have or just put 'lifeguard' for the past five years? Note: My boss has not officially promoted me but expects me to act with authority for the remainder of the season, as he's said so in the past.

**9.)** Will it raise some alarm bells if I've been at a position for five full seasons with no promotion, accolades or anything?

**10.)** How do I 'quantify' what I've done as a lifeguard? Number of people saved? Gallons of water I've seen splashed? Number of band-aids given out?

**11.)** Due to my lack of experience, one of the (I feel) most important parts of my resume is my activity with a club at my school (lol) where I basically turned a newly formed club I joined into an official club SPORT at my school. (woahhh &gt;.&gt;) If it comes down to references, should I include a reference for this, perhaps the club president, or keep references to be paid-work experience? 

**12.)** On the Eagle Scout thing, should I provide details about my leadership skills developed through Boy Scouts of America or is that too baby and distant (five-six years ago) to count? I was the leader of my troop for a full year (actual 365 days) and of course, I did an Eagle Scout project. Worth mentioning or no?

**13.)** If so, I'm currently at a page and really struggling to keep things concise due to my sporadic CS experience. Does my leadership experience in BSA outweigh some CS jobs I've had or is real 'work' (lol) better to list?

**14.)** I have two degrees, neither of which are helpful in anything because I was a dumbshit and didn't properly college: BA in Linguistics and BA in Russian Cultural Studies. Do I list one, or both (since I really have just a handful of dirt as a resume here) even if the content I studied isn't even remotely helpful to the jobs I'm applying for? 

**15.)** I recognise that HOW I studied it is very useful though. The synthesis of information, pattern recognition, big data management and logic was all useful but I don't know if employers will know those are skills developed with my degrees. If it matters, I say that I have an emphasis in syntax and semantics for my linguistics degree, but most people go 'What's that???' when I tell them about my degree. How do I impart this without rattling off courses I've taken, which seems to be a mortal sin on resumes?

A final note, no question, I have no internships or anything real to draw on either, just shitty retail jobs, BSA involvement, my degrees, my club experience, and another thing I explain in the comments.

Thanks all, I've been doing my homework on resumes using this sub and other websites as a reference. These questions are the last remaining ones that I can't find answers too. Sorry for the length, but your time is so deeply appreciated.

Also, feel free to sue me for false advertising regarding the title. I know there are ~~three~~ ~~four~~ ~~five~~ six more questions than I said, sorry!"

The process has been poorly handled from the start, but he finally got a start date, and went in to work. He worked for two and a half days (20 hours or so) before they sent him home, telling him that they hadn't been able to fully process his paperwork for orientation.  They told him yesterday that they aren't going to pay him for those hours, since he hadn't been officially onboarded. However, he performed actual work (he's in IT) and produced workproduct. 

I have always been told that it is illegal to perform work for free for the government. Is this true? Granted, he's only out about $600 if they stiff his the money, but I don't think it's right that he went to work for 3 days straight, and isn't getting paid a cent for it. 

Does anyone know if they can do this, and what his options might be?  I would appreciate any advice or perspective on this! "

1. When should I be applying for post graduation jobs and how can I identify them? I've been throwing resumes out like crazy to companies over the last few days, but I have no idea how interested any of them are in hiring someone who won't be ready to begin working until June.

2. Related to the above, is there anything I can do to stand out more when applying for jobs in locations far from my current one, and are there any cities outside of the usual suspects (SF, NYC, DC, Boston, Austin, etc) where I should be looking for entry level positions? 

3. Would getting the first IIBA certification improve my job prospects, and are there any other certifications worth getting?

4. Is it worth it to be applying for internships in the field for after I graduate, or should I exclusively be focusing on full time positions?

5. Should I be trying to network with my school's alumni in Business Analytics (especially those who live in locations I am interested in moving to) and what is generally the best way to contact them?"

I'm a 20 year old student doing an internship at a web-dev company in NA. The project I'm currently working on is very important for the company, and I'm struggling coming to terms with the amount of responsibility put on me and wanted to know you guys opinion on it.

When I started on this project nearly a year ago, I was very new to professional web development. I had played around with Django/Flask, and knew HTML/CSS/JS to pretty high standard. In the time I've been working on it, I've gotten very proficient in the backend stack (Java/Spring/Hibernate), and somewhat proficient in the front-end stack (Angular2, SASS). 

Now to the crux of the issue. A vast majority of my team are offshore and based in India and Bangladesh (I am the only North American based developer). Their code quality is absolutely horrendous, and even though I've only been in this tech stack for not even a year I feel confident in saying that I out perform a lot of their ""senior developers"" (I say this not out of arrogance, just trying to emphasize how low quality I believe they really are).

As a result of the terrible quality of their code, I often get left with a lot of the ""mission critical"" parts of the application and this sits uneasy with me due to my inexperience. I've been performing well so far, but I feel almost cheated because I'm getting paid massively under market rate while doing a majority of the important work, and have to take on a large amount of stress in essentially keeping the project together. I have almost no support in this, and feel constantly anxious with the amount of pressure being put on me because they don't trust their own developers.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? How should I tackle this? 

Thanks everyone! "

Shes at an internship for the summer in a different city, while I'm in our college town taking classes, working and taking care of her cat.

She came back very late two nights ago because her friends invited her to watch the fight at some resort. When she came back the first night all she could talk about was how much she missed her cat, I guess that's fine. She always tells me how much she misses her cat.

The next day she leaves to go watch the fight and doesn't comeback till 1AM and just goes straight to bed, then she leaves first thing in the morning today. So in total I spent about two hours with her over the past three days. I mean I get it, I'm her roommate which she gets to see a lot of during the school year, and she doesn't really get to spend much time with her other friend that invited her. But I just feel so low priority to her, first its I miss my cat and not you, and then its I'm coming to visit, but only to hang out with my other friends.

I'm acknowledge that I'm probably being over dramatic and over sensitive, but it just kind of sucks especially when I have a crush on her and I want to spend as much time with her as possible. 

I've been in our college town for about three months now, I don't have any friends aside from her here so I've mostly been alone for all by myself for the past three months. So any interaction with her is valuable to me."

I'm debating on asking my AP Stat teacher vs. AP Calc BC teacher. I had both of them sophomore year. 

I guess I'll list down the pros/cons of each teacher? I did super well in both AP Stat and AP Calc BC, and I took both classes sophomore year. 

AP Stat teacher

Pros:

1) I'm the president of math team and he is the sponsor for math team. I would feel like he would have bunch of things to talk about me.

2) I'm more closer to him than my BC Calc teacher since I talk to him alot more often.

Cons:

1) I feel like he would have little experience with writing recs. Barely anyone asks him for teacher recs. I'm not even sure if he had written any recs for selective schools? I'm kind of afraid he doesn't really know how to write recs and so the letter would end up being generic.

AP Calc BC teacher

Pros

1) He has LOTS of experience with writing recs and many of the kids who asked him for rec have gotten into great schools. (ivies+ ivy-like schools). 

2) He already wrote me a rec for questbridge and a summer program last year.

3) I had him for two years? I had him for BC Calc sophomore year and Linear algebra junior year. I didn't do as well in junior year as I did sophomore year. I did VERY WELL sophomore year though. 

Cons

1) I'm not that close to him, but he does like me. I've only gone to talk to him after class like once or twice. I feel like his writing in his rec would come mostly from my resume but idk I also participated alot in class though. He was very impressed with my presentation of research with mathematics though (we have this internship class in our school and we have to present it to a class of freshmen and he was the teacher who oversaw it)

2)He and I had this awkward incident last year where I cursed out loud in the hallway and he heard me. He told me to watch my language and got really mad. I just ran away without saying sorry or anything (I know! silly me!) because I was caught off guard and embarrassed. Two days later I went to his class after school to apologize that I ran away without saying anything and he tapped me on the shoulder and said it's good.  But I'm concerned if he would think im immature or something and it gets reflected on the rec.

Thanks so much! I know it's kind of long and thanks for reading it all.

Just a little background first: I'm CS student at the beginning of his sophomore year right now. I had an internship in an unrelated field the summer before my freshman year, and had a CS internship last summer. They have guaranteed that I can come back in the future summers if I want to, so I am not worried about getting more internships/experience before graduating. I have been offered a web development internship that would be during this school year and am completely unsure whether or not I should take it. 

It would require around 10 or more hours a week and they suggested that it would be a recurring position for the rest of my undergrad career (and hinted at possibly joining them later).

I am very conflicted in whether or not I should accept this position or use that time to have a bit of fun / work on myself / study more in classes / etc. I think I could make it work in my schedule, but I do worry a bit that my grades would suffer (my university has a fairly rigorous CS program).

I'm not a very strong writer, and I have looked at online resources such as Prudue OWL and such. Any help would be appreciated, Thanks!

I remember my first exposure to Natural Language Processing as stressful. I frantically tried to stay awake at 3 A.M. while figuring out how to apply sentiment analysis to a language I barely understood. I quickly wrote a script to translate some English words into Japanese, and I was shocked when 30% of them didn’t even have appropriate translations. The library I used could not handle Japanese, so I was forced to implement a new one knowing very little about the technicality behind sentimental analysis. This hackathon environment forced me to think well outside of the box. While I only managed to create an algorithm that ran somewhat successfully, the consequence was a newfound interest in machine translation related NLP.   

I firmly believe a Master’s Degree in Computer Science (Concentration: Machine Learning) will place me in a distinguished position to research and apply various NLP techniques. Gaining a strong A.I. background will also allow me to create a stronger breadth to compliment the depth that I hope to achieve while doing my masters. Over the course of my undergraduate studies, I never sat still in or out of class. Every academic semester, I have appeared on either the Dean’s list or received Faculty Honors. Outside of class, I was an active member of the Yellow Jacket Baseball Club, and Japan Student Association (Culture Committee Chairman). 

Since my Junior year, I have been working as the project lead with Dr. X of the School of Economics at X. We are working with the Georgia Department of Education to research and create a product which will eventually reduce the high school dropout rate. Using big data and machine learning techniques, my group plans to predict when a child is at risk for poor performance, and which topics the child must improve on. So far, we have found that 3rd grade reading and math scores can help predict performance as far as high school for certain students. From writing multiple research proposals, desperately trying to understand IRB documentation, and conducting a literature review summary of an endless amount of papers, I gained exposure to many research techniques. I hope to apply many of the research techniques and algorithms I learned in this project to machine translation related issues in NLP.

Another project that I’ve been working on since my Junior year is creating a mobile application for the X campus that will help decrease suicide rates. This independent group project, under the guidance of Dr. Y (School of Interactive Computing at X), will hopefully bring about a new method of helping those with mental illnesses. While it doesn’t currently involve the use of big data or machine learning, this project strengthened my understanding of how Human-Computer Interaction plays a role in all aspects of Computer Science. Research aspects involved reading textbooks about various design methodologies, documenting human experiences of using the prototype that was created, and molding the product to fit the largest human common denominator. 
 
My first practical experience occurred this past summer, when I did an internship at a start-up company in Japan. The company worked on providing an online cram school style website for tutors and students, reducing participation costs significantly. I had the pleasure of working on a variety of algorithms ranging from searching to complex scheduling. I was also named project lead for the big data portion of the project, which involved planning data collection, cleaning, and machine learning techniques once the website was available to the public. I was also actively involved in education research, specifically literary analysis of various papers on learning styles, which I then applied to the website. To continue the big data project, I was offered and accepted a part-time remote working role.

The beauty of these projects is that they contribute to computing for the social good, another topic that I consider an integral part of my hobbies. I hope to use the knowledge gained from X's Master’s Program to start a company which caters to this approach.  

I need a world-class university that will not only allow me to research and apply machine learning techniques, but also let me express my individuality and creativity. The last four years at X have truly allowed me to be myself, given its incredible access to various facilities and extraordinary professors. X has the unique distinction of being one of the best innovative universities, a truly friendly environment for progress. I have therefore chosen to continue going to X for my graduate studies, with the hope that I can eventually contribute to the field of NLP, and create a company that highlights the intersectionality between Natural Language and Social Computing.

I can't land an interview for crap though and I don't know why. I got an interview with Facebook as a sophomore but failed (learned a bunch). I even finished google Foobar and never heard back. Maybe my competition is just better? I got an employee referral to two positions at Amazon and got a decline from both before even interviewing. 

I applied to a bunch of companies over the summer, but I never hear anything back.

Does anyone know what I can do to better sell myself? I got an offer from my internship employer, but I really want to see what other companies are like.."

My college experience was a rough one; stress, anxiety, and depression negatively impacted my gpa, and since most internships req. a 3.0 or higher in my field, I was essentially screwed.


I never really gained the confidence in software development (because I equated my performance in college to my performance in real life). As a result I only ever picked short term manual Quality Assurance jobs.


This isnt the avenue I wanted to really go down, unfortunately. When I do code, I'm only working on small personal projects, some still incomplete, plenty that are over 1000 lines. And I have no real way of assessing how /good/ I am. 


I really wish I had an internship where someone mentors me while on the job, not only to ease some of my nerves, but give me guidance so I can gain confidence in my field.


But do these positions exist for people 5 or more years after graduating college? All the internships I've seen so far are for college seniors and juniors. Also I live in Chicago for reference. "

6wkfsw,17,2017-08-28,I feel guilty when I criticize my parents,paper_roses,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/6wkfsw/i_feel_guilty_when_i_criticize_my_parents/,"Relevant info about me; I'm 22F, graduated for one year with a degree in biology at our state university. I didn't do very well at college due to a lack of focus/possible depression, so I couldn't apply to grad school like I wanted. I am currently attempting to get into dental school, and am taking post bac classes and helping out at my mom's dental practice for experience. I am not independent from them and live at home.

In many ways I grew up with a typical Asian experience: made to learn piano, intense pressure to do well in school, Chinese school on weekends, parents with short tempers who always think they're the boss, etc. But at the same time I know my parents love me and care about my success. They gave me lots of the things I wanted when I was growing up, took our family on nice trips, to good restaurants, etc. My dad often shows me physical affection like hugs, which seems like it should be a given for parenting but obviously isn't for us Asian kids.

Lately though, they have been becoming insufferable. I don't know if it's always been there or is due to them getting older, but my dad in particular is starting to become incredibly critical and judgemental. He gets into arguments over tiny details, makes jabs at me for being socially awkward and not wanting to find myself a career, saying all I do is stay at home and do nothing, with no friends and no life. My relationship with my mom has actually improved since college, but she still has the same temper she did in my childhood and once she gets set off there's nothing anybody can do. Last week I got a parking ticket and while I was trying to explain why to her she just started screaming while at the same time saying she was just trying to figure out what happened and that she wasn't raising her voice. That was the final straw for me and I ended up screaming back at her (not a good idea). Yesterday my younger sister came home from an out of state internship she did over the summer and they started talking about her career path and what grad schools she needed to get into, all the while reminding me that I have no such goals and am basically a piece of shit loser. They somehow even managed to turn me not being interested in watching the game of thrones finale into a jab about me not having the ability to sit through an hour of tv because I'm so unfocused and can never finish anything (untrue). 

Another thing is they've never supported my interests. I chose biology as my major because I love animals and wanted to be an animal behavior researcher. I was told that was useless and to study something medicine related. I love art, but my mom has always deemed the time I spent teaching myself to draw as a waste of time. She calls the fabric I buy for sewing to be junk. They don't get why I like to read the same books over and over.

Experiences like that leave me really fed up with my parents because they are so judgemental and hypocritical. It's what makes me look forward to weekdays when I can escape them and dread weekends, when I'm stuck all day with them. Every conversation I'm on edge, not knowing if what I said is going to trigger some personal attack on me that I'll have to deal with. My self esteem is pretty low and I blame them for much of that. 

At the same time, I've never bad mouthed my parents to my friends even though I've wanted to sometimes. I still have a desire to make them proud of me even though sometimes I wonder if they've truly given up on me as a lost cause. Whenever negative or critical thoughts spring to mind I think, ""but remember everything they've done for you. They're your parents and they love you. Are you really that ungrateful and spoiled?"" I feel guilty for thinking badly of them because I know they have always wanted the best for me. When we do get along, it's great. But when we don't it's like everything I built up get knocked down in two sentences. I don't know how to deal with them in a constructive way, because the guilt just makes me repress my anger and depression and poor self esteem, as I convince myself that me daring to criticize them even to myself is wrong.

Tl;dr I have genuinely loving parents but they've also caused a fair bit of damage to me and I don't know if I'm justified in criticizing them and it confuses me. Help.

(BSc) Computer Science degree -  I have an unconditional offer from a university to study comp sci but this option obviously involves debt which is at £9,000 per year and this course is 3 years without work placement. For this option I will probably have to do the work placement year and/or summer internships. This is harder as it involves more maths but I am willing to put in the work. 

(BSc) Digital and Technology Solutions (Software Engineering) - The course fees are paid by a company and I specialise in the software engineering aspect of the course. This is a degree apprenticeship where I spend 20% of the time studying and 80% of the time working at the company that's paying the fees. This course is longer, at 4 years. Additionally, they will be giving me a starting salary of £17,000 which will have yearly increase. 

So my question is I guess which option gives me better job prospects after 3/4 years?

The second option is relatively new(2015) and therefore there isn't anyone who has completed it yet, whereas the first option is the tried and tested pathway. "

Ill give you a little background of the situation. I work for a medium sized business and run the IT department.  About a year ago we replaced our final Server 2003 machine and were totally on Server 2008. Now i had tasked the intern at the time to do the removal of the 2003 DC. Which all went well and I was happy as he was making some progress as an engineer.
So back to present. Now i have been working on this project for about 4 days now on and off. Setting up a VM host for all the servers we have now and migration our main DC over to 2012 r2 and making sure there are no issues. 

Now i am making great progress but i start noticing some strange issues. So i decided to do some digging and found the former intern (who is now an engineer for me) did not remove anything from the Server 2008 DC and left the function level at 2003. 
So i decided to ask him if there was a reason why he did this. His exact words to me were "" What do you mean i have to remove the old DC from the rest of the servers. I thought i just unplugged it and sent it out to get scrapped"" (facepalm)

Now this made me chuckle and laugh a little but kinda aggravated me at the same time. So i saw a prime time for a learning experience for him. So i taught him the right way to remove domain controllers but this has set my project back another day.

Having just recently attended my 10 year reunion, I've had some time to reflect on my choices since attending college. I'm wondering if, at 27, it would be too late to restart a path as an Engineer?   
  
A little backstory, I was attending University in 2007 for a BSE in Aerospace Engineering. Fall of 2010 rolls around, I lose my job, fiance and subsequently get a DUI. The combination causes me to withdraw from the program. I was bartending from then on until 2015 when I got a job as a mortgage broker.   
  
I've been able to save enough for a house down payment, but I was thinking instead of using that money to obtain a BS in Computer Science. As it stands now, I only have a rudimentary understanding of programming languages; with an even lower understanding of systems and architecture.   
  
I've been auditing just about every course available on MOOCs on statistics, linear algebra and economics, trying to refresh myself on topics I haven't touched in a decade. I understand that none of my previous credits will transfer, so I'll need to retake rudimentary courses like Calculus and English.   
  
That being said, I'll be able to enter the workforce at 32. I have no family or expenses at the moment besides rent, so I should be able to manage some form of apprenticeship or internship (if that's still applicable for my age) during my last two years.   
  
Am I putting myself at a disadvantage by entering the workforce at 32? I'm interested in block chain technology and information security.      Would a more efficient method be to continue auditing MOOCs and just build a git or similar portfolio?  
  
Am I crazy for thinking there's even a chance I can switch?  Will my DUI put my at a huge disadvantage for employment? It pretty much removed all chances of obtaining clearance for Aerospace.
  
Thank you for your time. Apologies for the formatting, I'm typing this from my phone. If this violates any rules please let me know and I will edit accordingly."

Yes, the weather may suck, but the gun laws are better, the COL is lower, my friends and girlfriend are here, and I honestly don't feel comfortable living in a city that's cramped. I enjoy my space.

But! I feel like I would be missing out on a great opportunity to jumpstart my career by living in the Bay Area. Honestly, I only really want a job in Austin, TX. It seems like a great compromise for me. But then that would mean I decline this great offer.

I don't mean to come off as picky. So many people would kill for this opportunity. I really don't want to make the wrong decision here. My manager said he worked really hard to put this offer together since at the time I said I'd like to work there after my internship. This company has positions in Austin, but my manager said this offer is only for the Bay Area position. I'm graduating next May, and the hiring season has barely started. Maybe accepting this will be jumping the gun.

For a little background, I'm 24 years old and have been working as a brewer since graduating college last May. I worked at the same brewery every summer and on weekends while going to college. I have a bachelor's in Engineering Technology - Electrical, but since I planned on working there after college (they offered me the brewer position after the second summer working there), I didn't get an internship related to my degree (a decision I now regret). I picked up a minor in computer science as a sort of back-up plan because going into my senior year I realized I most enjoyed the few programming/IT classes I had to take for my bachelor's.  

Fast-forward to now, I realize that a career in brewing craft beer is not something I want to continue to do. The hours are long and arduous, and the pay isn't great for someone with a bachelor's ($14/hr). Due to some changes in my personal life this summer, I'm looking to transition to IT by getting a help desk job ASAP. I've always been an IT/tech enthusiast (family tech guy, built my own desktop, blah blah blah) and been a regular listener to the Security Now podcast with Steve Gibson, so I've had a premium membership to ITPro.tv and had been watching random videos that interested me for the better part of the last year. Since making the decision to change careers about a month ago, I've been studying for the A+ exam and plan on taking the tests by the beginning of October. At the beginning of August I told my current boss at the brewery I planned on leaving in September.

My question to all of you is would it look bad to hiring managers and HR when applying to places if I were to be unemployed for September while transitioning careers? I want to take a month off to study for the A+ and start studying for the CCENT. I study the A+ material during most of my free time, but the long work hours (12+ hours some days) while trying to keep my personal life intact worries me that I won't pass the A+ or have the time to search for other jobs. I'm pretty fed up with my current brewing job and want to get a help desk or IT job ASAP. Do I have okay chances of getting a help desk job with just my bachelor's, no professional IT experience, and no A+ cert yet? I want to start applying to places right now but if I probably won't get considered for jobs, I think my time would be better spent studying for A+ rather than looking at job boards and applying places? I am financially well off enough where being unemployed for a month or two would be no big deal for me. (Thanks Bitcoin.)

Here is my current resume, any critiques or suggestions would be greatly appreciated! http://imgur.com/a/sib8y

 *Edit: The brewery I work at is in a rural area, and I will be seeking jobs in a metropolitan area. I have a place to stay with some friends lined up for when I get a job, would it be worth it to put down their address in the city on my resume instead of my current address?

Story in comments,luckygrad17,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6wnh0i/i_think_i_lucked_my_way_into_a_high_paying_job_as/,"So this story begins when I was applying for internships for the Summer of 2017. I had a few interviews with some good companies, but nothing came out of it. I then interviewed with a mid tier company, and that one ended up going well. After that, I started the process with another top company, but this was a company that I was super passionate about, I loved the product and used it daily, so I was really excited that I got to interview with them.


Fast forward a week, I got an offer from that mid tier company. I really wanted to finish the process with the dream company, so I let the recruiter know that I had a deadline. Later that week, the recruiter called me with an offer for an internship at that company, at nearly $50/hr. I was shocked, but obviously excited as it was my dream company and an offer I couldn't refuse.


This is where the guilt comes in. I received this offer without having to go through a single technical interview... I had a few behavioral interviews with various hiring managers on various teams, but having that offer deadline somehow let me skip the technical interviews and go straight to an offer. This was an incredibly competitive and selective company, and they regularly give challenging technical interviews to their candidates and I'm fairly sure I'm the only one who got an offer there without having to do a single technical interview.


During the internship, I performed extremely well, consistently got positive feedback from my manager, my project ended up being used in production, learned a lot, and I managed to receive a full-time offer for after I graduate, with a base salary of around ~125k in the bay area, plus other bonuses and RSUs.


Now, I know I earned this offer, and I don't feel bad about receiving it, I worked my butt off at the internship and definitely think I deserve the offer, but I can't help to feel bad getting into this company in the first place, avoiding all technical interviews, especially after reading all the stories on here regarding people and their technical interview horror stories and about how they can't find internships. I feel extremely guilty somehow getting into this competitive company avoiding all that, and thats giving me doubts on whether or not I should take the offer. Did I actually earn it when I lucked my way into the company, even after performing well during the internship?"

This is my first development job. I am 21 years old (if that matters). I finished my first week and this is my experience:


I'm the only developer in the whole company. Nobody can mentor me.


It's all written in VB and old ASP with no comments at all (I got hired after completing an ASP.NET MVC C# coding bootcamp).


I have to code inside a super slow RDP session with a SharePoint server (code will not compile otherwise).


I must dress very nice with a tie and everything.


I also have to provide IT assistance for our internal employees even if i was in the middle of coding.


Nothing to do yet. No one has given me an assignment so I just sit there and learn other, more modern, code like React and Angular 2.


My question is: Should I just put in my two weeks now or should I job search while employed here? I am not in need of money right now and nobody is going to interview me over the weekend. I'll have to take off work to interview. I would rather take an internship with for less money than this. But if I leave now I'm not guaranteed another dev opportunity. What do you guys think?"

My university had a program that allowed students to prolong their graduation date by a year to fit in 2 semester-long internships, which would help students in their career. I opted out of this, and if it weren't for a family member knowing people, I probably wouldn't have ended up with the internship I had.

--

Now that I'm done with school, cold applications are fruitless and the only way I've gotten connections is through using that same family member. I'm talking with a few people, but it has been months since I've graduated and I feel absolutely awful about the whole process.

--

I've set up my LinkedIn to let employers know I'm available, and job sites such as Indeed. Occasionally, I get recruiters that email me but they never respond after their initial message.

--

I live in the Bay Area, so it might be a different story for those living in regions with a lower saturation of techies, but I don't understand how getting a solid job is possible without having strong connections with those in the industry.

I browse this sub on occasion, and looking at the posts, it frustrates me to see people saying that they don't really work on projects but still get interviews with all these bigwig companies. Are people really getting interviews from cold applications or is there usually some intermediary? I'd really like to know."

6wp9yl,13,2017-08-29,I have one year. Should I continue being a stripper with extra free time or take this soul sucking job with alright pay but which would be killer on a resume?,iamquiteaverage,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/6wp9yl/i_have_one_year_should_i_continue_being_a/,"Hi, a little background- I am 23 F and just moved to a new town for one year perusing an internship/self employment opportunities as an artist. Warning- this got a little long! Sorry.



I moved here to this town with my boyfriend, he is attending the university and I decided to take welding classes and get as close to a certification as I can within the next year. We both want to leave this state (USA) as soon as possible but not before getting on our feet a little. 



I have an Art degree and previous studio internships. I was at several points a restaurant manager or a supervisor. I get offered promotions quickly when I enter a new job or I get added responsibility because I am one who can handle it. That being said I've never had a specialized job, it has all been retail and food service.



2 years ago I became an exotic dancer. I love pole dance and found out I could make more money doing that than I could working 50 plus hours running a restaurant while still finishing my degree. I've danced for nearly two years off and on, holding down part time jobs for the resume and one full time job as well so I would not have 'be a stripper' for my work history when I reentered the workforce. 



My brain got tired of the interactions- I don't like bars and the men are getting really aggressive and it is hard to compete with the girls prostituting themselves out. I make half as much as I did two years ago, but still more than I could possibly do with my skill set and age, and probably more than most people my age in this state. 



I intended to quit dancing when I moved to this town recently. I acquired new certifications to prepare my better for jobs that aren't 8 dollars an hour. But for weeks I've been looking and there is nothing here- the average restaurant manager salary is only 12.50 an hour and this entire section of the state only brings home an average of 10 dollars an hour. That includes the salary of the hundreds of well paid researchers and professors in the university here. What I am seeing realistically is that I will take a shitty service job for under 9 an hour and have a hard time getting my bills paid.



Now I travel back and forth from my home town to use a little studio type deal that I cannot bring with me in order to make my sculptures to sell. And I have class. So I do not want to be working overtime(which always happens when I take any food service job). I took a job as a dancer at the local strip club. The schedule is so forgiving. But I do not want to dance anymore. 



I got an interview with the police department here. A job I am under qualified for but would be paid training and it would look incredible on my resume. My mom would be so proud. A very respectable job. It would pay 13.50 an hour. Pretty good, I am very stoked about it. The interview went exceptionally well aside from one thing- the hours are going to be incredibly demanding and I will be required to work 11pm to 7am. They said I need to constantly be on call and I should not be upset when I have to work my days off with night before notice even when my time off was vacation/planned in advance. They want me, on days that I have class, come in before the class, leave for the class, then come back and work until about 4am. The original job posting did not mention they were looking for someone overnight, and there is no compensation for working the 3rd shift. 



This is the best job I would have ever had, has health and dental, 401(k), and other benefits (I've never had any of those from any job since I was 16) best paying (aside from dancing) and it would look very good on my resume. 



But if I take it, I am going to be worked to death with no time for me to build my own business selling my hand made items (yeah I know it sounds cheesy but I have worked very hard to make this a reality and it is my dream job, and I do make a little money from it- I am confident one day I will be successful! )



At this strip club I just got hired at, they cater to the college football home games days, and apparently the money is incredible. And I only need to be there about 30 hours a week, and can come in to pick up any shift I want if I need extra cash. 
I would have the time to work on my own business and take all the welding classes and possibly be certified by the end of my lease next year- or be very close to it. 



TL:DR- Should I keep being a stripper (which is only half soul sucking because I love pole dance) and use my free time/money to chase my dreams and education, or take this job with grueling hours which would be entirely soul sucking but pays alright and would look incredible on a resume?

Thank you so much for reading this. I am sorry it got so long winded!"

I will try to update my story regularly, but if I don't it is quite likely that I have been found, and there will be no conclusion to this story. 
______________________________

It all began with a summer internship at a huge bank, well know for its political links. I was at the top of the world. At the age of 19, I had a great career in front of me, and I was yet to reach the prime of my life. So far in my life, I was a prodigy. I had great results in school, was an active football player, a decent body and great friends. I had been hand picked from my university for this job.
 
The internship started of fairly well, with the full group of interns all a few years older than me being introduced to the sales people, working as a team for about a month, and eventually being split up to go work in specific departments. The day we were split, I was the last person to be called, and was sent into the office of one of the directors, while the rest headed off to trading floors. I walked in and saw three balding men who welcomed me and asked me to take a seat. I was briefed on my role in this small team.
 
The first guy, Klackenstein, was the head of the team, and handed me a laptop with a lot of information. He also gave me a lot of perks, a paid for apartment in a top area, a car, and a credit card with a ridiculous limit for personal spending. I was briefed on my role and told to start working. I had to figure out how to increase profits for all companies I was handed, by using resources from other companies. At the surface, all seemed well.
 
I used my car to get around. on the weekends I got used to splurging on my card, and made the most of the little time I had, and week days were mostly spent at work. One Monday, I got to work a little late, and was asked to meet Kackenstein in his office. He was with the other two men, and they were inquiring on the progress to date. I briefed them, and gave them my calculations and data on how to increase the profits across the board. They seemed pleased enough, and the conversation shifted to a lighter note asking about my weekend, and what I did. They were particularly interested in what I did on Sunday morning, and I felt it was odd that they were prodding me about it. I told them I had simply gone for brunch a local restaurant. After this meeting, I was reflecting on the past few weeks. It suddenly hit me that these guys were aware of my whereabouts and what I was doing. The one time I was not in my apartment, did not use my car or did not have my card on me, was the time they questioned me about! This was my first clue that all was not as it seemed.  
 
I got home that day, and decided my next plan of action. I called my girlfriend over, and popped the idea of her moving in with me. I knew she would want to redecorate, and she predictably enough, she jumped on the idea and started shopping for decoration. I put everything on my card, to intentionally bait my bosses. At this point, I was sure I was being monitored, and made sure I spoke clearly so that they could hear everything I said.
 
After a particularly busy week, I presented my draft report to Klackenstein on a Thursday afternoon in his office. He loved the ideas within. I had managed to merge the concept of the companies working in sync, with one company pushing a product, that would create a demand for another company. This was despite not knowing the actual products themselves! This was a lot more complicated, but explaining it would be a full post, and would not add much context here. As I would later find out, what I did for the company actually led to a slew of events which began with 911.

 Klackenstein looked very happy, and I decided to grab the moment and ask for a day off on Friday, so I could get a full 3 days off to redecorate my place. He happily obliged. I got up, stretched just enough to reach the ceiling board and slip a voice transmitter into the space, shook Klackensteins hand and headed out.
 
I got to my street, and circled the block prior to entering, as the next part had to be played to perfection. I got home, and got to work. I got my electromagnetic detector, and managed to detect 4 microphones, one in my bedroom, and the others in the living room, kitchen, and dining room, and a camera pointed at my entrance door. Great, I could work in any of the other rooms without fear of being watched. I converted my gaming computer into a high performance server, and converted the extra room to look exactly like my apartment entrance. Using a burner phone I bought earlier, I texted my girlfriend and asked her to meet me in the basement where my car was parked. I gave her my phone, car and credit card, and told her to splurge on the card. As she was reversing, I noticed the front tire had a missing central piece where the Mercedes logo was. I thought it was odd but did not think much of it. I stuck to the basement for a while, avoiding the areas monitored by surveillance cameras. After being fairly comfortable of the time that passed, I made my way to the electric room, and stuck a wire in between the circuits. This was enough to knock off the whole building. I now had to be quick. I ran up the stairs, yanked out the camera from its housing, and rewired it to the decoy entrance. Next, I hacked a hole in the wall from my bedroom to the decoy area, and checked the rest of the apartment for any missed surveillance equipment. There was no sign of any. Being satisfied that I was now ahead of the game, I decided to make myself scarce from the apartment before the electricity returned.

 I sat at a local coffee shop and removed my receiver for the transmitter. I wore it in my ear, and started listening. Klackensteins angry voice came through.

"".. you actually did that? What is wrong with you, can you not see how well this is done? He is so much more useful alive than dead"" I started shivering.

""I just need him out of action for a week or so, I made sure he wouldn't die. Just wanted to shake him up enough to keep him away while we insert the items into this report and present it. He gets a whiff of this, and he will quit and report it. Then I will have to eliminate him. Don't you understand, this will protect him."" I could not put a face to this voice.

I looked across the room at the TV, and a newsflash alerted me of an accident on the freeway. As they zoomed into the wreckage, I recognized my car. I could not make out what was coming through the transmitter, and after feeling dizzy for a moment, I lost consciousness and fell down, hitting my head hard on the floor. "

6ws4je,1,2017-08-29,My university is doing something shifty...,itsevan77,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/6ws4je/my_university_is_doing_something_shifty/,"I'll try to be as objective as possible. Takes place in the US.

My college offers a course called [CIS 487 Information Technology for Development \(A\)](https://www.brockport.edu/academics/catalogs/2015/courses/ug/CIS.html)

This course entails sending out students to local businesses to assist in their IT needs. This is for businesses such as mom n' pop stores that may not be able to afford the cost of IT services, and so our professor matches us up with a business for us to assist.

I'm worried because my professor continually stresses that this course will take up lots of time and demands a flexible schedule, and I don't want to be exploited since my time is extremely valuable this last year.

From what I understand, unpaid internships are not supposed to involve any labor whatsoever, and I don't believe we are assisting non-profits. The whole course premise seems kinda sketchy, and I think it would be a great opportunity for the professor to earn kickbacks from businesses in exchange for cheap student labor.

I hope someone might know something about the legalities of this, or might point me somewhere that does.

Edit:[ Department of Labor explicitly states they are cracking down on unpaid internship labor.](http://www.btlaw.com/files/ALERT%20-%20L&amp;E_DOL%20Cracks%20Down%20on%20Unpaid%20Interns.pdf) Here is a link to the [Fair Labor Standards Act.](https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs71.pdf)"

I'm at the point where interviewers are asking for 2-3 references. However, I do not have a list of references. Partially because I have never been asked for references in any full-time or intern positions, and partially because my latest references would be from my current position.

Some background on my current employment. I was an intern with them during my undergrad in 2014, then started working full-time with them in 2015 post-graduation. It is now 2017 and I am still with this company. I have no ill-feelings toward the company, but they do not know I am looking for new employment. I do not want to make this awkward if I do not end up changing positions, so I do not want to ask anyone from my current employer to be a reference.

So this leaves me a little lost of what would be best. I have other intern experience from 2012 and 2013, both those are almost 5 years ago now. I think they would provide good references, but it isn't exactly relevant to the work I do now. If they are best, I could try and contact them through Linkedin, or past company emails.

I now have the opportunity to to study for another year and to reapply to Imperial College and I believe I would get in (i have a good application but didn't apply to top Uni's this year as I didn't do the A levels they wanted).

I have read countless threads about university etc. but I am unsure which route to follow. Any of you been in a similar position and have any advice for me?


Also, the university I have a place at this year doesn't do Algorithms and data structures in first year so I am leaning even more toward Imperial. Would this matter much for internships etc? Would I just have to learn it in the summer after first year.. thoughts?"

At the same time, apart from 1-2 people, nobody in my team knew or cared about what I was doing. Overall, the internship seemed bland. 

Now it's hard for me to get a measure of what is actually standard/common in the industry, as opposed to things more company specific. So maybe more specifically:

How was your mentorship? Did you have weekly time together to pair, or would he/she check up on you often to see how things go, etc. 

Did you participate in code reviews? I.e. give feedback to others. 

Were you involved in the work of the entire team? Were you invited to participate in the overall discussions? Did you feel as part of the team? 

Did you like your project? Were you able to finish it? If not, why?

I'm not sure if this is normal for an interview but last summer, I had 4 technicals, a culture fit and then a managerial interview and this time, it's honestly just a 40 minute call with the potential manager, then the offer.

The coding challenge was the only technical aspect of the interview process but I was able to finish it about 50 minutes (given around an hour and a half) and I honestly think anyone could have done it in the same timeline.

6wuo52,185,2017-08-29,Green Intern: Ampere Law &amp; Court Order,GostBoster,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/6wuo52/green_intern_ampere_law_court_order/,"This might be a series of tales about my times as an intern at a public university on a more or less chronological sequence.

Setting: It's early 2011 and I'm pretty green at tech support. I only did basic computering courses, everything else was self-taught, a combination of not having money to make a proper tech course and friends not having money to hire a proper tech. Most internships require prior experience, the solution for this Catch-22 is internship at a public institution: Get the top score on a test against a few hundred, pass a basic interview, you're in. 

Players:

$Brick - Bossman. I'll call him Brick because [redacted], he's built like a brick house, and he mains Roland. I knew him for quite some time before this.

$Lilith - Coworker, above me in the pecking order. Nothing particular about her yet, but gonna roll with this naming convention.

This is my first day. At the time I was a Computer Science sophomore, studying at another campus. Exact science courses left this campus because it lacked equipment, still using outdated 90s fossils. Brick gives me the obligatory tour, we already knew each other and the place already for quite some time, but hey, protocol and now I have clearance for new places. 

Brick brings me to a room containing a cubic ton of desktops, boxes full of power cords strips and patch cords, and briefs me on the long-term assignment: Wipe, image and deploy them all. How they got the budget? See, when the government says they invested a few millions in education, they don't tell you how they did it (Cash? Pfft). They had these machines sitting for quite some time, since they didn't had neither demand nor budget or manpower to operate and maintain them, so they were left there.

Well, a judge disagrees, so we have a court order to get those online. Budget was slashed so manglement could invest in what was required to get it done (hire a single extra intern). Asked where I should haul those desktops. Brick told me some of them are already more or less in place in an improvised lab so we can make a test run first. I'm introduced Lilith, wiping a single machine the old way to see if the step-by-step guide was OK for interns to replicate, filling me in the basics of how domain machines work. *At this point I have absolutely no knowledge of imaging tools and they're not using them yet.*

The plan: Turn everything on, plop DVDs, leave them running, back to IT room to get acquainted with my desk, check if everything is working on it including ~~Borderlands~~ AD, go back there to finish (manual setup), analyze the time spent and bottlenecks of this deployment, figure out what can be automated or scripted, find creative ways of wasting 1-2 hours waiting for no calls. Almost no deployed machines means almost no IT calls.

Not so fast bucko.

I don't know much about electricity, but I know a bit about wire-melting loads. I happen to know these classrooms were built in early 90s, my uncle was a builder there (hence the ""I did college"" jokes), so I knew the wiring was the bare minimum to get the following to work:

 - Four 2x40W lamps
 - A slide/overhead projector
 - A fan

I assumed they upgraded the wiring so this should be not a problem. Lilith turned on a fifth computer, tripping the breaker. Turns out the whole room was on a single 10A breaker. It was supposed to have two 10A breakers but it still would not be enough. Manglement was brought for a demonstration, because they already scheduled usage of the (experimental) room and 40 seats, we had to demonstrate it was physically impossible to get it done. 

Manglement cuts in the bone again to get a bid for electricians and electric engineers to redo the wiring. This will take a few months. In the meantime we could only make up to four machines at a time. We could squeeze six by turning off the lights in theory. End result, restricted to making 4-6 machines at a time. What could be done in a day or two takes weeks, wiring won't be redone for the next 2-3 months. Users who swear to cope with these restrictions keep tripping breakers, blowing fuses and corrupting Windows. 

Bonus: We assembled another 40 machines in the other room with two 10A breakers and turned off lights to get extra power. At the seventh or eight machine in one side, a fuse blows up. See, until wiring got re/done, we had only one or two plugs on each side of the room, each plug serving 2-4 rows, so we had to make do by chaining a bunch of 3-foot power strips together. Didn't caught on that, other interns were less bright, users everywhere used those powerstrips for everything so... Request for a pack of ~~advil~~ 10A fuses denied.

**TL;DR:** Campus gets a container full of computers they don't need. Judge tells us we must need them or else. Apparently you can't plug forty desktops on a room which previously only had a forty watts lamp. Forty daisy chained power strips can't take forty times the load of one. And that's terrible."
6wvo2t,15,2017-08-29,"Drastic, overnight change in reaction to meds. Desperate and terrified that I'll never be me again.",yellowscoot,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/6wvo2t/drastic_overnight_change_in_reaction_to_meds/,"I (21f) have been on 36mg of concerts for 7 years and I've always felt so lucky. Ive had minimal side affects and the meds never seemed to affect my personality or mood. I've always been confident, outgoing, high energy, bubbly, goofy and passionate about hobbies, giant extrovert. Additionally, after years of hard work and determination, I was even to beginning to achieve some big long term goals of mine. In short, I was the happy and healthy and hardly had to worry about my ADHD. (Also, I've never really felt withdrawal symptoms, I take it during the week and not on weekends, and sometimes I would even go weeks at a time during the summer without it and feel fine, I just needed it for school and work) 

Then one day I had a stomachache, went to urgent care and ended up having an appendectomy that day. After surgery I seemed to bounce back quickly (wasn't taking ADHD meds while recovering), I even got my appetite back quickly. Then a few days later I suddenly lost my ability to eat or sleep. So many random symptoms popped in and out over the following weeks but the big ones were total loss of appetite and inability to sleep. After a while I started feeling depressed and tried to return to my internship. I took my meds and the symptoms worsened. I would have a resting heart rate of 120bpm, frequent panic attacks, ungodly rage and anxiety and total loss of my personality. I was a monster who went from screaming and crying and kicking to emotionless drone from hour to hour. 


It's been weeks and some things have gotten better. I've been so distraught and afraid. I've seen so many doctors and no one can seem to figure it out. The random symptoms are gone but I just can't seem to get back to normal. 

Here's what my days are like now

On days that I take my concerta:
-productive at work and school
-can feel good with myself when I don't have to interact with others
But
-can only be productive with stuff I have to do like school or work. But lost all interest in gardening, knitting, cooking. I'm in school majoring in songwriting and I can't even write songs. 
-0 appetite. Can barely force myself to get 500 calories in a day
-no sleep for 24 hours if I take meds 
-loss of personality, loss of interest in anything
-can feel pretty good, happy/productive during school and work but once I get home, I feel tired, must lay down and all I can do is watch tv for hours. Sometimes that's literally from 1pm-9pm then I ""go to sleep"" which I can't do without heavy dose of sleeping pills. 
-I can fake emotion but feel that I can't feel love. I love my partner so deeply but when I'm on my meds I have to fake affection for his sake but he can tell. 


On days that I don't take my meds (weekends):
-can feel full happiness, love, emotion
-I feel I have more of my personality back 
-I can eat all day no problem 
-I can sleep like a baby
But
-can't motivate
-can't be productive 
-if I plan social outings or activities to get out for myself, I have a great day. But if I lay down or try to watch an episode of Netflix, that's it, I can't get out of bed. I feel depressed and tired and can't motivate myself to get up. 

I've experienced high anxiety and extreme temper with and without meds. Been learning to control it a bit more but it takes a lot of effort and I have to keep very busy. 

It's been almost two months since this started and I'm so scared I'll never get myself back. After school or work I don't want to do anything but watch tv and go to bed super early. I'm trying to adapt to this in case it never goes away but I don't recognize myself. I used to write songs and knit and cook and garden and go on walks and now nothing. And there is such a drastic difference between being on the meds vs off and I can see it wearing on mu boyfriend. It's like we used to get to have ""me"" 7 days a week and now we only get ""me"" on weekends. I feel like I've been steadily climbing this mountain for 7 years and suddenly I fell off a cliff and now I'm lost. I feel like I'm losing myself and I don't know what to do. I feel scared that I'll never get myself back. I used to sing all the time and hug my boyfriend and dive into projects and cook and bake. Now I watch tv, I don't talk, I don't eat and I don't sleep. Everything changed drastically and overnight, all starting with appendicitis. 

Has anyone ever experienced a drastic change in reaction to their (previously successful) meds? Something to do with post surgery? 


*note, one of the doctors did genetic testing with me recently to see what meds would be best for me out of all of them and concerta was the top one, the one that has worked for me for 7 years until now. She is going to have me try a lower dose (27mg) but there's a complication with the pharmacy. 

*also, about a month before the appendicitis, I went vegan. But in that month I felt happier and healthier than ever. Truly the peak of my lifetime and didn't see a change in reaction to meds. Since the loss of appetite I have been daily loose about the vegan diet since my priority is to just get some kind of food in my stomach. Have had things like eggs, smoked salmon, and protein bars/powders that contain milk. 


I'm desperate for answers, tips or just to know that someone understands. 

I'm confused that there seems to be no explanation, I'm frustrated that I seem to have lost years of progress and I'm devastated that I seem to have lost myself. 


*edit
I have a wonderful therapist, supportive family friends and partner. I'm doing my best to just adapt to this new life but I don't want this to be my new life. I doing my best to start over but I want my old self back and I just don't understand why all of this happened so suddenly and drastically. "

Rant enclosed.,shitty_tech,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/6wvsdw/recently_started_a_desktop_support_job_and_feel/,"So I recently got a position as a desktop support technician with a largeish company. I had previously done a 6 month internship there through my school. About a month and a half ago, they brought me on full time. Thats where i'm at now. Now the ""back story"", if you can call it that.

Ever since i can remember i have been a poor student and it was no different when i was in college (My 2 year community college program was sort of a general IT program that touched on lots of different subjects). I graduated with good grades, but I was always more concerned with passing than learning, as I really wanted to get a good job with a potential for a good career (yes i feel stupid just writing that). As a result i feel woefully lacking in actual practicable skills, and i cant shake the feeling that my grades were more a result of ""gaming the system"" than actually putting in the work.


Now that i am working full time and can no longer ""game the system"", I dread every day. Desktop support is supposed to be the easiest job in IT! I feel like some tickets I respond to should be easy but they take me a long time to figure out or I'm forced to seek advice from others. I live in fear of being caught off guard with tech questions that I dont know. I also worry a lot that as time goes on I will be ""exposed"" and people will realize i dont really know anything. To make things even worse, I feel that my coworkers think I know more than I do, and the fear of being found out for the bad tech I am causes me to avoid asking for help in a pathetic attempt to fly under the radar or something...i dunno.


As an intern, I always felt that i had a certain ""safety net"". Now that im a real employee, I dont feel that any more and I feel like i don't even compare to others in my position. I feel like as someone who is still relatively new, that I probably still do have some leeway, but that doesn't change my mindset day-to-day.


I know this is a rambling incoherent mess but i am just wondering if there is a light at the end of the tunnel. I think I have always been one to suffer from ""impostor syndrome"", so i just wanted to bounce this off of someone to see if its really as bad as I think it is.


I know its early days for me yet and things could get better as i get more comfortable, but i'm just wondering if anyone has ever had a similar experience or could offer some advice?

Thanks to anyone who took the time to read this."

Moving back home, the mental health professionals in my area aren't helpful (compared to where I went to university) and don't have much empathy (since most people in my area that go to therapy/medication are for substance abuse cases.)

Currently I work at a grocery store; I enjoy my work and coworkers but it's minimum wage. The high schoolers and my siblings nag me about leaving (it's affecting my self esteem.) 

I've been getting interviews at other companies but I'm tired of people making fun of my situation when I'm trying to leave.

Graduate school isn't an option because I can't afford to take student loans and my applications are weak.

I had at panic attack at work in front of my coworkers. I'll be 25 in a month. I have no friends to hang out (theres a few people I talk to once a while) and I can't meet people to church/bars/gym since I work the late shift.

I know exactly what I want to do in life and the steps to get there but it's taking time; I tried alternative options.

Currently my obsession (distraction) is over a 19 year old coworker (when he doesn't give me the time of day).

I tried getting back into my hobbies or learning (taking online classes) but I'm too physically exhausted from work.

I'm basically 25 years old with two degrees working at a grocery store doing nothing.

I'm losing hope after two years (I had to quit social media after all the comparison). 

Therapy and medication doesn't help. PS I'm Asian-American and people expect me to be the model minority since I look Chinese; People set higher expectations for me at job interviews wanting me to know Chinese or at work people think I'm the pharmacist or store manager when I'm a lowly minimum wage worker.

Any tips to get out of the super shitty situation?"

6wyftj,1,2017-08-30,Generation Uber for X or universal business model,Eva_Davis,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/6wyftj/generation_uber_for_x_or_universal_business_model/,"Uber — The service for calling private drivers is the fastest growing company of the decade. Back in 2009, Uber was a small start-up with no global plans. Over 8 years of existence, the company has expanded its network to 600 cities around the world and raised about $11.5 billion in 14 rounds.

Such a dizzying success is the dream of any startup. The popularity of Uber has contributed to the creation of many projects using similar technology in completely different sectors, such as product delivery, transportation or even travel. To quickly and easily explain the ideas of their startups, the founders started to compare their projects with Uber, calling them Uber for.

The terms “Uber for X” or Uberization began to gain popularity back in 2013. Today they’re used by both beginning businessmen and established investors. At AngelList, a web site where startups are looking for investors, there are 526 companies in the description of which “Uber for” is used. On ProductHunt, a website where users tell about new startups, a separate category has appeared, called Uber for X startups (https://www.producthunt.com/e/uber-for-x).

It is notable that the Uber for X model is universal and can be used in completely different niches. Below, I offer several examples that will help make sure of this

1. Instacart
No time for shopping? The Instacart application is a well-known service “Uber for purchases”. The company, founded in 2012 by a former employee of Amazon, Apurva Mehta, provides its services throughout the United States. With the help of the service you can choose your favorite store, order products and delivery time and just wait for the courier. In March of 2017, the company closed a round D, which brought them $400 million investment.

2. My Police
Service for interactive communication between police and lawful citizens. Authors and developers call their startup “Uber for the police”. “My Police” is a social project of the Noosphere Association headed by Maxim Polyakov. The main function of the application is an alarm button “SOS” — it allows one-click on the screen of the mobile phone to call the police, automatically sending data about the location of the user. Also, the app allows you to assess the professionalism of a policeman, receive notifications about the situation anywhere in the city and look at the map where the nearest police stations and medical facilities are located. In August of 2016 the service started its work in the Dnieper and after a year of testing the system is ready to start all over Ukraine and enter the international markets.

3. Flinja
Flinja is a service known as the “Uber for work”. The company was founded in 2014 by Victor Young and Ken Miller. The Flinja model is more like the Uber model. The platform consists of two parts: the first is for employers, who are looking for students and interns, the second is for applicants themselves. In reality, Flinja is a market of actual vacancies where students can not only find work, but also acquire additional skills necessary for professional work. Investments in the Flinja project amounted to more than $1.2 million.

4. Application from RTS (Recycle Track Systems)
RTS, also known as the “Uber for household waste,” was created by Adam Pascal and Gregory Letieri in 2015. Despite the fact that the company is pretty young, the RTS project has already attracted more than $11 million of investments. The application for mobile devices, issued by the company, offers users to order garbage take away at any convenient time, as well as receive notifications about the fact of the performed work. The service is convenient not only for individual clients, but also for large retail chains, cafes, restaurants, etc.

5. Firefly Aerospace
The model of “Uber for X” has become a universal helper for solving problems not only on Earth, but also in near orbit. The project Firefly Aerospace, Uber for micro-satellites, is developing light and ultra-light vehicles to deliver cargoes to near-earth orbit. Firefly Systems, the company’s original name, attracted nearly $ 22 million in 5 rounds. In September of 2016 Firefly did not close the deal with one of the investors and was forced to suspend work. Already in May 2017 the project was restarted thanks to Maxim Polyakov, the founder of Noosphere Ventures. Now the developers are testing the launch of the Beta missile capable of delivering cargoes weighing up to 1.1 tons to the near-earth orbit.

6. DoctorOnDemand
DoctorOnDemand — a service through which you can get medical help or arrange online consultation with the right specialist by simply selecting the appropriate application in your smartphone. The project was founded in 2012, and belongs to Teladoc, Inc., a well-known provider of medical services on a remote basis. During the time of its existence, DoctorOnDemand has attracted additional funding of more than $86 million.

There are more non-standard start-ups based on the solution “Uber for X”. This vast list includes applications such as names as Minibar, Eros and Ease.

The Minibar application, available to Apple and Android users, offers to order wine, beer and alcoholic drinks without leaving your home. The company was created by Lindsey Andrews and Lara Crystal in May of 2013. “Uber for alcoholic beverages” is another promising area that is likely to be in demand in many countries.

The Ease project, also known as “Uber for marijuana,” is a new startup, headed by Don Bradshaw. With Ease, you can order marijuana or products containing it, delivered right to your home.

A new application called Eros, allows you to choose a partner for a night or escort service in countries such as the US, Canada and the UK. The application has a staggering demand. Moreover, in June, Eros went to the ICO. The announced sum collected was $5 million. Fundraising ends on July 23, at the time of writing this article, the startup managed to raise $4,834,893.

Being an almost ideal model for building a successful business, Uber is used by many start-up companies as an example of quality service. Don’t forget that any startup has its own characteristics, which can not be ignored in the pursuit of the success of an “Uber”. After all, they helped create a completely unique product that surpasses any analogues in popularity."

6wyyns,5,2017-08-30,Mass Winsock Resets Needed?!,cryohazard,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/6wyyns/mass_winsock_resets_needed/,"Hello All,

I have an issue in a school district where a large number of machines are 'connecting' to the wireless, but only receiving a 169.x.x.x address. After a winsock reset all is good. What the hell happened to cause this? The only major change this summer was a DC was brought out of the infrastructure a little dirty, but I didn't think that would affect the clients network stack. Any thought?!

EDIT: https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-networking/problems-connecting-to-the-internet/f121306e-fab5-411d-833f-e4490ecb8b5c

That might be playing into this.

EDIT 2: Assumptions were made that techs had rebooted. Techs assumed interns had rebooted. No one rebooted. Another set was reported and reboots were performed without winsock resets with success.

Current belief is these sets of laptops were imaged early in the summer and shut down until the students went to use them today. If that is the case, that would line up with when I had WSUS issues and it's possible these machines didn't receive the KB mentioned in the article linked above."

6wzhkw,6,2017-08-30,Some questions about getting hireable during college,itriedsorry,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/6wzhkw/some_questions_about_getting_hireable_during/,"Howdy.

I'm just about to start junior year in EE at Texas A&amp;M. The courses are interesting, I'm on track to get my ring after this semester, and I'm sitting at a 3.5 GPA. It's all great.

My roommate is a final semester senior in civil, and he's applying for grad school. When we met we talked a bit about the future, and he's already starting saving and investing, has had a handful of internships, and he's planning on going to one of those companies after school to at least get his PE license.

Since then I get a sinking feeling about what's after graduation, because I have ***none*** of that. I have no work experience or internships, haven't made a resume since high school, and I only have the vague idea that I've had this whole time in this degree that 1) space is cool, 2) electronics are cool, and 3) I should go to spacex or boeing and be involved with electronics systems on spacecraft.

I'm not asking y'all to plan my career out for me, but I have a few questions that would help me get started with it all.

* I'm pretty sure I'm behind the pack because I don't have these things done, but **how important is this stuff right now?** In other words, is ""whittling out a resume and looking at career opportunities"" a 3 hour class or a 5 hour class with 2 labs and mountains of homework?
* **How do I go about researching career stuff in general?** It's not something in the best of thread or the resources.
* **What do I put on a resume if I don't have work experience?** Some people have relevant projects as well on their resumes, but the only thing I've done project-wise in EE is a research paper.
* **If anyone here has marched in a drum corps, do you have it on your resume, and if so, under what?**

Thank you for your time"

6x02u1,1,2017-08-30,Organic chemistry lab and bioinformatics grad school [question],bioinf-,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/6x02u1/organic_chemistry_lab_and_bioinformatics_grad/,"Hello r/bioinformatics!

I'm currently an undergraduate bioinformatics major. When I scheduled classes for this semester, I was fairly sure I wanted to go into wet-lab biology as a full-time career and pursue a masters and PhD in cellular biology. However, I spent the summer working on dry-lab research and fell in love with it. I am now pretty focused on going to graduate school for bioinformatics/computational biology. While I love this field at the moment, I am aware that I might change my mind and am open to switching career paths again.

I am signed up for a fairly heavy semester consisting of organic chem and lab, genetics, and two computer science classes. That works out to 16 credits at my school. I have an additional internship class that I have to write a paper for, but most of that work is done because my internship was over the summer. In total 19 credits (though the last 3 aren't difficult or particularly time consuming).

Lab at my school is kind of a pain in the ass. For general chemistry lab last year, I spent 3+ hours every week just copying the lab protocol from my lab manual to my lab notebook because we were not allowed to have the manual in class. I spent several other hours during the week finishing pre and post lab questions. Gen chem lab was required for my major, however, and organic chem lab is not. I'm worried that organic chem lab will take up a huge chunk of extra time that could be used to work on my other classes. This would be fine if I actually need it as a prerequisite for graduate school programs, but I don't know how many programs require it. I really don't see myself ending up in a wet-lab position full time, though it could be a part of my job in the future.

So with all of that said, is taking organic chem lab a good idea just in case? Do many bioinformatics and computational biology programs require it?

Thanks in advance for the help! I apologize if this is long and rambles a bit. Let me know if there's any information I can add to clarify my dilemma :)

TL;DR: I switched career interests from wet to dry lab. Had already signed up for organic chem lab and considering dropping to make time for other coursework. I'm wondering if lab is a waste of time at my school and with my future interests.

Edit: Thanks for the input everybody! I considered the advice here and spoke to an advisor who said it would be rare for graduate programs to require it as long as I'm choosing bioinformatics/computational biology and not pure biology. I don't see myself giving up the computer side of things. I think I'll be dropping the lab to focus on my other courses. Thanks again!"

I am done all my coursework (yeah i know paying the school for an internship after all your coursework is done, what a load..) and began to apply back in May.

I applied to a very prestigious program (Company A) that was paid and was 9 months long. I made it to an interview, but unfortunately since I was in another state I had to do a Skype interview and ultimately was rejected. 

I kept applying places and found a smaller company (Company B) that offered a 6 month internship that came with a stipend. I interviewed with them and I guess they hadn't realized I was doing this internship for school credit because they then emailed back and said that they would like to offer the position, but they would only be able to offer school credit and the internship would now be 3 months long.  Its still a good company, and in need of an internship to complete my degree I accepted.  This job starts next week. 

A couple days ago I get an email from Company A saying one of their interns from another department could no longer participate and invited me in the next day to interview.  I went in, had a great interview, and received an email from HR saying that they were glad the interview went well and will be contacting me early next week to let me know of my status.

I would definitely choose Company A over B, my question is, how should I bring this up with Company B.  Obviously if I don't get it then there is nothing to worry about, but if I do, how do I let them know that I can no longer accept the position after a week of working there without burning bridges.

Side note: The field I work in is very small and I would actually be working directly with Company B if I was hired by Company A.

I'm planning to go to SJSU for grad school after finishing my BSEE at UCSD this December. Reasons I want to go to SJSU are:

- The program offers afternoon classes for working professional as I plan to have a full-time job while attending school part-time.

- No GRE tests since I'm from a UC and have more than 3.0 GPA.

- Located in my hometown.

About Me:

- 3.3 GPA, one internship in telecom industry, no research experience.

- My internship offers me a position to work with them after graduation, but the company is out of state and I want to pursue a master's right after my bachelor's degree so I have not given them answer yet.

My questions are:
- Is the MSEE program at SJSU ABET accredited?

- What are the best specialization in term of job aspect?

- How important is the Statement of Purpose? Is there any guideline for engineering program?

- Did you find the program helpful in your career advancement? I know the research aspect is not great, but I've never done researched as an undergrad.

- I'm also debating between MSEE and MS Comp E since I like programming (but have very little experience). Would it be difficult to switch if I get admitted?

How do I ask her out?",flycam1991,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/6x1cus/im_an_intern_who_has_a_crush_on_fulltime_coworker/,"To give you a back story about myself.  I'm into my second year as an intern (not at the same business) in my desired field.  I decided to take a leap of faith to move to a completely different city to get my foot in the door.

While working here, I've come across very friendly people who are more than willing to help me.  I even gained a small crush on one of my coworkers who works full-time in a different department in our office.  However, I don’t know if it’s appropriate as an intern to ask out a full-time employee.

The first time she engaged in a conversation was at lunch.  She only asked me how my weekend was.  I didn’t think anything of it, but I started to wonder if she was single and how old she was.
One morning during breakfast I decided to do a little Tinder and Bumble.  I stumbled across my coworker on both apps where I came to find out she is obviously single and we’re the same age.  This kind of gave me high hopes and turned to a “why not” moment.  So, I swiped right.  I didn’t get matched with her and figured to move on.

The following day after lunch she came by and started to rearrange the lunch area furniture.  She went on to tell me that she’s slightly OCD and reminisced of memories about how her father got her into that habit or characteristics.  At the time, I thought she was making small talk and letting me get to know her.

The office layout is very weird.  There’s one stretch of a hallway where personal offices stem off it.  Other coworkers are near each other, the lunch area is out in the open/in the middle of the office and our conference room is hidden away.

One day, due to construction, I decided to hide myself away from the loud noise and banging by going into the conference room.  I was plugging away on work.  Out of nowhere my crush came into the conference room and started to angrily talk about the Yankees vs Tigers brawl that happened.  She’s a Tiger’s fan and she knows I’m a Yankees fan.  I was surprised she found me and went to tell me about the fight.  I smiled and still didn’t think anything of it.

Yesterday at lunch time, I finished my lunch early and decided to run to the rest room.  When I came back to hang out I noticed she was in my initial seat.  I decided to sit in the empty seat across from her.  He began to discuss about her trip next week and what she’ll be doing.

Fast forward to this morning.  She came to my work area to tell me about a dream that I was in.  Her dream took place at a WWE event.  She stated that I came over to her to talk casual and make a nice conversation during her dream.  Then in her dream, she out of nowhere roundhouse kicks me in the face.  She even gave the descriptive sound of what my body sounded like when I hit the mat/floor.  However, she was laughing the whole time telling me the dream.  She even noted she had no idea why she kicked me in the face.

Should I make an approach to her and ask her out to drinks?  How do I get alone time with her so no one hears me asking for her number/out?  What should my next step be if I was to take one?

I don’t have her phone number, but one of my friends suggested that I add her on IG and send her a funny gif in her dm’s.  I think that seems a tad creepy though.  Any thoughts on what to do?

I'm planning to go to SJSU for grad school after finishing my BSEE at UCSD this December. Reasons I want to go to SJSU are:

- The program offers afternoon classes for working professional as I plan to have a full-time job while attending school part-time.

- No GRE tests since I'm from a UC and have more than 3.0 GPA.

- Located in my hometown.

About Me:

- 3.3 GPA, one internship in telecom industry, no research experience.

- My internship offers me a position to work with them after graduation, but the company is out of state and I want to pursue a master's right after my bachelor's degree so I have not given them answer yet.

My questions are:
- Is the MSEE program at SJSU ABET accredited?

- What are the best specialization in term of job aspect?

- How important is the Statement of Purpose? Is there any guideline for engineering program?

- Did you find the program helpful in your career advancement? I know the research aspect is not great, but I've never done researched as an undergrad.

- I'm also debating between MSEE and MS Comp E since I like programming (but have very little experience). Would it be difficult to switch if I get admitted?

6x1ufc,1,2017-08-30,TOVA score and ADHD,sam130,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/6x1ufc/tova_score_and_adhd/,"3 months ago I was tested and diagnosed with a moderate Math Learning Disability through a Psych doctoral intern at my university. I took all the tests that they need and one of them was the TOVA. 

Recently I have learned about Inattentive type ADHD. I think I show a lot of the symptoms like difficulty with organization, time management, completing tasks that require too much effort and some of the other symptoms. I feel like I've been this way since at least middle school, but I never considered ADHD since less severe inattentive types don't fit the popular cultural stigma of ""the hyper mischievous kid"" or ""hey my name is SQUIRREL...what was I saying?"". I scored relatively poorly in working memory and processing speed, 18th and 4th percentiles respectively. My TOVA score was 3.32, which (I assume) would indicate I have less of a risk for ADHD. Does anyone have any input from personal experience or has similar scores? I don't know if I think I have ADHD or not. I contacted the intern who administered the exam to see what he thought, but he hasn't gotten back with me yet. I don't know if the University would test me for ADHD if I didn't seem to be at risk for it from the first exam. 

TL;DR: I got a 3.32 Attention Comparison Score on the TOVA, but I think I have ADHD-Inattentive symptoms. I'm trying to figure out if I should be tested or not. "

 I am a Tunisan citizen/ senior computer science student. I was 'selected' for a 14 month internship with the multinational Electrolux in Stockholm. But I only have 13 months of validity in my passeport.

 2-According to Tunisan law: I am not allowed to renew my passport as long as it is valid for more than 1 year.


This  a wonderful opportunity for me and I am so anxious not to lose it. If anyone has an idea on Swedish law or could suggest a workaround solution or a helpful source. I hope you would help.

 Thank you very much!

I had two offers that expired on Monday so I told them that last week. They said, were expecting you to take this offer now if we're going through with you. So I said sure.

Fast forward to yesterday, apparently the VP wanted to know whether or not I was remote or at hq before doing anything else? I haven't heard from the hiring manager yet today. So I have a feeling the offer may fall through.

What is there to do? I gave up 2 offers for them since the hiring manager asked to confirm that she will be sending me the offer.

I don't want to get royally fucked.

I gave up 2 offers for this job but I feel like the offer is going to fall through. What can I do?

Because I am a single working mother and student so I really don't think I would be able to find time for an unpaid internship just for the experience. If I'm spending time working it needs to be for money, and I do have managerial experience so it's not like I'm fresh out of high school with no jobs listed on my resume. I'm not asking for a huge salary but still.

I guess what I'm asking is, is it expected that you MUST have unpaid internships at a STEM company to get a job in an engineering field? And how many resume-worthy projects should I aim to have under my belt by graduation?"

For those of you who have or had a US tech job or internship, could you post the text of the NDA/Non-compete/Invention Assignment agreements for your companies, and what company you work for? And any other policies that might relate to those issues, especially intellectual property ownership? (I'm interested in the US in particular since that is my location.)

Also, if your company has some kind of 20% time or something like that, what kind of policies does the company have around the IP and such for that?

And yeah, I do realize that these policies go unenforced in a lot of cases since the company just doesn't care enough about your open source enterprise edition fizzbuzz to sue you. But I want to see just how far (or not) companies are willing to take their claims, even if it's just on paper.

Nearly two months have passed since I was hired as an unpaid intern. There have been ups and downs, but overall it's a good fit. My boss says that he wants to turn my internship into a full-time paid position as soon as he has enough money. He predicted that he would have the money in September.  

Here is the problem: the time is approaching when we have to do a major data transfer. It's going to be very tedious and time consuming. I'm not sure I am willing to do it without any compensation. Even if my boss says he will hire me, US Department of Labor law states that he is not obliged to give me a job after my internship ends. I am quite certain that he doesn't have enough money to hire me as a full-time employee yet. The US DoL also states that an internship must prioritize learning experiences over business operations. I am afraid that the data transfer will be, like, one week of learning, and a month of mind-numbing computer work.

I do not have any pressing financial needs.

""I'm surprised you're not in the hospital.""

Dr. Nader, my psychiatrist, is a soft spoken man of considerable credentials.
His exotic brown eyes search my features.

""Are you sleeping well,"" he asks.

I know he is concerned about my sunken bagged eyes and general malaise. This is
the new normal for me. My circadian rhythm has been dead for months. Most of
the time I am completely unsure of what day it is. Apparently this is nothing
abnormal for graduate students.

""Uh, not really,"" -- an understatement by any measure. ""I've been having these
dreams. Nightmares about my brother.""

""And how long has that been,"" he asks.

""It's been a little over a year.""

""And you've had bereavement counselling?""

Shit. I knew this was coming. How do I even respond to this? 'No, I think
counselling is bullshit'? I've seen counsellors in the past for various reasons.
Every time, they try to throw cognitive behavioural therapy at me. It works
about as well as hypnotism -- which is also bullshit.

""No,"" I start in an apologetic tone, ""I've been so busy with research and with
my teaching load that I haven't...""

""It's okay,"" he interjects politely, ""some people need to grieve alone, but you
have a lot of underlying emotions that you haven't unpacked yet. You need to talk
to someone. Anyone. So long as you can work through your own thoughts.""

He shifts in his chair and turns to his computer. Our appointment is just about
done. He's about to check my prescriptions and send me on my way with the standard
selective-serotonin re-uptake inhibitors and my trusty clonazepam (which, oddly enough
also happens to be an anti-seizure medication in addition to treating panic attacks).

""There's one other thing,"" I plead.

He looks up from his computer over his bifocals without taking his hands away
from the keyboard.

""I can't remember things,"" I confess.

His expression doesn't change.

""I mean, I can never recall where I've put something or if there is some sort
of date I am meant to remember. Someone can tell me something very important
one moment and I'll completely forget the conversation happened the next. It's
like I am walking around in a haze and have no clue where I am going and where
I came from.""

He turns back to me and folds his large brown hands over my file opened on his
desk.

""This is completely normal,"" he assures me. ""Your brain is like a bunch of boxes.
When you make a new memory, it goes into a box and your brain sets it aside for
later,"" he folds a sheet of paper from his notepad and holds it up at eye level.
""Let's say this is some information that needs to be stored into one of these
boxes. A date you're meant to remember, perhaps. Normally, you would have no problem
putting this information into a box to recall later"", he pantomimes putting the folded
sheet into my file laying on his desk.

""Your brain, however, suffers from constant worries, obligations, and just too
much information constantly coming in"", he pulls out a ream of paper from beneath
his desk and scatters the pages about, completely covering my file.

""Now, you can deal with one piece of information at a time, but when you've got
all this other information cluttering your mind,"" he makes a broad sweeping gesture
across his desk, ""you do not process the important piece of information right
away because of the mess of information that is already here. So, your mind simply"",
he gingerly plops the paper into the bin beside his desk, ""throws it out.""

My commute home is a blur. Then again, every day of my life is a blur. I've been
living in a state of perpetual dysphoria since my life started going to hell. I
honestly don't remember being happy -- but I can pinpoint the exact moment everything
changed.

Before the accident, before the divorce and being abandoned a thousand miles
from my family, before moving to Canada from England or to England from Wisconsin,
before graduation, before my wedding -- I recall the day.

It was hot. I was in Tennessee. I had an internship at a very prestigious University
in Nashville. I was studying astrophysics at the time which involves far less
staring into space and far more staring into a computer screen than one would
be inclined to believe.

For the most part, it was a summer of isolation. The stupor ushered in by the
daytime heat made it impossible for me to work during the day and so I became
more-or-less exclusively nocturnal.

I would rise with the setting sun, take ""breakfast"" at the nearest Subway
restaurant (seafood delight on flat-bread, white cheddar, cucumbers, pickles,
spinach and onions with a healthy squirt of sweet-onion sauce), head back to my
dormitory, lock myself in with a stock of energy drinks, open a terminal window
and hack away in FORTRAN at a then twenty-year old n-body program until the first
hint of daylight broke through my curtains. This continued for weeks on end
throughout the summer. I was probing the mysteries of the Universe -- just me and
the blinking green cross-hair of the most powerful tool in all of human history.

There's a stereotype about academics -- this idea that we tend to go mad. Honestly,
it's not an unfair assessment. This is anecdotal, however, I know both many
very intelligent people and many very 'simple' people and it would seem to me that
there is some correlation between intellect and probability of mental illness.

Mental illness can be exacerbated by prolonged periods of isolation and combined
with the mental taxation my brain was under that summer combined with the heat,
it's no wonder I snapped.

It was well past midnight. I was, of course, burning the midnight oil. When you
strike the right balance of uppers and downers code begins to flow from your
fingertips like the bright-red arterial blood from a cow that's been
strung up by its Achilles and opened at the jugular. Strong. Relentless. Draining.

I'd polished off a particularity tricky feat of transposing the output of rusty
old function from straight Cartesian coordinates represented by some archaic
data structure that I cannot properly recall into a logarithmic x,y,z,t graph.
Angry red dots, each a star, jittered and jostled about like a
swarm of beetles contrasted by the stark white void of the time-density plot. My
little Universe, evolving millions of years per real world second on a massive
parallel supercomputing cluster churning out n^n computations per second.

""Hey..."" a voice whispers from the dark. Nearly knocking over a can of redbull,
I leap from my chair in startled reflex. I'm meant to be alone in my dorm.

Silently, I level my eyes on the hallway beyond the door. It's an empty. My room
is empty. The dormitory is empty. I'm alone.

I turn back to face the gentle glow of the command line -- but there's no prompt.
Instead a young woman, no older than I, locks eyes with me. A video has started
playing. She is a student, dressed in black. Her eyes dart about as she lay on the
pavement. There is a group of men huddled over her holding her throat. She makes
to speak but only a gurgle and spattering of crimson escape her lips. The
men cry out in a language I cannot understand -- but what has happened is clear.

The life drains from her face while her eyes roll about. She's bleeding from the
hole in her throat and blood begins to drain from her nose and down her face matting
her black hair. She is so beautiful, even in her dying moments. The video ends.

I'd left my global news tab open, apparently. Her face would be known around the
world soon enough -- the beautiful Iranian student, a tragic casualty in the
democratic process gone awry.

I close out of the window and return my attention to the hallway. My head begins
to feel heavy. The hallway shrinks toward me and I begin to float within my own
body. An almost cosmic dread creeps into my mind as I make to pilot my mound
of meat toward the bathroom. I'm no longer part of my body, but simply tethered
to it. I cannot feel my face. I cannot feel my hands. I cannot feel my legs. But
I can pilot them.

Space and time are lost to me. I drift. My senses blend together and this human
vessel I'm piloting starts to tingle. Soon I am facing a face -- a face facing a
face; the one looking back has a trickle of blood running down its lips.

A nosebleed.

A drop swirls in the sink. How did that get on? The sickly florescent lights
pierce my retinas.

I lean over the toilet and vomit before passing out.

It's 02:32 in the morning.

Bare bones, I'm trying to get into IT. I've built a few computers, helped fix the occasional issue, and I enjoy helping people with computers. But I have no professional IT experience. In addition, I am finishing two bachelor degrees, yet neither one is in a tech/cs/math/ or related field (Criminal Justice &amp; anthropology). I've taken 1 CS course, and have only taken college algebra. I have some experience with Java, HTML5, and Python.

What I am doing right now:

I'm looking at job boards, but as I'm sure you can guess, they all want 1+ year experience.

So I look at internships... which 99% of them want me to be enrolled in an IT/related program, understandable.


What I am doing to help stand out for an entry level position:

My goal is to get in to cyber security. So I am currently studying for the CompTIA security+ Exam, and plan to take it at the end of next month or early October. I am reading Darril Gibson's book, and near the end of Chapter 1 after a day or two... woohoo!

I have this final semester left before I graduate, so changing majors isn't really an option. 

Is aiming for security+ the right move (I will be striving to get it anyways)? What else can I do to help make myself stand out? What jobs should I look for since even Help Desk Tier 1 positions are wanting 1-10 years of experience?

Struggling with algorithms,whichcsjob,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6x772b/what_kind_of_cs_related_job_should_i_look_into/,"I really love developing and programming things. As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to go into a computer related field. However, after entering college and seeing how much focus there is on algorithms and such, I'm starting to get second thoughts on going into a SDE role. Everytime I open HR or CTCI I get filled with dread. I barely managed in my algorithms classed in school. I did well with programming assignments (usually near 100%) and finished them rather quickly, since it's a relaxed situation that I can pace myself with. However, on paper tests the pressure and stress gets to me and destroys my performance, which I imagine what will happen in technical interviews (I'm completely fine in your ""standard"" behavioral interview). Even if I could get by, I'm not sure if I would enjoy the job itself if I have to deal with algorithms. I really enjoy security and reading papers and stuff, but I've heard it's a really hard field to get into, and I feel like if I can't deal with algorithms and such I probably would do even worse in a security field.  I also really enjoy low level programming (my assembly class was actually really fun tbh), but I'd imagine that algorithms/optimizations matter even more in this case, no? I'm working an IT job right now during the summer and it's relatively simple, but it's rather... boring. What other fields can I look into?

Also, I had major issues come up last quarter and nuked my GPA to around a ~2.5. Unfortunately this will be my third year is kind of bad timing due to the importance of landing an internship around this time. Assuming applications that ask for my GPA won't auto trash my resume, does GPA come up in interviews, and how much impact does it have?"

The problem is, I decided in my first year that I wanted to focus on my studies as I didn't really need the money at the time because I worked three years before attending university. The summer after my first year, I had some health issues which prevented me from working the summer. 

My second year I was considering transferring to a better institution and program so I worked hard to raise my GPA at the expense of not working through the fall/winter semester. This summer I chose to do spring semester to lighten my load for the fall semester but it made it very difficult to find a summer job as most places had already hired people for the summer. 

Therefore, I am stuck with a ~1year resume gap which I am sure does not look very good applying for internships this year. I am trying to find a volunteer opportunity to do during the school year but so far have not had much luck finding something relevant.

Am I going to have a very rough time finding an internship because I have a gap of not working retail while in university even though I worked before attending and have a 3.6 GPA?"

6x7gk5,25,2017-08-31,I think my work computer has a virus,jillnochill,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6x7gk5/i_think_my_work_computer_has_a_virus/,"I think my computer has a virus that did something really bad. 

I’ll start with a little background about the company I work for. It is a manufacturing company that makes paper and I am an intern in the quality department. Outside the office I work in are huge machines that are very dangerous. Today when I came into work we were at 12 days since the last recorded injury; the guy had broken his foot on one of the machines. 

I never deal with any of the machines I simply take the test data about the paper and put it into an excel document to send to our customers. I sit in a room with my boss and another intern all day and try to avoid going out near the plant floor. (I am a girl and all the older men who work on the machines tend to stare at me weirdly. A few have even asked if I had a boyfriend.) 

So today started just like any other and I was filling out the weekly report for my boss to send to his higher ups. I was the only one in the office area, both my boss and the other intern were out for the moment. The setup of the room is weird. It is in the center of the building and you have to walk through the plant to get to it. On the other side are the rest of the offices with the sales reps and managers. The room itself is pretty big, my boss having one half and the other intern and I sharing the other half. There is only one door in this room and as the other intern pointed out, the only exit in an emergency. And as I said this door leads into the plant which is far from an exit. I try not to think about it too much though as I work.

As I finished the report I went to save it to my computer. That’s when I heard a loud “ding” from the computer. The noise was so loud that I yelped and jumped in my seat. It also echoed off of the walls in the room. It sounded like one of those error noises the computer makes if you click on something that won’t work, only much louder. Now that I think about it, I also always have the sound on my computer off, but maybe those noises sound even if you have the volume down.

After my heart calmed down I laughed to myself, since I was alone in the room, and went to click save again. That’s when I realized that my computer was frozen. Great. I thought. I didn’t even get to save the thing I was working on. I tried exiting out of the excel document but my screen stayed frozen. I noticed down at the bottom, in the taskbar, there was a new icon. It was simply a red dot. I thought that was weird but didn’t think much of it as things were always being put onto my computer without my knowledge. 

I tried clicking around on the screen to try and get anything to work and I soon realized that there was nothing I could do. I went to text my dad, because he worked in the IT department of the company (and yes that was how I got this job) but I knew what he would say, “Did you restart the computer?” So I knew what I had to do before he would come and help me.

Since the screen was frozen the only thing I could think to do was to press the power button. The screen went black immediately. I waited a couple of seconds before pressing the power button again, happy to see it begin its start up. Just as quickly as the blue start up screen came up, the screen blacked out again. I rolled my eyes and brought out my phone to text my dad but before I could even unlock my phone words appeared on the screen.

Hi Jill.

I thought that was weird but not too weird as everything in this computer is under my name. At this point I assumed I had gotten a virus somewhere and they could probably pull my name from the stuff on my computer. Where I could have gotten the virus I had no idea. I only use my computer for work related stuff and occasionally sudoku. It didn’t really matter where I got it, I guess, only that I now knew I had to text my dad. 

You don’t need to text him, Jill.

The words popped up on the screen and a chill went down my spine. I wondered if someone was playing a prank on me but there was no one in the company who knew how to use a computer in this way. So a virus still being the only possible explanation I started to panic, knowing that I would probably be in trouble for messing up the computer. I tried to press the power button again hoping that that would solve my problems but the words stayed on the screen. 

Wanna see something fun?

I actually said “no” out loud in the empty room and by now I was hoping my boss or intern would come back in so I could show them what was happening. I really didn’t want to know what this “something fun” was going to be. I thought that it was probably going to be a horrible image like you see in those pop-up scare videos so I braced myself for the picture. 

Listen.

The second the words showed up I heard a loud clanging noise coming from outside of my office door, followed by a scream. My heart dropped into my stomach but I stayed at my desk not wanting to go to the door. Outside I heard yells and people running and I could just barely make out someone yelling “Stop the machine.” The door to my office opened then and the other intern rushed into the room, his face completely pale. 

“What happened?” I hurriedly asked. 

“I think he’s dead.” He whispered, sitting down in his chair and putting his hands into his face. I didn’t know what to do and when I turned back to my screen the words were gone and all I could see was the log in page. 

Over the intercom our plant manager’s voice told everyone to stay in their offices for the hour because there had been an emergency. Once the hour was up we were all told that the offices were going to be shut for the day and production was to be paused. I don’t think they had ever paused all of the production, not even for Christmas. 

I left without even telling my dad about the virus. I don’t know what I am going to do when I go back to work tomorrow. I don’t want to think that my computer had something to do with the accident but I just hope the virus is gone when I get in.

So starting this September, I'll be starting a 1 year conversion course for computer science (my initial degree was in biochemistry if that adds anything to the conversation) at the university of Newcastle.

http://www.ncl.ac.uk/postgraduate/courses/degrees/computer-science-msc/#profile 

I happened to come across a recruiter who informed me that unless I obtained a 1st class and additional experience, I would struggle to compete against the people who took this as an undergraduate degree as they will have far more in depth knowledge and experience than me (as would be expected).

My question is how do I make myself not only more employable but also if there are any additional subjects I should look to cover to become more skilled as a developer during my stay.

I'll apply for an internship after the degree to gain work experience but would still like to do more and make the most of my time whilst I'm there.

Thanks in advance for all the advice."
6x87xq,1,2017-08-31,"[Seeking advice] Trying to increase my desirability, knowledge, and just pay in general.",Mildly_Uninteresting,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/6x87xq/seeking_advice_trying_to_increase_my_desirability/,"I am trying to increase my desirability to recruiters to hopefully maximize my earning potential and/or to give me more options if I decide to make a big move here in a few years. 

&amp;nbsp;

For background as well, I make approximately $50K a year in a fairly low cost of living area. For comparison, I pay $945 a month for a 1050 square feet, 3BR/2BA apartment. I feel like I am paid well for what I do, considering my prior qualifications, but like anyone, I would love to make more...

&amp;nbsp;

**Previous Work Experience:**

* I have ~4 years working standard retail in the form of customer service and computer sales. 

* I have ~2 years working as an Advanced Repair Agent at Best Buy's Geek Squad.

* I have ~2 years working from home as remote Geek Squad support as a Covert Agent.

* Three month internship at a major local hospital's IT department directly under the director.

**Current Work Experience**

I have worked in my current position at my company for approximately six months. My title is currently System Administrator for a ~300 employee company. I am in the only in-house IT and we use a MSP for most tier 1/2 support. My job has mostly consisted of implementing new projects, handled escalated tickets, and managing a few other systems. I also manage a few of our in-house Windows Servers, our public-facing web server on AWS, and the networking for our approximate 50 locations. Granted, most of the non-corporate locations require nothing more than a basic SOHO router to suffice. I also have made monthly or so trips to the remote offices to run cable drops and setup new offices.

&amp;nbsp; 

Everything considered, my job is probably:

* 30% handling escalated tickets.

* 30% working on projects, such as implementing new systems, such as single-sign-on.

* 20% deploying new hardware, either outside of our primary location or in it.

* 20% miscellaneous.

&amp;nbsp;

**Education:**

This is really where I feel I am lacking big time. Other than graduating high school, I only have a career studies certificate for Cisco Networking from our local community college. Though, I am fairly close to finishing two other associates degrees; one in Electrical Engineering Technology and one in Information Systems Technology (Networking/Security).

&amp;nbsp; 

I would love to also complete a 4-year degree as well, but considering my current area, it is a bit out of the question unless I want to drive an hour or more away for classes. I am not sure if my employer would accommodate that either, if I decided to go that route. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Certifications:**

I currently have the Network+ and Security+ certifications. I have been studying to take the CSA+ here in a couple of weeks as well, too.

**Personal Background:**

Correct me if I am wrong, but from an employer's perspective, I guess this isn't too terribly beneficial? Anyways, since just after the release of VMware ESXi 5 I have had either a cloud-based server, self-hosted server, or a mixture of both. I spend a good bit of my free time, probably like most, tinkering with different technologies, which has given me experience most of my experience with VMware ESXi, Windows Server 2012/2016, FreePBX, and Kali's respective toolset.

&amp;nbsp; 

**Questions**

Sorry if the previous bit seemed long-winded. I felt it was necessary to divulge as much information as possible to get the insight of the others here.

* As far as my current pay goes, is it on point with what I should be making? If not, is it more, or less than a similar candidate would have, in your experience?

* Are there any reputable 4-year schools I can do online without having to take classes in person? Unfortunately, the nearest school with a relevant program to me is an hour and a half way. I don't think my boss would accommodate that.

* If I can't find a 4-year school to go to, would it be beneficial to get a third associate's degree? Specifically, in something along the lines of business administration?

* What certifications should I aim on going for? My list of ones I want to do are MCSA Windows 10, MCSA Windows Server 2016, CompTIA CSA+, CompTIA CASP, CompTIA Linux+, CEH, and maybe a VMware certification. I would like to either stay in system administration or move to a security job.

* In general, do you have any other recommendations, knowing what my current career, path, and previous experience is?

6x8aqv,128,2017-08-31,Fresh Grad Still Unemployed After Nearly 4 Months,Dimwittian,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6x8aqv/fresh_grad_still_unemployed_after_nearly_4_months/,"Hey all,



So I graduated with a degree in Computer Science (3.7 GPA) back in May, and ever since I've been job-hunting. I don't have any internships, but I do have a large and complex Senior Capstone project, along with a personal project that took ~ a month to build.



I've interviewed with five companies so far. Three of them were clear in outright rejecting me. One of them was interested in hiring me (contract-to-hire), but didn't have the money to take on employees. The last I'm currently waiting to hear back from after a final interview, but it's been over a week and when I get in touch, they repeatedly say something along the lines of ""we'll know something soon.""



My problem is this: **If this ""we'll know something soon"" opportunity doesn't pan out, I have no idea where to look for opportunities anymore.**


Why do I say this? 


1. Well, recently I searched up every single technology company in my area. And I applied to every single one of them. I got one call back, out of fifty. So it seems that blindly applying isn't a good strategy.


2. I went to websites like CareerBuilder and searched for Jr. Developer positions. First, Jr Dev positions seem to be fairly rare on job hunter websites. Second, for the ones that did exist, most of them had something like 50+ applicants, some of whom had Master's degrees. I wouldn't stand a chance with that kind of competition.


3. My ""safety net"" has been working with recruiters, who look for job opportunities for me and set up a Contract-to-Hire deal. Today I did some research on recruiters and C2H deals however, and my research leads me to believe C2H is usually just a horrible deal where you get screwed over, big time. So that's apparently not a good route either.



With that said, I don't know where to turn. I need advice, badly.

Edit: Got a call this morning from a company I've been waiting to hear from. Direct hire, in Richmond, and great culture. They said they want to extend me an offer letter that should get to me by Tuesday. No longer unemployed. I'll respond to the rest of the comments when I have some time. "
6x8t4q,643,2017-08-31,"Career Fairs 101, from a recent grad",MisterMH,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/6x8t4q/career_fairs_101_from_a_recent_grad/,"Hi all,
As a recent grad, I've been through my fair share of career fairs and have a lot of experience/advice that I would love to share with other students. I wrote this article in the hopes that it would reach someone who, like me, struggled in their search for their first or next internship.

**Introduction**

Invoking the words 'career fair' or 'internship fair' to an engineering student can evoke a number of emotions: dread, fear, resignation. I haven't met a single colleague or classmate who has actively looked forward to a campus career fair, and for fair reason. At UCLA, fall career fairs have often consisted of thousands of students, dressed in business formal, packing into a hot ballroom and waiting sometimes up to an hour for a 30-second pitch.

At the same time, most engineering students are familiar with the black hole of applying online: you upload your resume and then never hear back. A quick Google search shows that up to 85% of jobs are filled through networking. Career fairs are the most efficient way to convert applications to interviews: all the benefits of networking sans small talk.

As an undergraduate with an unremarkable resume, I found few successes with online applications. The only interviews I ever received were through the career fairs and info-sessions; I believe having the right credentials is 20% of the battle, with the other 80% of the battle selling yourself and your skill-set. Following this rubric didn’t mean I had offers falling in my lap, but it at least got me past the recruiter and landed me phone interviews with Northrop Grumman, Ball Aerospace, Lockheed Martin, L-3, and SSL. And it can for you, too!

Note that this is not the definitive way to navigate career fairs or develop a pitch: this is just my experience. Nevertheless, I hope you find something useful in the following article.

**The Salesperson’s Mindset** 

I want to take a second to talk about the mindset of the pitch. All of the companies in attendance are looking to make an investment. You are both the salesperson and the product, but at career fairs, you have companies receiving hundreds of proposals and all the products are (at least at the undergraduate level) more or less the same. At this scale, the key differentiating quality is your communication skills. Summed up in a few words: _keep it relevant, and keep it concise._

Relevance is extremely important: every single sentence should relate back to the company’s immediate needs. It’s okay not to have a perfectly-aligned resume for an internship; most student projects/research groups involve soft skills like cross-disciplinary work, client management, multi-tasking, etc. All of these are marketable and relevant – you just have to sell it!

Along the same lines, concision is absolutely critical. Your pitch is an highlight reel, not a comprehensive presentation. It’s not essential to stick to 30 seconds – feel free to go a little over, but the longer you talk, the longer you run the risk of losing the recruiter. If the recruiter starts looking bored or trying to interrupt, that’s your signal to cut it short.

**Preparation**

Too many students come in a superficial view of the company’s goals, products and business areas. This is my tried-and-true method of doing my research prior to the fair:

1. Narrow the list of companies down to 5-8 based on your preferred interest and the company’s hiring availability. I would recommend doing this a couple days before the fair, because often companies will post their internship listings just prior to the fair. (One career fair, I did my research the morning of the fair, and noticed that L-3 had posted an internship requisition that very morning, which I noted. Later that afternoon, when I spoke with the L-3 rep, I mentioned I was interested in that position. Would you believe that she was the one who had posted it the day before? That turned out to be my first interview!)

2. From those 5-8 companies, jot down on a notepad the following for each company: biggest company events in the last 6 months, core product lines (typically 3-4 most relevant to you and 1-2 products per platform) and jobs you are interested in. This information is critical as it will be what you to refer to in your post-pitch chat.

3. Apply for at least one of those jobs per company! This is critical – recruiters love to hear that you’ve already applied. It shows initiative, and seeing as many companies hold interviews take place just a few days after, it leaves a good impression.

**Making the most of those 2 minutes with the recruiter**

So, you’ve made it to your career fair, and you’re waiting in a long line to get your chance to talk to Google or Lockheed Martin. Now I’ll walk you through an example of a pitch I’ve given and why (I think) it’s worked. This was for a Systems Engineering position that Boeing posted a while back that wanted candidates with MATLAB competency, as well as some experience working in integration and testing of aerospace systems.

&gt;Hi, my name is John Doe, I’m a fourth-year aerospace engineering student, and I would love to talk to you about your Systems Engineering position.

Don’t forget your fundamentals: open with a strong handshake, a smile, good posture, and a quick 5-second introduction about who you are and what you’re interested in.

&gt;In terms of my relevant background, at my internship at [Aerospace Company], my role spanned test, evaluation and integration of MEMS devices. I was responsible for setting up and executing high-temperature tests on gyroscopes, as well as examining the test data and writing brief reports for our client.

&gt;I also worked as the trajectory engineer on my rocketry capstone project where I focused on developing a trajectory analysis algorithm. The algorithm was used to generate velocity and altitude plots of our rocket based on unique flight conditions: initial angle-of-attack, drag coefficients, payload and launch mass, etc.

This is the meat of your pitch. This is where you discuss how their current needs align with your skillset. Even if your entire resume is a good fit, stick with 2, 3 items tops and focus on your highlights and responsibilities. Don’t worry if you can’t cover every little detail - if they’re interested in other items or would like follow-up on a specific resume item, the recruiter will ask you.

In my experience, recruiters place importance on internships, then hands-on projects, then research, and finally leadership experience. As an underclassman, you might be relying more on hands-on projects and leadership experience, which is fine – just sell it!

&gt;I think the combination of my internship experience and the work on my spacecraft design project make me a strong candidate for your position.

This closing line slightly alludes to what I mentioned earlier about aligning yourself to their needs.

Be cognizant of who you are talking to. If you are talking to a chief engineer, or a project manager, feel free to dive into a little more technical detail during your pitch but keep it brief. But if you’re talking to an HR rep, keep the technical details at a high-level because you don’t want to lose them with technical details. Along the same lines, don’t be afraid to add a little personality! These recruiters listen to hundreds of pitches a day so play your personality up. If you are a jokester, make a couple jokes. If you’re passionate about a certain project, let that passion show.

You might be wondering why you needed to do all that research prior to the fair if your pitch covers only your background and a job position. You need the company information for the follow-up questions, where the recruiter will likely dig past the rehearsed pitch. It's very common to be asked ""What do you know about our company?"" as one of the first follow-up questions to the pitch, and this is where most students falter, as they have scant understanding of what the company does. This is really where you can shine as a candidate and move yourself into interview consideration, if you can align the company’s direction and competencies with your resume.

**Post-Career Fair**

Congratulations! You made it through the most difficult part of the career fair process, and your work is almost done.

+ If a recruiter tells you to apply online, that does not mean your effort is wasted! Quite the contrary – many companies, especially in the aerospace industry, require candidates to submit an application online before they can be considered for any position. To be clear: _You cannot be considered for an internship without having submitted an online application!_ For example, I have been told after a pitch to the LinQuest Corporation to apply online, and not 24 hours after my online application did I get an email from the company requesting a phone interview. Make that online application your #1 priority!

+ If you managed to procure any business cards, follow up with the recruiter especially if you feel good about your pitch. As with any professional correspondence, keep the email brief and to the point!

**Conclusion**

Career fairs are not easy. You will sound awkward, you will slip, you might mispronounce the company name, or even accidentally refer to them by another company name (likely why I got nowhere with AeroVironment). What you have just read ahead may not be your style; maybe you prefer applying online. However, in my opinion, career fairs are the most efficient use of your time and a much-faster way to get your resume to the decision-makers. I hope that you found this article helpful, and if you have any questions feel free to reach out! I wish you all the best of luck on your professional ventures!"

It is a Part-Time Software Engineer Internship where I am currently the only intern. I work 15 hours a week while going to school. The job is mostly web development at the moment with the incentive to move to firmware or mobile development.

1. The codebase does not have any comments and very little documentation. 
How do I go about learning what is going on in the code and fix bugs they have assigned me?

2. What do I do when I am not at work or school to improve my ability to do my job?

3. How do I ask questions without looking like a complete idiot.

4. What is the general expectation of an intern?

Thank you for any advice you are willing to give."

I would really appreciate your input. Right now I am planning on doing EECS 280, EECS 370, STATS 250, and 2-3 credits of UROP this fall. I am also registered for EECS 376 in case I decide to swap 370 for 376. I want to take EECS 370 over 376, but I don't want to end up with more work than I can manage. 

I want to do 370 because it opens up more upper-level EECS electives for the next semester, the subject matter is more interesting for me, and I am thinking that it would look better for applying for internships than 376. I have experience with embedded systems, and that's what I mainly worked on this past summer at my internship, so I think that 1. 370 shouldn't be that hard, and 2. if I want another embedded-related internship, 370 would look much better. My 370 schedule also allows me to have no class on both Wednesday and Friday, giving me more time to conduct my UROP work and catch up on projects for 281 and 370. I also found 280 to be a pretty easy A, as I have lots of programming experience, so maybe 281 won't be as awful as it sounds. I am pretty good with managing my time. Despite this, I am still worried that 281 + 370 will be too much, because I've heard so many horror stories about the combo.

As an alternative, my schedule with 376 instead of 370 would be less project-intensive, so maybe less stress, and still leaves me with no class on Friday. However, I found 203 to be fairly difficult, and because of this I am thinking that 376 may end up being just as much work as 370. Also, with 376 not being a prerequisite to anything, I am not as incentivized to take it.

Thanks so much for your time reading this post, and I appreciate any advice you may have to offer!"

I only have a few projects, so I feel like I'm struggling to fill an entire page. 
I was considering putting down that I worked with my friend's dad (Lighting company) since I occasionally helped with some IT/network stuff. but I might take that off. Let me know what you guys think!

6xa3sr,1,2017-08-31,"Currently in school, Have two offers, one for full time web developer and one for intern software developer. But I want to work in software dev as a career. Need help choosing which would be best for my future.",HTML_Novice,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6xa3sr/currently_in_school_have_two_offers_one_for_full/,"The full-time web developer position is a contractor WordPress developer that pays 25/hr. 

The intern is a software developer position that pays 20/hr.

The issue comes in when I think of my future, I want to work with software development for my future, but the web development position pays more, and is more consistent. Being that I am paying for school on my own, those factors are huge. 

On the other hand, the software dev intern position is at a pretty big company, is more applicable toward my future career choice, but pays less and also has less hours. 

Two years in the future when I graduate, I'm applying for a software dev position and they see web developer on my resume, will they disregard that experience as insignificant? I'm trying to weigh the relevant experience, vs the full-time on the job experience as which is more valuable.

The career fairs cater non CS majors like writing, criminal justice and nursing (since they are the most popular majors at my university). 

So in short I'm wondering how would I land an internship I've had a LinkedIn and indeed account (which I check for opportunities everyday). And signed up for two hackathons this November hoping I can impress the companies that will be appearing there. If there's anything I miss or am I doing something wrong let me know. "
