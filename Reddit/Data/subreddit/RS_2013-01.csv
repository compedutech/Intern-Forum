15sfyq,10,2013-01-01,"16 and considering dropping out of highschool for the sake of learning, am I being stupid?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/15sfyq/16_and_considering_dropping_out_of_highschool_for/,"So, let me elaborate a little.

I discovered programming when I was 14 and learned C/C++ during a couple of my classes with the help of a few books. Ever since, I have never been so sure of what I want to do for a living. Learning how to program almost inspired me to begin to learn about the full story, about how computers operate. I always knew that I wanted to do something tech related (I guess that's what spending tons of time on the computer does to you), but now I was sure.

Unfortunately, I still feel as though I cannot do anything close to what I hoped for.

Let me say that I pretty much have a hatred for school, not because of what it aims to do, but how it does it. I could go on a rant, but i'll just try to get to the point. I cannot learn anywhere close to the amount of stuff I want to learn about computers mostly due to highschool, and i'm afraid the same will apply to college. So now I have these thoughts floating around in my head, ""why should I bother with highschool when I can teach just myself?"" I really wish it were that simple. 

With that said, I have a couple of questions:
Is it realistic to expect being able to land a job in the CS field as a highschool dropout, assuming that the person has the required knowledge for the job?
If so, what are the kinds of things you would need on your resume to have an employer consider you in the first place?
Would it be possible to find an internship as a hs dropout?
Am I being stupid?

Any additional advice/words of insight would be greatly appreciated. Really. After all, I am only 16. I don't know anything. All I know is what I am interested in.

Thanks."

December 30, 2012


I just woke up and thought I should write this down before I forget. I haven’t been sleeping that much lately, which is why I am just now waking up. The paranoia and fear is just getting worse as the case goes on. I had this really weird dream. I was in a field. Just a field like you would normally think of when you think about fields. Trees everywhere with shrubs at their bases. There were some deer off in the distance and I could hear birds chirping. The sun was shining. As I stood there thinking about how this would be a good place to come and think. I started thinking about my childhood. I used to come to a field just like this and play with my dogs. They loved to play fetch in the grass. When it was really tall they loved to sneak up on me or leap over the grass like gazelles. 


I thought it was a dream about that. But as soon as the sun vanished and the clouds covered the air, I knew this was no dream – but a nightmare – and not one that was about my dog filled childhood. 


When the clouds covered the sky, the plants all died. The trees lost their leaves, the grass turned brown, the flowers wilted where they stood. The deer dropped dead and the birds fell from the sky. There was a smell in the air that I can’t even begin to describe; it was so disgusting. Beyond disgusting. Like rotten flesh and rotten eggs and rotten milk all combined together. I watched as all the deer dropped to the ground and I ran to them thinking there could be a way for me to help. But when I got there, there was nothing I could do. Their flesh was already rotting and parasites had already come to eat the meat off their bones. 


Suddenly, I heard a loud, low groaning sound. It was coming from all around me. It sounded like it was coming from the trees. I couldn’t escape it by running. It just got louder and louder the longer I was in that field. I saw some concrete stairs going into the ground. I watched myself run. It kept switching from first person view to third person. It was really disorienting. I kept going towards the stairs and then hurried down them. At the bottom of the stairs there was a beat up wooden door. Something told me I shouldn’t open the door, no matter how badly I wanted to escape that groaning sound. That I should force myself to wake up and just keep going on with my life, without opening that door. But of course, like in all nightmares and typical Hollywood teen screams, your gut is ignored.

 
I opened the door. It creaked and it felt like it was going to fall off its hinges. There were scratches all over the back side of the door. Like someone had been trying to escape. It was cold as I entered the hallway the door lead to. Ice cold. I shivered. I didn’t know if I was shivering from fear or from the cold. Either one was entirely plausible. I closed the door behind me and the groaning stopped instantly.


 It was pitch black dark, but I walked down the hall anyways. I tried to move quickly, but my feet felt like they were made of lead. It felt like each step took five minutes. It was driving me crazy. I put my hands on the walls to guide me. I felt inscriptions on the wall, but I couldn’t tell what they said. I patted my pockets to see if my cell phone was there. It was, so I pulled it out of my pocket and when I went to open it to shine light on the wall, it shocked me and I dropped it. I winced and shook my hand to get the pain to stop. I went to pick it up off the ground, but it turned to dust as my hand touched it. The dust was unusually warm and more ashy than grainy. I stumbled forward, keeping my hands on the walls to guide me. I felt more inscriptions, but I wouldn’t find out till later what they were. I felt a corner and slid my hands onto the cold wall in front of me. As I felt it, trying to find an escape, I felt a handle. I put my hand on it, tried to push or pull the door open. It wouldn’t budge. So I tried sliding it open. And that worked. It slid open with a loud bang. 


I walked into the room and slid the door closed behind me. The lighting was like a doctor’s office. The kind of light that washes out your skin and makes it look blue. I always hated that light. The room looked like the morgue in the hospitals. In the middle of the room there was a metal table, shiny and eerily clean. Like it had never been used. Along the walls there were drawers you put dead bodies in. The room smelled strongly of sulfur.  Next to the table there was a little cart with various surgery tools on it. I walked towards it carefully. Every step I took was deafening. I got to the table and picked up the first tool I saw, a Stryker saw. My dad was a coroner so he would always talk about that stuff over dinner, which I really didn’t appreciate. The only time I put up with it was when I was doing an internship for him when I was trying to decide what part of the police world I wanted to join. 


I started thinking about how I had to watch him use various saws to cut ribs open to get to the heart. I remembered the blood everywhere and dropped the saw on the ground, forgetting I was holding it. It hit the leg of the cart and all the tools fell onto the ground. The metal clanked against the tiles on the ground. The sound was just as deafening as my footsteps had been. When the sound stopped, I started to look around the rest of the room. It was back in third person. I watched myself wander around the room. My other self looked into the file drawers that weren’t full of bodies. He pulled out some papers and looked at them. All the files were in a different language, but neither me nor the other me could tell which language it was. I watched myself find a single paper in English, talking about the Lake Bodom murders. I remember Googling the case a couple years ago out of curiosity because one of my favorite bands was named after them. No one ever found out who committed them. Maybe Stitch was behind those attacks too... Then suddenly I was back in first person. As soon as I oriented myself, I started hearing banging and moaning. I looked around the room and saw the body drawers shaking. I heard people pleading to be let out, moaning and groaning, begging. I started panicking and ran to the corner. I sat on the ground and covered my ears and closed my eyes, hoping against all hope that the sound would stop. And it did. It wasn’t a good quiet though. It was a scary quiet. Eerie. The quiet went on for what felt like forever until the loud groaning sound from the field started again. I walked to the sliding door trying to find a way to escape it again. I opened the door but couldn’t see anything. My eyes were still adjusting to the darkness in the hall. Once they did, I saw Stitch standing at the end of the hallway. You could only see one of his arms. He took a step forward and then I could see him holding his chains behind his back. 


“Are you trying to hide?” Stitch said. 


“Where am I?” I asked. 


“We are inside your memories,” he replied. 


“Why?”


“I want to ruin your best memories. I feed off fear and anger. I killed the animals and turned the sky gray. Now look behind you and feel more fear,” Stitch said. All of a sudden there was the stench of rotten flesh and blood in the air. I turned around slowly. As I turned around I slipped and hit my head on one of the counters. I put my hand on my head to ease the pain and closed my eyes. When I opened them, I looked at my hands and they were covered in blood. I looked around the rest of the room and the floor was flooded with blood. Papers covered the floor. I looked at the body drawers and saw all of them were open. The dead bodies inside them were sitting up on their metal beds, smiling, with dead eyes and pale skin. One had a gunshot wound on his head with crusted blood around the edges. Another had his throat slit. Another was severely burned; his skin was blackened. Their smiles were still and frozen. Like mannequins. I turned back to look at Stitch again. His arm was still bent back. 


“Meet my latest victim. Courtesy of you.” He grabbed his chains with both of his hands. He jerked someone roughly. As the mystery person went flying through the air, Stitch jerks him back by the neck even more roughly than before. It yelped and cried in pain. He landed right in front of Stitch. There was a chain around his neck. It could’ve come off, but there were spikes driven into his neck, keeping them in place. The holes in his neck kept oozing blood. His legs were broken off at the knee. His femur was sticking out. The skin and muscle were all torn, still bleeding. From his bottom lip to half way down his neck, the skin was gone. The muscle was disturbingly red, bloody… it made me want to puke. It seemed like every pore in his body was blood oozing out of it. He was so beat up. Some of his teeth were missing. His hair was torn out in chunks. His arms and chest had gruesome scratches all over them. His eye lids were missing. His eyes were dried and shriveled. There were chunks of his face missing, along with the rest of his body. 


“You know who I am,” Stitch’s victim said. 


“No I don’t,” I said quietly, scared. 


“Yes you do. You watched me get taken away.”


“RepetitiveRoutine,” he said. Then it hit me. I recognized his short dark brown hair with its slight curl. I felt a fit of tears coming and held them back. Suddenly, RepetitiveRoutine came loose and started bounding towards me. He ran on his fists, like an ape. While he ran, he screamed blood curdling screams. Terrified, I stumbled back and ran as fast as I could to the corner of the morgue-like room. I slammed the door and as soon as the sound rang through my ears I woke up. Or at least I thought I did. 


“You need to wake up, Ryan. It’s time to have breakfast,” a voice said. I found myself in my childhood bedroom, cuddled up in my Scooby Doo sheets. I rolled over and saw my mom watching me. Before I could answer her, Stitch came up behind her. He loomed over her. He was wearing a blue button up shirt with slacks. He put his hand on her shoulder. She put hers over his. 
“Hey, honey. I’m just trying to wake up Ryan,” she said. 


“Wake up, son,” Stitch said. Stitch was playing the part of my dad. But my mom couldn’t even tell that my dad wasn’t there. She couldn’t tell what was coming for her. Naked again, Stitch tore her skin off in one piece and danced with it, laughing. I was left frozen in terror. And even with her skin missing, my mom stood there smiling. After a little bit of dancing, he tore her skin in half. The back of her landed on the floor and he held up the front in front of him. He put his eyes where hers should be, wore her like a mask. 


“Good morning, baby,” he said, mocking my mother’s voice. He stuck his tongue through her lips and wiggled it around at me like a child, and started laughing again, even louder. All the while, my mother was standing there, all meat, just looking at me. Stitch dropped the rest of her skin on the ground and grabbed her veins from her ankles and wrists. He wrapped them together and swung her around, her feet touching her hands. As he swung her around, her blood splattered all over the room. It flew onto my face and I nearly threw up. I tried to get up off my bed and run away, but before I could reach the door, Stitch pushed me against the window. A piece of broken glass cut my back, leaving a huge scratch. I woke up for real then, drenched in sweat. 


I went to the bathroom before I started writing this. There’s a scratch on my back… I’m going to go to the hospital now and get this checked out. 
I just thought of this… My dad’s still alive. Why was Stitch pretending to be him in my dream if he’s still here? Maybe I should go stay with him for a while… 


I know you guys have been wondering about Anna too. I still haven't heard from her. It's been a while now, a week and a half... I'm starting to get worried. She won't answer her phone, her emails. There isn't even anyone there when I go knock on her door. This is getting distressing. What should I do?

Should I put references of employers that I worked for last summer, even if I plan to apply for an internship with them again?",[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/15ulad/applying_for_summer_internships_and_was_asked_to/,"Hi, I'm currently applying for summer internships.  A little background first:

The past summer internship that I had at Company X, I'm pretty sure I did a great job, and my hiring manager has told me that if I wanted to come back, I should send him an email, and he would help see if there are opportunities to come back.  Basically, I have an inside track in obtaining another internship there again.

While that is wonderful, I'm still looking for other opportunities because my internship at Company X didn't quite align with what I wanted to do for the future (however, it is still a wonderful Company to work for, and would look good on my resume).  That being said, I'm applying for another internship at Company Y, and it asked me to list references.  I'll be able to provided references from Company X (unfortunately, they would be my only good ones, and I wouldn't really have any other references to choose from), but I'm worried because if I get rejected from Company Y, would that hurt my chances with Company X?  I get the sense that it would be awkward if I ask the references to help me get another internship at Company Y, even if I plan on applying at Company X again.

Hopefully this is clear, and thanks for any help!

At this moment I'm halfway through my junior year of a BS degree in Computer Information Systems, a little behind on courses because I was originally a Communication major (relevant!). I'll graduate on time, all requirements completed, but with very little interest in systems administration, networking, computer security or programming.

I worked for about a year and a half in NOC/HD within IT and I'm doing an internship in automated software testing at the moment. I've made attempts to teach myself programming concepts that haven't been touched on in classes but I just don't enjoy programming and don't see it as a possible career outlook for me right now.

Concern:

As of right now I'm looking into opportunities in the field that differ from what I've tried and researched already, and how I could best prepare myself for employment in that sector. I really, really enjoy writing and would definitely be interested in an opportunity to write full-time in a technical environment. I'm also familiar with the roles of BA/PM and I was just looking to see if anyone might have some additional insight.

As a side note, I wouldn't be opposed to scripting or light programming as a result of the position -- I just don't want to be doing so for the majority of my day.

I've been sending out my resume to a bunch of different companies looking for internships before I get my degree. I've been doing this since Junior year and I'm finding it really difficult to land a position anywhere. My resume isn't that strong (I have no real on the books work experience, mostly off the books working in a company with my neighbor). I use that job as a reference but that's about it. 

 The only other real thing I have is a summer course that I TA'd for with my professor whom asked me personally. It was a CS 101 course in Scheme/Dr Racket. These are the two big things I can really think of putting on a resume. I have good experience in Java as that's the main language my university teaches, although I have experience in a lot more. (I'd say my university has the view of getting a lot of possible languages in working knowledge as opposed to strong studies in one language.)

Can Reddit help a guy get his money back?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/15spy8/my_housemate_wont_return_my_375_security_deposit/,"So here's some background information.

I'm a 20 year old film student from Australia and as a part of my course i decided to complete an internship in Los Angeles, CA. I saved up lots of money and finally flew out for three months in early October. 

Accommodation wise, i chose to find a place that was fully furnished (something with a bed provided since i couldnt exactly bring my own from australia). So i browsed Airbnb.com for months before and finally found a shared house with its own private bed near my place of internship. It was a short bus ride away and it was $900 a month, the cheapest place i could find! So i met up with the guy and he was a nice guy, a bit paranoid, but he agreed and we went ahead with the airbnb transaction. The night i got there, he told me he needed the security deposit..and he was eager to get it or else i couldn't get the keys. So we took a trip to the bank, and i withdrew the $375 needed for the 3 month lease. I gave it to him, and he put it in an envelope. 

Now comes the main part... 

This guy, his name is Akil Thompson, wasn't the best housemate. He was constantly knocking on my door asking for things, he would also go through my room to get to his extra storage. He was very flambouyant and would sing loudly every night, even at 11pm. And his wifi would cut out constantly...It was very hard living with him especially since he never stipulated in his airbnb post that he would be doing these things. Infact, he said he's a quiet respectable person. Whatever, i just pushed through these annoying living conditions and minded my own business. 

So just before Christmas i told him that my 3 months is coming to an end and that i'd be returning to Australia in the first week of January. I told him that i'm going to clean my room and put everything back to how it was. Throughout my stay, i never broke, damaged or stole anything! I was completely respectful and he knew i was! He constantly said i was a nice, easy going housemate. So the day came and i showed him my room and told him everything is back to how he first had it. 
I even cleaned the floor and washed all his towels and bed sheets!

Then... he told me he didnt have my security deposit. The odd part is that the first night i gave him the money in cash, right? Well apparently the room i was staying in actually belongs to a girl who is currently in japan.. so he sent all the money to her, because technically i was staying in her room. 

Now i didn't care where the money was, but i needed that money before i left. He agreed to it..and so did I. 

So the day i leave i tell him, Hey Akil.. i'm off to new york before i leave for Australia and I NEED that money now. 

He kept saying he didnt have the money and that the japanese girl wont get back to him. 

I told him..that's not my problem. I gave you my money.. and since there is no damage, I need my money back..or else that's considered stealing.

So he said he'd give it the day i get to new york..and i've been here for 4 days and he is ignoring all my calls and emails. 

I have a feeling he wont give me the money and it'll be too late. 


Can reddit help me try get my money back? 
Any ideas?

I can post his details.. if that'll help?"

Don't get me wrong, I am very knowledgeable about my subject area, I get decent grades, I work hard, I try to network actively outside of school, and I even have previous internship experience. 

However, when I apply for positions in my field I do not even get a call back for an interview. Even in situations where I have networked and have some connection to the hiring manager; there is always someone ""with more experience"" or someone they know even better that they pick for the job. 

I want and am willing to start at the bottom to get my foot in the door, but the door is locked. I pursued an undergraduate education to get the key but it turns out in these economic times I need to pursue an MBA AND obtain some sort of finance designation to even ""get my foot in the door"".

This results in more time and money spent on education on top of the thousands of dollars I already owe in debt. The worst part is, by the time I get these credentials I fear they might not even be enough. 

You might say ""get some experience instead of degrees"" but that's the problem, I CAN'T get any experience, I've been working hard trying, even going as far as to walking into businesses dropping off my resume and talking to the owners.

I am not one of those people who believes that I am entitled to anything, but with the risk of going bankrupt before I even get my first full-time job, I want to feel that I at least ""bought"" something."

It usually comes back to the basic argument ""we were lied to and brought up to believe that simply attending college would secure us a job"", but is that really so?

While i do believe we were brought up with this concept, it feels as if too many people feel they are entitled to a career upon graduating college, without any real work.

I am a bit bias since i happen to have aligned myself with people who worked hard to get good grades and looked for employment well before graduation.  But i would like to know what people think.

I personally believe that college really is a ticket to a better future, but its not a given, you must work for it. This means you need to straighten up your act and focus.

* Pick a major that will actually get you employed
* Make sure you actually pay attention and get good grades
* Network and look for employment before graduation, internships are a awesome

And i think any major is viable, but some definately have a higher chance of getting you a nice check: Engineering, Finance, Accounting and so on.

So what do you think Reddit? Do people just feel entitled to a career because they went to school? even those who barely make grades and pick majors for which they cant even answer ""What do you want to do when you graduate?""

I'm a Computer Science student, and recently I've landed a job for the summer at a pretty great Company, a company that is known for bringing hard working interns back each summer until they graduate and commonly providing them with full time jobs.  However, I've also been given the opportunity to work at a well known International Giant in the Computer Science industry, a company I'll refer to as IG.  The travel opportunities and pay are much much greater for me if I take the job at IG, however, as a downside, I will lose my good standing with my current employer for the summer and possibly lose the chance to work at that company altogether (many companies are judged by how many offers potential employees accept, so refusing a job offer would make them look bad and deter them from offering a job to me in the future expecting that I would again turn it down and go to another company) but IG is not necessarily known for bringing interns back for future summer positions.  What would be a wise course of action in this situation? Stick with my current company (which is no doubt fantastic in its own right) and keep job security, or take the job at IG for better pay, travel opportunities and the overall experience but sacrifice the reassurance of having a job at graduation?

I am all sorts of excited to graduate in May with a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from a state school known for it's engineering department.


**My elevator pitch**


I am currently in the thick of a job search, and I am looking for ideas as well as specific positions to apply for. I am really interested in an industry where designers, visionaries, and engineers all work closely together to realize a product that is user-centric and ideally fun!

This product might take the form of a website, an application, or even a physical object. In my opinion, the most wonderful part of Computer Engineering is allowing a way for the physical world and the digital world to communicate.  I would like to be involved in a product that strives to provide a novel, positive, and exciting experience to people.


**What I'm good at**


* Strong in Java (android) and C++
* Coursework in embedded design (ARM, Arduino)
* Love to work with Processing/ OpenFrameworks making artistic tech projects
* Comfortable on Windows/ Linux (and mac is probably cool too.)
* One summer internship as a Software Dev (C++)
* Two apps on the Android market (freelance)
* Working on a portfolio website to teach myself html/ css/ javascript

**Where I want to work**


* Seattle/ Portland area
* San Francisco
* New York
* Europe (my dream)
* Denver (IF it's the right job)

**What else I like**


* Music, literature, philosophy
* Traveling
* Skiing, hiking, rock climbing
* Good coffee and food


I think that covers it... Hopefully this isn't too meta, but I am really hoping some good ideas come out of this.  I am still very much in flux about what I want to do with my life, so this is a chance to mold a young and excited mind! 

OK, anyway, message me if you have any ideas/ tips/ job openings I might be interested in. I can provide more details as needed.

Almost NOTHING could be had.  When finding out most of our frustrated Engineers started bringing in their wanted extra gear from home (and were encouraged by their management to do so), we finally got some extra room in the IT budget to allow each department their own little piggybank within IT.

Extra monitors, extra RAM, larger hard drives, special order PCs, Macbooks, etc, could now be had if that particular department wanted to use what was in their ""bank"".  We even managed to carve out a bit of the extra money for an IT ""toy"" fund.  Much less grumbling from cube-land and from the helpdesk.

However, we have had a couple unintended consequences, departments forget that the money still comes from IT and stuff they buy with it is ""ours"" and goes back into our inventory when a user leaves the company.  It also gives users the impression that limitations on gear were due to a technological limitation rather than a budgetary one.

Example 1: One of our departments loves buying extra monitors for interns that are only with us for a semester, then they get pissed off when I go return their 2nd monitor and 16GB of RAM workstation to my spare equipment rack... no wait, they get pissed when I tell them they need a new request for the new intern and spend the money again.  Moral of the story: don't buy this shit for temporary employees.

Example 2: Line manager puts in request for his new hire's equipment. Asks for a laptop with 2 monitors.  Nobody gets 2 monitors to start with (only 2 exceptions which don't apply here).  I inform him of this fact and he replies that ""I thought the policy changed since the newer model laptops support multiple external displays.""  Yes, because monitors grow on a tree I tend to behind the building and totally don't cost $200/ea.

Oh well, if I had wheels I'd be a wagon.

tl;dr lusers fail to understand that hardware costs money.  What money they do have for hardware shouldn't be spent on temporary employees.

**Edit:** Sorry guys, I'm not a corporate accountant and it's hard for me to explain how all this works.  I probably also should have tossed in a ""You Don't do the budget, Gary, I do!""  It's just a typical workday frustration for me since I have to be mindful of our client-tower spend (as usually I'm the first one on the chopping block if things go south.)"

I am an intern at a corporation and I enjoy it here. Everyone seems to be relaxed in the IT office. There are laughs here and there, and we get serious if something happens. 


Anyway, on one of the floors, a user pressed on the call help desk in the teleconference room. The guy I learn from, and help here and there picks up the phone, and sees its the fifth floor teleconference room. Some mumbo-jumbo talk with the caller, and I hear ""Try pressing and holding the power button. Then let go, and push the button."" To no avail, the user continues asking my pal to have him come upstairs. My pal responds ""I'll be right there."" As we take one flight up, he mentions that the caller said something about a computer not wanting to start up, and that he mentioned Dell. So I think to myself what could be going wrong here. The conference rooms are setup in a wooden panel. These panels include multiple switches for TVs, shades, screens, etc. (Fancy-shmancy stuff). I've interned here over the summer, and have seen sh*t hit the ceiling when one of these panels decides not to work.


We walk through the door, and my pal walks to the panel. He opens the panel, and presses the power button on the Dell. The TV automatically realizes the computer is being booted up, and shows us the Windows loading screen. The crowd inside the room goes wild! The user speaks turns to us and asks [""Where's the power button?? I kept pressing the big, silver Dell button, but it wouldn't turn on!!""](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Dell_Optiplex_745_standing.JPG)


When I got back down to the place I sit, I only though to myself ""It hurt's to have a brain..it hurts..""

I am a long-time reader and was wondering if any of you had advice regarding my current employment situation.


I am 20 have been working in Southern California for ~1.5 years as an Intern for a medium sized software company (~ 300m-700m usd market cap), and have lived here most of my life. I have stayed in college (at a junior college) and will eventually get my degree in CS, although not around the typical 4 year mark. I get paid $20-22 an hour (between that), after a small raise after the 1 year mark. The discussion was initiated by myself, and there is no formal internship to full-time program for my current position/department. I currently live with a parent in a comfortable arrangement and have been saving most of my money. The work is mostly writing lots of BI reports, SQL queries, website updates, and other small projects. My personal programming skills have been mostly self-taught and cover many languages such as C#, Java, Python, PHP, etc. Web Development and Windows/Java Development. Programming has been my life's passion since I started in middle school.


My problem is that I do not enjoy the work very much, which as mentioned, is mostly writing reports (more IT focused, instead of more CS/development focused). My passion is in actual development, such as Java and .NET (C#), versus the IT-related stuff I am currently doing such as making reports, etc.


As I am currently employed on a ""contract"" basis and do not have a full-time job, my question is this: Should I stay with the company for around up to 12 more months, which is when it is highly likely that I will get a full-time job (according what they have told me)? Or start looking elsewhere in the field of work I actually desire? My true passion and skill is in normal programming languages such as Java and C#, versus writing BI (Business Intelligence) reports I have been writing, even though I have become the top report writer at the company. My reasons for thinking about applying elsewhere, is that I am essentially working as much a full-time employee, and my passion is doing other type of work such as Java and C#. I feel the opportunity cost is possibly too great to wait an additional 12 months, and possibly not even a full-time position in the work I want to be doing long term (even though the field I am in would pay somewhat well).
Note: Although the position is on a ""contract"" basis, I am large part of my team and would regard myself as very well-liked.

Thank you for any advice. (This is a throwaway)"

I traveled for a while with my then girlfriend and we worked at a family business out of state for a couple years. We saved every dime we made there and decided that we had a great idea of our own and took what meager funds we had saved and went back south to open our business idea.


 That same year we got married and then pregnant. Business was good and we weren’t concerned. I had wanted to go back to school for my passion but the time just wasn’t there. I began taking some classes at the local CC while running the shop. Things were going pretty well and then we found that our daughter was not speaking or developing as quickly as she was supposed to. After many tests, she was diagnosed with apraxia and we began paying for her costly therapy sessions 3 times per week.  This is when the credit cards came out since we were not poor enough to get it free, but still not rich enough to afford the treatment without financing. This lead to a pile of debt totally about $60,000. Whilst this was ongoing, we both redoubled our effort both at work and home. I neglected my school for a stint there in the middle, but I buckled back down and budgeted my time a little better and finished my AA. 


I got the idea that 2010 was the year to start my BA. I had a full head of steam and was buoyed by my daughter’s recovery and her strides forward. I have always loved Political Science and law so I figured what better field to get my degree in than something I loved. I majored in PS and minored in Law. During the two years I was at the 4-year school our own business felt the hardest pinch of the economy. Our customers just were not spending the same as they had been. Our landlord had raised the rent and several unforeseen emergencies had tapped us out of extra operational funds. After nearly a decade in business, we closed our doors in November.  Then in December I finished my degree graduating with honors (Dec 2012). I have been applying for jobs and attending interviews non-stop since graduation. I have yet to get even a nibble.


 I had an internship that was supposed to pan out with a job for the clerk but cutbacks from the governor’s office froze my offer and I walked away with merely a heartfelt letter of recommendation and a law school referral.  Since then my only lighthouse has been that I was accepted into both the Ms CIS:Computer Science and MBA program at a state university in for May 2013. I can combine the two degrees and graduate with both.  I have a ton of business experience and such so I would much rather have found some good employment and perhaps go to school part time while working. Seemingly, this is not to be. I must have filled out over 120 job applications with no takers, made a 100% complete linked in, got on careershift, monster, indeed, etc. 


On top of this back in July despite contraception my wife became pregnant again and now we have a baby boy due on the 21st of January. 



I just do not know what else to do. I suppose I will start applying at grocery stores, Staples, Walmart, Target, Sears, etc as apparently I can’t get a good job and we need money. It hurts to have to apply for jobs I held during HS.  


What am I missing in my job applications? Is my experience combined with the degree just not suitable for any good job?


I have never been depressed before in my life, but .......

162j09,16,2013-01-06,Miles Moon - Slither Hunter,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/162j09/miles_moon_slither_hunter/,"You know how some people spend their entire lives wishing things were different, hoping that something will come along and make everything more interesting? They’re the type of people that spend so much time complaining that they’re bored, they never do anything to combat the boredom. Well I wasn’t one of those people, I was happy with things just the way they were.

The name’s Miles Moon, once upon a time I was a normal guy, a writer of sorts, just making my way through life and taking everything as it came. Very few interesting events happened, it was peaceful, I liked it that way.
 But good things don’t stay that way, and the day I was enlisted turned my quiet existence on it’s head, now I’m Miles Moon - Slither Hunter, and nothing is ever going to be the same again.

You’re probably wondering what a Slither is. You know about them, or the affect that they have anyway. Slithers are creatures from the dawn of creation, beings that don’t quite belong in our dimension, but have made it their home anyway, Slithers are a cause of nightmares, depression, murders and suicide, and for the most part, they’re also a damn nuisance. 

There’s a chance you’ve seen one, if you’ve ever seen something out of the corner of your eye, or felt a breeze in a draft-free room, then you’ve most likely come into contact with a Slither, and you should be afraid, because where there’s a Slither, there’s trouble.

							               ***

I remember the first time I saw one, though I didn’t know what it was back then. It was the day of my Grandfathers funeral, and we were standing around the grave, I was too young to really understand death, only five, looking back I’m amazed that I was even at the gravesite. 

 It appeared after the priest had finished and the family had been left to grieve, everyone was standing around hugging each other and crying, I was holding my mum’s hand while she cried into my father’s shoulder, not really sure what I was supposed to do. I was sad, sure, I loved my Popo, but I’d accepted that I wouldn’t see him again. 

That’s when I saw it, the Slither, it was hanging around outside the circle of family and friends, at first I could only see it in glimpses as it passed behind people. Curiosity got the better of me and I let go of my mothers hand, it seemed to be going around and around the circle, so I stepped out in front of it, just before it passed us by.

The world froze, birds that had been singing were instantly silenced, and the noises of mourning vanished. It stopped and looked at me, I don’t think it knew what to do, it sort of swished it’s head from side to side, as though searching for something. It was ugly, it’s rather hard to forget what a Slither looks like. 

Imagine a tadpole, but grey in colour and about fifty times bigger, the size of a full grown adult, they float above the ground as though they’re swimming in water, and their tails seem to turn into mist before disappearing completely. They have arms of a sort too, protruding from just under the head, they’re long and spindly things, with two joints in each that might be elbows, they end at a point, which when spread turns into a four fingered hand, there are no nails, but their skin ends up the width of a needle on each finger.

The heads are harder to describe, they don’t really have one, there’s a bulge and the body just sort of rounds off at the front, where they keep their face. The faces are interesting, they take on the likeness of the last person who’s life they’ve affected, and keep it until their next pray succumbs. The faces they take are lifeless, with grey orbs instead of eyes and a mouth that turns into a black emptiness past the teeth. The one that I saw on the day of my grandfathers funeral will stay with me forever, because it was wearing his face.

It made up it’s mind about what to do next, snapping it’s face back to me, looking at me with a cold and dead version of my grandfathers eyes, and it started to advance. I didn’t move, I was scared, but something was stopping me, I willed my legs to turn around and run, but they didn’t.

 It crept closer by the second, I found myself unable to look away from those eyes, and I was sure that it was opening it’s mouth wider and wider the closer it got, I tried to scream, but my mouth was following my legs example and stayed firmly closed.

 I could feel a chill on my face when it was inches away, I started to think about the next week, when it would be my grave the adults were crowded around, and my mum would be crying even harder than today.

 Then a strange thing happened, there had been no sound since I'd locked eyes with the creature, but there was sound now, a low hum that seemed to be coming from all around, the Slither must have heard it too, because it suddenly started to back away, thrashing from side to side, it’s form seeming to bulge and bubble, before exploding in front of my eyes.

The second it exploded I could move again, and it was just in time to cover my face with my arms, making sure I got none of the creature on me. When I lowered my arms again I saw a figure walking towards me.

“Name?” The man asked, as he put a metallic object back into his pocket, and took a notebook out of the other.

“What?” I could feel my eyes welling up with tears, I looked around for my mum, but the adults were all frozen in place, it was silent again.

“Look kid, I’m sorry that I have to do this, but you’re a Hunter, and we’re fighting a losing battle, so we need everyone.” The man sighed, he flipped open the notebook to a clean page and knelt down so that he was at my level.

“Miles... Miles Moon.” I could feel my lip quivering as I said it, the man looked at me sadly, before writing the name in the book and patting me on the shoulder.

							               ***

That’s what I remember of the day, for the longest time I was scared of what I saw, but as I gradually got older I started to forget, my memories faded as childhood memories often do, and the Slither, along with the man, disappeared into the haze.

I managed to forget about them for seventeen years, during that time I led a nice and normal life, going to university, getting an internship, and eventually landing an awesome writing job. Everything was falling into place, but all that changed on my 22nd birthday, when I was visited by the person that would change my life. 

I’d decided on a quiet one, just a small gathering of friends at a local restaurant, I’ve never been one for big parties, so I was happy to just spend the day with those that were closest to me. The place was nearly empty by the time we’d finished eating, and I think the waiters were sick of living up to their name, I asked for the cheque. 

My girlfriend, Alex, leaned over to me as the waiter skipped towards the register, and whispered into my ear.

“Hey, I don’t want to freak you out, but that man over there has been staring at you since we got here, don’t make it obvious.” She squeezed my hand under the table and lifted my finger to point to the man, I casually took a swig from my drink and looked at him over the top of the glass.

He was younger than I was, hardly a man at all, probably still a teenager, but Alex was right, he was staring right at me, and the plate of food in front of him had barely been touched. He saw me looking, and stood up.

“Everyone ready to go?” I turned to the group, who were playing the ‘how many toothpicks can you get to support each other' game, none of them paid attention to me.

The man walked around our table and straight up to me, Alex squeeze my hand again, before turning around to watch the toothpick contest with faux fascination.

“Mr Moon?” The man extended a hand, I took it. 

That was the second time in my life when the universe stood still, all of the tiny movements around me suddenly stopped, the sound of the register broke off mid slam, and the beginning of shouts from my friends were instantly silenced. I turned to see a handful of toothpicks half way to the tabletop, and Steve with a mad grin on his face stood above them.

“Cool.” I turned to the young man who’s hand I was still holding, he smiled.

“I’m impressed, most people usually start with ‘What the-,’ not ‘Cool.’” He let go of my hand and grabbed a chair from the table behind us. “My name is Rathford, and it’s a pleasure to meet you Miles Moon.”

“Are you like him? That man?” My childhood memories had come flooding back to me the moment that the universe froze, I remembered the creature at my grandfathers funeral, and the man that had taken my name.

“I am, and I’m here for you Mr Moon, I’m going to offer you a job.” 

“I have a job.” I responded, picking up my drink to take another swig, it didn’t work, the liquid stayed defiantly at the bottom of the glass, Rathford grinned.

“You don’t have a job like this one, you’re a Hunter Miles, the ability was temporarily buried by my co-worker until you were ready, but it’s about to come back in full.”

“What ability?” I put the glass down, hoping I hadn’t looked too foolish.

“The power to see the Slithers.”

“Slithers? You mean that grey tadpole thing?”  Rathford laughed at the description.

“I suppose they do look a bit like tadpoles don’t they, but yes, they’re the Slithers, and there’s considerably more than just the one at your grandfathers funeral.”

							               ***

So that’s my story, and here I am, fighting in a war that I didn’t even know existed until my 22nd birthday. The Slithers are the scourge of the earth, and if there weren’t people like me keeping them at bay, then they’d run rampant and destroy us in weeks.

I don’t know what makes me special, Rathford told me that they haven’t worked out why some people can see the Slithers and most can’t, but they’re hoping to try and find out, it could be the key to a decisive victory against them, and the end to the suffering.

Ah yes, the suffering, I should probably qualify this. See it’s a hard life for myself and the other Slither Hunters, we’re tasked with tracking down and exterminating them, until such time as we can find out which hell they come from and close the door. We have to give up everything for this, our families, any friends, our whole lives, though I suppose that we do get the ability to control time, and an arsenal of weapons.

But it’s a much harder life for the human race, people that otherwise have great potential, or an untapped intelligence, will simply collapse one day, any future ripped from them, the lucky ones are killed, the unlucky ones... well, they simply become husks, and that person becomes just another meal for the Slithers.

Honestly, if it weren’t for the fact that we’re on a pretty level playing field, the human race would have been wiped out aeons ago. "

The majors I have been looking at are Advertising, Graphic Design, and Computer Science. I know they are all different but I would like to do CS the most.

I have one year before I set out for college and would like some advice on how to prepare for what is to come if I did want to pursue a career in CS.

Should I start teaching myself, through books or the internet math? What kind of math should I teach myself before going to college. I can't even do algebra correctly. The courses require up to Calculus 2, I can't even dream of doing that. Should I start from Algebra 1 and work my way up and teach myself until I can do Calculus 1 and 2?

Should I start programming before I start CS in college? Will this help me or will I not need to program until my third of fourth year? Programming will help me land an internship easier at least, right?

If I wanted to learn programming, could I match it with other degrees that are less math-intensive if I really struggled with math and couldn't get past CS? I am going to try and take CS but for me I cannot see it being remotely easy.

Thanks, hopefully you guys can answer my questions about teaching myself and getting prepared for my future in CS. Is the math in the CS courses used in programming at all?

3. In college, declared electrical engineering as my major. Failed Calculus I twice.  Switched to Business MIS.
4. Had 1 internship working in IT.  Didn't like it.  Had 1 more internship working in marketing.  Loved it.
5. 3 months prior to graduating college, I started working full-time at a marketing agency.  Boss allowed me to come in work every other day so I can finish classes.  45k/year job.
6. Graduated from college in May 2012 with a 2.4 GPA.

8. I wasn't even a marketing major.  I turned 23 in 2012.

The point of this post isn't to brag.  I just want to let you know that it's not all about grades when it comes to jobs.  There are probably tens of thousands of graduates with super high GPAs who are unemployed right now.  You need to separate yourself from the pack.

You need to know what field you want to work in, what kind of company you want to work for, how much you want to make, and go for it!  You need a plan.  You need to stick to it.  You need to work towards it.

For myself, as soon as I found out that I wanted to do marketing, I applied to marketing internships to gain experience.  Then I studied marketing on marketing websites/blogs almost every day(who needs to pay for expensive college?).  I also created personal projects for fun and to show off what I knew to employers. By the time I graduated college, I was more skilled than almost all marketing majors.

And instead of waiting to find a job after I graduate, I started working full-time at a marketing agency while I was still in college for a cheap rate because I knew companies like prospects that come from consultant roles in agencies.

My advice to you all in college:

* Know what you want to do early and understand that unless you are rich, you'll need to work in a profession that companies actually need.  So no art history major(unless you are rich). Business/Engineering/Economics majors are best if you want a job right away after college.

* If you don't have one yet, sign up for a LinkedIn account and fill out your profile.  If you don't have a lot of experience, write about what you want to do after graduation.

* Actually spend time on LinkedIn.  Add people in the profession that you want to work for as connections and look at their work experience so you know what how to get to their level eventually.  For example if you want to work as a software developer, add software engineers, VP software engineering, software architects as connections.

* Apply to internships! I would have started applying in my freshman year in college if I knew what an internship was.

* Create personal projects that you can show to employers.  For example, if you are a software engineer, create a program.  If you are a statistics major, create a model to solve a problem.  If you are an economics major, start a blog and write your thoughts on how to solve our economic issues.

I graduated with honors in 2010 with a B.S. in marketing, minor in economics, and I couldn't find anything in my field at the time. I took a job in information systems, and then in 2011 started a graduate program which I am about to finish when my thesis is approved. My masters is in accountancy with an information systems concentration (my thesis is in network audit trail management).

I would like to get in to systems development, but I have had little luck landing a relevant position. It seems that the popular career track for a job like that is to go to get a technical major, intern in your Jr. and Sr. years, and then work with the college career center to land a job. I may have missed that boat.

I am willing to take a paid internship to prove myself if necessary. The issue is that most companies seem to consider internships something that happens in your Jr. and Sr. years of undergrad. Am I too far out of that to have a good shot at internships? With my experience/education, should I be trying another angle to get into this field? I feel that I am somehow ""locked out"" of most of the college-to-career opportunities because I missed the boat with my school's career center.

As an intern I never used any of the work machines so I have no idea what kind of hardware is in them and since he kept the hard drives I don't even have an OS installed to turn it on. When I open it up I don't really know what I'm looking for inside and labels are lacking or hidden from view.

I do however have a new harddrive but no OS to install onto it. So I was wondering if you guys had any ideas for how I should go about assessing my loot."

I'm also wondering, since I have some teaching experience (it's on my CV, but I don't mention it in my SOP), should I talk about it in my SOP? It's not necessarily relevant to this program since there aren't teaching fellowships for Master's students, but is it something I should talk about just because it's nice to have?
Thank you in advance!

My motivation to earn a graduate degree in psychology stems from my passion for psychological and brain sciences, my desire to become an experimental psychologist and university professor, and the necessity to learn as much as I can in my chosen field. Through thorough academic preparation and several years of experience in neuropsychological research, I have transformed into the ideal candidate for the Master's of Awesome Science at the University of Equally Awesome Science.

I sought out my first experience in psychological research during my second year of college: a position as a research assistant in a child development lab. My main responsibility was to learn a complex coding scheme and use it to correct discrepancies between codes in previously coded narrative transcripts of maternal word choice in picture book reading. Through my involvement in this project, I gained experience with the post-experimental aspects of behavioral psychology. I continued to work on this project throughout my undergraduate career, and I am currently in the process of helping to train incoming research assistants, as well as beginning some preliminary statistical and data analysis.

In addition to my experience with research in behavioral science, I had a strong interest in neuroscience methodology, and sought an internship in an event-related potential (ERP) lab. Initially, my responsibilities were to run adult participants in ERP studies, which involved attaching scalp and eye electrodes, explaining event-related potentials to participants, and troubleshooting if participants had any questions or if programs went awry. During the summer of 2012, I accepted a research assistant position in the Undergraduate College ERP Lab, which not only afforded me the freedom and funds to pursue my own research interests, but also gave me valuable experience running child ERP participants. I left my summer placement confident in my ability to program studies in E-Prime 2.0, to recruit and schedule participants, efficiently execute data entry, and to explain neuroscience to children in ways that are both engaging and exciting to those with no prior interest in science. 

My positions in research for the last 3 years, as well as my experience designing and carrying out my own undergraduate research thesis have given me a thorough understanding of some of the frustrations psychological research can present. I have worked on projects tirelessly for months, only to find that researchers in Finland have been working just as hard on the exact same project, and have published their findings just as I begin data analysis. I have programmed and piloted a series of studies, only to realize after recruiting and running many participants that adding additional trigger numbers to stimuli could have yielded even more interesting research. These speed bumps have only made my passion for science stronger, and although there are numerous challenges in the process of psychological discovery, the rewards yielded by the findings of a study, whether they are expected or unexpected, make the frustrations along the way totally worth it.

My personal research interests stem from a fascination with human emotion, interpersonal interaction, and how we use our own experiences to relate to others. My undergraduate thesis, a novel ERP study on the role of mood congruency in the implicit processing of emotional faces, was my first real foray into the field of empathy research. My study yielded significant findings that present potential new challenges to the field of affective empathy research: since mood congruency is important in our processing of emotional facial expressions, the validity of some previous research on the empathetic response (that has not considered mood congruency as a variable) may come into question. Should I be granted admission to the Master's of Awesome Science Program, I would hope to continue this research on emotion and empathy at the University of Equally Awesome Science, using the same or a similar paradigm to more closely examine the role of the cross-race effect in mood congruency and implicit emotion processing, as well as to correlate the ERP amplitude responses to mood-congruent faces with participants with both high- and low-trait empathy. 

Master's of Awesome Sci at U of Eq. Awe. Sci. is the ideal place for me to begin my graduate studies in Psychology. The individualized structure of the program is one in which I have experience, and one in which I thrive. My undergraduate program allowed me to design my own major and academic concentration, excel in graduate level courses, gain unprecedented research experience, and carry out every aspect of original psychology and neuroscience studies, from the discovery of an idea to the programming of stimuli, to running participants, to data collection and analysis. Although I do not necessarily expect this amount of freedom at the Master’s level, my undergraduate experience has given me the discipline, responsibility, and tools to successfully navigate my own education. Additionally, your program will give me the opportunity to learn from those whom I consider “science rock stars,” whose research I have admired for years.  

My education in brain science will not end at the Master’s level. I aspire to earn a PhD in psychology with a concentration in integrative or social neuroscience, and conduct empathy and emotion research in academia, as well as teach at the university level. My life’s ambition is to research the neural bases and psychological manifestations of affective empathy, and discover novel ways to facilitate these neural processes so humans can best allocate our resources to understand and empathize with each other.

Anyways, I am currently an intern at a specialty truck manufacturer and had been given a task.  It is essentially data clean up.  I was given an excel file that contained records that failed a process (missing information in records).

I was told to bring up each record using queries and check the record to see part of the data was missing and if it was I would look at the excel sheet and put in the appropriate information in the appropriate field and update the record.  I had hundreds of records and had to do it manually.

My first thought immediately was to create a python script that would grab the key from the excel file and select the record from the database.  Check if a field in the returned query was missing information and then if it was I would go to the excel file and grab the appropriate input for that record and update the record using a sql statement and then move on.  Bonus points would being able to format the row in excel with a certain color as in if it had been changed or some other condition.

So my question is can anyone point me in the right direction on how I can achieve this?  I am not sure how to look up something like this.

Thank you."

The problem is that I took my data structures course at a different University, where the curriculum was extremely lacking.  We didn't even touch sorting or searching algorithms, Big O, or anything along those lines.  I do have some basic experience with these concepts from previous courses, but it's just that-basic.  When I get asked more in-depth questions on these topics during my interviews, I feel like this is something every programmer should know, so ""I didn't learn that"" seems like a very poor excuse for my lack of knowledge.  I am doing some research and trying to teach it to myself, but the interviews are soon enough that I don't have time to learn it all.

So, how should I address this in the interviews?  Do I attempt an answer and if I get it wrong then I just move on? Do I mention that my course was a bit lacking, but I'm doing independent study to fill in the gaps in my knowledge?  Any advice would be appreciated.

EDIT: and does anyone know of a good site for learning Big O?"

I've wanted to move to Europe since I started high school and got into languages. I speak English natively, Dutch and Spanish comfortably (B2/C1), and German at a level that could use improvement (A2).

Specifically, I'm looking at Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany or Austria. France would be nice too, but I don't speak French.

I could really use some advice. I graduated from college with a computer science degree last summer. It was pretty challenging for me but in the end I managed to creep my way up to a 3.0 GPA / 3.3 Major GPA. I didn't get an internship though, which was my first big mistake. 

After graduating and moving back home (near Los Angeles), I wasn't really sure what to do, and it took me a while to get the hang of fixing up my resume, applying to jobs, doing interviews and whatnot. The real problem is that up until about a month ago, I barely did any programming at all, so I got pretty rusty. I'm not sure why, but without the structured environment of school, I got really lazy and time flew by at an unbelievably quick pace.

So right now I find myself jobless, with a resume that has a suspicious 6 month gap. Even the last school project on there is from 2011. I've had only a handful of interviews over the phone, and one in person. The most recent one asked me about what I've been doing since graduating, so I can sense that the gap is becoming an issue. 

I know I've made alot of mistakes so far, due to both ignorance and laziness, but now I'm really starting to feel that I missed the window of opportunity, and I want to get things back on track. Do I keep applying to jobs hoping that I get lucky? Do I just focus on programming, maybe doing a few projects that I can add to my resume? Do I get a job in something unrelated for the time being? Look for an internship? All of the above? Something else? I want to get out of this ever-worsening situation but I don't want to make any more mistakes due to ignorance. What do you guys think the best course of action is right now?

1663jr,7,2013-01-08,Doing my duty to follow up with the community on how I got a job,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1663jr/doing_my_duty_to_follow_up_with_the_community_on/,"I graduated in mid december and I just landed a contract position at a good company that has potential to lead to different things there. Here is what I learned:

1. It's all about who you know - and I knew no one, like, I had no connections - it sucks!. _just find a way around HR_, it is easy to figure out the corporate emails of employees, email the manager or leader in that area and say you are interested. Whats the worst that could happen? You do not even have to use your full name, so you can still apply traditionally. For example, 8/10 times Dexter Morgan's company email at Microsoft is just dmorgan@microsoft,com or dexter.morgan@microsoft,com

2. It's all about timing - I was denied a job at this place originally and then the interviewer called me up 5 weeks later to say he remembered me and there was an opp for me. This is out of your control, you can just hope you are lucky?

I, just like you, applied to those job boards and heard nothing back. I just imagined what it must have been like to be the HR person on the other side of the screen who got to feel better and better about themselves everyday by looking at all the schmucks trying to get where they work. So, I went around them. Kind of. The best advice I can give, which can only apply to some of you, is work with recruiters/contract work. These are people that are given special privilege to opportunities and have connections to people at a lot of different companies. Call them, say you are interested in X type of work and see if you think there may be an opportunity. They will ask for your resume and it continues from there. The goal is not for a cushy job right away, but somewhere where you can at least have a chance to prove your worth and progress from there. Some contracts are truly contract work, some are like professional internships - jobs that need to be filled but companies quickly and cheaply fill them with potential incumbents and get to try them out. Similar to the probationary stage of full time jobs but without the benefits.

Prior to graduating I had a few internships and studied abroad. Econ degree. This didn't seem to factor into the qualifications; my personality, analytical background of econ, and some Excel experience are what sold it, I believe.

I may be back on here in a few months if the contract is up and no opportunities show themselves during that time, but I will do my darndest to earn my spot there!"

John and I were working on the case in my office. It was weird not having Anna around. I was so desperately hoping that my suspicions were wrong, that she wasn’t dead, just hiding until the case was over or was taking a break. The office was cold, so cold we could see our breath. Neither of us really knew what to do about the whole Stitch thing.

We looked through the pictures, read the journals, and watched the tapes, God knows how many times. We would watch the tapes in slow-motion looking for any little clues that might tell us where to find him. But we couldn’t find anything. First, we were thinking he must be hiding somewhere outdoors. He always seemed sort of dirty and disheveled, like he didn’t have access to a shower and was always running around barefoot. But then we wondered, if he’s an outdoorsman, why is he naked? Doesn’t he get cold? Then we played around with the idea that he lived in a cave somewhere. Which would make sense – he’d have some warmth so he could wander around naked all he wanted. But it still didn’t quite work in our heads. Since when do supernatural creatures and serial killers not have homes and established lives outside of their murder sprees? Vampires, you think live in castles, mansions, and whatnot. Werewolves are only like that once a month, so they obviously have stuff to do the rest of the time, and have a house. Even zombies sort of have a home – their coffins until they rise from the dead. What would make Stitch want to be the outcast and not have a house and established life?

Nothing was making sense to us. Our heads hurt. Our coffee was running out. The sun was going down. The work week was coming to an end. Our options were running out. Thankfully no one else had been killed. But surely, it would happen again soon. Stitch wasn’t one to sit and do nothing for extended periods of time.

“What do you want to do?” I asked John as I stretched out my back. Before he could answer, the door to my office slammed open and an FBI team walked in.
“We need you two to come in for questioning,” the only one in a suit said. The rest of them were wearing the typical FBI uniforms, with their guns and everything. John and I were confused. What could we have done to catch the FBIs attention? We complied and went with the team willingly. We all walked out of the office quietly. My coworkers watched, just as confused as we were. Their eyes were all wide. Some of the mouthed words at me, asking what was going on. I just shrugged. I really had no idea. They shoved us into the back of a car and drove us to where they wanted to question us. 

We arrived at the jail in Downtown Seattle. It was a tan building with small windows with bars over them, so the prisoners couldn’t escape. I was scared. I looked over at John. He was squeezing his hands together; I could see they were sweaty. He had wide eyes, like he was a child caught stealing candy. My palms were sweaty too. I’m sure my eyes were just as wide. 

We were let out of the car. Two men grabbed both of my arms and pulled me into the building. I didn’t know what we’d done to deserve such harsh treatment. They didn’t give us time to look around the building, but I didn’t really mind. I’d been there countless times. I was just confused by why we were being brought there for questioning.

John and I were put into separate rooms. Each room had white walls, a white tile floor, a white ceiling, and a white light. There was a metal table in the middle of the room with chairs all around it. I was told to sit down and wait. So I did as I was told, in an attempt to stop the brutal treatment. The walls were entirely bare of everything, even texture. As I waited, I tried to find something to fix my eyes on. But I was so nervous I could hardly sit still. I tapped my feet and drummed my fingers and chewed my nails. What could I have possibly done? I’m just a detective! I’m the one who’s supposed to be solving the cases, not be a suspect or anything. Interrupting my thoughts, a man in a gray suit walks in with a file. He sits down across the table from me and just looks at me for what felt like an eternity.

“You’re probably wondering why we brought you and your intern in here,” he said. His voice was deep and scratchy. He had a bird’s nest type of hair, mostly white with shades of gray. His eyes were tired and old, like they’d seen everything to be seen. I nodded at him, unsure if I was allowed to speak.
“What do you know about…” He looks at his papers. “Repetitive Routine… What do you know about his death?”
“I know what happened on the tapes,” I said. “I have them back in my office if you want to see them.”
“We know what happened in the tapes,” the man said. “What do you know? Is there anything we should know that can’t be learned through the tapes?”
“What do you mean?” I asked. The bright light was making my headache worse.
“What did you have to do with it?”
“Nothing!” I said, shocked. “I didn’t kill him, if that’s what you’re asking. He offered to help us find Stitch and that’s what ended up happening. Stitch came and killed him. We didn’t think that would happen, but it did. And from that side of the webcam you can’t really do anything.” My speech got faster and faster as I kept talking. Was I really a suspect in his death? In my own investigation?
“Okay,” the man said. “Calm down. We’re just investigating his death.” That made me fume. That was my case. I didn’t work so hard to become the best detective in the Seattle PD just to have my case taken from me. Even if it was impossible to solve…

“You’re free to go,” the man said. “We’ll be in touch with any further information on his death.” I nodded at him and walked into the hall. As I waited in the hallway for John to come out from his interrogation, an idea crossed my mind. An illegal one, mind you, but an idea nonetheless. And despite its illegality, I decided to pursue it. I jogged down the hall to the man who’d questioned me and asked him where the nearest bathroom was. He pointed and said down the hall and around the corner. So I walked down the plain hallway and stood just around the corner, near the restroom. I peaked around to see the man go into a room with the folder, and come out without it. When the coast was clear, I snuck into the room, quietly so no one could hear. The room was dark and dank with file folders covering all the walls. The files were organized in alphabetical order so I found the J drawer and searched for my file. At last I found it. Johnson, Ryan. I opened it and found a small notebook. Flipping through it, the pages were covered in notes. I smiled to myself. Suddenly I head the door opened so I stuffed the notebook into my pocket and closed the drawer quickly and silently. A woman with sharp features and a stern expression walked in.

“What are you doing in here?” she asked.
“I was looking for the bathroom,” I said.
“Wrong room. It’s down the hall and around the corner,” she said.
“Okay, thank you,” I said. I walked out of the room and found John waiting at the end of the hall by the rooms we’d been questioned in. 

I swiftly walked to him and gestured for him to follow me quickly. We stepped out of the building into the crisp Seattle air. I kept walking until we were a good distance away from the building. Then I pulled the journal out of my pocket and showed it to John. He looked at me with concern.
“Did you steal that?” he asked. I nodded but didn’t care that he was worried. We were already in trouble. I flipped to the first page. It talked about how we were suspects in Repetitive Routine’s murder.
John Freeman and Ryan Johnson – present at time of crime, could have orchestrated it in ploy to solve serial killer case, follow after questioning.

That made both of us nervous. We looked around as soon as we read that, looking for suspicious cars. Cars of different colors and models whizzed around us, but nothing was standing still watching us. We felt small rain drops start to hit our heads and neck so we started walking and fast as we could to the office. The rain started to really pour and get us soaking wet before we reached our cars.

“I was thinking…we should go up to Anna’s parents house. She might be staying with them,” I told John.
“Let’s go now,” he said. “Why not? The sooner we find her the sooner we can let our minds ease.” I agreed with him and we both piled into my car. It was getting dark as I pulled out into traffic and eventually onto the freeway. The clouds were ominous. They were a dark gray. The rain was pounding on my car. John and I were silent the whole time. Neither of us knew what to say. We didn’t know what we were going to find. But both of us were praying to whatever God was out there, that we’d find Anna alive. A couple hours went by. The weather kept getting worse and the sun kept going further down until it was pitch black outside. That’s when I felt a bump and then it got really hard to drive all of a sudden. I pulled over to the side of the road and jumped out of my car. The front left tire was completely flat.

“Great!” I nearly screamed. “Just awesome.” John got out of the car and looked at the wheel. I ran my hand through my messy hair and sighed. It was already getting late and I didn’t want to deal with this. Especially given the situation. What if Stitch found us? I shoved those thoughts aside and tried to focus on fixing the wheel. I opened my trunk and found my spare wheel. But only a spare wheel. All my tools to fix it were gone. Nowhere to be found. How was I supposed to fix my stupid tire without tools? I nearly screamed again. I shut my trunk and leaned against the driver’s side door and waited for someone to drive by and help.

“You okay?” John asked after a while. We were both standing the pouring rain, in the dark, in the middle of nowhere. Neither of us were happy. Our suits were soaked; our hair looked like we’d just taken a shower; it was late; we were tired and stressed out. Things just weren’t looking good for us.
“What do you think?” I said. I wasn’t trying to sound rude, but I guess that was the vibe I put out because John scooted away from me a little bit and didn’t say anything else for a while. We waited in the rain for half an hour before a car finally stopped to help us. A man and a young woman got out of the car. The lady had long brown hair in a braid down her back and hippie like clothing. She had a kind face and walked towards us with welcoming arms.

“What happened?” she asked, sounding genuinely concerned.
“Flat tire,” John said. He sounded in a better mood than I was. Even if he had been acting strange lately, he was still more chipper than me. “We can’t find Ryan’s tools.”
“Oh, that’s terrible!” the woman said. “We have tools. Go help them change their tire, Josh!” The man she was with was tall and extremely muscular, to the point that it was kind of weird. He wore a plain white t-shirt and jeans. He didn’t seem like he would be dating the woman he was with – if they were dating, that is. He nodded in her direction and went to the trunk of their black car. Shortly thereafter he came back with the necessary tools and helped us change my tire. In just a few minutes we were ready to go.

“Thank you so much,” I said. “This really means a lot.”
“Oh, no problem at all,” the woman said, grinning. “Just one question though. What’s with the car with the two scary looking men in it back there? They’ve just been sitting there the whole time.” John and I looked back at the car and then back at each other. Neither of us had noticed it until she pointed it out. It was sleek and black, nearly unnoticeable in the dark from that distance. I thought on my feet.
“Oh, that’s the FBI. We’re detectives working on a case with them. It’s nothing to worry about.” It was something to worry about…
“Interesting!” the woman said. The man stood beside her silently the whole time they’d helped us. “Well good luck with your case!”
“Thank you. And again, thank you so much for the help.” I smiled at her and John and I got back into my car, thoroughly soaking wet.

“What should we do about them?” John said, pointing at the FBI car trailing us.
“Just let them do whatever. There’s nothing for us to hide; we didn’t do what they think we did,” I said. I started up the car and kept driving. John and I were silent the whole ride to Bellingham. The car kept trailing us all the way to Anna’s parent’s house. We tried acting like we didn’t see them. We tried to act as natural as we could. It was hard, but we did as good a job as possible.

Soon we pulled up to Anna’s parent’s house. It was a small little house just outside the city. They owned a little ranch with three horses. They were neighing in the barn a little ways from the house. They sounded panicked, but I didn’t know anything about horses, so for all I knew, that was what they sounded like all the time. John and I walked up to the front door of their shabby little house. Anna’s car was sitting outside. It had frost on the windows and what looked like fresh mud on the tires. Maybe she had just come back.

The paint on the house was peeling and the grass was unkempt. The stairs creaked as we walked up them onto the porch. I knocked on the door, but as I knocked it just opened. I pushed it further open and John and I walked in skeptically. The air was freezing cold and bugs were crawling on the ground. The first room we came to was the living room. The furniture had that typical old-lady pattern of canvas flowers. The furniture was covered in those plastic covers. The window next to the television was broken. Glass was all over the ground. The television was on. A news broadcaster’s voice rang through the silent house. It was eerie.

The floor creaked beneath our feet as we kept walking slowly through the house. We got to the kitchen. The fridge was open and the sink was running. Food was sitting on the counter like someone was about to prepare a meal. The food was rotting and there was a slight stench in the air. It was starting to get various colored mold on it. Flies buzzed around the plate, loving the stench of the disgusting food. John walked over to look at it. He winced a little.

“One of those flies just bit me,” he said. He poked at the food and a bunch of fruit flies jumped off the food on the table. We couldn’t tell what the food even was. The table was set and one of the chairs was pulled out from the table like someone was sitting there watching the other person cook. I started to see specks of blood on the floor as we kept walking. We followed the blood drops until they turned into trails of blood. Some places it was hard to make out on the brown carpet.

The trail led into a room that appeared to be an office, but also kept going down the hall.
We decided to go room by room and started in the office. It had a computer, printer and a desk with some cabinets. The blood trail went right past everything and up the wall. It stopped halfway to the ceiling. John told me to come over to where he was. I walked around the desk on the side where the chair was. The chair was covered in blood and so were the keyboard and the top of the desk. Some of the keys were missing from the keyboard, the monitor was completely broken and the mouse was hanging down, covered in blood. The damage and destruction of the desk area was not the most disturbing part. The worst part was, all over the keyboard. We found teeth. Like someone had gotten their face slammed into it repeatedly and their teeth had fallen out. They were white with yellowing at the top of them where they’d fallen out. The monitor still had glass around the frame. It was covered in blood and on one long shard of glass, there was an eye ball. It was brown and still had the veins attached to it. There was also some hair caught on glass on the side of the monitor. It was long, white, and sort of crinkly. 

At least I knew it wasn't Anna’s. I went to pull the chair out from the desk, and as I did, I heard a loud thump. I look down and there was a hand coming out from under the desk. John and I crouched down to have a better look. It was Anna’s mom.

She was curled up under the desk, her knees against her chest, sitting up. Her left eye was out of its socket, some teeth were missing as well and there were a few holes in her scalp where hair and skin should be. We could see the white bone of her cracked skull. Her right eye was still in its socket. It was swollen and black with bits of blood trickling down her pale white cheek. Her nose was severely broken. You could see the cracked bone beneath the crusted blood.  We decided not to touch the body continued down the hall way.

The blood trail was on the ground for a good five to six feet then it swerved to the left and went up the wall. We followed it on the wall until it came to a door. This door was locked and after several attempts to break it in with our shoulders, John kicked it in. It was Anna’s dad’s personal room - bachelor pad, if you will. It had a flat screen, computer, fish tank, various mounted animal heads, a gun cabinet and a cigar humidor. We didn't stay long in that room.

The first thing we saw was her dad’s body. He was ripped in half and replaced on the wall with his mounted bear head. His lower body was still standing up, right below him on the ground. On the wooden plaque, where it read the name, size and weight of the bear, someone had carved over it. It said ""Collateral"" and below that it said ""You can't run"". Maybe this will get those damn FBI agents to finally believe Stitch is real. Maybe this will get them off my back.

John and I went outside to find the FBI agents. They weren’t in their car so we assumed they were following us around the house. We turned to go back into the house and look for them and saw them coming towards us. Their guns were drawn but they weren’t pointing them at us.
“Do you believe us that Stitch is behind all this now?” I asked. “Do you believe we didn’t kill Repetitive Routine?”
“We don’t know what to think,” one man said. He scratched his head and rubbed his chin. “Maybe we should call the local authorities. They might have some insight on this couple. Maybe someone was out to get them. We’ll also call in more field agents. This might be beyond your control now, if what you’re telling me is true.”
“Didn’t you see what was written on the plaque? It was Stitch!” John said, getting flustered.
“Show us,” the second man said. We walked back into the house and tried not to look at the gore too much. We got Anna’s dad’s room and showed them the plaque. They looked at the words carefully.
“Collateral, huh?” the first man said. “Collateral for what?”
“We’re thinking he has my partner, Anna. She’s been missing for a little while now. We don’t know where she is,” I said.
“We definitely need to call the locals. We need all the help we can get.” The second man pulled out his phone and dialed 911. He told the operator about him being an FBI agent and needing back up. He asked for the address, I gave it to him, and we waited for the police to arrive.

“Maybe we should go check on the horses,” John said. “We don’t know how long these people have been dead. They might be needing food and whatnot.” We all agreed and walked back out into the cold. It might have been dark and freezing cold out, but it was a nice change to the disgusting sights inside the house. I loved the open field that lay between the house and the neighboring house. Although, it did remind me of the dream I had a couple days ago. 

As we walked further into the field, my heart began to beat faster. I found myself staring into the woods that surrounded the property. I can still hear that loud groaning sound from my dream. I know it was just a dream, but it still makes me nervous. We walked towards the barn quietly. Part of the thought maybe Stitch was waiting for me. The barn was like a typical horse barn. Red outside and stalls inside with open windows so the horses could get fresh air when they were inside. We opened the door. It squeaked loudly.

You could smell the stench of decay from 20 feet away from the barn. I doubt I was the only person who noticed it. All of the straw and hay on the ground of the barn was damp and stuck to the bottom of our shoes. It felt...gross...beneath my feet. I almost slipped a couple of times. The horses were in the back of the barn in the last three stalls. As we got closer, we noticed only 2 of them were alive and they were just skin and bone. You should see every bone in their body and their neighs sounded like they were in pain and scared and they could barely stand. Their legs were close to collapsing underneath them. As I checked them out, I noticed they had rope around their necks. Why would they have ropes around their necks?

When we found the horses, three more police men showed up.

“We were the closest officers to your location. We checked out the house and we called for more back up though,” one of the officers said, almost out of breathe.

“Oh my god... what is that smell?” another said. He put his hand over his nose and mouth.

“That's what we're here to find out,” I said.

I opened the stall where the third horse should have been. I wish I didn't. The only thing left in there was the scalp of the horse... It's whole mane and the horse tail was on the ground. The tail had a giant chunk of meat at the end, still connected, where someone ripped it off the horse. Next to these things on the ground...there were three of it's hooves.

“Jesus Christ! Where did the other hoof go?! Where did the body go?!” John yelled.

We all walked away from the stall and one of the FBI agents ordered another officer to take the two remaining horses out of the barn and take them to a veterinary clinic. As we opened the stall to one of the live horses, blood was everywhere. All over the horses feet, it's mouth and in its hair. We couldn't see any wounds or anything on him though.

Around the food trough, there were flies flying around it. I walked closer and my nose started to burn. There was a lot of meat in the trough. Some of the meat was still connected to bones. But... they didn't look like... human bones. They were much too long...much larger than human bones. The joints were different. The horses had been eating the third horse whose body we couldn't find. Who the fuck does this? I thought.

“Guys... I think I found the third horse...” I said, trying not to puke."
169dn9,0,2013-01-09,"Well my post didnt show up in samegrassbutgreener, and there is no one there anyways that would see it. So I will post my story here.",timeelostt,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/169dn9/well_my_post_didnt_show_up_in_samegrassbutgreener/,"Where to start? A bit of background on myself? No job, no money, no friends. mid 20's, Adhd, depression, anxiety, introvert. Living at home with mother and 2 sisters, its filled with garbage and junk, all counters and tables have no open space. Even the stove top is a place to store coupons, newspaper, and magazines the neighbors were throwing out. Even dirty paper plates get set next to the garbage instead of being put into the garbage. My mother works 3 jobs, and takes care of my eldest handicap sister. The other sister who lives here doesn't do anything to help keep the house nice, but adds to the mess since she picked up my mothers hording habits. The kitchen sink has a pile stacked higher then the faucet of dishes that wont get cleaned till probably next week. I do my part by cleaning the dishes and utensils I use right away. If I need to strain the water from my noodles, sometimes it requires me to use the upstairs bathroom sink.

I sit in my room(because it's clean) from when I wake till I fall asleep, talking to my family as minimal as possible. I would go hangout with the few remaining ""friends"" that I have that my parents are constantly telling me to hangout with, but that requires money for gas since only one of my ""friends"" are local. Invite them here? No one wants to visit this house, have you looked at it recently? I do have a few xbox friends, and I game with my cousin too, but they are only on at night. And since I am the only one in this house that sleeps with their door closed, I get upset calls and texts for me to stop playing because I am too loud. Are their xbox mics that allow you to whisper in them?
""What about a job Timeelostt?"" Well I used to have a job I enjoyed. But when I come home from basically working out for 6-8 hours, tired and stressed, I didn't enjoy having to clean the stove stop, finding the cleanest pot to clean, make food in a kitchen that has the stench of rotting food, week old bacon and pork grease, and a cup or two of milk that has been sitting out for a day or two. Well that didn't continue on for too long. With it being a challenge to make myself breakfast or dinner, I ended up eating once a day at work. Jimmy Johns, Subway, the hot food at Pick n' Save, or Piggly Wiggly, fast food is way too expensive. Now that I don't have a job, I have no money to go out and buy food, so I continue to eat as little as possible. Typically a frozen pizza at night, finish it the next day, the next night repeat.

""Didn't you try to save money and move out?"" Of course I tried. My job was a lot of work, and little pay. So when you have an income of $1000 a month, and $240-$260 goes to gas to work and friends, $240-$280 goes to fast food and restaurants, another $240 goes to cannabis. That's about 3/4 my paycheck. Then with Netflix, Xbl, a video game here and there, maybe a case of beer, and a hobby. That isn't much left to save. I even found someone to get an apartment with. That would of given me a clean place to live, where I could cook my own meals, and lunch for work. I would of lived close to work and friends to cut way back on buying gas. I sold my iMac for less then it was worth to get the money for the down payment. But with little income, you are required to get a co-signer. Who could cosign for me? My parents? Nope, they refused. With no co-signer, that apartment was quickly taken, and my apartment buddy disliked the other apartments in the area. By the time he finally did find one he liked, I was out of a job, and out of any chance of moving out.

""What if you stopped smoking /r/trees[1] ?"" Well this message would have never been written, I would have killed myself by now if I couldn't smoke. My family and friends of past pushed alcohol on me. That lead to severe depression, self cuts and burns. The only reason I smoked cannabis, after being told my whole life by friends and family how bad it is for me and that it's just as bad as coke and heroin, is because I planned on killing myself. I had it planned and all thought out, and was ready to off myself. Would it matter if I looked like a coke head if I was dead? Not to me. So I talked to some sketch people, got jipped a few times, then lucked out on some nice herb. That week I was a different person, I was happy, motivated, no anxiety, my finger nails grew past my finger tips! (first time since I was a child). Cannabis is what motivated me to getting that last job. That job got me a nice tan working outside, some buff arms, a muscular back, and then I found a great girlfriend. I have never been close to my parents, because of my poor relationship with my parents, I have always had trouble and really disliked talking to past gf's parents, or even any of my friends parents. But I connected with my last girlfriends parents. Tho I was in my 20's, it was fantastic to have a father figure, and a mother I could talk to. And their house!!! It was SO CLEAN! It was the prime of my life, I was motivated to get a place with the gf and my buddy, to lead a life with love and friends, my life was looking bright and I couldn't ask for anything better
But as time continued, having to live in this house continued to take its toll on my mental health. I started going into work late, then a day off here and there. Some days I just couldn't handle my depression. I went from seeing my gf from our usual twice a week, to not being able afford gas to see her that week. She eventually left me, and I can understand why.

""You haven't said anything about your father yet."" My parents divorced when I was 8. I could care less about my father. I could write 10,000 words on how pathetic he is. He is an active member of his church and hold a high rank in his Knights of Columbus club. He has canceled family vacations because he didn't want to have to bring his handicap daughter along. He finds excuses and reason for why he cannot come and help her if no one else can. Before any of his children turned 18, one by one he emptied our savings accounts into his pockets. I had to split live with both parents, and couldn't move out of my fathers till I was 18(court order). Once I turned 18 I was out of there because he was always putting me down for being a ""low grade"" student, and the control he needed to have on his children's life's. But I still talked to him here and there, he has a nice income, and my mother drowned herself in debt, and she is still sinking lower in it. If my car broke down, only person who I could ask for money was my father. After I lost my job I broke down in front of him, with tears pouring out of my eyes, I cried to him about how harsh my life has been, like being a target kid to be picked on and harassed all through grade school and high school, in and out of school. I cried to him how I wanted to end my life. He only sat there for a few minutes before he decided to leave, so we could talk ""when I was calmed down."" The next time I talked to him I realized he could care less. I asked him why he doesn't care, and with a few seconds of thinking, the exact first words out of his mouth were ""Well you don't ever come up to my house and help with chores.""
So with no support from either parent, no motivation for myself, no reason to take care of myself and my body, never a reason to leave the house, no cannabis to settle the stress, and my birthday a week away. If this is the life I will have to continue living, I can honestly say I don't want to make it to my birthday. An xbox friend has been saying that in 4-6 months I could move south west by him, he could get me a job working for him, and he could fit me into his apartment. It wouldn't be ideal for me, but it would be a step out of this house. But having to wait such a long time, if I don't make it to my b-day, how will I make it 4-6 months?

Well I guess I should get on with what I am looking for in life, and I guess what I am looking for is a lot. Since cannabis is the only medication that works for me(yes I have tried anti-depressant pills, keep them the fuck away from me please), I would love to live in a state where I could get my medication, I have looked a bunch into finding a way to move to Washington and would be a dream come true if I could live there, but living in any state with medical cannabis would be amazing. If I could also find a job or internship blowing glass, then I would be the happiest kid in town. I'm not into glass blowing because of marijuana, I have had an interest in glass blowing for a long time. Making something out of a lump of molten glass if fascinating to me, not just glass pipes, but any type of glass art, putting my imagination into a form. ""Degenerate Art"" was one of the coolest videos I have ever seen. Jackpot if I managed to find myself working in a dispensary. But I don't need the perfect job to be happy. I need a new place to live, surrounded by positive people, people I could call friends. It would be nice to have someone one to talk to, to have some social interaction.

But this all just a dream of hopes and wishes.
What else to say? It's a bit of a rant, I cut out a few parts, reddit doesn't need to know how pathetic I am. But thank you for who ever took the time to read this."

I was hired into a healthcare environment as a help desk intern. I was told to monitor the help desk and fix basic windows issue, reset passwords, etc. Right after I was hired in, the two network admins quit, they hired one new one, but there were alot of duties not being done so I decided to get my feet wet. I handled enterprise backups, server installation, learned a bit about networking, a bit about sql, basically your general ""wear alot of hats"" IT work. This went on for nearly 2 years.

Also after I was hired the company got a new IT manager. When I was hired the company had the head of accounting working as an interim IT director, but for obvious reasons that wasn't working out. 

Last year saw a huge software implementation. I configured and installed more than half of the new hardware (despite this being the assigned job of one of the admins). Worked tons of overtime. Helped deploy the new servers, and incorporated the new backup systems for the new hardware. 

I should mention at that right after I was hired there was a 1 year pay freeze. I was hired at intern pay of $10 an hour. As of last year, after picking up tons of responsibility and 2 years with the company I had still had no raise. I brought this up multiple times to my manager, and she said we would address it after the software implementation. So I worked hard during the lead up to go live, worked a couple 90 hour weeks during go live, and have been on call about three weeks out of the month for the last year.

I finally got our meeting for the employee evaluation scheduled. went to it. And (drumroll please) $0.10 an hour raise. My world pretty much exploded. Between the huge blow that was and the stress the previous year had brought, I had developed some health problems, actually was rushed into surgery one day after nearly collapsing.

I'm back from my surgery now and have had plenty of recovery time to think about my situation. Basically I've been spending all this time working hard and getting practical experience at the cost of academic experience. I had to drop out of school to accomodate all the overtime and on call that I take around here. What I want to know is, Where do I go from here? I can barely afford to live on what I make currently, but theres alot of people in the IT job market right now and I feel like I have no skills that look pretty on a resume. Are there any quick certifications I can get, or am I not looking for a job correctly? Any advise would be great.

**tl;dr after two years and sacrificing school for a company, I have no degree, not sure what marketable skills I posess, and could make more money working at walmart. What should I do?**

I'm a sophomore at a large school in Maryland and I'm looking for advice on what to do next. I live right next to DC for reference.

I'm pursuing International Studies at my school. I'd like to work for the State Department or even become a diplomat someday. How do I get there from here? I'm planning on taking numerous language courses as well as studying abroad for a semester or two.

What should I do this summer? I tried applying for an internship at the State Department but I haven't heard yet from them (I'm assuming this means I didn't make the cut). If I can't find anything useful to intern for, I'm just going to continue at my menial job I work at on breaks, which doesn't add anything to my resume, but does bring me closer to paying off my college debt early.

If you don't think working for the State Department is realistic/a good idea, what would you guys recommend I pursue?

Thank you so much guys for your help!"

**TL;DR = I hate my role as the 1 man IT department and feel I'm overworked, and none of my pleas for help (people or tech) go answered for over a year.  I'm burnt out and my new 'manager' knows nothing about tech, or IT/support roles, and is doubting I do anything because there are still some open tickets for ongoing projects.  Do I rage quit? or bite down and play nice and 'man up'?**

And the full rant... 

I'm so pissed right now and my apologies if that comes out here.  I'm going to try and lay this out here in a way avoiding ID of me or my current employer.

I am the Network and Systems Admin for the company in title but in practice I am the one man IT department.  When I took the job, I knew I was getting into that role and with the size of the company it was quite manageable.  The company has now doubled, if not nearly trippled in size (including merging with another small company) and now spreads over MULTIPLE offices around the midwest US, and overseas sales staff that are operating on all time zones pretty much.

I am on-call 24/7.  Literally.  I am the only one and they all have my direct cell and while I accept 'mission critical' calls are par for the course, I get the ""my printer is beeping at me"" calls at 3:20 am just the same.

I manage everything from reloading printer paper at the office I am based in, to troubleshooting phone lines, over the phone, with people who don't know the difference between a busy tone and a dialtone, across the country.  I also manage the Cisco and HP network devices, and am expected to administer multiple Linux boxes running KVM, with multiple (too many sometimes) KMV guests.  

I am expected to document everything.  I do not feel shocked at that expectation as it's good practice for everything IT, but... I am expected to document everything I do, as I do it (get to that in a second), as well as retro actively document the 5+ years of things they've set up before I was even hired!  I am also expected to document it in such a way that ""anyone in the company can open a PDF and do what you do.""  Basically a how-to for everything, up to and including (this was a real request), configuring a Cisco ASA firewall... written for someone who doesn't even know how to ssh or what a firewall is.  Back to the ""at the time you do it"" rule.  I am often doing MULTIPLE tasks at once and rarely ever get more than 15 minutes straight without someone dragging me into another discussion that probably shouldn't even involve me, but hey, it involves a computer or a file so... IT right?  I rarely get the time to go back and close out the ticket I just completed work on, before I am dragged away to another thing... and I rarely get the chance to open, fill out, and then close a ticket, for many of the things (most things) when people just walk up to my desk (the front of the whole office so everyone can get to me instantly), give me a problem, and need a resolution right then and there.

On that... I'm at the front of the office.  For fuck's sake.  The UPS guy has ME sign for everything and asks me if we have shit to pick up.  Fedex too.  Postoffice dude comes in, drops mail on my desk, goes out.  I'm closer to the front door than the people who answer the phones, deal with mail, and UPS/FedEx.  This not an issue for anyone it seems.

I have been with the company over a year now, as the only IT person.  The only assistance offered is whatever lowly 'intern' they have hired to help with 'random office things' for that period of time.  For that persons time though, I have to queue up along with everyone else in the office who wants assistance answering phones or filing paper or scheduling meetings for them so they dont have to.  These people also NEVER have any IT skills, so all I can have them do if I get time with them is tell them to update a spread sheet with numbers (file sizes) they find on various network drives.  That's all.

I have personally installed 2 full racks in 2 locations for them with servers, NAS, network, VPN, spares, etc.  I am the only person with access to 1 of those which is 2 hours away from my home office, and no one else is willing to get access so that if anything ever happens, I  alone have to drive to the datacenter to flip a switch or console into a server when a dev turns eth0 off.

We also deal with media quite a bit, and we have multiple people who are geniuses with Adobe products.  I am tasked with managing all of the 'licenses' (very very grey area in some cases, if not just pirated), and the workstations they run on.  I am also tasked with keeping a 40TB Netapp from being full.  38TB they need to retain there ""just in case"".  So I am constantly copying 2TB off to external drives for off-site storage, and by the time I get it open for another project to fit on, they fill it back up and yell or open tickets ""NETAPP IS FULL!!! HORRIBLE DISASTER!! NO WORK CAN BE DONE!!!""  They refuse to buy more disk space for the netapp, or alternate large storage solutions for quicker offload of data.

Now, they have decided that I am using my time inefficiently, which I totally agree with.  I have no idea how to 'effeciently' keep up with the level of demands placed on me.  Their solution however is not to bring it another IT skilled person to balance the loads and work beside me, but to assign the office manager to be my boss because ""she's good at schedule everyone's time"".  ie: she makes the meeting calendar.

I have a ticketing system.  No one opened a ticket for the first 4 months it was up and running.  No one.  Everyone called me directly and no matter what I did they didn't get it.  Not until I had to tell the CEO to open a ticket 5 times in a call did he get the message and then make a note about it for everyone.  He still never opens tickets but that's what it is, he's the main man.  Now I get tickets for ""My mouse needs cleaning"", or ""Our site is giving php error code... ""  I am expected to clean mice balls, and replace mousepads, or hand them out.  I am expected also to apparently PROVE that a PHP error code in our products is NOT the fault of the Linux server it's running on, before I am allowed to have a dev look into it.  

Just tonight, sitting here installing a VM for our Oracle guy because he'd rather have a ""clean slate"" than upgrade his current VM's oracle with a patch... I have gotten an email telling me that I have failed to close all of my completed tickets in the past few weeks, and there is now reason to suspect I have spent 3 weeks doing nothing.

3 weeks, of a one man IT shop, doing nothing... the place would be burned down.  But, there's reason to doubt that I've been doing anything?  Really.

I emailed the CTO, my direct boss, who's been avoiding being ANYTHING of a manager to me for my entire time with the company up to the past few weeks, and who had repeatedly shot down requests for a) more IT help, b) more storage options, c) developers to look at site errors instead of me, d) meetings to keep us both on the same path with IT needs... I told him I need to know if HE personally has any reason to doubt my abilities and efforts, and if so HE needs to tell me, not this office manager (in an email she CC'd to him, the president, and the CEO, none of which have mentioned any concerns to me directly).

Oh and fucking vacation time.  I haven't had a vacation since I started. They have a ""strict, not strict"" vacation policy.  ""as long as work gets done when it needs to get done, take whatever vacation you need"".  There is no written policy.  No accumulated days.  No anything.  People just say ""I'm out from now til then.""  However, I am IT.  We are a tech company.  I am always on call.  There is always something relating to some type of technology that needs to be looked at.  The only 'vacations' I have gotten, is the drive time across the midwest to go from office to office now and then to work at differnet places for a week at a time.  Seriously, they consider that vacation, or 'personal time'.

I am fucking tired of this.  I'm tired.  I'm just fucking beat down by all of it.  I think most of the people in this company are fucking awesome and great at what they do, the other 1/3rd are all college friends that came along with the CEO when he made the place so they're untouchable and I'm just tired of getting slammed with multiple offices, remote users, everything from piddly shit to being the 1 person on high fucking alert during Sandy's landfall.  I'm just fucking tired.  I'm not personally invested in the company like my superiors are, and not guaranteed anything if they do sell, or we strike fucking industry gold or anything.  I'm just getting my paycheck (about 80k) and that's it.


I want to quit.  I want to clean out my fucking personal shit tonight, drive home, and fucking email them a ""good luck with that shit"" letter in the morning and never go back.  Okay, maybe hand them a formally typed letter and say ""sorry, it's just not working out."" in the morning and then go home, but what the fuck ever.  

Now, I ask you guys, from what I rambled here, does it sound like 1 IT person should be handling this kind of load on their own?  Does it sound like I'm just ""not realizing my true potential""?   Should I bit the fucking bullet and nod and play nice and wait for .. what?

I am already taking phone interviews, and look to get more when I bump my resumes.  Meant to do that this week actually but I have had to do lots of last minute ""we forgot to do this, could you look at it..."" shit for the DBA's and Dev's.  I am also at this point willing to work outside IT if it comes to that again.

I am just looking for someone to tell me that they've been here, done that, and it's not as bad as I think it is.  Or tell me what you've done to unravel situations like this in your past.  If no one can, then I'm probably in my last 12 hours of being part of this company.  And in that case, how do I deal with this going forward, eg resume?  Whats the best way to walk the fuck out (not staying for an awkward 2 weeks, fuck no)... and not cause it to bite me in the ass on my next interview?

**TL;DR = I hate my role as the 1 man IT department and feel I'm overworked, and none of my pleas for help (people or tech) go answered for over a year.  I'm burnt out and my new 'manager' knows nothing about tech, or IT/support roles, and is doubting I do anything because there are still some open tickets for ongoing projects.  Do I rage quit? or bite down and play nice and 'man up'?**"
168ccx,9,2013-01-08,How should I properly set myself up for future jobs?,ragnvaldr2,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/168ccx/how_should_i_properly_set_myself_up_for_future/,"I'll give the TL;DR first, because I'm afraid I'll let the full story get too long.  
**TL;DR:**  
* 22, No college degree, getting married in 3 months   
* No previous experience  
* Self taught--and it shows...poorly  
* My job isn't giving me useful experience, and I doubt ever will ever will  
* Would really like to get into software engineering, but am very lost and directionless  

Background: I'm 22, and live in southern California. I took enough community college to transfer to a UC/CSU, but never actually did so.   Instead, I took a full-time job offer at a company I was working at part-time. I'm also about to be married in 3 months, and both my fiancee and I make $30k, pre-tax, which is barely enough to scrape by where we are.  
  

The company I work for is a mostly family run, non-profit, movie review business. And I might add, it's a **very** poorly run company, and with the possible exception of my immediate boss, I'm the most qualified to do their IT--which is scary. A total of about 12 people in the office, plus another 6-12 in different areas. I was originally hired to do data entry, learn how to use their production printer, and generally just be smart enough to fix things and solve problems. I've grown up with computers, and have a number of years learning and fixing things, but didn't start getting a deep understand until fairly recently--still don't have near as deep of an understanding as I'd like.

  
When I was given the full-time offer, they made promises of teaching me programming and having me **just**  be a programmer that didn't quite end up as planned.  

That was a year ago, and I still only know enough HTML and CSS to get by, and a bit of javascript, and I'm still little more than the office grunt doing little jobs that everyone else can't be troubled to do. Every now and then I'll have to set up some new little website in rackspace and stick a WP theme on it (and try to customize it a little,) but that's hardly something I can put on a resume.  
Just today I was asked to make a ""piss simple"" app for them that basically just is a news feed of all our website's content (new articles, reviews, etc,) using something like Titanium, since it's JS, and though I feel like that's getting closer to what I'd like to do, I feel like it's not something I realistically *can* do yet.

I try to fit in some time to learn more, but there's not enough time to focus on it. Mostly codecademy (almost finished all the JS courses) and some Lynda.com. At home, on the side, I'm starting to go through C++ Primer.

What I'd really like to get into is software, I think mobile in particular. ...But I have no experience. And no one to teach me. And while I know there are unlimited resources online to teach myself, I feel like I'll be missing out on a lot not having someone guiding my curriculum or being able to explain certain things that I'd otherwise miss. 

So I think what I'd most like is to find a job where I can start out low (preferably making at least what I am now...) but somewhere where I have someone to teach me as I go. Or even a mythical paid internship would be great. 

I've looked at colleges, but the local school, CSUCI, doesn't have a night/online CS program, and I couldn't find a decent looking and affordable program anywhere online either.  
I'm also open to moving--my fiancee is at a job she'd like to leave as well, and we're both up for moving around a little for work if need be.

I'm sorry if this is the same old story you guys hear in here, and I'm sorry for the horribly long post, but any advice would do wonders for this desperate man. I feel like if I don't do something soon, I'll be paying for it dearly in the long term."
168a1n,4,2013-01-08,"Need advice figuring out how to get anywhere in video games. Suddenly don't know what I want anymore. (long post, contains tl;dr)",arcturin,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/168a1n/need_advice_figuring_out_how_to_get_anywhere_in/,"TL;DR: Moved to LA 1.5 years ago to get into video game audio. After a job at Starbucks and another for a film composer, I haven't gotten anywhere in video games. Don't know what to do anymore, because all my effort seems wasted.

Ever since I thought about what job I'd like to be doing for the rest of my life, I've been sure I'd want it to be in video games. I first got the idea in my first year of college - completed a double major at Berklee College of Music, and graduated August 2011, ahead of schedule. I love writing music and working with sound. It is my passion, and the only other thing that I have the same love for is video games. So, after connecting the dots, I started studying video game sound design.

After college, I moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in video game audio. After two unpaid internships, a lot of effort, and a few small paid projects providing music and sound for video games, I ended up working at a Starbucks to make ends meet. This went for six months, and I was left with little time to pursue my passions and started wondering what I was doing with my life. In late October, I got an email about a major film composer looking for a new assistant. I applied for it, and after a few emails, an interview, and less than 24 hours, I had been hired. I was so happy I cried. I don't think I've ever done that before.

Very quickly, I began to learn that the life of a composer's assistant is not one I want to lead. Constant 10-16 hour days left me exhausted, and I felt like the work was taking its toll on my soul - I didn't emotionally connect with any of it. I started making mistakes. Nothing major, just occasionally forgetting one thing or another. But it was still more than enough to annoy my boss to the point of firing me right before I flew home for Christmas. I had a bit of a mental breakdown the night beforehand (the job was really getting to me in a number of ways), so losing my job didn't unnerve me too much.

The entire time I've been in LA, even during my time as a composer's assistant, I've wanted to music and sound for video games. I got the opportunity to attend GDC 2012, I met/interviewed people from Activision, Infinity Ward, Riot Games and more, I've happily stayed current with what video games are hot (indie and AAA alike), and so on. After everything I've done, I've felt like I haven't gotten anywhere towards getting hired fulltime to work on video games. What's more, I don't feel particularly driven to do sound design in my free time, because I have nothing to design sound for. That's made me doubt if I have any place in the industry at all.

At any rate, I need a job very soon, and I no longer feel like LA is a good place to be for getting into video games. Today, I was looking at an application for Trader Joe's and, being disgusted with myself, tossed it aside. I feel like all my time since college has been a waste. I don't know what to do, other than continue creating random pieces of work and hoping that someone likes what I've done. I've been heavily considering applying for jobs at small, indie studios in San Francisco and Boston, but I am thoroughly dissatisfied with my work portfolio, and don't want to apply anywhere until I'm sure I can impress someone with something I've done (don't even have the money to move anyway).

I just want to work in the video game industry, and hopefully make enough to pay rent. I want to get involved in the community, assist in the design process, write character backstories, schedule progress milestones, maybe even provide music - I want to contribute in some way to something I'm passionate about in an industry with people I identify with. It doesn't have to be in audio, but audio is what I'm best at. Am I being naive? What on earth could I do competently enough so that my work is considered helpful, necessary, and excellent? I'm a member of the LA IGDA chapter, I've been on GANG and Gamasutra constantly, I've submitted so many applications to video game companies, I've networked my ass off, I've done sound design and music for video games, and I'm still at square one, because my work is mediocre and my effort seems wasted. If someone told me to do three different pieces of background music, twenty sound effects, and an essay to be considered for a job at a video game company, I would be happy to. But I've never felt so unwanted in an industry before - it seems like nobody will even give me a chance. I am now confused and desperate, and don't know where to focus my effort."
16c9og,4,2013-01-10,CS Career Paths,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/16c9og/cs_career_paths/,"Hi reddit,

I'm currently a junior CS student at the University of Idaho, and working as a software engineering intern for Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories. My manager has asked for a write up and what direction I want to start pursuing for my career. The problem is, I have no idea. I have experience in several languages, and love designing software (not just programming). I've talked with my academic advisor, but he unfortunately could only tell me that it's too early to go down any one path, and I personally also feel I have too little industry experience to even know what all the available paths are.

Currently I think there are a few things I don't want to do: I'm not the biggest of fan of worrying about low level programming (I prefer high level abstractions, and I love studying different programming paradigms), so I don't think I want to to systems engineering or anything embedded.

My interest is currently piqued by release engineering. I am a major fan of source control, especially huge scale systems like GitHub. Continuous Integration I also think is a super neat concept.

I'm currently possibly being tasked with Jenkins plugin development, which would give me a lot of experience with Java and build systems.

I'm excited, but apprehensive, as RE seems like it can be very dirty, possibly unappreciated work, where if something breaks it falls on you to fix it ASAP (which is something I really didn't like as a system administrator with a small company I used to work for). I like my days 9-5 without a whole lot of work pressure during my off hours. Also, RE seems like a pretty set path that's difficult to hop out off.

I'm looking for advice, what would you do in my situation, and where would you look to learn more about what all I could go into?

Thanks reddit!"

[What happened between you and Jenna? I understand she left to run the YouTube videos, which was always her goal, but why does the animosity/bad blood exist between you, as shown by some of your blogs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/169yz5/i_am_dave_portnoy_owner_and_founder_of/c7u2vzo?context=5)|This one would take forever to reply.  Should have written it first because I obviously knew it was coming.  Truth is Jenna and I didn't have problems for 99% of the time she was here.  When I hired her she cried she was so happy. She was working in a tanning salon.  I told her I wanted to make her into a personality.  Hence ""Getting Weird with Jenna"" videos and shit.  Turned out she could write too.  Gave her Stoolala.   She'd do anything we ever asked.  The second and I mean the second her first video hit she got weird.  She'd come into my office once a week and say I was exploiting her because I wanted to make money off her.  I told her that's why I hired her.  She'd refuse to meet with advertisers who wanted to advertise.  She tried to charge me 10K to appear in Quirk ad when I was paying her 50K a year as an employee.  Still we got along because I thought she was just nuts.   She hated blogging which she openly admits.  She basically stopped working for me.  Money was tight and I told her that as long as I could keep the lights on she'd have a job with us but if things got too tight she'd be the first to get the axe.   I suggested she sell tshirts with her face on them and I'd front the money and she could keep all the profits beyond her salary.   Long story short is once she thought she may be done at Barstool she went beserk making videos and doing all the things I'd always asked her to do.  Despite all that I still would have left on good terms if it weren't for the last blog she wrote saying her succcess had nothing to do with Barstool and spitting in my face basically.  This was despite us having a 2 hour heart to heart the day before.  She talked about how she was getting fired and didn't know when Stoolala would be shut down.  I offered to give her the site no strings attached.  Just give it to her.  Bottomline is I thought she painted me out to be a douchebag when all I did was help her.   Now when people ask her how she got her start she says she was just making videos in a tanning salon.  It's infuriating.   It has nothing to do with money.  She emailed me six months ago and apologized and I pretty much told her to go fuck herself.
[You joke about being worth ""internet dollars"" but in all seriousness has barstool had any offers to be bought by a larger company? Have you figured out a way besides advertising to monetize the sites popularity long-term? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/169yz5/i_am_dave_portnoy_owner_and_founder_of/c7u2xyu?context=5)|We have not had anything that I'd have legit.  Always content comes up.  Will we tone down what we do.  I always say we won't.   I'd rather figure out how to make money ourselves than change our tone.   We are one of the last blogs of our size that has stayed true to what we do.   I think that scares a ton of advertisors, investors aways.  It's also why Stoolies like us I think.

Smokesmash blew up.  We needed somebody to run it.  We tried to put Feits and Devlin there.  They both sucked.  That's how Kmarko ended up there.   Little known fact about Big Cat.

It's not over yet so we can't really talk too much about it.   I am suing 2 people over blackout shit.  We're getting sued by 2 people.
[Why do you think Barstool and similar sites get a lot of hate from feminist groups for promoting rape culture, sexism, etc., but when someone like Chelsea Handler can make jokes about men from the other side,  it's somehow okay because she's a woman? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/169yz5/i_am_dave_portnoy_owner_and_founder_of/c7u2y13?context=5)|Yes.

(Of the main writers, e.g. KFC, Mo\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/169yz5/i_am_dave_portnoy_owner_and_founder_of/c7u30gy?context=5)|Profits shirts, ads, blackout.   Big on Blackout.   Writers 60ish.
[What do you think of “rape culture”, a term that seems to have originated specifically from critics of Barstool? I imagine you wouldn’t deny charges of your website being misogynistic in tone, but do you feel the accusation that your website actually subconsciously or explicitly condones rape to be fair on any level? When you hear that specific term, what is your reaction? Does it piss you off? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/169yz5/i_am_dave_portnoy_owner_and_founder_of/c7u34wt?context=5)|I don't think it is fair on any level whatsoever.   ZERO.

With all the shit you spew on Barstool regarding how you'd love to bang other smokes or how many women you'd take down if you were single (which in 99% of the cases, wouldn't happen;  but that's neither here nor there\), is your wife able to always distinguish and separate the blog from real life? I can imagine there are a lot of ""David we're married now..please tone it down with your obsession of Sophie Turner and her huge dump-shoot"" moments. Does your stuff ever lead to blow-ups at home?  Keep doing it man...your stuff is epic.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/169yz5/i_am_dave_portnoy_owner_and_founder_of/c7u34wg?context=5)|Yes.  The only time she's ever gotten mad at me was back in the Power Hour days with Mcshay and Elio on 1510 the Zone.

I've got a bachelor's degree under my belt already, and I'm doing a 2 year addition at my alma mater to get a second degree in CS. 

From what I've hear from friends and relatives and found online, its really difficult to immigrate to California. Has anyone here done this who was originally from Canada?

What are my chances of landing an internship at a big company like Google, Amazon, or Msft down in the states before I graduate? I've got near a 4.0, and hopefully will have some local co-op experience before I get into my upper division classes. 

My goal for the future is to move to California. Even if the money wasn't better there, I would still want to go. I don't mind Vancouver, but I've been to Cali and I fell in love with the weather and the cities there. Washington would be okay too.

I'm hoping to hear some success stories, but I wouldn't mind knowing about some of the pitfalls as well."

I'm studying computer science at college and I'm going to start applying for internships for this summer soon - specifically, it's always been a dream of mine to work at Blizzard and I plan to seriously apply there. I read all over the place (and have heard from employers first-hand) that it is a HUGE plus to have code that they can look at, presumably in the form of an open source project or contributions to an open source project. In my case, I'm nearing completion of an XNA platformer in C#, and could hypothetically make my github project public so that they could view the code. However, my game isn't architecturally very profound (because I've been focusing more on the design side of the game) and I'm worried that they would look at it and scoff at its lack of professional game-development techniques, or have a hard time understanding it's layout or why I made the decisions I did.

So my question is this: what exactly are companies looking for in ""sample code""? What are the risks of showing a company your code? Are they really looking for smart engineering decisions, or is it more of just a screening?

On the one hand, I want to show off the fact that I can make a game and know to code, but the other hand I'm scared to show off any inadequencies that I may have. If anyone could give me some advice on how to approach this, whether from personal experience or what they've read, it would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!

I'm hoping I can get a few questions answered. I'm in my final semester of school, about to graduate with a CS degree. Obviously, I would like to get a good job, and have a number of things going for me. I'll be graduating with a 3.8+ GPA and have internship experience. However, I feel like this isn't enough. I have worked on large projects for class, but I haven't really done any projects on my own outside of class. How much will this impact me?

Also, I'm pretty apprehensive about technical interviews in general. I do well in school, but a large part of that is because of my study habits and whatnot. As previously mentioned, I don't do a ton of work outside of class so I need to refresh myself on some things. So really any advice for preparing for technical interviews is appreciated.

Finally, I have a question regarding my interests in CS. I'm really interested in both linguistics and artificial intelligence. I've enjoyed most of my other classes, but these were the ones that I was really passionate about. I may be wrong, but it seems like it would be more difficult to find a job in those fields. Also, would I need a graduate degree in order to really work in those areas?

16dv9t,9,2013-01-11,Senior in college; not sure where to go from here.,throwaway44811,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/16dv9t/senior_in_college_not_sure_where_to_go_from_here/,"I'm currently a senior majoring in Information Security, graduating in December. I've had a few internships since getting out of high school. The most recent was developing some test scripts for a large internal application (using QTP). I have also worked with a company, before leaving them after about a month, partially because my coursework was pretty heavy going into the fall semester. They were building a web application using ExtJS and Java. I had done all the necessary training and was starting to work on an actual feature, but of course decided to quit. Before that, I had a work-study where I created educational 3d worlds/helped manage servers and labs, classrooms. The first internship was basically scanning/importing maps and drawing the walls for a Cisco WCS, along with helping image systems, and moving machines around.

My programming classes have been in Java, and I feel reasonably comfortable reading javadoc, and java in general. Did a simple android app last semester, and studied android security for that upper level security class. I have also done some linux kernel programming in C, and while I understood that class well, I had a partner to get help with the actual programming.

At home, I have an ESXi server as well as a pfsense firewall. Mainly have a file server and a minecraft server running off of it.


I'm not sure what direction I should take. I feel like I don't have enough programming experience, and my grade in the upper level security class wasn't great either. I am planning to learn Python this j-term. When reading around reddit, the usual response it to find an open source project and contribute to it. I would indeed like to do that, but never know where to start. 

Finally, I'm not sure if I should go to Grad School. What should I be asking myself about this?

Thanks!"

I am currently on my second internship with a company. I have been with them since the beginning of last summer so about 8 months. It was a summer internship which turned into part time when I went back to school.

The thing is that Im not really happy working here. It has nothing to do with the people but just with the type of work Im doing. I don't find it challenging and its very boring for me. Its a manufacturing position which turned into working with quality department.I go in and the only thing I think about is leaving that place. The last internship I had I absolutely loved and I left it to try a new company. 

Saying that I dont see myself working full time with this company when I graduate. I do all my work and I am told that I do great work but Im pretty much there in order to get some extra cash while Im at a school. I could go my last semester without the extra cash though. 

So what are your suggestions? Should I quit? I dont have any other jobs lined up when I graduate so Im just kinda worried that if I quit I wont find anything. I general Im just unsure what the future will hold for me. I guess this is normal. So what advice would you guys have for me in my particular situation."
16cqvu,11,2013-01-10,Looking for resume advice for internships given my situation as an older CS transfer student with little experience.,KagedFC,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/16cqvu/looking_for_resume_advice_for_internships_given/,"I'm 25, and I transferred to my current school about a year ago (UC Santa Cruz) from a community college as a non-CS major.  When I got here, I decided to switch to CS, and the switch added two additional quarters to the expected two years to graduate (two years plus two quarters total).  What this means is that I'm cramming a lot of complex concepts in a short period of time, and it seems like I have very little time to comfortably complete outside projects.  However I decided to begin working on a simple iPhone game with a few friends that we are hoping to release by the end of the school year in June.

Unlike a lot of younger CS students, I actually have a lot of other kinds of work experience under my belt.  I worked at Wells Fargo for a year, a recording studio for four years prior to moving to go to UCSC.  My questions are:

-Should I put on my resume the fact that I'm working on an iOS game, but that it's not yet submitted to the app store?

-Should I list the languages that I know given the fact that I have no previous work experience?

-Should I provide school projects or courses that are relevant to computer science?  For instance I wrote a simple compiler in C for a simple C-like language, an AI simulation of simple creatures on a three-dimensional plane, etc.  (I would put these on GitHub but they are assignments that other students could potentially search for...)

I won't have trouble filling the page, I just want to know what I should emphasize and what I shouldn't.  School takes up a huge portion of my time since I finished me GEs at community college, so the workload for me has been pretty intense.  Any guidance would be appreciated!

**TL;DR** Started after transferring to 4-year institution, little programming experience, spending most time cramming a lot of schoolwork rather than outside projects, what should I emphasize on resume for internships

[I have a good friend who is a VP at your firm . They blamed the entire Financial crisis on ' poor people who could not afford their mortgages ' they said this was pretty much he opinion among the investment banks .  How do you feel about what happened to Greece and Goldmans hand in it ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16eu5v/iama_goldman_sachs_investment_banker_amaa/c7vfvp7?context=5)|That is not true. Opinion is very much split within the investment banks and there is no right or wrong answer. I personally don't believe at all that the crisis was caused by 'poor people' - and I don't like that sort of categorization of people in the first place. There are perhaps 15/20 different institutions you could blame for the crisis, there's no way of isolating individuals.  I'm not sure what exactly you think GS's hand in the Greece affair was. Of course it's a sad story and I feel remorseful - I recently donated £50,000 at a charity ball to help rebuild one of the islands which has almost been burned to the ground. But ultimately Greece employed GS at the time because they wanted to fudge their finances  so as to meet entry requirements for the Euro i.e. the greek government was knowingly employing GS to help perform an extremely risky task - GS didn't force anything upon them. If the experiment explodes 10 years later (as it did), should GS really be the party to blame?

[I love seeing the ignorance that emerges in these AMA's relating to investment bankers. I am really interested in a career in either IB or Consulting, have a few questions for you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16eu5v/iama_goldman_sachs_investment_banker_amaa/c7vfba8?context=5)|Thank you to fletch below for answering this question.
[1\) How did you cope with the hours? I like working hard, I like working for my money but I also like enjoying free time and having a social life. When working a 100 hours as an analyst that would certainly have to suffer  2\)What were you academic results like through your degree?   I'm currently in my second year and will be realistically looking at 2.2, 2.2, 2.1 and 2.1 (years 1-4\). This summer I'd hope to get an accountancy internship in one of the big 4 followed by an internship next year in one of the large IBs. I know there's more to a candidate than solely their academic credentials + internship but would this stand me well for a BB in London? (Top Irish university, undergrad will be in Business and French\)  3\) What is it that makes you enjoy this job? I know the paycheck is certainly a bonus but you've said there's more to it than that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16eu5v/iama_goldman_sachs_investment_banker_amaa/c7vfba8?context=5)|Whatever your breakdown between modules is, you need a 2.1 overall. Even if your average is 60% or 61%, that's enough to get you past the minimum requirements and through to interviews. After that it's up to you - they'll take someone with a good business mind and strong communications skills irrespective of whether they average 60 or 78 or 92.  I disagree with him. My job is extremely rewarding and i wouldn't swap it for any other industry at the moment. If you want evidence of people enjoying their jobs look at the number of years they spend at their respective firms. Most of the partners at GS are 'home-grown' and have spent 20/30 years sweating away but don't regret it for a second. 
[Do you realize that in countries like Spain you're seen as an evil person that only wants to get profit and don't have any soul or feelings and probably kicks puppies for fun?

[In your view, are there any regulations that could meaningfully alter the moral hazard typified by the 2008-2009 bailout of the financial sector?  If so, what might they be?  And if not, to what extent does regulatory capture play a role?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16eu5v/iama_goldman_sachs_investment_banker_amaa/c7vdb1n?context=5)|Regulatory capture is a seriously problem not just in banking e.g. also in the energy business. How do you reduce it? It won't happen unless the public demand it, as everyone with power tends to benefit from it and so they won't make meaningful steps to change anything, i.e. its a win win situation for government and business. However it needs more than just 'occupy movements' but rather i am talking the mass voter population.
[Have you seen @gselevator on twitter? if so have you ever contributed/is it legit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16eu5v/iama_goldman_sachs_investment_banker_amaa/c7vd6ka?context=5)|Haha yes i have seen it and no its not legit, well at least i think its not.

Basic risk management theory - don't put all your eggs in one basket. If that 1 horse sized duck isn't exceptional, your business is going down the tubes.

[What do you do day to day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16eu5v/iama_goldman_sachs_investment_banker_amaa/c7vczco?context=5)|I work in the energy field in Europe but don't want to get too specific. Day to day we advise natural resource companies on all things financial such as m&amp;a and financing strategy and then execute on their behalf. So I am on the corporate finance side rather than sales and trading. However I work closely with the syndication and sales guys such as if we are executing an IPO or a follow-on share offering.

[Is it as cut throat as I have heard with the bottom 50% of people getting sacked each year to make way for new guys who will probably be sacked the year after?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16eu5v/iama_goldman_sachs_investment_banker_amaa/c7vfis2?context=5)|Bottom 5% is more accurate. 7-8% in a bad year, 3-4% in a good year. It's a fine line between 'cut throat' and having a 'healthy competitive atmosphere'. But we'd be out of business very quickly if we kept firing half of our staff every year...
[Is there any stock I should look into in 2013? Long term or short term.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16eu5v/iama_goldman_sachs_investment_banker_amaa/c7vdcf1?context=5)|Short term- African Barrick Gold. The chinese walked away and so the share price plunged and despite serious operational issues, the massive drop has presented a golden buying opportunity.
 |Long term- anything to avoid inflation, inflation scares the crap out of me and is going to be a big problem in the Uk and elsewhere in the future.
 |Also buy into soft commodity boom e.g. meat in africa, think zambeef etc if you can find an attractive entry point.

Depending on what area you are applying for, make sure you know some really good examples and stock pitches as it is amazing how many candidates lack knowledge e.g. if applying for ECM for god sakes know some of the recent IPO's  and likewise for equity research have good stock pitches and have conviction when presenting.

 |From the link you've provided, I find no.2 the most plausible explanation. But I would also add 6. UBS did something stupid again.
[As hardcore capitalists what is your feeling about (management of\) banks that seem to live under the impression that profits are for a happy few while losses should be carried by tax-payers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16eu5v/iama_goldman_sachs_investment_banker_amaa/c7vk5us?context=5)|That's not what I believe at all.
 |And by the way all of us are tax payers too. The top 5% contribute approx. 50% of the government's taxation revenue. So if losses are being 'carried by tax-payers' - that doesn't exclude people in the banking industry by any means.

I think some of our deals have been morally reprehensible in the past. The same goes for any major investment bank.

16fuet,1,2013-01-12,Phone call from potential employer was super confusing. ,throwawaythebelt,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/16fuet/phone_call_from_potential_employer_was_super/,"OK, yesterday at about 5 after 5 I get a phone call unexpectedly for a job I applied for about 10 days ago. The first thing the woman did was gush about my experience and how great my resume was. Then she took time to  pick my brain about various things I had done.  It was a great boost to my ego as up to this point I have had no luck since my graduation on December 8th. My only interview was for an unpaid internship that maybe they want to make a job and pay me for it, but they are not sure yet. That one was a real let down as the whole conversation both people took pages of notes on my ideas, but there was no promise of paid employment at the end. 


Well after she was done with that line of thinking, she went over the job and stated that normally the position pays low 30’s but considering my experience, they were willing to go as high as 38/39. She then said she knew this was not enough considering my background and experience   and she wanted to make sure I was aware of the compensation before I came in. Then she asked me about my plans and where I saw myself. I told her that I would finish my MBA while working full-time and hopefully get to a point in my career where I can be comfortable enough in my finances to help my two kids with college. 


Now, right here it got a little awkward as she started telling me that they wanted to make me a happy employee and they wanted to make sure I would stay at least a little while as they were investing in me with their training and such. She made sure to tell me there were not a lot of title changes at the office and that it may be difficult to climb the ladder there. She said that she wished she could fast-forward two years as they have some need for an MBA for some kind of other position and that would be just the right salary for me. 


We then closed with her telling me to take time to think it over and call her on Monday to set a time to meet if it seems agreeable. She thanked me and told me how great I was again and we hung up. 
The whole conversation had an awkward vibe to it. It is weird when someone offers you a position but then says there is no real mobility to it and then goes on at length about how great a candidate you are. I just do not know how to take that. The money is less than I would want as I wanted at least 45, but I do not want to turn it down and lose my chance. 
Last evening I added her on LinkedIn and thanked her as well as letting her know I would call to set a meeting to further discuss salary and such next week. I figured maybe they could come up to 45k.


The thing is I just got an email from another position I had applied for and then a follow-up email with a login for a Predictive Index® survey. THEREFORE, they were interested enough in me to do that. The pay on that position is a bunch more. I still have quite a few applications out there and I do not want to jump on this offer and then be thrown something better. 
I would feel like a douche if I take this job and then something better comes a week or two after and then I burn my bridges with them by leaving. 




What should I do?


What is the take on that whole phone conversation? 



Is the other company interested in me if they went ahead and sent out a Predictive Index® survey login?

16f04n,0,2013-01-11,Finally got an accnt and my first post is to ask y'all for help. I got fired today...here's my story...,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/16f04n/finally_got_an_accnt_and_my_first_post_is_to_ask/,"I'm a lurker too. Been a redditor for a little over a year now and ironically, just last night I upgraded to a ""pro"" account on the iPhone app to support reddit and thought today I would join. 

Go figure that my first post is a, well, downer post. I got fired from my first job. I know it sounds like an ever-day Joe Shmoe woe, but this one was particularly tough, I wanted to share it and get your guys’ help. If you don’t want to read the story, skip to the end – I totally understand, heh.

So here is my story and here is why I wanted to post it on Reddit.

My name is Justine. I'm 24 and I graduated in 2011 from Ringling College of Art and Design as part of their first digital filmmaking class. I don’t know if y’all know of Ringling, but it isn't cheap. I was frankly surprised my parents allowed me to go there, knowing I'd come out with over 70k in loans, but they had tremendous faith in me and my talent/passion for filmmaking. The four years I spent there were tough - I was new to film (having never touched a record button in my life) but I made it through. Bumps and bruises to be had, but I survived. But I managed and even snagged a few awards along the way.

Here was the hard part though. We were the first graduating class and that meant we were pretty much on our own – no alumni of the major, no real connections, nothing. So I had to get really creative and no small amount ambitious. The looming graduation brought to light two options that I had: either go back to suburban Pennsylvania and live with my folks, or find a way to get to Los Angeles and pursue my (yes it sounds cheesy) dream. Of COURSE I was doing the latter.

Another problem (as it is with a lot of recent grads) - I had no money. I knew that, my parents knew that, my friends even my teachers knew that. So after talking with some people I came up with the idea of posting an ad on Craigslist with the title ""will trade work for room and board"" - I thank my lucky stars for ""the Sams"" as I call them. A family of two (widower and his daughter) living in northern Los Angeles took me in and said I could stay with them until I found work in exchange for light cooking, cleaning and nanny-ing.

As many if not all of you know, job hunting isn't easy...especially in the entertainment industry. I got a part-time job at a retail store and took up working as a PA on more student films, did some free jobs and got one or two paying jobs. Despite that, it's hard being at home all the time - your head gets to you (mine in particular is ruthless). I fought really hard to get to LA but even that didn't prevent me for wanting to give up. My student loans had gone in to effect and my parents were paying them, but I knew that wasn't going to last long as they are close to retirement. If I didn't have a full time job by the summer (one year from when I moved out there) I was to go home and pretty much work as a waitress because I would be cornered by the loans/debt. Needless to say those were some of the darkest days of my life. The lack of being productive and independent made me feel like a failure. I got in to shit that was not good, drama that was way outta the realm of a reality TV show among other things. I'll spare you all the details.

I kept going, and finally got an internship in Feb 2012 (yes AFTER school). The internship was only $8 an hour but it was a hell of a lot better than nothing!! 

Three months of that and then I got my big break, or at least what I thought was my big break. A dear friend of mine suggested me for a position she was temping in at BIG Cable Network (i.e. premium channels) as an executive’s assistant. After lots of phone calls and an interview or two, I was hired. This was unusual because one, I didn’t have any agency experience and two, I was very nearly fresh out of college. But I had a bang-up resume and some wonderful references. It was a job I felt I was made for.

Little did I know, haha.

I don't now if many of you have ever worked for an executive in the film/entertainment industry but let me tell you. It's hard. Check out this website: http://hollywoodassistants.tumblr.com/ or watch ""The Devil Wears Prada"". Granted, my story as an executive assistant wasn't AS bad as Anne Hathaway's but my fear and paranoia was EXACTLY the same.

I worked my ass off, making a few mistakes, but I was just out of college and this was my first job. Everyone told me my boss knew that and mistakes happen so I should just keep working hard.

I would ask for feedback, talk to his previous assistant for advice, talk to OTHER assistants, I asked HR to find a class I could take on being the best assistant, I even tried to train myself on the particular department I worked for (as it wasn’t my forte). Shit hit the fan a few times (but nothing that was major, or so I had been told…this was my first job, so I needed other people’s insight), but I did everything in my power to fix it. I thought things had been going smoothly....he really hadn't indicated they weren't. And like I said, I was paranoid as shit so I double and triple checked things.

Then today, two days after he got back from a HUGE conference in Vegas that I organized down to a ""T""...he calls me in and there is HR.

Boom. Fired.

Dunno how I didn't fall to pieces in that meeting today, but I didn't. I calmly packed my things with the help of a coworker, sent a goodbye email and made it to the elevator where ALL my friends/coworkers had gathered to wait for me. The faucets turned on and I bawled.

I need your help. If you guys know of anything in Los Angeles, openings, websites, even advice ...please email respond or email me at sigyn.astira@gmail.com (or if any of y’all are interested, I have a website you can check out, just ask). I have one month's rent left before I'm looking at having to head back to PA.

And I really don't want to do that. So please…anything helps :-/"
16in7j,5,2013-01-13,"I can no longer afford college, 23 years old, seeking advice on what's best to do next...",[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/16in7j/i_can_no_longer_afford_college_23_years_old/,"I should have graduated May 2012, but I took time off when my mom passed away from cancer when I was 21. She was the reason why I was able to receive Pell Grants to go to school, as well. Now I can no longer get those grants. Dad is unable to pay. As Bursar charges have prevented me from enrolling in future classes, I'm left with the question of what to do next.

At 23, does it make sense to get a job, save up, and finish the remaining (~two) years I have left? Or would it make better practical sense to go ahead and try to pursue a career, despite not having finished? Further, is it possible to get a job that could benefit me later professionally while paying off school in the short-term? My degree focused on political/geopolitical affairs.

I was an active campus leader elected to run some of the largest organizations at my university (at a larger state school), and I also had many national opportunities to network (where various organizations would pay for my travel to many activist-related political/geopolitical events). I've also had 11 internships since the age of 16; ranging from every level of government (local to federal) as well as private-sector.
 
So what do you think: stay and work it off, or go out and try to join the workforce? That would probably entail me moving from the South to Washington, DC. 

Any tips you might have are much appreciated. "

A couple months ago my company announced it would be moving its HQ to the parent companies location--I declined the invitation to move with the company and am now looking to break into finance.

I'm very interested in AM, PE, and ER but given my non-relevant internships I feel I may be pigeon-holed into a corporate finance position. I'd greatly appreciate any career advice you guys could give me--specifically regarding if it is even possible for me to get into these types of positions given my background (non-target, low GPA - 3.1, non-relevant internships).

Would passing the first level of the CFA help me? What positions can I realistically shoot for? Should I try and get a job as a fund accountant or other non-finance entry level position and try to transition to an analyst from there?

Overall, I like working there and I feel like I'm doing a really good job. 


The only problem is that my boss is making work a nightmare. She has enormous mood swings, is unbelievably high-strung and seems to make it her mission to take out her stress on others- namely, me. 


Before I started working there, it was the receptionist; a young, incredibly sweet and smart woman who everyone loves. My boss would order her around (although the receptionist was outside of her department), yell at her in front of everyone for the tiniest offense, and generally make her feel stupid and inadequate. 


Now that I'm the 'new girl', her attentions have turned to me. She seems to go out of her way to find things to criticize/take issue with. When she does, she is insulting, degrading, condescending, and makes it a point to do all this loudly enough so everyone can hear. She berates me for close to a half hour for a tiny mistake that is easily fixed. 


Because I help out multiple departments with different assignments, I know that I can't be doing as bad a job as she makes it seem. I get tons of compliments and appreciation from everyone else, including the company president. But my boss is sucking away my self-confidence and making me feel incompetent and stupid.


I'm not sure how to handle it- I want to keep my job, but I don't want to be treated this way anymore. I'm scared to make a scene/call her out on it because I fear that I may lose my job. Help!"

I am currently pursuing a M.S. in computer engineering and I have to choose between two 6 month internships. Neither are 'big' name companies so I will leave them anonymous .

**Company A**

* High speed fiber optics telecom hardware
* I would be working in the FPGA division
* Had 6 month internship there 2 years ago (was a great experience)
* ^ Worked in the board-level design division (schematic and layout work)
* Would end up making less money (10-20% less than Company B)
* ~60 employees (seems likely to hire after graduation)

**Company B**

* Board-level controllers for power electronics (*schematic only*)
* Start up company ~10 employees (seems *unlikely* to hire after graduation)
* I would be one of 2-3 engineers (i.e. lots of experience doing schematic digital design)
* Also be involved with the business aspect of starting a company
* Would end up making more money than Company A

**My personal thoughts**

* I am divided between chip-level (FPGA) and board-level (digital) design.
* I already have PCB design on my resume, should I expand to include FPGA (Company A)?
* If I do FPGA then it is at a company that I worked at before - bad? FPGA and PCB at the same company?
* If I do the Company B board-level position I will be doing something I've already done (doesn't expand resume) but it is at a start up where I would get tons of experience.
* I have a desire to start a company at some point in my life but that may just be fanciful thinking.
* Company A has a long commute ~1.25 hours, Company B is within walking distance.


**TL/DR : A - worked there before (not showing variety of employers?), expands resume OR B - start-up, lots of experience, doesn't expand resume just makes one skill stronger.**

Ask me any questions to help clarify. Thanks so much!"

[Do Microsoft employees use Internet Explorer and Bing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16i543/iama_a_microsoft_employee_who_has_worked_on/c7w8yh8?context=5)|Yes most of them do. The practice is called dogfooding - all about using our own products to make them better. However there are no rules against using other browsers or search engines.
[Since you were at his residence I am assuming you have met the man.  He seems like a really nice guy.  Is he as nice as i think he is in real life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16i543/iama_a_microsoft_employee_who_has_worked_on/c7w904e?context=5)|Yes this was at an intern event. He was quite down to earth and humble despite what he had achieved. All the interns mobbed him and started a barrage of questions so I couldn't get to ask any questions unfortunately. Although I have tremendous respect for Steve Jobs, I think Bill will leave a better legacy due to his charitable work in the past decade and going into the future.

WinRT apps are going to be fluid and beautiful for consumption and I think the start screen in Win8 is more productive that the start menu. For a desktop user these may not be compelling reasons to upgrade, but for a new PC I think the Win8 choice is obvious given that it is fully compatible with Windows 7.

I also caught a glimpse of the theater it was pretty huge. Yes there are automatic temperate controls and those that detect a person and adjusts settings and such. The event was held out in his lawns front of the house with a gorgeous view of Lake Washington. I don't recall seeing too many screens though.

Does anyone carry iPhones around the office?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16i543/iama_a_microsoft_employee_who_has_worked_on/c7wapho?context=5)|Yes every employee received a Surface RT tablet and a Windows Phone 8 (2 year contract not paid for). No devices are banned and no one is forced to use Microsoft products. However employees with iPhones do get friendly jibes for being so Apple-y :).

How do you feel about Apple?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16i543/iama_a_microsoft_employee_who_has_worked_on/c7wa6df?context=5)|Free soda, free coffee, free public transportation, you decide your hours, free to work on weekends/nights, great benefits. You do spend time on support and there is lot more design, discussions and documentation work - it is certainly not like Swordfish with a lone guy in a dark room typing out thousands of lines of code a day :).  biggest perk: ability to ship code that millions of people use. Its a humbling experience, that's what motivates me to get up in the morning and go to work. Apple is a great company and the source of the renaissance in the consumer tech industry. Focus is back on apps and devices, whereas for a time there it looked like Web was winning and Google wsas on its way to being the undisputed winner. Big big change and remarkable that all this happened in a matter of few years.
[I get what you're saying, but ""They let you work on nights and weekends"" doesn't exactly sound like a perk.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16i543/iama_a_microsoft_employee_who_has_worked_on/c7wcc91?context=5)|Pretty much deciding your own hours as long as you attend meetings and get work done on time is what I was getting at. The world is at your fingertips - who knows the next brilliant idea may just be from a engineer thinking in his office on a quiet Sunday afternoon :). The biggest perk of working a bit on the weekend is no email or distractions - its so peaceful!

[What was your reaction when you first saw an iPhone years ago?  What was the reaction of your colleagues? Did you think ""we have to catch up to that""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16i543/iama_a_microsoft_employee_who_has_worked_on/c7w9eky?context=5)|To be frank my reaction was the same as Steve Ballmer - for both iPhone and iPad. I thought they were overpriced products that most poeple won't buy - that it would remain a niche for the high end of the market. Boy was I wrong! But then it was apparent in a couple years that we have to catch up to that. I have great respect for Steve Jobs and Apple - they have shown the way, it is up to each one of us in the consumer tech industry to take that vision forward and give it wings.
[Does Bill Gates use an iPad?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16i543/iama_a_microsoft_employee_who_has_worked_on/c7w8t88?context=5)|I am pretty confident he uses a Surface :). I recall watching an interview where he did say that he and his family use Microsoft products predominantly. 
[What is your opinion regarding GNU/Linux?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16i543/iama_a_microsoft_employee_who_has_worked_on/c7w950v?context=5)|Great example of what can be achieved by collaborative software development that is spread geographically.

[Your opinion on Windows 8? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16i543/iama_a_microsoft_employee_who_has_worked_on/c7w9hpp?context=5)|Best version of Windows yet no doubt. Give it a honest try yourself and do not go by opinions on the Web. It lays the foundation for where the OS will go next.
[What percentage of your working hours do you spend browsing the Internet and being generally unproductive?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16i543/iama_a_microsoft_employee_who_has_worked_on/c7w92x6?context=5)|I'd say and hour or two on most days - sometimes more sometimes less - mostly reddit and browsing tech sites. Its not like there isn't work to do - each product at Microsoft is used by millions of people - and there are always things to fix or improve. So its a big responsibility but I think that letting off the steam occasionally is necessary for a developer. I'd say roughly I end up putting in around 60 hours a week most weeks including the goofing around.
[What can you say about Valves criticism on Win 8?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16i543/iama_a_microsoft_employee_who_has_worked_on/c7w96bh?context=5)|I think steam runs better on Windows 8.

16jd22,37,2013-01-14,I'm a mediocre programmer. Do I have any chance of getting a summer internship in the SF Bay Area?,boringx100,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/16jd22/im_a_mediocre_programmer_do_i_have_any_chance_of/,"I'm finishing my final semester in community college before transferring to a 4 year university. I'm looking for a summer internship in the Bay Area. Nothing particularly fancy either. I just want some relevant industry experience. 

I've taken Calculus 1-3, Linear Algebra, about to take Discrete Mathematics, Java Programming, various C++ courses including OOP and Data Structures, an intro UNIX/Linux course, and Assembly Language Programming is planned for the upcoming semester. 

I'll be honest, I'm extremely mediocre at programming. Although I've worked hard in all my courses, my programming skills have been improving very very slowly. If I'm stuck with a problem, I'll spend a lot of time working out a solution and coming pretty close to it. But I always need help from a professor or intelligent colleague to get it 100%.  

In an academic setting I do alright with the programming labs, but I've looked at some standard interview questions and don't quite understand how to work with complicated brain twisters or algorithmic problems. I guess my programming knowledge is still weak.

I'm not sure what to do. I really want an internship, but I don't want to waste anybody's time by applying and then completely bombing the interview. Application deadlines are coming up in the next few months so I need to think of something. Any insight would be appreciated."
16j5s7,4,2013-01-13,I took a job right out of college last summer.  I am planning on relocating for personal reasons this spring. How should I handle the job search?,banitsa,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/16j5s7/i_took_a_job_right_out_of_college_last_summer_i/,"I took a software developer job at a prominent west coast tech company last summer. My girlfriend and I have been long distance since then.  We had hoped that she would be accepted into grad school in the city I am living in but that school turned her down.  It looks like she is very likely to be accepted into my Midwestern alma mater, however.  Because of this I am planning on relocating back there after I have been in my current position for a full year.

I had a strong academic record and strong experience with internships and research positions so when I was looking for jobs coming out of school I was in fairly high demand.  I imagine that leaving my current job after just a year may raise some red flags for recruiters and hiring managers though.


How should I handle the inevitable questions about why I am job searching again?  Should I acknowledge my situation in the cover letters I send with my resume?  For the recruiters out there, how much would you hold my situation against me looking for a new job?

And don't worry, I do plan to leave my current job gracefully and with proper notice."

I'm a master's student in CS with a few internships under my belt in development.  I'm looking into a program manager internship this summer, but I'm not registered for any more engineering/development classes, because I'm not sure that's what I want to do.  Now, I could register for one, but it conflicts with a very important statistics class that I should take.  

I recently discovered data analysis and I want to go be a data scientist so I'm thinking about applying for PhD programs, so this stats class is important.  However, I'm not completely committed to it, and by GPA isn't that great.  I'm just starting the second semester of grad school.

So, what I'm asking is, is how did you know you definitely wanted to get a PhD, and what kinds of decisions did you have to make?  What sacrifices did you make, and what was your persuading factor in getting deciding to get your doctorate?

Also, I'm uncertain about whether or not I should take this class.  I'm interviewing for an amazing internship and the class is part of a software development subtrack at my school, and could be the difference between getting an offer after the internship or not.  What do you think?

Thank you all so much.  This is a great subreddit and I try to contribute more than I ask.  I really love seeing so many people of all age and experience levels going into the field and sharing my passion.  "
16mxpr,322,2013-01-15,My 1 year experience from internship to full time job.,viceflow,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/16mxpr/my_1_year_experience_from_internship_to_full_time/,"So here's my story :

When I was 25 back in 2008 I decided to get a bachelor degree in Computer Science. At that time I was working as a Front Desk clerk for a resort here in Cancun. So I managed to convince my boss to let me study in the mornings and work on the evening. So basically I was in school through the morning and then to work.

Four years passed and its 2012. Got my bachelor degree and really wanted to leave the front desk job and start taking advantage from my degree. My main goal since I started university was to learn to code, and to be honest... I learned almost nothing .. lol... See when you study and work it gets pretty hard to even coupe with homework even worse when you only have one day off so I learn some bits of C++ and Java here and there enough to pass terms.

So as I was saying , its 2012 and I need to get a job on IT , I really didn't wanted to work at Help Desk fixing printers, I wanted to code and build software, the only problems was that most companies needed at least 3 year experience... fuck my life.So I made a huge decision and started to look for a internship somewhere in Cancun... I started to send emails to a few companies (to my surprise there's around 8 software companies down here) . 1 week later I got an email back from one of them, they ask me if I could come over for an Interview. Feeling nervous and dumb there I went.. lol I remember they ask me to do two exercises... the first one was to take any kind of string and reverse it.. without using functions...(they use Java) the other I don't remember cause I fail miserably on both... I got to nervous and couldn't think of a solution...  bummer. They said....thank you.. we will call you, ouch.

A month pass by and suddenly I got another email. Another company , .NET developers, 10 minutes from home(holy shit) for an internship. You see from the few things I was able to learn in university was C#. My final project was made in it so that help me a lot. Ok so , they ask me to do online test's for basic and some advance C# features + TSQL. I didn't fail miserably but got enough basic concepts to got me another interview. 

The interview goes pretty good, they like the fact that I speak English since most of their clients are from Canada and the US. They offer me an internship position for 6 months. After that time I have to take a certification test to see how much I learned, plus they gonna paid me(around 500USD a month). So I said.... fuck it lets do this. The only downside... the job was from 9am to 6pm... shit... what I'm gonna do with the front desk job?? I talked to my boss in the resort and told him I need to work in the evening shift. He was OK with it, on the internship place I convince them to let me work from 9 to 2pm even without pay, they agree and still pay me. For 4 months I spend all day working like literally ,I started the internship at 9am then rush out at 2pm and start at 3pm at the resort were I leave at 11pm. 

This was from Monday to Friday. So as you can imagine I started to feel miserably.

On the other hand... I was learning a lot.

Right away I get my hands on books , courses and videos on everything .NET.

They put me on a MVC4 project that was going to start from zero. The project leader was kind enough to go easy on me and started to explain everything... so there I was learning Entity Framework, MVC, Repositories, Moq,SCRUM  .... at some point my brain almost explode from all that information.

One day I talk to the wife and decided to leave the front desk job. This was like 4 months into the internship , I really wanted to get that certification. 

As you can imagine I pass the certification and land me the full time job.

Its been almost 1 year since I decided to do a complete change on my life. I think it was a good decision.

So far I been working with ASP, SQL server, MVC, Jquery, JavaScript, Unit Test,Reporting Services  and hope to get a new certification in a couple of months in HTML 5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

So , thank you learnprogamming cause some of the stuff I studied / study comes from here !

**TL; DR I went from a Front desk clerk to Developer in 4 years and how perseverance land me an internship in a software company**

Nice blog with examples

[Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)
Always a starting point if you feel lost through a project or how to do x task.

Like I said previously you are never to old to learn and apply something new. Life is funny on how the decisions that you make change everything. Something that I realize now that I'm close to 30 is that you need to plan ahead, don't plan for today but for tomorrow. Save money, invest in your development , that steam game can wait. 

The rewards will come sooner or later but it's up to you.

16mxdm,1,2013-01-15,Software engineering interns in CA: is overtime required by law?,suta120391,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/16mxdm/software_engineering_interns_in_ca_is_overtime/,"According to the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE), [California law requires that employers pay eligible employees overtime](http://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/faq_overtime.htm). There is [an exemption](
http://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/Glossary.asp?Button1=E#employee%20in%20the%20computer%20software%20field) for employees in the computer software industry meeting a fairly narrowing set of criteria. These criteria have several exceptions, two of which are as follows:

&gt;* The employee is a trainee or employee in an entry-level position who is learning to become proficient in the theoretical and practical application of highly specialized information to computer systems analysis, programming, and software engineering.

&gt; * The employee is in a computer-related occupation but has not attained the level of skill and expertise necessary to work independently and without close supervision.

To me, this sounds very much like an intern. If that's the case, shouldn't employers be required to pay their interns overtime? We all know that startup culture -- if not the employers directly -- encourages employees to work more than 8 hours per day or 40 hours per week. Interns are no exception. 

I feel as though I must be mistaken given that this is the status quo, but the legal facts seem pretty clear. Does anyone know if I'm missing something?

To be clear, I'm not an intern (anymore), and I have no interest in pursuing legal action. I'd just like to understand what's going on here."
16mfz3,23,2013-01-15,I'm one of the lucky few.,dangsos,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/16mfz3/im_one_of_the_lucky_few/,"I just wanted to pass on some encouragement.  I've been reading probably an hour a day on average.  Got an awesome job from an unpaid internship which resulted in getting hired full time with an under market salary, but I got my foot in the door.  I know people look down on jobs like that, but with this internship/job and working my ass off I've managed to get past an interview with a technical recruiter.  I've been given the go ahead by HR and have an in-person interview coming up where we will likely discuss an app I coded for them last week.

I don't have a college degree, but if I'm lucky enough to land this job I'll have at least one free class a semester at a top 25 school in the US (the job position is with a cancer research crew at a university's cancer research facility), putting me in a great position for my career goals (heck the job sounds cool enough who knows, it has the potential to be the last company I work for!).

Moral of the story is you don't need a college degree to get a coding job.  It certainly helps and will possibly be required to move up in the field, but to get started and to land a job that will pay for school, it isn't required, plus if you work hard at something you have the opportunity to find out if you enjoy something before you've invested a few years and a couple thousand dollars.

Anyways, I haven't been offered the job yet, but I've certainly made it far enough to prove it's possible to get a high-end entry level job without going to college.

Best of luck to all of you!"
16mbnr,2,2013-01-15,"Help with the outside life aspect of getting a PhD (living situation, etc)? ",a_baby_coyote,AskComputerScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/16mbnr/help_with_the_outside_life_aspect_of_getting_a/,"I'm not sure if this is a commonly asked question, but I feel I should ask it so I can work to better shape my future to my goals. 

A little about where I'm at now, I just returned to college after a long break, my degree focus being Computer Science with a focus on math, and it's possible I'll go for a dual major depending on how things pan out. 

I'm a sophomore with credits, and currently use a 40 hour a week job to pay for my school with tuition reimbursement. Not having to pay a cent towards my undergrad education is a nice benefit but as you can imagine it may not be my best option. 

My current goal is to finish my undergrad in as little time as possible given my circumstances (40 hour a week job), which may be 3 more years minimum. I'm 26 years old and I think due to my makeup more than my age, I'm not someone who can continually sacrifice sleep without paying a heavy penalty for it, so to have enough time to study, decreasing my class load might be necessary. 


So this is a question more about life around schooling rather than specifics into schooling itself. Free education is awesome but I feel I'm at a disadvantage because there's no way I can do an internship which I would think is very important, unless I'm able to convince my work to let me intern a project. There's also limited time to do self education which I really would like to spend time on. 

I hope I'm not being too verbose in getting to the point. I know to go the PhD route, I need to begin focus now on working towards that goal, through study and gaining knowledge as much as I can outside of school. 

So how does a 26 year old that can't live at home, and is entirely dependent upon a full time job, pursue a PhD? Is this a path only suited for the really young/go getters that never missed a beat with education, or is strong determination a little later in life enough? 

You don't even really have to answer my specific question, this can just be a discussion about living the PhD life. "

My sub-discipline is more on the science side of things, but is not unrelated to industry.  I've won a prestigious national award or two, published a few papers in top journals, and have done a couple of research internships, including at my dream company.  It was really devastating then when I was not offered really even the possibility of a job at the end of the summer with my dream company, despite a stellar review.  Part of this, I think, is because my field, at least in industry, is shrinking.  After that rejection, I thought, ""I have made a huge mistake"" in picking this field.


I've been going to career fairs and scouting my school's job board, and it seems like for every job related to my field, or even in hardware in general, there are two, three, or more software jobs.  I've been programming since I was young, I minored in CS in grad school so I have a formal background in data structures, algorithms, and so on, and I constantly am writing tools in various languages to help analyze all of the data I have taken while in grad school.


Still, I'm realistic in that my software experience is just not impressive, especially for someone looking for graduate-level jobs, and I'm afraid the Ph.D and all the good science work is irrelevant or, worse, harmful when looking for software jobs.  My ideal job would be writing low-level software to control hardware, analyzing data coming from sensors, or something else that has a hardware component.  How do I convince employers to give me a chance?

Experiences making this kind of jump would be very helpful."

I am still a freshman pretty much. Now from my experience, I am kinda fed up with these ""wonder"" offers.

I have worked a bit in the software development field and 
sometimes I get the feeling that these big software companies just send tons and tons of spam. They may have interesting opportunities but the crap that I have seen in their videos is amazing.

I mean I ran into a lot of problems where I work currently and there are a lot of challenges that normally I wouldn't even begin to imagine. But when I see these big software companies with their amazing promises and concepts I tend to laugh at them because they seem so unrealistic. I see mostly ""nice talk"" but not any conclusive information and nothing about programming. I am kinda fed up with these.

So after all that I have said above, is it still worth trying for that job? Did anyone go through experiences like mine? Any tips?  Should I put any more effort into it or just let it go to chance and write every crazzy idea that comes into my head onto that CV and in the answers?"

16ouno,3,2013-01-16,Not sure how to make it up to her...,8npls,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/16ouno/not_sure_how_to_make_it_up_to_her/,"So... I'm in Asia visiting my parents and I decide to get a random internship to pass the time. There's this girl at work whom I've taken a liking to, let's call her Jenny. She's been around since late November but she has a busy schedule, so most of the time we've spent together has just been breaks (dinner, lunch, random half hour breaks during shifts). I asked her out on a date in early December; she replied with uncertainty and told me she'd have to see after her schedule was confirmed. Her hours were approved a couple days after that but she never got back to me.

I was originally planning to fly back to Canada on the 27th, however some family issues arose and I have thus changed my flight to end of February. My workplace is fairly small, so most of the people I worked with knew about my situation. One of my coworkers actually really kindly set up a dinner for a small group of us on the 21st.

However, due to some miscommunication I figured it was just another typical ""work break group dinner"" and it turns out I wasn't scheduled to go in that day... on top of that, Jenny had seemed pretty hot/cold during the time period between my asking her out and this dinner being planned. I figured she'd lost interest and had been casually dating another girl on the side.

I do make it clear to everyone though that I'm uncertain about being able to show on the 21st; I tell them I'll be there if I get scheduled for work and that I'll send my regrets if not. Turns out I got the day off, the other girl asks me out for dinner that day anyhow so I say sure why not and on the 19th I tell them I won't be able to make it.

Around 6pm on the day Jenny calls me and asks if I'm showing up, I reply with my sincerest apologies that I don't have work today and thus will not be going to dinner with them.

Fast forward to today. My internship originally ended on the 24th of December since I was leaving, but I returned last week because I can't really sit around and do nothing. My reappearance in the office catches Jenny off guard a bit and on the first day she seems rather jovial and pleasantly surprised that I'm back... next day, however, she is completely cold towards me and just entirely ignores me.

OK, I'm kinda rambling on with this story so here's essentially what's going on: I know I really really fucked up on the 21st. I found out after the fact that I made a huge mistake assuming it was just a typical dinner when Jenny had actually taken off the remainder of her shift that day, arrived at work dressed up... and the ""group"" comment was just her being too shy to directly ask me out on a date.

Truth is, I do really really like her a lot but I don't want her to get emotionally attached or whatever since I'm leaving so soon. That said, I genuinely do believe I owe her an apology because what I did was extremely inconsiderate and just a major dick move.

My question is... how can I make it up to her? I was thinking of apologizing to her for being a sod and standing her up, then treating her to dinner... or should I get her a small gift/write a note (on top of apologizing in person of course)/other suggestions? I'm not really good at this kind of thing. I'm not expecting to get anything out of this by the way; I just want to repent for hurting Jenny's feelings because it definitely wasn't my intention to do that. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated, and sorry for the long post! Thanks guys :)

**TL;DR: Stood up a girl unintentionally, now that I know I fucked up how can I make it up to her?**"

I've been offered a three month, paid internship contract in an industry that I'm interested in, with the possibility of a job arising in the future - they're hiring three interns and one gets picked at the end. They want me to get back to them as soon as possible, and I would start on Monday.

At the same time, I've made it to the second round for a permanent role, also in a relevant industry. They offer great pay, however, the interview is only scheduled for next week.

I've asked the company with the internship role if there is any flexibility and explained the situation, but they want all of the new interns to start at the same time.

16oeif,10,2013-01-16,Recovering from past challenges and trying to push forward -- advice?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/16oeif/recovering_from_past_challenges_and_trying_to/,"Hey everyone,

I've got a tricky situation on my hands, and would love any advice I can get. At the moment, I'm very fortunate to be enrolled at a great school studying Computer Science with a solid GPA. Beyond that, however, my experience here has been nothing like what I had thought it would be upon entering, and not in a good way. I'll explain the situation as briefly as I can, then ask my question.

I initially entered college around seven years ago as a freshman, but not long after that I began to be dealt a tough hand of cards which ultimately forced me to take around three years away from school, and beyond that some time as only a part-time student. To make a very long story short, I had three friends die -- two by suicide -- within a span of just a few months. I initially took a medical leave to deal with this, and intended to be gone only for a short time. Shortly thereafter, however, my father's Parkinson's became so severe that he had to stop working and I, being home already, became the de facto caretaker (my parental situation is a bit irregular -- they were actually in their 50's when they had me). Our financial security was never good, but it got a lot worse after that and due to a few other factors I ended up staying out of school much longer to help manage his care. Though to be honest, I had become so depressed at that point that it wouldn't have been wise to return to school anyway. The situation with my father has been resolved, so to speak, and I have since returned to school to continue my degree.

As you may have guessed, I would like to know how I should best address my massive enrollment gap and lack of internship experience with companies during a job search. ""I took a medical leave"" or ""Family issues"" seem so cryptic and would probably only engender confusion. However, telling any considerable fraction of the full story would seem like suicide in a job interview. That said, I'd really like to be as truthful and honest as possible. I'm not going to back down, but I am extremely self-conscious about it and have been struggling to address all this to people in both a reasonable and truthful way.

Everything aside, I believe that I have the core software engineering and algorithms knowledge to do well at a reptuable company -- Palantir and Google are far and away my top choices (a man can dream, can't he?), but I'd certainly be happy with many other options as well. I'll be looking for full-time opportunities next year most likely, but am currently focused on finding a solid internship for this summer.

Thanks again for reading, and best of luck to all of you this job season --

The work I will be doing is something I'm competent in and can succeed in well, however it is not something I want to ideally settle in, one reason being the money. I'm happy that they accepted me since unlike most developers I don't have a CS degree. The problem is the company is brand new, does not have investors yet, and the internship is unpaid (this would be fine if they weren't asking 20-40 hours a week). I feel like I can wait and find a better offer but this is based on my own instinct and not the reality of a web developer finding a job. 

My experience includes programming non-stop for the past 8 months, 8 hours a day, 7 days a week, along with numerous projects under my belt using Rails/Sinatra/NoSQL, etc etc. My question is, should this be something I'm grateful to take or should I find something else, at least one paid."

I did internship as a part of graduation program at a company for 6 months. I did apply for permanent position there. The GM-HR took my interview. After that I sent him a thank you email, and also kept a HR personnel in cc: with whom I was in touch. (They both work at head-office in different location to where I worked)

I called her back after a week to check on status. I followed it up 10 days later. I had a presentation on my internship pending at the time. So after finishing all my internship formalities, I followed it up again 10 days later with an SMS and called her the next day. At the time she said she was waiting for the feedback form from the plant I worked at and assured that they have my name in their mind for recruiting. She also said she'll take 3-4 days to look up for vacancies at one of their several plants, and also asked to mail her my project report. I sent the same to which she replied she'll get back soon. It's been 2 weeks since then and I don't know how to follow this up further.

Entering college I was hoping to have everything I'd need to know by this point, but right now I'm feeling hopeless.

I can program, I know that much. I know C++ and Java, and have been able to jump into other languages (C#, javascript, for example) easily. More complex things take a bit of time, but eventually after a lot of googling and tinkering I get it right.

Other than that though, I'm clueless. Despite taking hardware classes and other ""inner-workings"" courses, I still don't know much about computer specs. When my friends talk about their newest computers with their fancy parts, I just nod my head without really understanding. While others are making their own laptops, I don't even know how to make my own PC. I want to blame the Russian teacher, or the teacher with tenure who didn't really care, or the teacher who read the book word-for-word and eventually switched to a youtube tutorial to teach, but I know that most of my struggling is my own doing.

I have nothing to show for a portfolio. I have a Unity project that I've been toying with for a few months, but I haven't had much time to work on it and have only gotten a few simple functions on it (Creating stats for a player and enemy, and a functioning attack button). I did take a class, a game design course, where the entire class made a game together but the dropbox has already been deleted and no copies exist.

I want to get into the game industry so bad but I'm just at a loss of what to do or how to help myself. I'm afraid of letting people know that I only feel confident in programming and that everything else makes my head spin. I've applied for an internship with EA, and someone who worked there has agreed to put in a good word for me, but I'm afraid that if they accept me and I go that I'll just make a fool of myself. My university recently had a CS&amp;IS dept pizza party, and I had mentioned that one of their recommendations was to know multi-threaded processing and how I didn't have any experience in that as far as I knew. A kid overheard and said that if I didn't know that, then I had no business in EA. My confidence has reached an all-time low.

I feel like I'm just begging for ""Cheer up, it's ok!""s or that this is one of a billion similar posts, or if this is even in the right sub, but I really need advice, or direction, or something that could get me out of this horrifying rut. What can I do to help better prepare myself for what's out there?"

16rvse,89,2013-01-17,"""The printer keeps jamming, and I don't know why.""",jordan042,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/16rvse/the_printer_keeps_jamming_and_i_dont_know_why/,"Sorry if it's a bit long. I have a hard time telling stories without giving the play by play.

So today, I had gone up to the elementary school where my mom teaches, offering to help with computer-related issues. For background, I worked for this school district's technology department as an intern for my final semester of high school and four summers. This is just to say I know their setup pretty well, so I'm capable of doing a lot to fix their issues; I also know that the Technicians for the district are sorely understaffed, and that they rarely make it out to some of the elementary schools (and this one in particular*) since the middle and high schools are much larger and have more frequent and numerous issues.

The teacher in question asked me to take a look at her printer (an [HP Deskjet 1000](http://www.shopping.hp.com/en_US/home-office/-/products/Printers/HP-Deskjet/CH340A) for those interested in the particulars), and said that it had a tendency to jam. Luckily this was not compounded by software or driver issues. I opened up good old MSWord and typed a few words to print (""Test page, please ignore,"" in true Redditor fashion). I put a sheet of paper in the tray and hit print.

What came next wasn't unexpected; the paper scooted in about an inch, the printer made an odd noise, and on the monitor a ""printer out of paper - please insert more and press the printer's power button once"" message appeared. Well well well. I pulled the paper out relatively unscathed, and opened the printer door up to have a look inside. (This printer has a small door on the front that when opened, gives access to the ink cartridges.) This was of no help. I could see nothing out of order, and the door was too small to really allow me to get at anything that would be inside. However I was able to see that there was no other jammed paper inside, conveniently. 

At this point I close the printer up, hit the print button, and received the same result. Clearly I had missed something. I checked in the paper tray at the back, but still nothing. I proceeded to unplug the printer, and turn it upside down and listen for loose parts, to no avail. I tried printing again with no success, and decided to poke around once more before recommending the printer to the school district's printer guy. This is when I notice it. There's something red down in the paper tray. It turns out to be a [red felt-tip pen](http://i.imgur.com/dC13N.jpg), jammed down in the paper tray assembly.

After finally finding the issue, it took about 10 minutes of reaching and poking and stretching my fingers to actually remove it. It had gotten stuck in a location that seemed to be just slightly narrower than the width of the pen, and definitely narrower than my fingers.

I plugged it in, printed a test page successfully, and then gave the teacher the good news. ""I have not only fixed your printer, I found your pen too.""

^(*For example, several classroom computers still run Windows 2000 after there was a project 2 years ago to upgrade everything to at least XP.)

**TL;DR**: ""I not only fixed your printer, I found your pen too."""

[Do you know any lawyers that are like Saul Goodman on Breaking Bad? Sleazy and infomercial-type kinda lawyers? and what do you think of lawyers like that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z3vus?context=5)|Sure. I read somewhere recently, I can't remember where exactly, that advertising is a tax you pay on not being very good at what you do. Obviously that's a pretty sweeping statement that isn't true in all cases, but it's true in a lot of instances in the legal field. I have met plenty of lawyers who I would never hire to represent me were I ever facing criminal charges.
[Should the average person have the number of a lawyer handy?  Do people go consult with a lawyer for free prior to any legal troubles, just so they know they have one available?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z75qd?context=5)|It's abnormal for someone to come to me prior to committing a crime, but it's not unheard of.
[I'm an attorney and I regularly deal with advertising with my firm. I would say that in personal injury you MUST advertise to survive. That said, in other legal fields advertising is just stupid (merger's and aquisitions for example\).  It's all context.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7zdm2z?context=5)|Oh, absolutely. My comment was related strictly to the criminal defense industry and not all lawyers. I'd agree with your assessment re PI lawyers.
[What do you think of those you are defending that you are sure have completed a heinous crime, but then are acquitted? Do you feel bad that a probably guilty, destructive person is out on the streets due* to your good work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z3ien?context=5)|I can count on one hand, and I frankly don't need all my fingers, the number of times I've had someone who I believed was guilty of committing a heinous crime actually end up being acquitted of all charges.
[I have a friend who is a Criminal Defense Attorney, and we asked him the same question. He just responds by saying, ""I try to make sure they don't get the death penalty for robbing a gas station."" Is that similar to how you feel?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z71q1?context=5)|That's a good way of putting it.
[*attempted manslaughter.*  Is that when you attempt to accidentally kill someone?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z7l48?context=5)|Generally speaking attempted manslaughter results from injuring someone (short of murder) in the heat of passion.
[Perhaps not quite what you were expecting from the AMA but could you explain 'attempted manslaughter' please?  Also, do you enjoy your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z7c2j?context=5)|Attempted manslaughter is nearly universally borne out of self defense actions -- think A assaults B and B responds by shooting A but doesn't kill A. B is charged with attempted murder. B argues justification. Jury decides that B didn't intend to murder A, but overreacted to the threat A posed.
[Sorry to detract, but how exactly does someone get charged with 'attempted manslaughter'?  Isnt manslaughter accidentally killing someone? How can you attempt to accidentally kill someone?  Edit; nevermind, was answered below.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7zdvp9?context=5)|It's incredibly unlikely someone would get charged with attempted manslaughter. I've had one client convicted of attempted manslaughter. That case was a case where he was charged with two counts of attempted murder for shooting two people that were attacking him. I argued that he was justified in shooting them. The jury decided that he was justified in doing something, but that his actions were a bit of an overreaction, and they basically split the baby, so to speak, and ended up convicting him of attempted manslaughter.
[Maybe you aren't the best defense lawyer if all your clients go to jail??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z992f?context=5)|Your reading comprehension skills need work. Well, either that, or your inference skills.
 |Most of my clients avoid jail time.
[Most rewarding part of your job? Favorite kind of cases to work? Do you think drugs should be illegal?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z3ri3?context=5)|Most rewarding part of my job is an easy question to answer. A lot of people come to me after having made bad decisions that were borne out of desperation, be it familial, financial, or otherwise. Working through the system to ensure that these people's futures aren't horrifically damaged, and then seeing them come out on the other side of criminal charges with an opportunity to put a bad decision behind them and not have it limit their possibilities is a really rewarding scenario.
 |I don't know that I have a favorite type of case, because each case presents different obstacles and opportunities. I think generally my successes in drug cases make them interesting ones to take on.
 |I go back and forth on this question. What I never waiver on is that I think a lot of drugs should be legal in limited quantities. I also strongly believe that the system could do a better job dealing with those convicted of drug offenses to get them help and move them out of a system that can sometimes seem like a revolving door.
[How does it feel defending an obviously guilty person? Trying to get the scum of the earth off the hook? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z4jhe?context=5)|Legitimate question. I have control over what cases I take and what cases I pass on, so there's a bit of a slant to my answer that doesn't apply to the legal profession as a whole.
 |Most people know they're guilty if they're guilty. But most people I represent are guilty of something far short of what they're charged. I can point to numerous occasions when I've represented someone who was guilty of trespass but was charged with burglary. In a case like that, I don't feel bad representing someone who's obviously guilty of trespass and having them ultimately be acquitted of burglary.
[What is the weirdest case you have worked on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z3isq?context=5)|Answered this in the last AMA, and I think it probably depends on your definition of weird.
 |The TL;DR version is that I represented an individual who hired an escort to come to his motel room and watch fetish pornography with him while he told her about his interests/fetishes, and then he paid her for her time with a combination of drugs and cash. Weird, weird fella, and weird, weird story.
[Why was he indicted?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z3zui?context=5)|He gave drugs to someone as payment for services rendered. That's kind of sort of a no-no.
[How did he get caught? Did the prostitute just rock up to the police station one day and go ""hey hey, this guy paid me with some wack dope, yo. Put his ass in jail""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z6zwr?context=5)|Prostitute got scared by his fetishes and contacted the police.
[Which begs the question as to what it was.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7zclrm?context=5)|Not going to go into that much detail.
[Awww, you must be new here. That's kind of our thing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7zdq17?context=5)|The fetish? Or the detail? Ha.
 |Seriously though, it was some weird stuff.
[Everyone says law school is a horrible investment and there'\[in doing this for\]s no jobs these days, is there \[in doing this for\]still room for inexperienced people doing criminal defense?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z3w5e?context=5)|I'd say law school is worth doing if you're absolutely certain you want to practice law and you aren't going to be coming out of school with an insane debt burden.
[How common are these for drug investigations?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z3w5e?context=5)|People gain experience doing criminal defense quickly. I know plenty of people who started out in a 2-3 person firm and after 12-24 months decided to go out on their own, and have made great careers for themselves.
[Just the kingpins making millions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z3w5e?context=5)|Long-term wiretaps oftentimes get targeted at people the government thinks are kingpins, but often end up catching lower-level dealers and buyers, because a lot of the big players are smart enough not to get caught up in a lot of that, or they have other people doing their dirty work.
[Have they started using facebook very frequently for investigations yet?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z3w5e?context=5)|Generally speaking, I use facebook more often than the State, but I've absolutely seen cases where the State has facebook posts effectively.
[How much do prosecutors actually know about who's who in the drug game? Most genius/ dumbest schemes you have ever seen? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z3zjl?context=5)|Most prosecutors know largely what the police tell them, and not much more. They don't have a ton of time to be investigating crime. A lot of the police officers that I've met are quite knowledgable at what's going on at the street level.
 |Most of the cases I take don't emanate from ""schemes"" per se, in that most of my clients are charged with one-time offenses that they didn't really plan out. I have seen some pretty elaborate schemes though -- such as clients replacing their phone every two-three weeks for fear of having it tapped (which is really annoying when you have to correspond with them).
[Definitely interested to hear how you use Facebook and how the State does.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z9g7h?context=5)|Research on witnesses' background of stories / testimony, basically. 
[Have you ever been threatened or come to physical harm?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z41py?context=5)|I've never had a client threaten me directly to the point where I was scared for my well-being. I fight hard for all of my clients, and I make it a point to treat each and every one of them like a human being and to respect them, and I think that results in a lot more courteous reaction from them. And I've never suffered any physical harm related to my job.
[What's the typical sentence for drug distributors? Do most snitch? How much does being an informant help peoples sentences? Do people still get in trouble for weed in Oregon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z3mug?context=5)|The typical sentence varies based upon the person's criminal history, the type of drug, the amount of the drug, and other factors. I've seen drug sentences ranging from probation to multiple decades. For a first time offender, often drug offenses can result in probation sentences, and/or minimal jail time. It also depends on the jurisdiction you're in, and how common of a crime narcotics trafficking is.
 |A significant majority of my clients are not interested in being a snitch or an informant.
 |Being an informant can help if the client has actionable information that leads generally to multiple people far higher up on the food chain than themselves.
 |Large quantities of weed, yes.
[What's a large quantity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z72vo?context=5)|Depending on the jurisdiction something in excess of 50 pounds of MJ. Lesser weights for harder drugs.
[Have you handled cases involving the drug cartel of Mexico?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z40ks?context=5)|There are plenty of different cartels in Mexico, but yes, I've handled cases involving people involved with Mexican drug cartels.
[How dangerous are they?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z41mu?context=5)|In Mexico, they're ruthless, and I've heard horrific stories from past clients. In the United States, far less dangerous because of the fact that law enforcement here is frankly far better, and the threat of capture, prosecution, and imprisonment is far greater than the threat of a similar response in Mexico.
[What kind of stories did you hear?Any examples?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z42t4?context=5)|Nothing too terribly different from what gets reported in the mainstream media in the US -- kidnappings, mass killings, extortion, bribery of public officials, etc.
[Have you ever defended somebody you *knew* was innocent, but then lost the case?  What made you choose Criminal Defense over any other field of law? (currently in law school myself, trying to figure out where I want to end up\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z65pc?context=5)|Yes. It happened once, and the case got overturned thankfully on appeal. The year or so he spent in custody was pretty rough on him and his family, and me for that matter.
[What's the story on that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c805wll?context=5)|Guy and his wife live in a trailer, with a driveway and a fenced yard.
 |Guy's friend asks him if he can park a vehicle there for a month or so while he's away on business. Our guy says ""sure, no problem.""
 |The friend drives the car over and parks it in the yard. The friend hands our guy the keys and the friend takes off. Our guy puts the keys on a cork board in his entryway.
 |A couple of weeks later, cops are in the neighborhood on an unrelated matter, and end up running the plates on the car. The car comes back reported stolen out of a city about 250 miles away.
 |Lady who reported the vehicle stolen have a really weird story about leaving the keys in it, and then waited two days to report it.
 |Our guy's friend is nowhere to be found, and the cops can't track him down.
 |Our guy had a lock solid alibi for the day the car was stolen, and there was no communication (calls, emails, texts) between our guy and his friend immediately before or after the theft.
 |The car itself had no visible damage and it wasn't obvious from looking at the vehicle from the exterior that it was stolen.
 |Ultimately I argued that (1) the vehicle want ever really stolen, and that it was likely a case of fraud committed by the alleged victim and our guy's friend; (2) that even if the car was stolen, there was no evidence linking my guy to the theft; and (3) that when he took receipt of it, there was no indication it was stolen, and it wasn't unreasonable of him to keep it parked in the yard, because he honestly didn't know better.
 |At the conclusion of the trial, I moved for a directed verdict - which basically allows the judge to find the defendant not guilty before the case goes to the jury in an instance where the state hasn't proven every element of the crime. I was shocked when that was denied.
 |The case then went to the jury, and the jury found my guy guilty, which was equally shocking.
 |On appeal, the appellate court held that the trial judge should have granted my motion for a directed verdict and that there was no real evidence that my guy was guilty.
 |In the end, it all worked out, but it was really hairy there for a while.
 |Edit: a few auto-correct errors.

 |There isn't enough space on the internet to answer your second questions. I could regale you with hundreds of instances where defendants were convicted or pled to an amended charge that resulted in a far more lenient sentence than the quantity of narcotics they were involved in trafficking merited.
[Have you ever been involved in a case where the jury clearly exercised Jury Nullification?  Even if prohibited from mentioning Nullification directly (as is the case in many courts, as I understand it\) have you ever tried to subtly hint to the jury that they can, indeed, return a finding based on their own moral beliefs about what is equitable, and not a strict adherence to the law as written?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z8td8?context=5)|Yea, a couple of times. I can remember one specific case where I had a client who was very likable and relatable, charged with DUI for ""driving"" a vehicle a few hundred feet in order to have her roommate, who was sober, drive them home.
[Do you often talk to jurors after a trial, to see what they were thinking and what influenced their decision one way or the other?  If so, what's the most surprising thing you've found out from doing that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z8td8?context=5)|Nullification is a powerful thing, but it probably happens less often than people make it out to occur. 
[What is the worst sentence one can receive for DUI?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z40eq?context=5)|Depends on the state, and on the person's record of previous DUIs. Assuming the defendant didn't hit anything/anyone and you didn't cause any injury/death, there are states that have such a thing as extreme, or super extreme DUI that can result in felony prison time.
[*super extreme DUI.*  They couldn't come up with some legaly words for this? did they name the law during take-your-child-to-work day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z71ff?context=5)|Well, I can't speak for all states, but some states have legislators that make you question their sanity.
[What makes it super extreme as opposed to just a DUI ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z7msh?context=5)|Higher the BAC, the higher the charges in a lot of states.

[How do feel when you're able to get a dismissal due to a technical flaw, i.e. a perceived Brady violation or slight mishandling of evidence? Is a win a win or do you see it as ""the prosecutor should have done his job better""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z8byq?context=5)|When I win on ""technicalities"" I see it two ways: one, technicalities exist because of the system we've set up to ensure everyone is treated fairly, and without them, the system would break down, and two, more often than not, if the client I've just freed on a technicality keeps breaking the law, he'll be caught, and there won't be a technical violation to save him the second time around. 
[Thanks for the reply. As a follow up: Are you ever willing to concede on a ""technicality"" during a trial and allow a flawed process be ignored (I'm not saying made admissible\) for the fact s to emerge or do you just look for a way to get your client out of the hot seat?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7zbdeb?context=5)|Sometimes you do avoid arguing a ""technicality."" I can think of numerous cases where my client's statement to police came in violation of Miranda, but helped the theory I was advancing, so I wanted to keep the statement in, and thus never challenged its admissibility under Miranda.
[Probably too late, but, serious question: What are you supposed to do when the cop asks the cliche question, ""Do you know how fast you were going?""...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7zkhwr?context=5)|My general rule of thumb is that any admission against your own interest is going to come back to bite you. ""No, sir, I don't.""

[I was a heroin addict living in Baltimore for years. I have been working on sobriety the past few years,  but I came out of everything with a few misdemeanor possession charges, and an intent to distrubute charge. A few of them are on probation before judgement, but what can I do to either make the rest go away, or at least make them invisible/harder to find for potential employers? Any tips?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z8yio?context=5)|Once you've completed all of your probation, find a lawyer who will work with you to get your convictions set aside. It'll cost you probably 1k or so, but it'll be worth every penny.
[I'm currently filling out my law school applications. For the character and fitness section, I need to disclose that I was arrested for possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia quite a few years back. The charges were subsequently diverted and are completely off of my record, however from my research I still need to fully disclose any interactions with law enforcement.  My question to you is: what is the best way for me to word this encounter, that would look most favorable to the admissions council? I was considering: ""I was arrested for *suspicion* of possession of marijuana...of which the charges were subsequently diverted"" Is this dishonest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z753u?context=5)|I doubt something like simple possession + paraphernalia would have much of an adverse impact.
[I have a cousin that graduated from Harvard, took the BAR the first time and failed. Multiple people told her that this happens, but she refuses to try again. Any advice for trying to inspire her to try taking the BAR again?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z8yx3?context=5)|I have multiple colleagues that tried and failed multiple times before passing a bar exam. These people are veritable, good, professional people, and they just for whatever reason took a few tries to pass. They're great lawyers now, and nobody cares, or frankly knows, that they didn't pass the first time (or second time) around.
[From what I understand, if pulled over for a DUI you can refuse a breathalyzer. The same source, (I think it was an ACLU video\) said that if you are arrested and brought back to the station, at that point refusing a breathalyzer may have consequences / charges. It seems odd that you can't be charged for refusing it out in the 'field', but you can if you're taken back to the station. Any idea why that is?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z6mu2?context=5)|There's a difference between refusing a preliminary breath test (PBT) and refusing a breathalyzer (actual breath test).
[Also.. what is your impression of the Supreme Court case being heard now concerning warrantless blood tests in DUI cases?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z6mu2?context=5)|That supreme court case could have really far-ranging impacts on the criminal justice system.
[Ah, thank you for the clarification.  According to the reporting that came out when oral argument was heard, they seemed inclined to accept the argument that a warrantless blood test is a violation of the 4th amendment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7zdcc2?context=5)|Yea, that was my sense from reading the reports. That said, oftentimes the questioning at oral argument can lead one to conclude the court is leaning one way, when in fact they come down on the opposite side. The court's decision on the Affordable Healthcare Act is one instance of this.
[As an idealistic young lad I took the LSAT during my undergrad and scored in the 90th percentile.  However because of money and other problems, law school wasn't in the cards. I've since graduated, found a good job.  At this point, I'm obligated to stay with my current company till shortly after I turn 29.  I'm fairly confident that I could score as well, if not better on the LSAT, than I did when I was an irresponsible dumbass kid.  Do I stand any chance of getting admitted to a decent law school and and being able to start a law career or has that boat pretty much sailed because of my age?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z9qkp?context=5)|Totally! When I was in law school, the number of 30+ students was pretty close to that of the &lt; 30 students. 
[A friend of mine is a prosecutor and he tells me that for them they gauge a win to be where they get a conviction. For the public defenders in his area, they call it a win if they don't get the maximum sentence. Which, from what he tells me, they both have ""win ratio's"" of about 80%](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z9h2e?context=5)|I ask my client, initially, what it is they want and expect out of my representation of them.

Or is yours the same as theirs?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z9h2e?context=5)|Obviously some people have unreasonable expectations, and I try to avoid doing business with them.

[Thank you for your response. Most of what I read is on Wiki and believe he is guilty as well.  However, my wife and her friends are questioning things because apparently there is a conspiracy theory out there that he didn't act alone and that the government is attempting to cover some things up.

[I just had a question that I wondered if you knew the answer too. I heard this on Reddit a long time ago and so I wanted to see if it is true or not. A guy said that he owned a home and had his girlfriend living with him at the time. Eventually they had somewhat of a fallout and so he asked her to pack and leave before he got back home the next day from work. When he came back the next day he found out that all his locks were changed and that she basically invited her new boyfriend into his home and did not allow him to go in and kick them out. He spoke with the officials and for some odd reason, even though he had proof that he was the owner of the home, they said they couldn't help him out.  What I wanted to know is, is all of that possible? Can the police really do nothing, and if not what CAN you actually do legally?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z8ufz?context=5)|I'm not an expert in property law, but that sounds pretty fishy. 
[In my area, the judge states that he does not have to sentence you to your signed deal. Is this true? What happens if he decides on a different sentence?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7zfk4b?context=5)|Generally speaking, all standard pleas contain a provision that if the judge sentences you outside of the accepted range in the deal, you can withdraw from the plea immediately and it's as if you never plead to anything. 
[I got carjacked at gunpoint in November2011 one suspect testified against the other One got q 5 year jail sentence an the other is still waiting trial.

You can have restitution ordered through the sentencing judge, but collecting on that would be difficult.
[If the person you're defending tells you they're guilty, that they actually committed the crime, do you still defend them and act as though their innocent? Do your morals get in the way, will you drop a client?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16t4e9/iama_criminal_defense_lawyer_ama/c7z9eju?context=5)|Generally speaking, someone's own interpretation of their guilt is meaningless because they're not familiar with the statutes they're accused of violating. Morals do get in the way at times, and I've turned down plenty of cases because of how I felt about a client or a specific crime.

16u35u,2,2013-01-18,I am targeting Tesla Motors and I need your help/suggestions.,ARHANGEL123,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/16u35u/i_am_targeting_tesla_motors_and_i_need_your/,"I am a senior EEE graduating this Spring with 3.8. I am also working as an undergrad researcher. I research off-grid energy flow models. In short I use Simulink to model off-grid homes with solar panels and local battery storage.  Recently, I've applied for my dream job - internship at Tesla Motors. I have excellent grades, and I am good with electronics and programming. However I realize that I have a few downfalls. First, my university is not the most affluent in the area (CSU Sacramento). I also realize that hundreds of people apply online with similar amounts of skills and it usually comes down to the numbers game - years of relevant experience, GPA, connections, and luck. In short, I have grades and relevant experience(batteries and sensors), but I have no connections and I don't rely on luck. Thus, I realize that if I don't remind Tesla's recruiters or HR about my existence the chance of me getting to the interview stage is approaching 0. I have no contact information for any of the Tesla recruiters or HR, neither does my school's career department.

I have applied online. Now where your help might come in handy. Do you have any suggestion on what to do to increase my chances? Any tips, suggestions, or advise would be appreciated. If someone knows a way to get noticed by the Tesla's recruiters or any other Tesla's engineers - I am all ears(well, an eyes in this case). Also on the off beat chance that someone knows a Tesla recruiter...


**tl;dr** Graduating, targeting Tesla Motors, need some advise to stand out from the crowd."

16sy6l,0,2013-01-18,The stare,KillTheKinderPS3,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/16sy6l/the_stare/,"I might as well start off by telling you who I am. I'm JJ. I live in a rural town with the population barely peaking over 500 people.  I'm unemployed living with my mother and my brother Ryan who is 8. I'm 18 and we get along just fine...until the night of December 18th through the 27th.
I am a heavy sleeper but my brother has insomnia and he just watches shitty cartoon reruns on the television. The night of December 18th, I was awoken by my brother telling me that he heard the sound of tiny pebbles being thrown at my window that points at my neighbor house across the street. ""JJ I'm scared, I think someone keeps hitting our window with rocks."" Pissed off, I said, ""Ryan you have school tomorrow, it's probably one of my friends trying to scare you."" He agreed and he finally fell asleep.

That was only the first night of these ""pebbles"" being thrown at my window. I know my friends would never do such a thing because I only have 1 best friend. 

I wake up mid morning on the 19th. Mom was at work and Ryan just left for school. As I was drinking my coffee, my curiosity kicks in. I thought to myself, ""My brother seemed terrified. I might as well go take a look outside."" As I open my front door I see my neighbor Dennis across the street. He is in his mid 60's and let me tell you, he is the strangest man I ever spoke to. ""Morning JJ"" He said to me smiling. I smiled and proceeded to my bedroom window. I get on my toes to see if there were any cracks in my window. Nothing. I laughed it off thinking my brother was too exhausted and heard things. To my amazement, I was wrong. Right in front of me were six pebbles about the size of my pinky nail. I looked behind me and saw Dennis smiling asking if I needed help. I shook my head no and went back inside.

Around 7 o'clock the in the evening everyone was settled in bed. I could hear my mom chatting with her boyfriend and the sound of Spongebob playing. Ryan asked me, ""JJ. You are tough. Will you fight off the bad guys who threw rocks at the window?"" ""Ryan!"" I yelled, ""there is no time for games. If you hear anything, wake me up."" He had no idea about the pebbles. 

Again, I woke up around 3 in the morning. ""JJ, I hear something outside. Please look, I'm scared."" I rolled out of bed to have a look. My vision is blurry, I didn't feel the need to put on my glasses. I faintly see Dennis watching television behind his faded curtains. Ryan creeps up behind me and whispers, ""No bad guys?"" ""No bad guys Ryan."" I went to the kitchen to start my coffee for the morning and all I hear are footsteps running towards me. ""JJ I LOOKED OUTSIDE AGAIN AND DENNIS LOOKED AT ME."" Ryan said in a quiet yell. I was still groggy and I held his hand and walked him to bed. 

""See? He is sleeping, no lights are on""
 ""But JJ I-""
 ""Ryan, Dennis is old. He probably wanted to see if it was raining.""

Ryan curls up in with his Spongebob blankets and passes out. (He is obsessed with Spongebob.) I stayed awake for the next hour wondering why Dennis up. This was not normal of him to be up this late. To sooth my thoughts I watched some television and went to bed.

The next day rolls by. I must have slept in. I heard my mother yell, ""Get up! I had dinner waiting an hour ago!"" I got up, threw on my glasses and ate some shitty T.V. dinner. Of course, nobody wanted to throw away the trash so I tied it up and left when I finished. Again, I see Dennis walking down the street. He smiled underneath the streetlight. He has this grin that makes his stick out like a sore thumb. Stained teeth with his wad of tobacco always in his lip with this grin that seemed to stare into my soul. I quickly went inside to play my video game.

I slowly started to pass out on the ancient couch. I finally passed out, but the last thought I had was about Dennis.

I was in mid dream and I heard someone fall. I look over at the Grandfather clock. I could only make out a 4. I glance over to see Ryan, nearly pale. ""Dude, you okay?"" He shakily answered, ""D-Dennis smiled at me through his window."" Hearing this made me think this had to be true. I told him to sleep with mommy while I talk to Dennis.

I open my front door and with a head of steam, marched across the vacant street. I knock. ""JJ my dear boy, you woke me up. What's the matter youngin'? Kids ding-dong ditchin' your house? Let me tell you the kids people do for entertainment nowadays."" I spoke about his voice and said, ""None of that sir. My brother keeps telling me you are looking at him through your window. Dennis looked extremely puzzled. ""Why no, I fell asleep hours ago. He shouldn't even be awake. It's Friday morning JJ. Doesn't he have a quiz tomorrow"" He smiled jokingly. I shook my head and told him I was going home.

Now nothing has happened for a few days. No noises, no Dennis. I cannot get him out of my mind. Is Ryan correct? He never does this. So the morning I call Aden, my best friend to tell him the situation. He tells to stop worrying about it and smoke more weed. Unfortunately, he is an pothead with barely any knowledge of anything at all but he does love my photos on my camera. He tells me I should try to be an intern for my paper. What a joke. He decided to stay over for the night for comfort. Again, no Ryan waking up. I now got Dennis out of my head.

I awaken on the 22st of December to the scrumptious smell of eggs and bacon. Of course, Aden ate most of it. I sat down with my mother and she tell me, ""Aden left. Sadly, I am going away for the weekend. However, I have a business meeting with my boss today about a promotion. We can move!"" I was relieved. ""But mom, what about Ryan? He is a ball of energy, how on Earth do I watch over him?"" She chuckled and said, ""Your  a big kid now. I need to go hunny. I love you."" She kisses me on the cheek and grabs her suitcase and off she went. For the remainder of the day I played video games with Ryan and talked about nonsense things with Aden over the phone.

As night comes along, I am exhausted. I guess smoking pot and staying up until 5 was a bad idea. I was about to go to bed but I went outside for some air and noticed Aden's can of chew was next to my window. I knew it was his because he always peeled off the wrappings around the Skoal can. Him and Dennis chew the same type of product, so they get along well. Dennis always talked about how Aden chews more than him, which is completely false. Dennis kills a can a day. I left Aden's chew where I found it and went inside for some shuteye. Again, no Ryan pushing me rapidly to wake me up. 

The next morning I took Ryan to the mall to see Santa and God damn was it annoying. Nothing annoys me more than little kids screaming for some imaginary figure. I told Ryan to go sit on his lap while I walk in to the tobacco shop for a cigar. Damn, 3.45 for this one cigar? Oh well. I went to purchased it. I got chills down my spine when I heard this old man's voice. ""My favorite type of cigar! Black and Mild!"" There he stood Dennis with a can of chew in his hand. I stuttered to get my words together. ""Yeah, I like this one."" I scrambled to find my brother getting his candy cane from Santa. He seemed so joyful.

 I took him home to play some Guitar Hero that Aden let me borrow. Out of randomness, he asked, ""JJ. What are you a-scared of?"" ""Getting any type of cancer."" He knew I smoked cigars on occasion. ""JJ. Stop smoking them then."" Pissed off, I responded. ""Time for bed. Mommy texted me."" Of course that was a lie. I took him to bed. Before I left the living room, he took my camera. ""Just in case I get scared at night, I will take a picture of Dennis' house."" Excitedly, I said, ""Hahaha, gonna be a photographer like me, eh?"" He smiled and went to bed. 

Nothing important happened the 26th; same shit, different day. The night of the 27th is where Ryan used my camera. I woke up to the sun beaming through my blinds. I know for a fact I did not put them down. I bump into my brother sleeping in my bed. He woke up with ease and said, ""JJ I heard something at the window. It was too scared to look so I took a picture. I don't know how to open the picture."" I grabbed it from him and turned it on. It died soon afterwards, which was strange because I charged it the day Aden left. I went to plug it into my computer in my mother's room, and the Sony camera program opened up. I clicked on the picture folder and Ryan did take a photo. After a minute and a large deep breath later, I forced myself to open it. I was in utter shock. Complete and utter shock. I saw I lip with chew packed in a lip with Aden's can. Etched on the top of the can said one word. Hello. It was Dennis. 

I cannot explain how much shock I am in now. I grabbed Ryan and took him in my car to Grandma's house. He loved it there so I know grandma will look after him for a few days until mom comes home. As soon I dropped him off, I quickly called Aden. It rang 4 times and went to voicemail. I called again and instantaneously he answered. One word was spoken over the phone. ""Hello."" Holy shit. That was Dennis and in the background I heard Aden's muffled voice. I could not make out a single word of his. I'm on my way to Dennis' house now. I will get back to you guys as soon as I can. Don't bother calling the cops. They are more worried about robberies and shootings."
16sx5m,4,2013-01-18,"I'm thinking about going back to rehab because it would save my life, but it's complicated.",champnag,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/16sx5m/im_thinking_about_going_back_to_rehab_because_it/,"I'm 19 years old and I'm going to die at a very young age if I don't stop.

I went into detox late November, but my treatment was costing me $320 a day out of pocket. I was only there for 5 &amp; half days and when my counselor mentioned keeping me another 21-30 I snapped. The combination of losing access to the internet, financial costs, and hellish withdraws made me miserable. 

I was addicted to alcohol and klonopin and was pretty bad with my addiction. After they did an assessment on me I was rated ""moderate to severe."" I could of died from the withdraws. I deteriorated the lining of my stomach so bad it got infected about a year ago. I was puking blood and spent a day in the hospital. 

The biggest reason for me not to go is the financial cost, and I'm still enrolled in college and the semester started this week. I know very well that most of my money goes towards drugs so I've probably spent anywhere from 4-6 grand just this year. I can make arrangements to get my schooling taken care of, or I can drop out and risk my completion rate. I'll also have to admit to all my family and friends that I've been lying about my drug use again, but I have lied about it for years so this shouldn't be an issue. 

I have done great things though while doing drugs. I got a great internship for a fortune 500 company my senior year in high school. My current and previous managers love me and compliment my work frequently. I had a 3.2 GPA and I was about to get into the honors society (last semester was rough.) Admittedly I've gotten progressively worse but I have always been powerless to drugs. 

Typing this out has really helped, but I know it's not a cure. I love drugs and I know I'm just going to get worse. I would be lying if I said I didn't want to die. Life just doesn't seem worth it most of the time. I don't really have anyone to talk to, and I think I've struggled with adversity most of my life. I was molested by my older cousin and my father till I was like 10 or so. I have memories of abuse happening in every house I lived in. I was in 1st-3rd grade when it ended. I don't have a good recollection of my childhood, in fact a lot of these memories were repressed. I remember nearly every Saturday morning well. My dad and step-mother would joke about how much I loved sleeping because they would have to get me out of bed at noon, but in reality it's the exact opposite. I have insomnia and have a very, very difficult time falling asleep without any drugs. I used to just lie in bed because I was safe there and to afraid to leave my room. My dad later told me he took medication for OCD and anger. He would become irate over the littlest things so I was constantly on edge. The custody was changed to where I only saw him when I wanted when I was 10-13 years old, so I didn't see him as much after that but the damage had already been done. I briefly tried moving in with them when I graduated high school, but he yelled to one of my young brothers ""I'm gonna kick your fucking ass"" because my brother was being too loud and I changed my mind. 

I haven't really talked to him much since June 2011. I'm happy about it but I get really, really depressed when I think about my two younger brothers. I miss them so much I'm nearly crying typing this out. I can't be there to protect them. They are obese and get picked on a lot. They are twins and I caught them giving each other handjobs once so I'm pretty sure they were molested by our father too. 

The last time I talked with my father he told me he has serious migraines now and spends a lot of time lying down. I couldn't be happier to hear it. I know that a lot of kids will sometimes say that they wished their parents were dead but I've never really been like that. I hope he lives a very long life and I'm happy knowing it's miserable.

My mother isn't a great person and makes mistakes. My mom started giving me drugs and I eventually gave her drugs too. She divorced my father when I was about 2. She was having an affair on my step-father while he was in Iraq and Kosovo (he's in the Marines), they divorced when he got back and I was maybe 12. My mom left me home alone a lot of nights. I remember I loved it because I could watch girls gone wild all night and later I could do dangerous drugs but in retrospect that wasn't good for me. I would be a lot harder on my mom, but I feel really bad for her because she has worked really hard for me and her boyfriend is abusive. We don't talk much. Most of our conversations end in arguments. To give you an idea of what my mom is like I'll provide a little story. I had a memory of seeing my dad in the door frame of my room one really late night. He asked me if I was awake and he was naked. When I first thought about how scared I was of him that moment I started having a panic attack. I told my mom about this memory and she tried to kick me out of the house. Her reasoning was that she is miserable being around me and didn't want me around her. I really, really want to move out, but I have no idea where to begin. 

I also live with the guilt of physically and mentally handicapping a toddler, but it's a long story. The tldr is that I was supposed to be watching him, but I was watching TV. So the 2 year old plummeted down a spiral metal staircase. 

I really wish I was stronger than this. I'm trying keep my chin up and be positive but it's getting difficult. I have thought about committing suicide often. Honestly the only thing that keeps me going are drugs. I sometimes wish I could be religious or spiritual, but I'm too bitter. The world seems so dark. I think it's very sad that I'm wasting my life because I have so many great opportunities.

If you took the time to read my life story I thank you. I know it's long and not particularly uplifting.

edit* I guess I should mention that my major is human services and I'd like to be a CPS agent or mental therapist. I want a job where I help people but I can't even help myself. I also posted this in r/depresson"

16vlfm,7,2013-01-19,Combining internship with freelance work (newbie web-developer)? Also: What exactly is an internship?,solid_steel,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/16vlfm/combining_internship_with_freelance_work_newbie/,"I want to break into the web-development field. I already made the first steps, I have a website, a portfolio of code, and I contribute to opensource a bit.

After looking for entry-level jobs on CS and a bunch of other sites, I see that entry-level means ""at least a year of this, this, that, and this"", which I don't exactly meet. So I started looking for internships and I have two interviews setup next week, which is pretty damn sweet.

I know this will sound funny to most of you but - what exactly is an internship? The ads only mentioned 15-20 hours of work per week, one mentioned a stipend and the other a ""daily rate"". How reliable are internships? What can I expect salary-wise?

My second set of questions pertain to freelance work. I have a goal amount of money I need to make in 7 months so I thought that in addition to an internship I could do freelance web-design/dev. I found that online freelancing services are flooded with workers from the near, middle, and far east so I was hoping to set up shop locally ie. cold call local businesses, present my offer, and maybe snag business. Does this seem viable in New York City?

Maybe I should ditch my dream job for now and go for steadier employment as a PC helpdesk/support as I already have some experience and certification in that field - I really need about 7k$ by August so I have to choose the best route?

I'd really appreciate any input on this as I'm pretty new to NYC and the US in general. Thank you very much!

edit: P.S I also thought of contacting HR people (or people involved in the company) directly with my resume and a cover letter as well as a solution I could supply to one of their problems. That way I could expand my job search from merely looking over CS/Monster/etc.. Is this sort of contact acceptable? Is it a good idea?"

16v13u,3,2013-01-18,"The First ""Hunt""",Keelan13,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/16v13u/the_first_hunt/,"Like many people, I’m a fan of the TV series *Supernatural*. I was actually fortunate enough to intern as a college student doing script coverage for Warner Bros. when Kripke was trying to get the pilot picked up and got to read a few early drafts of the first script; so it goes without saying I was a fan [technically] before there even was a series.

But people, please…stop with all the rock salt solutions to everyone’s problems. Yes, salt has its place among items to be used, but it isn’t a preventative measure and it certainly doesn’t apply to 90% of what the masses seem to think.

=ahem= Anyway, as I was starting to say: I have all the seasons on DVD, the comics, the novels (those that have been released, anyway; others I have pre-ordered), have worn a replica of Dean’s old amulet every day for the past 6 years, and even have the RPG books, though I’ve never played a session. So it should come as no surprise that, considering my fondness for the show plus my already lifelong interest in the paranormal and occult, I started to write my own Hunter Journal.

For the most part, this is filled with information on different topics, rather academically. Histories and theories behind different spirits and creatures, different ways in which to protect oneself, and basically anything that would come to be found as helpful should such things ever be encountered. Of course, it wouldn’t be complete without a few entries of personal experiences, so I’m going to share some of them with you, much like I started to with my previous entry (“A Childhood Memory” http://redd.it/15uiuk ). There’s an occasional use of colorful phrases (much like Dean, I’m a natural smartass and pretty great at it when it counts), so just roll with them when they happen.

When I was around 12 or 13, I met a kid named James, who very quickly became one of my best friends. We got along well right off the bat. It didn’t take me long to notice there was a little bit of unease to the dude (I’m definitely an introvert, and one thing we’re good at is noticing human behavior and picking up on patterns and other little things most don’t see), and at some point he started to talk to me about having seen things in the condo that he and his family were living in.

One thing he described was a pair of green eyes looking at him from through an air-vent high up on the wall in his bedroom. Now, knowing me, I probably made some smartass joke, but once James didn’t react I knew he was being serious. So we started talking about it all some more. He told me about a time he hopped over the back of the couch to land on it and watch TV… and the couch moving so he dropped to the floor instead in a reverse belly-flop. My mind started to analyze things (yes, even at that young age I was quite the nerd; learn to love it), trying to figure out what was scaring my new friend, and what I could do to stop it. I’ve always been a bit of a “Peter Parker” like that, so I always help someone who needs it if I can, and this seemed an important time that I happen to have that trait. Feeling that I needed a little more verification than “I think *this*,” James and I opted to get a little more information.

Without knowing it, Doc and I (“Doc” is a nickname I’ve called him for many years now, so just keep it in mind they’re the same person in case I switch back and forth during the rest of the story) were about to have a serious meeting with some *thing*.

His mother was alone at the condo watching a Godzilla marathon or something, so Doc and I seized the opportunity to go to the local library. We found a small selection there dealing with ghosts and spirits and hauntings and all other aspects of parapsychology. After looking through about half of them, one of us came across a book primarily about Poltergeists. A good deal of what was mentioned in the book regarding the behaviors of poltergeists and what Doc said was going on happened to fit almost perfectly. Add to that the fact that he had three younger sisters, and two of which were about to approach puberty; this coincided with the theory connecting energies of such developmental events and the spirits, so we felt we had enough evidence to make a positive ID.

Skimming through the book some more, we found a chapter talking about ways to confront and banish the spirit, mostly through equalizing the energies stored within the home environment. Armed with knowledge and now a means to strike, we decided to waste no time and went into action (what can I say but we were young and foolish).

We knew immediately that something was off when we got back to the condo.

For starters, the place was wide open. I mean the front door, gate to the back, garage door and the door from the garage to the kitchen, all open. Doc’s family had two huskies (Gambit and Wolvie) that would have been running around the area like crazy…but they were nowhere to be found. Inside, the condo was empty. No person was there, which caught us off guard as we expected his mother to still be there. Most electronics were on; lights, the microwave, the TV (which was picking up white noise but no sound) and a radio somewhere upstairs.

Doc went upstairs to turn off the radio, also closing the front door while he was at it. I opted to close up the garage area. Leaning in at the kitchen door, I pressed the switch to shut the rolling door and heard a thump! from next to me. One of the knives from a kitchen drawer (now open when it wasn’t before) was stuck in the door frame next to my hand; far enough not to have posed a risk, but close enough to send a clear message.

I just didn’t care what this thing had to say. “Honey badger don’t give a shit” mentality going on there.

When Dog got back and we turned everything off, we decided to look room-by-room, starting upstairs. Other than the silence of the place, nothing seemed off upstairs; not visually, anyway. So we proceeded to look downstairs, with the same result. James wanted to look into where the dogs may have been, so he opened the sliding door from the living room to the back (which was also the only door that remained shut when we first arrived) to find two dead sparrows on the mat outside, facing each other. This seriously had him freaked out, for a few reasons:

a)	The dogs would have chewed the shit out of the birds if they were around.
b)	There were two of us and two birds; symbolism is sorta in your face on that one.
c)	The way they were placed on the mat was too aligned for it to have been done any way but intentionally.

We braved the situation and looked about the back. Zero signs of what may have happened or where the dogs may have gone to.
Through the blinds of the room upstairs that doc and his uncle shared, he saw what looked like the silhouette of a person standing in the room looking down at us. I told him “don’t take your eyes off it” and bolted back into the house, up the stairs and into the room. Nothing was there, so I went to the window to open the blinds to see if James saw anything move. Nothing had, he told me.

James was so scared at this point that he just wanted to leave. We went back to my house so he could calm down and so we could figure out our next move. It took a while and some convincing, but he finally got himself together enough to go back. When we got there we were greeted by his mother, who apparently hadn’t left that day. In fact, she had been recording the movies on VHS and had to manually pause the recording to edit out the commercial breaks. The dogs were also present and just fine, for those wondering. :P

I don’t remember what it was Doc decided to try from the book in the end, but things sort of stopped after that. What I do remember is that shortly after Doc told his step-dad (who was a relatively faithful Jehova’s Witness), the family up and moved. Whatever it was didn’t follow them, and as far as I’ve been able to observe with my occasional trips through my hometown, hasn’t been active at the condo either.

Not sure if that means the first “hunt” was actually a success or not, but at least it didn’t turn into a total train wreck, right? Clusterfucks right out the door are sort of a bad way to start off your record.

Now at this point in time, we’ve obviously gotten older and acquired a fair deal more of knowledge. When first writing this entry into my journal, I started to look closer at all the events that happened. Looking back at the behaviors of what we encountered, I [finally] started looking at those that didn’t fit what poltergeists were known to do, rather than only giving attention to those that nearly perfectly fit…I’m no longer so convinced what we encountered was a poltergeist after all."

[It's a lost thing.  Not an actual question. But to make me seem like not a total time waster, besides reddit, what do you do to keep yourself entertained?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c8011dh?context=5)|Well for the first week and half or so we were in transit to our first buoy. So that was rough, i had infinite time to do whatever. There is a bench out on the fantail that I like to sit on and watch the flying fish do their thing. I can normally kill an hour or so out there at any given time. I also brought The Illiad and The Odyssey and I have been reading that. Every now and then I'll help launch a weather balloon.
 |But since we actually got to the buoy I have been relatively busy, taking samples and what not. And we are there to recover and replace the buoys, which takes about 10 hours so there are always parts of that process that are fun to watch.
[What do the buoys do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c806fnn?context=5)|They record basic measurements like air-temp, wind speed, precip, sea surface temp, salinity, etc. These get beamed back to land to watch out for hurricanes and such.
 |The buoys track the basic parameters like air temp, wind speed, precip, humidity, sea surface temp, salinity, etc.
[So you're all within the realm of meteorology? What other sciences get to go out on boats? I figure marine biology would be one...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c80h6fm?context=5)|There are oceanographers here, engineers, chemists, and meteorologists. As there are no animals be researched, marine biology is not one of them.
[What is your role on the ship? Research or crew? Both?  And proof. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c7zzq51?context=5)|I am research, doing the above work. As for proof, is there a way to upload a picture on here that isn't like a link to an imagur host? I am kind of new to reddit.
[Ah, can you explain roughly what your research is?  No, it needs to be an imagehost.  Snag.gy is a site where you can print screen right into, cut the image and hit save. The link is postable here. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c8004rf?context=5)|I am with a group of scientists that have a variety of jobs. One group is doing some aerosol work (the kinds of particulates in the air, how big they are, and to what abundance), another group is here to recover and replace an array if bouys that monitor basic weather conditions for the area, and I work with the group collecting water samples along the way.
[I think you might be on the boat that my boyfriend will be boarding in a few weeks for his own cruise. He just told me where it is now and what's happening, and your stories line up... quite nicely. :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c8058q8?context=5)|Interesting, where is he slated to go?
[That is facinating.  Where do you guys ship out from? Are you an international crew? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c8009sq?context=5)|The ship I think is ported in Charleston, SC? I am not 100%, though. The crew is not international, but the buoys we are servicing are owned by the US, Brazil, and France. Or at least the program that put them out there is run by them.
[Im not sure how you are connected with the politics of the project, but do you think that research is getting more and more international with less problems due to it being several countries involved?  What I am trying to ask is: Earlier on there seemed to be a problem with countries using research as a power play. Is that something you guys see anything of now, or is the research shared?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c800fxd?context=5)|Well I can only give my very limited opinion. This array of buoys has been around for nearly a decade I think, so this particular venture is nothing new. The kinds of cruises like the one I am on don't typically have foreign scientists, but the hardware itself could be a multi-national thing. I don't think I really answered your question and I'm sorry, but I am not quite ""in the know"" on that one.
[Thats ok. I was just curious. It seems to me that if you don't know about it, it is probably less of a problem. If it was massive you would probably hear people moan about it.  Thank you for your time, sir/sirette. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c800lb6?context=5)|Sir :) thanks for the questions.
[Have you seen any sharks or whales?? If so, what kinds?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c800lql?context=5)|No sharks, and I don't think whales are migrating in this area this time of year. I've seen some squid, mahi-mahi, tuna, and this one gull that got stuck on our ship too far from land that I named Petree. Oh and dolphins, and someone said they saw a loggerhead turtle.
[Is Petree still there? Is he ok? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c800u72?context=5)|I haven't seen him in a few days :( there was a big storm a couple days ago and I think it may have blown him away.
[Sounds amazing!  I'm studying marine biology so you are living my fantasy right now!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c800oth?context=5)|I have a good friend who studies marine biology at Oregon State, she says the same thing. I am hoping for some more animals when we get closer to land, but we'll see!
[What are you using for internet connection?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c7zztrq?context=5)|It is all satellite driven I think. It isn't particularly strong, sometimes I can't even download pdf files.
[That sucks... PDF is the greatest electronic text format. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c806l2v?context=5)|Heard that.
[Is it frightening at all? Is this your first time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c800ydi?context=5)|This is my first time (and I am the only one on board who hasn't been on a cruise before) and there have been a couple scary moments. About 3 hours after we left port, we ran fire, man overboard, and abandon ship drills. That was all well and good, but about 45 minutes later there was an actual fire! One of the 3 generators blew up! We almost turned around at that point, but they fixed it up.
 |And then just tonight, we have gotten into some higher winds and are we pitching pretty good. We had a series of strong pitches and I guess something got knocked loose, but the power went out on the whole ship. So that was terrifying. I had to remind myself that I wasn't on a plane and power did not necessarily equate to flotation. But we are up and running again, about 3 days from land!
[One of the biggest fears that I have is of being on a boat/ship out in a large body of water for an extended period of time.  The *idea of the* isolation and inability to leave the confines of whatever functioning piece of flotilla that would keep me above the vast depths of the ocean, without any land in site, almost sends me over the edge thinking about it.  Do you have any fears such as this?  Do any of the other crew?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c80237m?context=5)|I imagine the crew forgot those fears a long time ago, this isn't their first rodeo after all. I was certain I would be a little scared of the isolation and the night, but so far I have surprised myself. The ship is state of the art, and I trust the crew explicitly. Although, I did have a panic attach my first week because I was seasick and just could not escape it anywhere on the ship. I feared I would go crazy from not being able to get away from the churning for the next 5 weeks, but that too, has passed.
[Bonine.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c80evfy?context=5)|Huh, i've never heard of it but ill look into it. ive been taking meclizin and phenogrin.
[What is it like being stuck on a tiny boat that long?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c7zzz6t?context=5)|The first week was terrible. There was a huge low pressure system that kicked up some nasty swells. This is my first cruise, so I got pretty seasick. Since then I've been on some good medication so I have come to really enjoy the ride. It is strange to wake up to the same horizon every day, but I enjoy the company of the crew and the other scientists so that helps. 
[Do you think that Gravol would work for suppressing seasickness?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c80648v?context=5)|I dont know what that is?
[What is your profession exactly that allowed you on the ship with the buoy guys? Do buoys ever get destroyed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c8013fu?context=5)|I am intern kind of thing, I'm a meteorology student at Texas A&amp;M. The other scientists though are research scientists at various labs and Universities around the country.
 |Buoys can get damaged, or even vandalized. We recovered one yesterday that had a crack down the side, probably from a boat running into it. And we recovered one today that had some missing instruments, likely stolen by fishermen.
[Why would fisherman want to steal weather monitoring instruments? Aside from the obvious ""to monitor the weather"", I'm assuming they are relatively hi-tech and require a special understanding to either operate or extract data, so yeah, why take them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c80c4cy?context=5)|Exactly, they may steal them to sell for parts. also, they could have just fallen off in inclement weather, but somehow i doubt that.
[How frustrating. Don't they know there's science happening?!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c8059xj?context=5)|They must, they know it will get replaced in a year so they can come back and steal some more.
[Can you fish off the boat or is there generally not much to catch where you are?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c7zzztt?context=5)|Well these buoys that we are servicing develop there own little ecosystems. They are the only things out there for thousands of miles, so fish hang around them. It takes about 10 hours to recover and replace a buoy, so we fish off the side. So far we caught a few tuna and a baby mahi-mahi. The tuna we sent up to the cooks for dinner, the mahi we threw back.
[When you replace the buoy, what do you do with the stuff scraped off the old one?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c806hf5?context=5)|Throw it overboard, normally its just barnacles and stuff.

[What kind of research are you doing that requires you to be at sea so long?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c7zzp00?context=5)|I am with a group of scientists that have a variety of jobs.

A couple days ago we had the huuuge storm kick up in about an hour. Completely out of nowhere. We watched it roll in and right over us around sunset, made the water turn red and bloody looking. It was very cool. I'll upload a pic if I get time.
[Op will deliver.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c8084y9?context=5)|I updated with those pics.

Best part of the trip so far has been the views, the sky is so big and you can just see all these storms develop without any obstruction. the worst was the seasickness i had the first week. suuucked!
[How much personal space and free time do you have?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c8001wb?context=5)|Well the first 10 days or so have been just transit. We have to get to where we are going before the science can happen, so I have had nothing BUT free time for awhile. I only just thought about doing this tonight. I have my own stateroom, but I share a bathroom. And there is always somewhere on deck I can sit quietly if I need some fresh air.
[I dated a girl who worked on one of these vessels years ago. She emailed me that she had written me a letter and would post it when they reached the ""mail buoy.""

[What are the various ways in which computers and applications help you study the ocean? Are they developed in-house or do you ask vendors to develop them (hardware and software\)? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c802xhj?context=5)|We have a room just dedicated to our mainframe, keeping our computers up and running, satellites and what not. I don't know anything terribly specific as far as what hardware we have, but we use computers in almost all the science we do. They track the weather balloons we launch, the probes we drop in the ocean, and buoys we are tracking down. Computers help us analyze and compile the data for later use. I pretty much don't understand how we did science without them.

[Why the Atlantic? Why in the middle? Why now? What's your average day like? What's for breakfast?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c808h4s?context=5)|Woah. The Atlantic because that is where the buoys we are servicing are at. Now, because that is when we got funding to go. My average day consists of browsing the web, doing homework, reading, and occasionally working. That will change in a couple days when I will have a 12 hour shift. And I never make it up for breakfast, so unfortunately nothing.
[What are you researching? where are you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c803210?context=5)|There are 3 groups here doing stuff and I am with a group taking water samples along the way. We analyze them for oxygen and salinity concentrations throughout the water column. We can use that to calibrate buoys in the area and the values goes online for other researchers to access for their projects. Can't say where I am exactly right now, just tropical Atlantic.
[Vary interesting are you also testing for plankton levles? hope you don't get seasick and look for turtles.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c818541?context=5)|No plankton levels on this cruise, but at night i can see their bioluminescence which is cool. I did get seasick the first week, but that has passed thankfully. No turtles as of yet, but I heard one person saw a loggarhead somewhere.

[That is really awesome, man! and thanks for the response! sounds like a pretty amazing experience!  for water column samples, is there a set depth on which you guys are basing from? how deep do you guys read to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c80j325?context=5)|Well we sink our instrument and it gives us readings of temp, salinity, and oxygen. then based on those profiles we pick depths that look interesting or are stable enough to represent that area of the water column. we typically don't go deeper than 1500m.
[How do you and the other scientists on the ship balance work and play, so to speak? Is work around the clock or sporadic? What sort of activities are there when you're not working? Is the work itself any fun?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whqf/i_am_on_a_research_vessel_in_the_middle_of_the/c807gu2?context=5)|Well the first 10 days have been just transit for us, there hasn't been a whole lot of work to do. So we have all the time in the world to ""play"". When we get to where we are going, then we will have 12 hour shifts that have intermittent spurts of free time every 4 hours or so that give us some free time. We have to do something besides work every now and then or we would go bat shit crazy!
 |When we aren't working, I typically stick to my computer and read a book. I'll sit outside and watch the flying fish do their thing every now and then. When we get to a buoy we fish off the side of the ship, which is fun. The work itself is fun to me! Very hands on and science-y so I like that kind of stuff.

Thanks in advance

Thank you all for the quick responses, 

This is what the glass looked like,

It currently seems like ill have to wait till around May when the glasses are being distributed for the festival,  i have already apologized profusely to him and bought him lunch and he has been very easy going about it which almost makes me feel worse.  I'm going to read into all of your responses and hopefully figure out a way that isn't a headache for anyone to help me out and also a way to figure out shipping funds and funds for the glass.  I haven't told him i'm doing this yet but hopefully i can surprise him since he only brought back a couple things from Germany.

170ohb,3,2013-01-21,"[X-post from /r/advice] Was already feeling very overwhelmed from having to balance school, work, and feeling like I have to figure everything out right now. And then I got broken up with yesterday. I don't know how to handle all of this.",throwaway_098765,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/170ohb/xpost_from_radvice_was_already_feeling_very/,"Sorry this is a bit long.

I made a post about the break-up in /r/breakups [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/16zfyv/my_now_ex_i_supposegirlfriend_just_ended_our/). I miss her like crazy and wish I didn't have to completely give her up. That there was some way we could still be friends, because I know we both want to. Some way to stop missing her, or feeling the way I do, so I could at least keep her as a friend.

But I guess that's not really the only point of this post...

I had already been feeling a little alone lately, because I just started  community college in the Fall, and I don't really have any friends that I actually see there. And I can't say I've really found anyone that I feel like I would actually ever hang out with outside of class, and since I'm going to school full time, and I'm working, I feel like I never have time to hang out with people anyways. And being with her always made me feel better. Even if I saw the break-up coming. She was my best friend, and the only person I was actually comfortable talking too. Having to cut her out completely makes me feel just so much more alone. And work is so mindless, all I ever end up doing is over thinking everything. Now I'm probably just going to end up thinking about her non-stop while I'm there.

I also feel like I have to figure everything out in my life right now. I'm in college, but I have absolutely no idea what I want to do. How do I even find out where to start? Hell, I'm only in school right now because I feel like I have to be. I have no over-all goal in being there. Maybe if I knew what I wanted to do, I'd at least have that to work towards. I hate all this pressure. What I really want right now, is figure out what I want to do, and just find an internship in it. Learn there on the job instead of going to school, because to be quite honest, I just kind of suck at school. 

I think the last thing that's really contributing to me feeling so overwhelmed is just time in general. I feel like I'm either at school, or at work. I never have time to myself, and when I do, it's either too late, or not enough time to really do anything with anyone. Plus they have different schedules than I do anyways. 

I honestly don't feel like I have any motivation to get up in the morning. If I didn't have to go to school or work, I probably wouldn't. I really have where my life has been, but I have no idea how to fix it. I feel powerless to really change anything, and incredibly alone, even though I know I have a few people I could talk to, I'm not really comfortable with anyone. I've always been such a closed person, I donno how to not be. I really just want someone to hold, and be together with through this.

I know the economy has been better and whatnot, but you can get a job right out of college if you're driven.  

The ""experience paradox"" as I like to call it is a huge barrier for entry to recent grads.  You can't get a job without experience, but you can't get experience without a job, now can you?  This is the unfortunate state of many industries right now.

There is a solution, however.  **Internships.** Some paid, most not.  If you're a student, you should be interning over the summer before your senior year, and if you can find an internship during the semester, go for it as well.  Gaining this experience as a student not only allows you to learn far more at a younger age, but it also makes you much more hireable than your peers right after graduation.

Recent grads are usually not OK with this. There are bills to pay, family keeps asking you what you're doing now, etc.  The last thing you want to do is take a job where you may not get paid.  And let's be honest, the word *intern* has a sort of stigma about it.

This is where you have to weigh your options.  If you get an internship and really kick ass, it should only take a few months before you're hired on (maybe 2-3 depending on if there's an opening).  If nothing else, you now have the experience to apply for a job job, henceforth referred to as a jerb.  You can work part time or weekends at another job to help with the cash flow.  You're young.  Live off of ramen and PB&amp;J for a while, sleep on your moms couch or find a place via craigslist.

Paid internships!  They exist! They are usually more competitive, so get your resume/portfolio etc together!  I'm in advertising, so an application for an internship might require me to make a short video, write an obscure essay or complete some weird task and document it.  Put in the effort to make a great application, because the internship will be worth it.

The bottom line - This is your future.  You can make it what you want.  Put in the grunt work now while you're young and can afford to, and you will have a much better chance at landing your dream job.  Don't wind up miserable for the rest of your life.

I am currently majoring in Computer Engineering and minoring in Economics at a top engineering school. I love working with technology and coming up with innovative solutions to problems. I currently have an on-going internship (co-op) at an IT department in a large law firm.

After graduation, I have two routes I could go. A strict technical route and try to get a job in Software Engineering at a tech company, or try my hand at consulting. I have done a few case competitions and I am a member of my school's consulting club, so I do have some knowledge of consulting. I enjoy that it requires the same level of analytical thinking that I like in computer science work.

So my question to you is, what are my possibilities in the field of consulting? I have read a lot about management consulting vs. IT consulting and although I think recruiters would look to me for IT, I think I would enjoy management more. What can I do now that will better prepare me for a job in consulting? What kind of opportunities are there for growth? What about MBA school?I am a sophomore, and after my current co-op, I will have a chance to apply for a summer internship in 2014. What companies should I look into?

Thanks, I would love to hear your input!"

I don't want to get ahead of myself here, but I have an interview with Accenture in about a week or so and I'm wondering if anyone here could tell me what working for the company is like?

I've read some small reviews on glassdoor.com and indeed.com but I want to know, specifically from someone in a software engineering role what day to day life is like with them.

At the moment I have a somewhat cushy job within the local government. Though I have a B.S degree in CS as of December, I'm still being paid an ""intern"" wage as there are currently no higher up roles.

I make about $35K a year and they are also willing to pay for me to get a masters degree (I've already been accepted, though I'm not sure if it's for me).

So, to cut to the chase, my questions are, if I were to pass the interview...

* From a salary point of view, would accepting the job be worth it?

* What is the work/life balance like at Accenture? I know a lot of people say the work overtime.

* What is this ""bench"" I hear about for consulting companies, do you get paid while on it, is there a danger in being there? 

* Is the job secure? (My current one does not pay much but I don't see them getting rid of me anytime soon).

* Any other advice/insights about the company are welcome.

Thanks."

What I learned: This is a lie.

Situation now: Living alone without worrying about scheming, asshole roommates.

How to be a godawful roommate. (True stories. Disclaimer: probably lots of grammatical errors but in a fit of anger, don't care)

1. Bring your 37 year old boyfriend with little notice when you told me that it would just be you and myself.

2. Bring your 37 year old boyfriend who just got his antidepressants.

3. Bring your 37 year old boyfriend who, on the day we had to unpack and move everything in the apartment, decided to go drinking and chat up the bartender instead.

4. Be the 37 year old boyfriend who decides to throw a fit at me for using the vacuum to clean the apartment when your girlfriend already ok'ed me using said vacuum.

5. Be the 37 year old boyfriend who decided to get trashed and came out to the living room in skimpy underwear when I had guests over. 

6. Be the 37 year old boyfriend who made my guests uncomfortable while wearing skimpy underwear in the living room.

7. Be the 37 year old boyfriend who has the balls to tell me that I live off other people when you're the one who lives off unemployment checks from California. You do remember you told me that you had the checks shipped to a PO box which was then shipped to NYC, remember? How was I the one who lived off others when I had a full-time internship which led to a full-time job?

8. Be the 37 year old boyfriend who got mad at me for touching your girlfriend's boobs (I'm a gay man and you know this). Storm into your room, tell me to ""FUCK OFF"" and then give me the silent treatment for 2 months after I apologized for hurting your feelings.

9. Be the 37 year old boyfriend who decides to get drunk then storm into my room while I'm not there, take your shoes off, then drinks a full can of beer on my bed and leave it there when you're done.

10. Be the 37 year old boyfriend who yells at me for asking your girlfriend to not let you go into my room anymore.

11. Be the girlfriend who gets mad at me for asking you to tell your boyfriend ONE thing after complaining to me all year about your boyfriend. Oh, that's right. You don't want to get involved, you dumb bitch.

12. Be the girlfriend and 37 year old boyfriend who tells me that management companies can only ship deposit checks to ONE address and they would rather have their address on it because ""Not that we don't trust you or anything, we'd just rather have it sent to us."" Aren't you the one who defaulted on all your credit cards and you're still living off your unemployment?
NOTE: I called the management company, they ship to multiple addresses. The look on your face when I told you this was PRICELESS.

13. Be the 37 year old boyfriend who loses their wallet and asks me to lend them money after ALL THIS SHIT HAPPENS.

14. Be my former coworker who asked me to move in with them because ""you trusted me.""

15. Be my former coworker roommate who asks me to buy a $1,000 couch after nixing all of the options I wanted. You ask me to get it first so we can split the costs. After I get said couch, you tell me ""You know, I think what you buy should just be yours and what I buy should just be mine.""

16. Be my former coworker roommate who then uses the couch way more often than I have ever used it.

17. Be my former coworker roommate who tells me that ""I bring very negative energy"" when I've never heard that from anyone in my entire life.

18. Be my former coworker roommate who when I told you the ballpark of what I make at the company we used to work for, tell me that ""they overpay me for what I do.""

19. Be my former coworker roommate who brings your boyfriend over and then have the boyfriend borrow my boots and don't return them until I ask them if they had it.

20. Be my former coworker roommate who walks in and anytime I'm cooking something, say to me, ""That smells disgusting/gross/bad."" Then when I'm done cooking, ask me ""Can I have some?""

21. Be my former coworker roommate who blames me for not finding someone quickly enough to take over my room when you told me that you would take the reins of finding someone.

22. Be my former coworker roommate who NEVER refills any of the paper towels/toilet paper. Get mad at me for when I ask you to refill it ONCE.

Along the way you'll learn everything there is to know -- and more -- about email marketing and managing a hugely popular daily email list.

**Responsibilities:**

• Work 15-40 hours per week from our offices at 40 Berkeley Street in Boston's vibrant South End.

• Help design and implement the tools we need to keep us running smoothly.

• Manage and help design our website.

• Research and recommend ways to automate and streamline our operations.

• Work with a team of talented, passionate people to help fulfill our immense vision.

**Qualifications: (If the following descriptions apply to you, you will be enormously successful here!)**

• Scrappy: You're a GSD person - the type of person who Gets Sh*t Done, no matter what. You're scrappy, entrepreneurial, and highly execution-oriented. Once you're pointed in the right direction, you make things happen with gusto!

• Passionate: You're excited about our mission, a perfectionist in your work, and ready to work hard to help us succeed!

• Techie: You love everything about computers and technology. In your spare time you taught yourself a new scripting language just for fun and you never back down from a challenge.

**Specifically, we’re looking for someone who has experience with linux email servers, the latest scripting languages, PHP, MySQL, Javascript/Jquery, AJAX, creating database backups using Linux Terminal and parsing Excel files into an HTML format. Top notch Excel skills and great documentation habits are also highly desirable.**


Interested? To apply, send me a PM telling me about a problem that you solved and what technologies you implemented. What methods did you try that failed? What did you learn from the project? Write up a paragraph or two about the experience and be sure to highlight your role. What are you waiting for? We're going to change the world (really). Come help us and learn a lot doing it!"

I made sure that I sent thank you notes to the interviewers and follow up with them via email or by phone. 

Last week, I completed a freelance copywriting project for a local digital marketing agency... but all I hear is silence. The work that I have done for that agency was content for their new website and now I have emailed and left messages and no one wants to contact me. It's like they forgot we were under a contract.....

I've had two prominent in-person interviews and I was supposed to hear back from both parties last week. Nothing... If I did not get the job or second interview, that's fine. I'm used to rejection since I graduated from college in 2009. But at least tell me. I feel like this waiting around is not healthy and that I should be doing something more productive with my time but I can't because I have no source of income and my professional career hangs in the balance. 

I've been patient for over 3 years now, working my ass off. I'm tired of being on hiring managers' and potential employers' Standard Time. I hope daylight savings time comes around the corner so I can move 1 hour forward pass all the BS and lack of genuine concern for long-time underemployed and unemployed Americans who want to work.

173wvi,0,2013-01-23,Do you enjoy MegaMan? So do I.,J-dazzy,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/173wvi/do_you_enjoy_megaman_so_do_i/,"Hello everyone,


I'd like to ask a few questions regarding a project I am going to be beginning quite soon. I am hoping to receive some advice from more experienced developers and enthusiasts to aid me in a few decisions. First and foremost, let me introduce myself. My name is Jordan Curd. I am currently a senior at NCSU, majoring in Computer Science and concentrating in Game Development. Although I've spent much of my life dabbling in game development, I had the opportunity to work at an indie dev in the Raleigh, NC area last summer. They are called Mighty Rabbit Studios and are the creators of Saturday Morning RPG, a JRPG currently for the iOS, but soon to be available on Android and Steam. I developed in Unity3D, but in the past, I used mainly Digipen's in-house game engine called ProjectFUN. I attended their summer sessions when I was a teenager and received access to it, so I spent a number of years making small-scale games with it. I have spent most of my college career learning and using Java and C/C++. I learned to use C# at my internship (not a big leap from C++), and I also learned to use PHP, MySQL, and a little bit of Javascript. Also, I've used GameMaker before.


While working at Mighty Rabbit, I had the opportunity to represent them at a games expo in Philadelphia called Too Many Games. While there, I noticed an overwhelming theme of MegaMan. Everything was MegaMan. The name tags had Dr. Wily's castle as a backdrop. The DJ constantly played remixed MegaMan songs. Every booth had something to sell of MegaMan. And let me tell ya, I love MegaMan. It is, by far, my favorite video game series. I love everything about the series, and I feel that my enjoyment of the games doesn't require any explanation... everyone can appreciate MegaMan! Anyways, I had 9-10 hours of driving home after the Too Many Games expo where I couldn't get all of that MegaMan stuff out of my head. People love it. I love it. Why don't I make a fan game?


I concocted a game idea during that drive. When I returned, I started writing a game design doc. This thing turned out to be 30+ pages. I then created another document and wrote the entire storyline. I created a few more documents before I found myself swimming in a pool of documents with, what I think, are brilliant and unique ideas for a fan game. I have this thing entirely planned out, and it would work. By God it would work. I've played with the idea of ditching the MegaMan universe and creating something of my own, but I can't get that expo out of my mind. I feel that the market for a MegaMan game is huge. I'm not after money with this project, the money will come later in my career. This isn't about money, this is about sharing my idea and love for the series with everyone. 


I originally took my idea away with Unity. I am comfortable with Unity and I wanted the challenge of creating a 2D game with an engine made for 3D. I like challenge. I ended up getting a pretty decent MegaMan engine going. If you were to limit MegaMan to one room with enemies, my engine worked for that. I was on my way. Well, one busy semester and two hard-drive crashes later, my Unity project exists no more. With this misfortune, I am starting fresh, and I am not using Unity. Although I'm comfortable with Unity and I enjoy the challenge, I feel that using a different engine that is more catered to what I want to do would speed up development and would allow for a much more rapid iteration schedule.


Here are my questions:


* What are your thoughts about a MegaMan fan game? Would it be worth it? Would I receive the infamous ""Cease and Desist"" letter? I've heard that Capcom is lenient on fangames, but does anyone have experience with fangames?


* Are there any game engines that come to mind with my experiences and game concept? I know that GameMaker can be limiting, but I have experience with it and was therefore thinking of using it. What would you use instead?


* What is your opinion of the fangame vs. my own universe? As stated, money isn't my intention with this game. However, some of you may have experience with this and can shed some light on this subject.


* If you're interested, would you care to hear my game idea? :)


Thank you all ahead of time. This is my first time posting here, but I look forward to positing in the future! Also, I apologize if these types of posts are frequent. I searched a bit of /r/gamedev and didn't see anything too similar."

My question is: what's expected of my knowledge for an entry job?

While I've taken plenty of classes and am familiar with how a good chunk of programming language work (js, java, php) I'm not sure I could just sit down and pump something out on the fly, let alone remember a ton of syntax.

I guess I'm just feeling a ton of pressure to build up a github with projects/apps before I start applying for jobs this winter.  I'm confident I can handle the work, but I just need to make sure I can get there first.  
  
**EDIT**  Sorry for being vague, was late when I wrote it.

I currently don't have any internships completed, althought I'm applying and plan on getting one this summer.

From what I'm able to dig up, the only chance you have to transfer into Berkeley is when you are a rising junior, which is unfortunate. That said, I need to know what I should do for my sophomore year that will better my chances of acceptance.

1764k7,3,2013-01-23,"Associates (Applied) in CIS, will be transferring for Bachelor's, any hope for experience employment in the meantime?",lloydlindsayyoung,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1764k7/associates_applied_in_cis_will_be_transferring/,"Hi all, I am graduating in May from junior college with my Associates in Applied Science in CIS from a junior college, and will be transferring to a 4 year school to finish up. I have done a 14 month co-op in Enterprise Architecture (somewhat related, did a little actual programming in it, but my real target is software development or web development)

I meet all the requirements to graduate with my Associates, just due to a hang up, it won't be official till May. In the meantime I'm taking a 2nd-level web course to keep academically relevant. Anyway...

I realize there are a LOT of positions that seem to insist on a 4-year degree regardless of experience, unless you can provide a wealth through some kind of portfolio or something, and with a 2-year degree, I'm wondering:

-is there any chance of getting any half decent employment until I get my 4-year, (I don't care too much the pay as long as it's somewhere around $15-20 an hour, I do have bills to pay - not looking for $50k+ and I know I can't get it)

-what would I expect? realize I'm targeting software/webdev so hopefully my only hope isn't some helpdesk job where I sit at a phone and fix someone's problems over a phone or something like that. Another co-op or internship that's more targeted on my degree goal would be great for experience points

what should I be looking for? What kinds of ""titles"" or job descriptions? It's hard to know what words to search for in a job board or something without getting 500 results that all say ""Senior XXXX"" or ""Junior XXXX (minimum 4-year degree + 2+ years experience)

I'd like to see if I can gain the 2+ years experience while still in school.

any suggestions?"

Any advice, please?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/175v5y/im_graduating_in_may_and_getting_increasingly/,"So, I'm graduating with a B.S. in C.S. this May (from an average state university) and keep hearing from others about how difficult it is for people in my age bracket (I'm 30) to get a job in the software industry.  What are your thoughts on this?

A bit about me: I do well in school (3.9 GPA) and have a STEM scholarship, but I really have no personal projects to speak of (other than my capstone project) as school keeps me fairly busy.  I also have no coding experience prior to school.  I did not get an internship. The nearest one I could find was over 50 miles away (I live in Oklahoma, so the software industry is not exactly booming in my neck of the woods) and I couldn't afford the daily commute.  It's just me and the wife, so I didn't have the luxury most students do of having their parents support them.  Another big potential problem for me is that my networking skills are absolutely deplorable.  However, I do love programming and am very passionate about it.  I'm hoping that and the fact that my academic performance is good will count for *something*. :-)  Suggestions about what I can do with the limited time I have left to maximize my opportunities?  

Thank you very much in advance.

17a9sd,13,2013-01-25,"Should I take any computer related job at this point, just for the experience?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/17a9sd/should_i_take_any_computer_related_job_at_this/,"It's been a month since I've graduated with a B.S in CS.  While pursuing that i did 1.5 years of help desk work at the same university.  I graduated with a 3.6 GPA and while I got good grades in programming classes, I never enjoyed programming that much.  I got into CS because I liked computers in general, and i was always fixing family and friends computers (software wise, not really hardware).  In the help desk position I had, besides phone support, we also did hands on support where we fixed students computers. (on a walk in bases, almost like geek squad.  However, software only, not hardware).  I also did an internship over the summer, but it wasn't really technical.  It was doing a lot of reports, and having weekly meetings with the boss and the developers to talk about various website features.  The most significant project I did for the internship was doing video editing for some videos we were producing.

I was never the one to program on my own time (tedious and boring).  I would say the most I learned was through the help desk job, because I ran in to a lot of different computer issues that I had to troubleshoot.

Halfway through the CS degree I realized it was catered more towards programming, but I decided to finish it because I felt that having a CS degree would be a good base, and allow me to go in many different directions.  The problem is at this point that I don't know which direction I want to go in.  

I always envisioned myself as some kind of computer administrator or in a desktop support role.  A friend of mine works as desktop support (software only) for a university and loves it.  This would be cool to do. However he doesn't live in the US.

Finding a job doesn't seem to be a problem as i have on average about 10 recruiters calling me weekly saying they have a position for me.  Most of these positions are help desk however.  One has been a QA testing role, and another one has been some kind of database role.  All have been within the 35k-45k range.

I have some siblings who are angry that I don't go for the 80-100k a year jobs.  They tell me that i should do this and that, but I know that money has never been a motivating factor for me.  I don't need that type of salary to live comfortably, and I try to never live my life for someone else.  Plus, I know that the higher the salary, the higher the stress.  I value my free time, and don't need a career where i'm going to be doing 60+ hours a week regularly. 40 hours M-F is fine with me.

At this point i'm not particularly picky, I just want a job that is computer related  (that is all I ever asked for).  I just don't know exactly which career path to eventually go towards.  My parents tell me to get any computer related job now just to have some more experience to put on my resume.  It's been a month after graduation and I feel like the longer I wait, the tougher it will be to break in.  Although I feel like i'm somewhat ahead of the curve as most kids graduate in May.

What advice would you give me?

[Have you ever seen a case of Munchhausen by proxy?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c800orn?context=5)|Yes. Not a single one. Many. Last year there was this specific single mom early in her 30s that would go into WebMD and find a random disease. Then, she'd come up with a story and ask for her kid to have all scans possible (the kid was 5 years old and i was not going to strafe run his body with radiation from a CT and several xrays). The mom wanted us to believe that the kid had Osteogenisis Imperfecta (Glass-Bone Disease) and came up with some weird stories. The kid had bad hand-shaped bruises all over his leg (the mom actually tried to break his femur, the strongest bone in the body), and we called social service. Never heard from the mom or the kid again.
[How do you deal with the heartbreaking reality that occurs when a child dies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c8002qk?context=5)|The worst of seeing a kid dying on your supervision is that you're the one supposed to ask the parents to follow you to the social worker's office and there you have to say the same thing all the doctors say: ''We did everything we could. We followed the protocols but, unfortunatly, your son/daughter didn't survive. We are sorry for your loss and we will be here to help you in any way we can''. And then hear the relative scream: ""No, you didn't. If you did everything you could do, she'd be alive. I'm going to sue you/You are a monster/Is this because of my healthcare provider?"" This. THIS is a heartbreaker. Usually, they say that they are sorry, but this stays in your mind forever.
[Wow, that is harsh that most people resort immediately to pinning the cause of death on you. Have you ever been assaulted/harassed when parents were in this state?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c800dpx?context=5)|Yes. A guy punched me in the face. But then he apologized.
[Wow seriously? Mind telling the full story?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c800ktl?context=5)|Here we go then. Bad car crash on a highway, two deceased on scene (other car), other two badly injured (wife and kid), one person almost unharmed (the father). Kid was taken to the hospital by helicopter already bradicardic (his heart frequence was very low) and we were trying to stabilize it while giving him blood/ringer fluid (he had several injuries and could potentially bleed out). Then he crashed on a V-fib (ventricular fribilation, when the heart is beating abnormally and not providing the body enough blood, in this case we have to shock) then we started CPR. The whole team was very focusing on saving that life and you could hear the father crying at the ER entrance. We shocked the kid about three times or so, and he finally came back on a stable sinus rhythm. At this time, the mother was already stabilized and on her way to orthopedics to get her broken leg operated, but several minutes after, the kid entered a state of shock doing a CT scan and crashed again. We did everything we could but then we realized he had several deadly injuries inside his body (injuries that we were about to discover on the CT scan) and he didn't make it. We made the procedure of telling the father and all, and then he punched me when i said his kid died. He said he'd sue me for malpractice and neglygency because we didn't discover that his kid had splenic rupture and liver injuries. The thing is that we were busy making his child breathe again before we did a scan, and the kid crashed again mid-scan, so we couldnt know since the abdomen was not that swollen, and then he apologized.
[Wow. That is heartbreaking. I can't imagine being on his or your end of that.  What was your reaction when he punched you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c800w5s?context=5)|I had a very deep breath and walked out of the room.
[Opinion on circumcisions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c8001v1?context=5)|Unnecessary.
[Have you ever seen pretty much clear evidence of child abuse and if so, how does that play out?  Like on medical TV shows where they secretly call the police and have them just show up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c800b7n?context=5)|If we are sure that a child is being abused, we ask the parents to follow us into the hospital's social worker's office. They wait there (alone and under vigilance) until we have a Tuteraly Council agent to talk to the parents. If the abuse is really irrefutable, the child is usually taken from the parents and we call the police. What happens next is only for the cops and the parents to know.
[How frequently does this happen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c800xjs?context=5)|Not very often, because we work with poor, honest and humble people (the hospital is located on a poor neightborhood). But we are prepared to respond to this when it happens.
[What is your favourite part of your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c7zzp8n?context=5)|Walking out of the ER with good news for the parents.
[What is the worst case you have had to deal with on a young child?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c7zzyr1?context=5)|So... The boy (13 years old) was riding his bike down a hill and he horribly fell, broke a leg and an arm, and somehow stuck his neck into the bycicles chain. Needless to say he suffered severe trauma and had cardiac arrest on scene. EMTs tried to bring him back but he arrived into the hospital on a very poor state and after 15 minutes or so of continued CPR we called him deceased.
[Thanks for doing this. It's one of the most interesting AMAs I've read through and I really respect your work. Also, your English is very good for it not being your first language!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c801051?context=5)|Thank you! I've been to English-speaking countries so i know how to speak English... Decently?
[Now that you are a doctor and have gone through all the hoops to get there, would you do it again? Do you feel you made the best career choice? I ask because I know it's not easy to be a doctor. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c7zzrh3?context=5)|Yes, i would. Being a doctor was my dream since i had like 4 years old. I never wanted to be a famous soccer player, an astronaut or something like that. I always wanted to be a medic. 85% of my toys when i was a kid were all about medicine. I had one birthday when i asked my mom for a cheapass stethoscope and she gave it to me.
[\[Edit: Also, what was your reaction the first time a child died under your care? I can't even imagine.\]](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c800wla?context=5)|It depends. But we do have one or two deceased children per week that reach the hospital already dead or die in the ER, but like i said, i'm not always supervising the emergency room. There are other doctors.
[Wow. That is much more frequent than I would have thought. I edited my original question. When you have time, I would really appreciate you answering it as I am genuinely curious.  Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c8011u0?context=5)|My reaction was ''i killed this kid''. I was on my first days after residency and i was helping a more experienced doctor. This doctor was a very cool guy (he was an old man, like 60) and he told me that sometimes people die and we have to let go. I felt amazingly better.
[How are you able to balance your career and your outside life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c8013bs?context=5)|I'm young so i live alone, i don't have a wife or kids (i'm 31) but i do have an amazing girlfriend who's always there for me. My job is the greatest thing in my life (after her, of course) and i love it. I usually don't talk much about my job with friends unless they are fellow doctors, and i live a normal life. It's not a big deal.
[What is your opinion on the current standards of pain management during painful tests such as VCUGs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c800zau?context=5)|The pain management is fine, but the more psychologic appeal the test has (like VCUGs, no 5 year old is ready to have a tube inside his private parts), the more preocupied the parents get and the more painful it is for the child. Pain management on painful tests is deeply studied so the kid feels little to nothing, but sometimes they see what is going to happen and they think that they WILL feel pain and they end up crying and actually making the pain a big deal.
[I missed getting one of my kids a flu shot this year. Should I still try to get one for him or is this flu shot not effective?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c7zzykm?context=5)|Speak to your pediatrician, but i'd say yes. Better safe than sorry.
[About how many children do you attend to a day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c8000ny?context=5)|There are three pediatricians everyday on the ER (Clinic), so i attend about 15 kids on a calm day and 30 when the ER's Clinic is filled with sick people (my shifts go 6AM-6PM). On the Emergency Room itself, about two to seven a day, if no big accidents happen. I do attend other emergency calls that don't involve kids.
[That shift seems harsh.. How do you keep a social life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c8011ke?context=5)|My shift is not daily (but i'm going to work tomorrow and it's already midnight on my country so i should get some sleep, lol) and some doctors cover my place, but i do make friends inside the hospital as well. The interns, nurses and more experienced physicians have some cool stories.
[What do you, and other doctors at your hospital (if you know\) think of Obamacare?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c800s7o?context=5)|I don't live in the United States so i don't know a thing about it. Mind giving me a heads-up?
[What made you decide to go into Pediatrics?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c8018xx?context=5)|I always loved children and i always had an interest on see how the job worked. I wanted to be a Neurosurgeon but then i dropped it and went to the pediatrics internship. I don't regret it.
[Have you ever seen Munchausen syndrome by proxy?  If so, what was the outcome?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c80178l?context=5)|I did answered that, didn't i? I guess someone deleted it.
 |Yes, i did. TL;DR: Crazy mom, tried to break the kids femur because she wanted to make him look like he had Osteogenisis Imperfecta (glass bone disease), we called social service and the kid had to go onto psychiatric care and had tons of bruises all over her body due to the mom attempting to break a bone and make us believe that the kid had the disease. Kid had no other symptoms, muscular tone was k, and i never heard from the mom again.
[Will you prescribe me medical marijuana?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c800fyh?context=5)|No.
[Has there ever been an occurrence so sad that you actually started crying?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c803moq?context=5)|No. If you're a doctor you don't have any time to cry over an occurrence. But i know some stories about the EMTs (they are the ones who see what happened), when they arrive at the scene and the kid has just lost both the parents. It's sad.
[Do you participate in pediatric trauma treatment? or are there special pediatric trauma surgeons?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c80545t?context=5)|Only when the patients are moved into the Emergency Room. After they exit the room for proper surgery treatment, there are other specifical ped surgeons.
[If you're asking for actual medical advice then you should probably call your own doctor.  The OP is probably legit, but common sense says to disregard anything someone tells you over the internet when it involves administering medication.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16whvn/i_am_an_emergency_room_pediatrician_a_physician/c808cjj?context=5)|Do not medicate your child unless a doctor says it's ok if you do (a doctor that actually takes a look at your kid and says what's better for him). There is nothing ok on giving medicine to someone sick without a doctor prescribing it.

The project is a PHP web app and possibly a iphone app. I've worked on school web projects and an internship using PHP before.

1788o6,2,2013-01-24,I was an overworked unpaid intern,arachnivore,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1788o6/i_was_an_overworked_unpaid_intern/,"Short version: I was an unpaid intern at a lab. My boss had me work up to 100 hours a week on critical software, then fired me. Almost a year has passed. What should I do?

Long version:
I worked as an unpaid intern writing code for a lab at a university for four months last year (Nov. 2011 - Feb. 2012). There was a student in charge of the lab who was attempting to spin it off as a start-up company.

For the first month, I worked about 24 hours a week and held a part-time job. Then in December, my boss had the team go on a programming ""retreat"" out at his parents boat-house which was a week straight of 14-16 hour days of non-stop programming. My boss had already mentioned that he could start paying me when he got funding (as early as March), but during the retreat he mentioned that he was working to get funding through the university sooner.

By the end of December I had received a job offer for a tech support company, but my boss told me that if I declined that job offer, he would start paying me out of pocket (""$900/month"") until he could pay me a full salary. I agreed to decline the job offer because I thought the work I was doing at the lab was a much more compelling.

When January started, my boss had just completed the paperwork for his company and my workload quickly became overwhelming. I was working 80 hours a week until the last week of January when I pulled a 100 hour week. I was building and testing a key component of our product and we had to demonstrate our work by the end of the month. I was paid $600 for that month.

In the first two and a half weeks of February, I was assigned a research task. I was to write code and test a new motion segmentation technique. When I finished my work on that, I was assigned a new feature to code. In the last week of February I was told that I was going to be classified as a ""visiting scholar"" so that I could be paid by the University (I was not enrolled at the university at this time). That never happened though, because my boss fired me for ""inadequate performance"". I worked about 60 hours a week in February. I was paid $800. The research I conducted was published, but I got no recognition for my work.

I was not in a good financial situation when I started the job and I was pretty much financially ruined afterward. I had to take a crappy job immediately after being fired to keep my head above water. Now I've recovered enough to start thinking about taking legal action.

I know Texas is a right to work state, but I'm pretty sure the laws regulating unpaid interns are Federal and that my employer violated them. Based on my (novice) interpretation of the law, my previous employer owes me ~$30,000. I'm not very keen on dragging the university into a legal battle, just my boss. What should I do?"
1787is,3,2013-01-24,Job searching with GIS/CS degree,Riiiicolaaaa,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/1787is/job_searching_with_giscs_degree/,"I'm graduating from SUNY UB in May with an B.A. in Geography/GIS and a minor in Computer Science. I'm currently interning at a local company that develops its own emergency management software, but at the moment I'm just doing some bug-testing for the release of a new patch in a month. I'm in the GIS department, and they're planning on getting me involved with development (Javascript and HTML5) soon, but I'm a little anxious about the possibility of not having a job after graduation.

So my questions are these: should I talk to my current employer about working after the internship ends in April? Is there any benefit to that or would I come off as desperate?

Also, should I start applying for other jobs now or just send out my resume and a cover letter to any and all GIS jobs I can think of?

Mainly, I've gotten stuck in a position that's more system administration than programming. I have one phone interview lined up, and HR recruiters have contacted me over LinkedIn, but in general, technical recruiters at career fairs have been ambivalent and sometimes confused about my background.

My background:

* BS in computer science from a top Institute of Technology about 10 years ago, good GPA. Did a couple of projects.
* A summer internship in a software engineering startup.
* Two years working on a small business making a tool to help people building web pages. Didn't really get anywhere.
* Programming and IT for the next 7 years at my current job. I maintain legacy software in C and have designed new software in C++ and developed some PHP web pages. I also administrate about 10 Linux servers. I frequently write small programs in Perl or shell scripts to help administration, and I also frequently do maintenance on the legacy programs. However, most of my time is administration -- configuring software and making sure it runs. Most of my software involves getting things out of a relational database or putting them back in. 
* Started an online Masters program. Did well in the classes I took but didn't continue the program. Was lead dev on a group project.
* Only started doing side projects recently. Have gotten familiar with Python, which I occasionally use at work as well, and Google AppEngine. I've done some work with Ruby on Rails, but not enough to actually build anything from scratch with it unless I get much more practice.
* Took several free online classes. That's where I got my RoR experience. Also learned MongoDB and have some familiarity with AI and machine learning."

Is this considered legit internship or just some project?",justonequestion22,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/17b3ur/got_a_remote_internship_is_this_considered_legit/,"I'm finishing my last semester in community college, and will be transferring to a 4 year university in the Fall. My plan for the summer is to mostly relax and clear my mind before going to university, while possibly working on a relatively low-commitment internship, if that makes sense. 

I found a start-up working on a project that's very interesting to me. Unfortunately they don't have enough funding, so there's no physical office, and all the work being done on it is remote. The guy in charge of the project requested that potential workers should commit at least 4 hours of work per day. This seemed perfect because I could definitely put in that much time without having to leave the house.

I contacted the lead guy and asked if I could hop on board. He asked me a few questions (puzzle type questions and how much programming I know), and said that I seem like a good fit. I'm welcome to join the team for the summer.

I didn't ask about a salary, and it wasn't mentioned either. I mean, I don't mind working for free. I'm just looking to get my hands dirty working on some actual projects. I'm just not sure if something like this could legitimately be called an internship, since I'm not really being trained by anyone. Would this be more of a personal project or something along those lines? 

Apparently a few of the people working on the project are Stanford students, and since I live in the Bay Area I could contact them to see if they want to get together. But still, I'm not sure how remote programming works. Any insight would be appreciated.

The first position is with a plastics/chemicals company in their research center working on process development, simulation and modeling. I'd be working with several PhD's and it seems like a very technical position.

The second offer is from a major energy company in the pipeline integrity division. Would be working with engineers in a subdivision (maybe something along the lines of cathodic/anodic protection or corrosion prevention). Salary is about 10% more.

Thoughts: 
I feel it would be better for my development as an engineer to take the first position, but it's very tempting to take the second  because of the better pay and getting to work downtown in a highrise. It's very likely I end up working in the energy industry when I graduate (because of where I live), so experience in the industry would be valuable. There would be several other interns at the energy company, while I would be the only intern at the research center.

Questions:
Am I burning bridges with a company by rejecting their offer?
Would taking the first position make me less employable in the energy industry after graduation?

Any thoughts/comment would be appreciated, having a very hard time deciding!

17asre,3,2013-01-25,Internship to Job,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/17asre/internship_to_job/,"Hello r/Jobs, here's a quick summary about me: 

I'm 23 years old, a part time Information Systems student (junior) with a full time paid (no benefits) IT/help desk/sysadmin internship. When I first started interning (November 19th 2012), my contract was until December 31st 2012, to see if I fit in and was capable of the internship. The internship then got extended to March 31st 2013, so that's where I stand right now. I'm 110% positive that once March 31st comes around, my contract will be extended another 3 months if I agree to it. 

What I want to know is the correct way of going about asking my boss whether or not a permanent non-intern position may be available in the future.

My boss is the offices System Administrator/all around head of IT in our New York office, so I suppose the role I would want would be Junior Systems Administrator. I should also mention that they already rely on me a little bit. For example, this past week my boss was on vacation, so I had to take care of his responsibilities for the week because no one else in the office had the knowledge or access to.

I was thinking about asking him mid-March if there was a possibility of a position like that opening up or being created, not necessarily for when my contract ends on March 31st, but just in general, even if it's in say another 3 months after that.

Is it too bold to ask that after only 4 months interning at the company? I'm just worried they'll think I'm disposable and hire a new intern, so I don't know if I should wait 6+ months before asking, so it would be a hassle for them to train a new intern."

17fwc0,27,2013-01-28,Sometimes They Crawl Back...,MyNeihborTim,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/17fwc0/sometimes_they_crawl_back/,"Kara didn’t know what to make of it. In fact, she thought she might be going crazy. 

But the fact that Sebastian was back, lounging on the couch, and purring away was enough to make her either laugh hysterically or start screaming at the top of her lungs.


Sebastian had been dead for over three months.

And now he was here, licking his dirt mottled hair, as the exposed tendons and bone from one of his ravaged paws lay stretched out on the couch – leaving behind a dusty residue on the black leather.
Kara opened up the blinds and let the sun peek through, the shaft of yellow-white light crisscrossed Sebastian’s body, as the cat, with only one milky white eye left, curled the remainder of its tail and meowed.

The meow came out as a gurgle – but it was a meow just the same.

Her cat was back, and Kara didn’t know what to make of it.

Three months earlier, when Sebastian had entered his eighteenth year, she knew that their remaining time would be short. Of course, she had no idea how short this time would be.

Two days after Sebastian’s birthday on April 15th – the cat had left his usual sleeping spot (under the bed) and jumped onto Kara sometime after four in the morning.

The cat was having trouble breathing and the sound of the harsh respiration woke Kara from a deep sleep.

She had enough time to turn on the light, and watch as Sebastian rolled over on his side, take one more breath and then the cat was gone.

Kara was heart-broken; Sebastian had been with her through so much.

When Kara first came to Los Angeles, in hopes of becoming a radio DJ, she had found the city to be an incredible tide of loneliness. People lived in a bubble, whether it was in their apartments, or cars - Kara noted that she could go for weeks without talking to a single person.

Being from the Midwest, she had never experienced a place where the defense mechanisms of millions of people could have the unpleasant after-effect of repelling all human interaction.

You could eat in silence, sleep in silence, travel in silence and work in silence – depending on where you were employed.

And for Kara, who had been very outgoing in college, this level of silence was not just overwhelming, but incredibly debilitating.

It was at her mother’s urging that Kara decided to get a cat.  

At first, she thought adopting an older cat would the best way to go. Nobody wants to adopt an older cat, and Kara wanted to improve the life of a pet, a life that may be taken away by an injection or gas.
She had chosen a larger, orange tabby that she named, Gremlin.

He was a pleasant, if not cranky, old sot – but he was low maintenance, had a good disposition and knew how to use a litter box.

But Gremlin wasn’t destined for a long life with his new owner. After returning from work as an intern at a popular radio station, Kara found Gremlin lifeless and stiff on her bathroom floor.

Picking up the cat was the hardest part. There was something so alien about a once malleable and cuddly ball of fur, which now dead, was stretched out – and felt like a heavy stuffed animal.

Kara wasn’t very squeamish, and although it really bothered her, she scooped the cat in to a plastic bag and dumped him unceremoniously into the trash.

She didn’t have a yard in her apartment complex, and the last thing she wanted was her neighbors or landlord to see her burying her tabby in a space reserved water-resistant succulents.

It also bothered her that Gremlin had decided to go out on a Wednesday, which meant the refuse pick up wouldn’t happen till the following week. And she had to ignore the smattering of comments from other neighbors about that “horrible trash smell.”

If she ever got another cat, she would bury it – even if it meant she had to abscond to the park in the middle of the night.

Kara was not dissuaded from adopting another cat, but having an older one would not do. She decided that a kitten would probably have the best chance for both parties.

It was a Sunday, nearly two and a half weeks after Gremlin passed, that she met Sebastian at a Pet Smart on Pico blvd.

He was the runt of the litter, incredibly vocal, and down right ornery. But she loved him from the second she filled out the paperwork.

This particular cat just felt right and she believed that Gremlin had only served as a dress rehearsal.

Sebastian flourished in his new home, and made it apparent that he would rule this house and not the other way around.

And thus the friendship between the two bloomed.

And as the year passed, Kara rose in the ranks. Starting with her internship, to answering calls, to producing shows and finally becoming a host – Sebastian was there every step of the way.

He wasn’t fond of the various boyfriends that Kara brought home over the years, and being that she was committed to her work more than relationships, Sebastian seemed to be fine with that.

Though, Sebastian would make himself known if he didn’t like a certain guy that Kara was spending her time with. More than once, Sebastian would take a pee on his favorite leather jacket, or abscond with his keys.

He was a little shit, but he was Kara’s little shit and she wouldn’t have it any other way.

Kara often wondered on those many nights when Sebastian would lie on her chest, and stare at with half-closed eyes, purring – if they had known each other in another life?

There was this deep soul connection between the two of them.

Were they lovers in the past? Were they mother and child? Was it the other way around?

The bond between the two was almost telepathic – for there were times when she was feeling anxious or upset, that Sebastian would gravitate towards her and plop himself into the middle of her lap.

When Kara was chosen as a DJ for one of LA’s biggest alternative-rock stations, her excitement must have been transported across town. When she returned home from winning the gig, and a celebratory drink with friends – her apartment was in shambles.

No, there hadn’t been an earthquake and it most certainly wasn’t a robbery.

Pictures, vases, drink coasters, pillows, half-full water glasses and plants had been knocked to the floor.
At first Kara thought it was an earthquake, but that seismic output was the cat that was running from room to room like a wild man.

He was a leaping, twirling ball of fur that shot out from the bathroom, blazing through the hallway into the living room – sliding across the coffee table, scattering the remaining magazines and remote control and then jumping effortlessly to the top of Kara’s head, where he sat, like a Russian hat, and meowed.

Kara could only laugh – yes, they would now be able to afford a house. At the mere thought of this, Sebastian jumped from her head and landed on the recliner, and flopped over, and began to groom his chest.

And here he was now, grooming himself – even though patches of his fur were gone, his skin, covered in mud and the muscles and internal organs clearly visible underneath.

When Sebastian died, Kara had made good on her promise and dug a very deep hole next to the rosemary bush.

Sebastian loved to rub himself against the rosemary, and it gave him such a sweet scent when he was in the house, that the plant was a constant reminder of him.

It was only fitting that his final resting place should be there.

There would be no more adoptions of other cats. Not for a while at least.

Kara planned to travel – since a soulless corporation purchased the radio station. The new owners believed that radio DJ’s should be replaced by an iPod, with the voice tracking done a world away.
For the first time in Kara’s life – she was free.

And having booked her trip to Europe, Kara was now having trouble sleeping. Always such a sound sleeper before, insomnia was something new for her.

Maybe it was the excitement of heading into the great unknown? Or maybe now that Sebastian was gone threw off her biological rhythms.

Strange dreams plagued her; dreams about suffocating, dreams about being stuck in a corner. The lack of sleep wreaked havoc on her blood pressure and diet. She found that she was forgetting things, and isolating herself.

Kara felt unmotivated, uninspired, and for the first time in a long, long time – lonely.

That LA bubble was making itself known again, and one day she realized that she hadn’t said a word out loud in twenty-four hours.

So it was one night, three months after Sebastian had passed, when she woke from another bad dream, where she felt like she was losing her mind that she got up and walked out to Sebastian’s grave, and cried.

She hadn’t cried when he died, in fact her own stoic sense of “this is the circle of life” kept her from any emotional outpour.

Shaking off the dream that she could no longer remember, she walked outside to the rosemary bush, and sat down – where it all came out.

It felt good to cry, and better to accept that she missed her old friend.

She slept soundlessly after that.

And the next morning, when she was brewing a cup of coffee, she heard a tapping on the sliding glass door.

She had screamed when she saw him.

Sebastian tapped on the window with a skeletal paw.

He tapped again.

And then he gurgled – and she couldn’t stop herself – she was moving quickly to the door.

Sebastian walked in and made a figure eight around her legs – rubbing his rotted fur against her ankles.
And that’s when Kara fainted.

But he was there when she awoke and he has been there ever since.

And now here he was grooming himself and Kara didn’t feel so scared anymore, because she wasn’t the only one who was experiencing this.

Shortly after Sebastian appeared, there were other reports of pet owners who were experiencing visitations from old friends.

The same morning Sebastian crawled back, she heard her next door neighbor scream “Why? Oh my God! Why?”

His long-dead Labrador retriever named, Bud, had crawled out of the ground and wanted to play ball with his master.

Bud was only a skeleton now, no fur, muscles, eyes or ears – but somehow his bones stayed together, and as Bud ran, the dog’s phalanges scraped along the ground with a puppy’s glee.

Around the neighborhood, people were reporting that their dogs, hamsters, parrots and cats were coming back from the dead.

If they had maintained some semblance of their bodies, they were soon poking their snouts out of the ground.

Some wondered if heaven was full? 

And others said that these returning animals didn’t have souls and were merely being reanimated by some new type of bacteria.

But none of it mattered to Kara, who finally had her Sebastian back.

She’d have to get used to the smell, though.

Sebastian smelled awful, as did all of the reanimated pets.

But everyone would have to get used to it, because sometimes they crawl back, and Kara wouldn’t have it any other way.

17emiy,0,2013-01-27,Thinking of transferring out of Tech.,ColdCaulkCraig,gatech,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/17emiy/thinking_of_transferring_out_of_tech/,"The following paragraphs are a quote from a post I found in another thread. I'm posting this because it describes exactly how I feel:

I know this is an old thread, but I wanted to respond since I go to Tech. I'm a senior ISyE major (used to be CmpE) at Tech, and I have always regretted going here. In Georgia, you pretty much have 2 choices for tradtional colleges: UGA for liberal arts, and GT for engineering. There's also Emory and some other small colleges, but UGA and GT are the most popular. If you want to do engineering and you don't have money to go out of state, then you are stuck with Tech (or Southern Polytechnic, which is horrible). 

It's true that Tech has ""great"" academic programs. The reason why they are highly regarded is not because of the professors or facilities or anything like that. It's basically because Tech is so difficult that it teaches students how to solve problems on their own with little or no help. Tech students are pretty much thrown in the water and it's up to them not to drown; if you survive, then you will have skills to be a hard worker in a job. You will learn to be a good worker if you go here; I've worked for Disney as an intern and found it to be quite easy compared with school. 

What Tech lacks the most is a social life. If you like programming and talking about computers 24/7, you will like it here. If you would rather play videogames than anything else with your freetime, you will like it here. If you are socially inept and awkward, you will fit in well. There are 27% girls here last I checked, and out of those, a small percentage are ""normal,"" and a small percentage of that are attractive (physically and otherwise). It's not just girls either, the guys are also strange. It's hard for me to make friends here because I don't like many of the people, and I was even considered nerdy in high school. If academics are your main concern, Tech would be great for you. If you want to have some kind of life or enjoy college the way most people do, you will hate your existence while you are at Tech. 

This is a little off-topic, but I am actually taking a philosophy class here that shows how schools (among other sources) shape people to want money and to buy stuff, and how institutions like Tech are used to create people who are hard workers and are primarily concerned with consumption of products. Over the years I've thought about my life more and more, and really thought about why I chose this school and what I really want my life to be like. I picked CmpE in the beginning because I thought I liked computers and that major makes a lot of money. A lot of people pick schools because they want to be proud of their accomplishments, they want prestige, and mostly, they want to get that degree so they can make a lot of money and buy a lot of stuff. Recently I've realized that I don't find that moving to the suburbs, working 60+ hours a week, and buying a lot of products is the life I want, but that's what you are typically headed for with an engineering degree. 

Anyway, if you want to go here so you can get a good job that pays a lot of money so you can buy more TVs and an expensive car and whatever, then go for it. Personally, I wish I had looked for something I would actually be interested in rather than what is highly-rated or is known for making a lot of money. I also would have rather spent these years enjoying my life as well as earning a degree instead of spending it in constant depression at Tech."

Where do I go from here?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/17ehsd/interested_in_computer_graphics_where_do_i_go/,"I am a university student graduating next fall. I have taken several upper level CS classes and last semester I had the pleasure of taking graphics. In the class I familiarized myself with the basics, and programmed in openGL.I found the class not only very interesting but also fun. I would like to pursue specializing in graphics. My question is, where do I go from here? What kind of side projects would you suggest? What is the computer graphics industry like, and does it have a promising future? What should I do to prepare myself and what do employers look for? I am looking for a summer internship right now and am trying to find some computer graphics oriented places. Does anyone have any suggestions?
Thanks for the help"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[How long do you think Jon will do the show? Will there be another host after him?  Who(iasosopo\) is behind the recent running gag revolving around uber-prankster Ronaiah Tuiasosopo? How will you decide when to stop using it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84faab?context=5)|1 - forever and ever, amen! 2 - what did i just say.  i said he's doing it forever.  but probably ray lewis. 3 - it is, indeed, ronaiah tuiasosopo himself! 4 - when it gets old to us... which may be never.
[Is this what Jon thinks too? That he'll continue to do this for a while?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84g7gj?context=5)|Yes. i've found that in general my thoughts are constantly identical to jon stewart's even when we we are predicting the future in a comedic manner. of course, i could be wrong about that. 
[I may never again have a chance to interact with anyone from my favorite show. So I will tell you that I love The Daily Show so very much, and that joke has run itself into the ground and is digging. Please stop.  I'm making it worse, huh? *sigh*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84geqv?context=5)|Well, since you said ""please"". although tonight's (monday's) guest is bob costas so there's an off chance it'll come up again. we ask your forgiveness in advance.
[HUGE Daily Show fan, just want to take this opportunity to ask: What's your favorite thing about the show? I.e., working with Jon, having the dogs around, being able to work around John Oliver and Sam B and the other correspondents?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84gssr?context=5)|The answer is ""all of the above"". but mainly i enjoy the fact that i am able to do something with my ridiculous choice of career that i believe is at least a LITTLE bit relevant. that's also nice. and the catered lunch. also nice.
[How did Jon Stewart prepare for the Bill O'Reilly debates? Did you guys help him or did he prepare alone? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84fzij?context=5)|Have you seen the movie ""rocky""? it was a lot like that. mainly eating half a dozen raw eggs for breakfast and then running through the streets at dawn wearing old, sweaty gray sweats. and yes, we helped him, but it was mainly jon.
[Do you ever answer questions honest and straightforward or do you always just make jokes? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84gcla?context=5)|Mainly i just make jokes, but i do recall once being asked ""do you take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife?"" and i'm pretty sure i gave a straight answer to that but i'd have to go back and check the tapes.
[Who is your favorite guest to have on the show?  Are Jon and the correspondents as crazy behind the scenes as they appear on the show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84fdqy?context=5)|1 - anybody who brings me something nice. or woody allen because he's woody allen. 2 - they are EXACTLY the same once you get past the fact that none of them ever wear pants.
[The speed with which you come up with the retorts to the Fox News cycle is impressive.  How many people are involved with assembling those epic Jon Stewart smack downs?  How much time does he have to prepare delivering it to us?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84fw0i?context=5)|First of all, thank you. yo are too kind and should probably back off a little bit on the kindness. secondly, the daily show has a large staff of very impressive, funny and dedicated people who help jon be ""epic"", but most of that epicness comes from jon himself. sorry. ""mr. stewart.""  (almost lost my job there.)  as for the time we have, please refer to the name of the show.
[How did you get the job? I've always wanted to get a job writing jokes but don't know where to start.  What's the writing process like in the Daily Show's offices? Is it a collaboration?  Is Jon involved in the process?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84feha?context=5)|Thanks for the questions - [here you go](http://www.waywire.com/v/efa3ebca95ef3ebc31e522eb184649b9)
[More and more young people get their knowledge of the news and current events from comedians like you and Jon Stewart. How do you think this impacts (and will impact longer-term\) culture around news and politics for future generations?  Is it a good thing to rely primarily on comedy for news about the world?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84fkx2?context=5)|1 - my dearest toby, i think that if people rely on TDS for their actual news the future will be here soon and will be similar to that will smith movie where he has a dog and fights his way through manhattan. 2 - no. but it's probably not terrible either. as long as you are aware of a few more details about the world.
[What is Jon Stewart like behind the scenes? Any funny stories?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84fxcs?context=5)|Nope. not one.
[Former Colbert intern here, from his 2008 PA primary coverage. Why don't Jon and Colbert check in with each other at the end of the show anymore? those bits were always hilarious. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84gpfd?context=5)|I think it's a timing issue -- early on it was a good way to transition between shows but now that stephen so easily holds his own we use that time differently.  they were awfully fun to do though.
[Politically-- do Democrats or Republicans have more of a sense of humor and of the two which personalities have had the most extreme reactions to your humor?  Have you found one person where you hit a nerve with that you can keep going for them?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84fl37?context=5)|1 - hard to say but usually the one's we're not making fun of seem to have a better sense of humor than the ones we're making fun of. the only reaction we're looking for is laughter. 2 - we're not out to bury people. we just do what strikes us as worthy of our focus and wastes the least amount of potable water. very important.
[*usually the one's we're not making fun of seem to have a better sense of humor.*  So, democrats then?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84g7fn?context=5)|Yes. because we ONLY make fun of republicans. you've got us pegged. please don't tell the non-mainstream-and-yet-ratings-leading-media.
[Anyone else think this guy isn't funny?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84gfks?context=5)|Which guy? hey, wait a minute!!
[If you had to pick your favourite comedian to work with, who would it be, and why?  Also, do you sometimes think, ""I'm making money being funny, this is awesome?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84fb8j?context=5)|1 - a guy i know named sam because he has a nice car and drives me everywhere. also, woody allen because he's woody allen. 2 - welcome to my world, buddy! first, middle and last thoughts of my day.
[Who of the correspondants is your favorite? John Oliver is mine but that is just me. Also when will a new(iasasopo\) correspondant come out? Thanks for the AMA i love the show.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84fzn4?context=5)|My favorite correspondent is one i've created in my head that has sam bee's face, john oliver's accent, jason jones' genitals, and aasif mandvi's size 3 1/2 feet. as for a new correspondent, that's just a matter of time since we replace them in much the same manner as Menudo.
[What were some of the jokes you wrote for The Simpsons? where do you get your inspiration?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84fkfu?context=5)|1 - i never wrote for the simpsons. stop getting your information from wikipedia. 2 - easy. every thursday, vilma from accounting comes in with my check. that usually does the trick. also woody allen because he's woody allen.
[Who is funnier in real life. Jon Stewart or Stephen Colbert ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84g1wy?context=5)|Hard to say since they are both trappist monks who never speak off camera.
[Were you the funny guy when u went to school. so it was like everyone told u ""ur going to be a famious comedian"" ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84fzk2?context=5)|No. i was severely beaten as child while the authorities constantly looked the other way.  thanks for bringing it up.
[You ever do stand up in Boston?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84fecv?context=5)|I've never done stand up in boston but i will if you want me to... and if you own a comedy club... and if it comes with a meal.
[Would you rather fight 100 Jon Stewart-sized horses, or one horse-sized Jon Stewart?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84fn08?context=5)|Having done both i can assure you that a horse-sized jon stewart is not to be trifled with.
[Do you use reddit often for research purposes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84g8ah?context=5)|Listen, d-mmm-b. i know a plant when i see one. you're not going to sucker me into your game. the fact that reddit is my sole source for research purposes is none of your business!
[I started watching for the humor but now watch for the actual news. Do you guys try to remain neutral? Or do you sway one way depending on what will be funny?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84fw3o?context=5)|1 - are you talking about ""sexually""? because i definitely sway toward hetero because i think it's hilarious. as for our politics, we try to remain reasonable and thoughtful and nothing else.
[Why do you do comedy? If you weren't doing comedy or show business, what would you be doing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84fnnv?context=5)|Becaues i have nowhere else to go! (you read that like richard gere in ""officer and a gentleman"", right?)  if i was doing comedy, or ""doing show business"" as you say, i would undoubtedly be chasing people down in home depot and promising to renovate their bathrooms. total no-brainer.
[How did Jon Stewart prepare for the Bill O'Reilly debates?  How did Jon Stewart prepare for the Bill O'Reilly debates?  How did Jon Stewart prepare for the Bill O'Reilly debates?  I actually really wanted an answer to this one.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84kxl0?context=5)|Maybe this will clear things up for people who seem to think that mother teresa's unfunny sister was supposed to be answering these questions.  1 - i get paid to be funny, so i usually stick with that. 2 - think about the question for a second and you can answer it yourself. the answer is that he prepared by doing what pretty much anybody would do: he put in many extra hours studying and researching the issues that were not only important to him but seemed to be hot button issues for o'reilly. and yes, we helped him when we could but, as usual, it was mainly jon's own knowledge and effort. 3 - happy now. 4 - i expect not.
[Who, in your opinion, is/was the funniest ""correspondent"" in real life?  Any interesting/funny/memorable stories about him/her?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84fn4w?context=5)|Funniest correspondent / interesting stories... [here's my response](http://www.waywire.com/v/f4797015bde38f0f2e03efbbbeda882)
[Any advice for someone who wants to start doing stand up comedy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84fyoy?context=5)|Just start doing it. find open mics and places that have free shows that you can just go watch and then talk to the comics afterwards. immerse yourself in the world that you want to become a part of. learn from the comics that make you laugh as well as the ones you think are not funny. to quote a popular footwear manufacturer - just do it.
[How many picks for the moment of zen do you get on an average day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84g5ok?context=5)|As you might imagine we have an almost endless supply of ""moments of zen"" to choose from so we usually go with whatever we find most jarring though it is also sometimes influenced by whether or not it goes along with the content of that day's show.
[Can you describe the writing process for the show? Does John lead the charge or is it more fluid? When do you start planning the next show? What kind of deadlines do you deal with? (Sorry for the rapid fire questions\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84g6v0?context=5)|[here's a little more about the writing process for the daily show](http://www.waywire.com/v/efa3ebca95ef3ebc31e522eb184649b9)
[How often, if at all, do you write a script/skit/line and then test out with others to see if it is funny? Also, what was the most recent joke you wrote that went over everyone's head?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84g5sj?context=5)|We are all constantly working off each other at the show and we all enjoy doing that and respect each others opinions. there are few if any jokes that anyone on staff can tell that ""go over everyone else's head"" but we all tell plenty of jokes that are immediately recognized as ""not suitable for air"". that's just part of the creative process.
[Any advice for young, aspiring comedy writers? Do standup? Improv? Write and shop specs? ??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84gbb0?context=5)|All of those are good things to do. and honestly, this is exacly what my podcast is about. listen to it and feel free to let me know if you agree. writersblocpodcast.com.
[For the interviews, how much of the book/ movie in question has Jon read? Is there someone whose job it is to read the book and give Jon some interesting questions to ask? And do they have a rehearsal interview before, or is it done cold?  Do writers get to meet the guests? If so, who has been your favorite to meet?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84g0yv?context=5)|Jon is very prepared for ALL the interviews. we help a little, but i honestly don't know how he does it. interviews aren't rehearsed. we're discouraged from asking to meet the guests because it would just get out of hand, but i asked to meet joe montana (many years ago) and jerry rice (when he did dancing with the stars) because i grew up in the bay area in the 80's and was a HUGE fan.  GO NINERS!!!
[What are your feelings on the Emmy writing category being televised only every second year now? (Related: where do you keep your Emmys?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84fnti?context=5)|It's a bit of a drag because i really enjoyed the free trips to LA, but it is what it is and at this point i can't say i really mind that much myself though i'm sure it's far more disappointing for the newer writers who haven't had the opportunity to go out as often.

[How in the world do you guys find so many relevant clips for the Daily Show? Some of them are from years ago! What's the process for that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84g0bv?context=5)|Great question -- [here's my response](http://www.waywire.com/v/2c21db110d375b2b585f3bf394e6c4e6)
[How much of the material is Johns original content?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84fyp7?context=5)|It's spelled ""jon""
[Do you write the questions for guests on the Daily Show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84fqna?context=5)|There are always a couple of writers assigned to spend at least a little time writing up a few questions but it's usually more of a guideline if anything. and more work is put into some guests (scholars and authors) than others (actors and such). jon is genuinely well-informed about all his guests which i believe makes him an amazing interviewer.
[Whats the best stuff that never aired or an idea of yours that got scrapped that you would like to share? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84fpjt?context=5)|We only really cover 1 or 2 stories a day so ideas get cut ALL the time simply because there's no time for them. it's just a matter of making choices. most recently, i really wanted to cover the recent developments in redistricting and the awarding of electoral votes but other stories trumped it. but that doesn't mean we won't address this issue later. and by that time i will, of course, have become a noted expert on the subject.
[Do you watch fox news all day looking for material? I am honestly amazed at how witty and thoughtful some of the smallest jokes on the daily show can be...Something that will take me a month to come up with you guys do daily..its truly amazing. Are you guys up all night researching and writing these jokes? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84g1pe?context=5)|We do watch foxnews a lot but we also watch msnbc and cnn and we read from many different sources. fortunately our hours are not as bad as you think. in fact, the writers ""work"" from basically 9 to 6.  but we ""think"" almost all the time. unless we're sleeping. then we don't think.  i think hard to say.
[Did you ever worry that Romney would be President? Would the writers be depressed if that had transpired?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84h0dd?context=5)|Speaking only for myself i'm not sure my main concern would have been for our show. but if he had won the election we would have continued on the same way we always do - seeking out absurdities that we have a legitimate reason to address. now, president cain... that would have been hilarious!
[What is the best little-known fact about Jon that you can tell us?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84gj4v?context=5)|He wears almost the exact same ""outfit"" to work everyday - khakis, a gray t-shirt over a white long sleeve waffle shirt, and extremely well-worn doc martin boots.
[How much media--books, news, stuff on the Internet--do you have to *consume* on a daily or weekly basis in order to stay relevant?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84ga0h?context=5)|It's not like there's a set amount. in other words my answer isn't ""296 pages"". we all just consume what we're capable of consuming in a given amount of time... which is just one of the things working at the daily show has in common with competing in a hot dog eating contest.
[What was it like working with Craig Kilborn? I hear he wasn't easy to work with.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84g8gl?context=5)|That depends on who you are i guess. i don't know ANYBODY who gets along with EVERYBODY. i liked craig. he was cool to me and he totally helped us get the show off the ground. he was also very easy to write for since he wasn't a big script doctor. (understatement) we used to get a lot of stuff on verbatim back then but if you go back and look at some of it it honestly could probably have done with a bit of massaging.
[HOW did you get into comedy writing? What made the daily show choose you? What would you tell someone who wants to do EXACTLY what you do?  What's Jon like in real life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84gf0z?context=5)|Jon is an above average human being in many ways. as for advice, listen to my podcast.  this is not a selfish ""pitch"". i created the podcast specifically to give people like you otherwise unavailable insight into the comedic writing process as told by people who have actually been able to make careers out of donig it.  ""Writers' Bloc w/J.R. Havlan"" - [Link to writersblocpodcast.com](http://writersblocpodcast.com)
[A few years ago Fox tried to compete with you with The 1/2 Hour News Hour.. It was cancelled after 17 episodes. Why do you think that, even after decades of trying, ""conservative humor"" is still an oxymoron? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84gipy?context=5)|TheLuminousEgg (below) is probably right.
[Does it bother you when people just assume that Jon writes all of his own jokes? Thanks for the AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84gde9?context=5)|No.  but i also don't know how many people actually believe that.  and i would assume that anybody who does believe that also probably wonders where the sun goes every night.
[This is really great - thanks so much for doing this. I'm trying to gain a foothold as a comedic writer/storyteller as well, and this is fascinating. I saw you do a set at Kabin shortly before Christmas, too, and I was really impressed by how well you handled a heckler who turned out to be a mentally ill, possibly homeless person. You did it with grace and compassion, but without taking any shit.  I've always wondered: when a writer ""submits"" to a TV show, whether it's the Daily Show or Colbert or Totally Biased - what do they submit, exactly? What exactly goes into a ""packet?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c8540ac?context=5)|Wow! that kabin gig was totally unexpected. i wasn't ""on the show"", i just walked in and they put me on, which was nice but it caught me by surprise a bit. then the weird guy caught me by surprise. then the friend i hadn't seen for years but suddenly was seeing everywhere ALSO caught me by surprise. quite a night. thanks for the kind words. for answers to your questions i can honestly recommend listening to my podcast - i address this in almost every episode.

[How do The Daily Show and The Colbert Report make sure they don't do the same jokes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84lxuh?context=5)|We don't really check in that much anymore ""day of"" and it usually works out particularly since we have such a different take on the stories. we also watch each other's shows so that we don't cross over too much on any stories that we might do a day or two later. oh, and there's also an elaborate warning system similar to the emergency broadcasting system that sets off an alarm in our offices whenever we have similar thoughts.
[How did you get started as a writer? Was it all from standup?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84fqw7?context=5)|This is a long answer but if you're really interested my full story is on this podcast (not my own podcast) that i did with a friend - [Link to bit.ly](http://bit.ly/Vjca5s)
[Could you tell us (perhaps a rough ratio\) how many of the interview guests Jon and the Production team select and how many are 'suggested' by Comedy Central (or other corporate overlords\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84xws6?context=5)|It's entirely up to jon though there may be a handful that he does ""as a favor"". i'm not really sure about that part of it.
[What do you think of Woody Allen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84g62j?context=5)|[woody allen's the best](http://www.waywire.com/v/7f08f19a587a86bec3ccd636bb71e6ea)

[Well honestly people are people, and this guy makes jokes. You can't just change him without ruining his thought process to fit the mold you give him, which would really bring down the actual depth and quality of his answers.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84i8oy?context=5)|Right on brother! (or sister. could be ""ian"" as in ""janice ian"". hard to say.)
[Well if Stewart just ridiculed him it wouldn't be a very effective argument.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84iiop?context=5)|I agree with this. also, though o'reilly certainly seems to be in belligerent a-hole mode a disproportionate amount of the time, he can also occasionally be humorous and reasonable.  i THINK maybe that's the side jon appreciates.
[God this was a stupid AMA. All I learned was how to come off as a dick to my fans by not giving a shit about their questions while making mildly smirk-worth jokes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84qcgb?context=5)|Why don't you consider reading the responses i've taken the time to add since the original 2-hour session during which well over 400 questions piled in.  and then go fuck yourself.
[Hey JR! Big fan of The Daily Show and Writers' Bloc. I plan on applying for an internship at the Daily Show soon, and I was wondering if you had any tips or advice regarding what you guys look for in applicants.

[I'm sure this is at least part of the answer, and it's pretty much what I always assumed. But when I asked Javerbaum and Karlin (unless they were messing with me\), they said that there's one staff writer who's eerily good at it as well. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17d96a/i_am_jr_havlan_16year_veteran_writer_for_the/c84nphm?context=5)|His name is adam chodikoff. he's our lead researcher, he's been at the show since day 1, and he's an amazing individual. but he also uses LexisNexus (3 points for crtjester) and we now also have an amazing search tool called snapstream that allows us to find specific clips on television using search words or phrases. but there are also many other people on the staff who simply recall specific events or statements form the past that apply to stories we are currently working on. i think i said this in one of the video responses but it truly is a combination of man... and machine.

17imv1,5,2013-01-29,At a Crossroad and need to know the next step,jacker2011,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/17imv1/at_a_crossroad_and_need_to_know_the_next_step/,"I need to get something off my chest and hopefully i get some advices from the community here.

so first of all, I am a MechE student that is about to graduate in 10 weeks or so. And I am on the fence between graduate school and jobs. 

 I started off college as an above average high school kid. my arrogance got the best of me by the end of freshman year and I got my butt kicked in my sophomore year. I was really lucky and grateful that i still had an internship by the end of my sophomore year. 
 As I move on in my undergraduate studies(core classes), I got more exposure(through coursework) to ME and I find myself to foster an interest in controls and thermodynamics. I am even currently auditing a graduate level course in Robotics.

so my current situations is that I have a ~3.0 major gpa and a 2.94 Overall gpa, passed the EIT,  and I've had two internship with the same company. (a fortune 100 company). But I didn't like the work because it was all CAD modeling with little analysis. I did, however, enjoy the hands-on prototype building and some of the light research work that I did. So they mentioned that they would like to have me back.
 I've been mass applying for jobs and luckily I've been selected to interview with companies like Chevron, Microsoft, PGE, General Mills, Lam's Research and etc but I just clutched on my interviews or my background is weak so I didn't get any offers.



 From my mistakes and failures I realized that I am not ""the shit"" as I thought I was and I also realized that through helping other understand or helping them with hw or even doing a lot of practices, I can learn better. People begin to perceived that I was smart because I was able to understand some of the material and help others with their understanding as well. by the end of my 4th year, I was very honored and glad that I met with a group of hardworking people through my classes and projects.
  With that said, I still do mediocre on exams(except thermo, controls, circuits, fluids, and FEA), while my project grades and hw grades were my lifesavers. i realized i suck at taking tests.
  Currently, I work at the computer lab as IT support on campus. But this is a dead-end job but I keep it because I need the money for rent and food.

 I am interest in doing some control related research or simulation research with 2 of the professors in my department. But I wonder if they would pay me as an undergraduate researcher. My plan is to probably join a design team for spring and summer while doing research with a professor if they are willing to 1.)hire me, 2.) pay me. 

 lastly, I also wonder if grad school is the right place for me or is it an escape if I don't have a job. I am certain that I don't want to go back to my internship place. i love the people and the culture but the line of work isn't for me. I really like alternative energy and defense industry.

Sorry for the long post. i don't know whether people will read this or not. but it did help me get some pressure off my chest.

cheers"

17i0pv,12,2013-01-29,"Internship, Tutoring, and Competency: Combo Question",gqgk,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/17i0pv/internship_tutoring_and_competency_combo_question/,"I have three questions and didn't feel like spamming you with three separate threads, so I'll make a numbered list and if you feel kind enough to answer one, they'll be in the order they appear above.

1) I'm in my first semester of my sophomore year with a 3.7 major GPA (will be around a 3.88 or so after this semester) and a 2.92 cumulative GPA (soon to be a 3.1-3.2, but regardless I've never had lower than a C in any class and lower than an A- in a programming class) at a good university. I have taken 2 algorithms classes that are done in C++ and I'm currently taking a UI class (in Java), a Computer Organization class (which doesn't involve much programming, but it does use some C and assembly) and another Data Structures and Algorithms class (again in C++). I started off with Java about 5 years ago and continue to use it for side projects (I have 3 Android apps on the market and create games and videos with/over LibGDX). I would love to get an internship this summer but most places require that you have your sophomore year finished and have a 3.0 (which I will have by the end of this semester), when I'll only be halfway through. Would I have any chances at landing an internship based on my history of past projects and taking a few CS classes early and high major GPA (even though my cumulative is less than stellar? Also, being in Ohio, what could an intern be expected to have thrown their way in terms of compensation?

2) I currently work as a TA for my university's intro programming lab. Someone in the lab asked me to tutor them on the side and offered to pay. A) How do I charge? By the hour? By the session? B) How much do I charge? I know if I was a tutor through my school I'd be getting paid at least $9/hr (pay is dependent on the total and level of classes you can tutor for).

3) Now that I've been doing C++ for a short while (and Java for 5 years), I still don't feel very confident. I can do all of the basic tests that people have posted regarding job interviews (FizzBuzz, check if a string starts with an uppercase, check if a string is a palindrome, etc.) but I feel that's over-simplistic and once I passed that I'd be overwhelmed once I started working. What do companies really expect an intern to know and how much are they willing to teach you if you don't know it?

If you read through all of that, thank you! You're awesome."

[What is the strangest request that the deceased had wanted done for their service?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c859y5f?context=5)|We had a dead clown one time. This person was buried in full clown costume with makeup and all. The whole family was clowns, all the friends were clowns. And at the familys request, the funeral directors were clowns too. They supplied costume and did our makeup. Family and friends had 1 tear drop painted on near the eye. Definitely my strangest.
[It's a common practice with clowns to use the teardrop in makeup for a fallen clown. Some clowns will use it as part of their makeup forever, depending on the relation to the deceased. (Coming from a professional clown. Yes, you read that right.\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c86ztfo?context=5)|That's awesome. It was the most interesting funeral service to date. At first we didn't want to do the whole makeup and costume thing but the family insisted. I'm glad we did, we had a lot of fun; which is something you don't want to do during a service but this one was completely different and had a totally different vibe than a regular funeral service. There were some sad moments, but overall it was a party to celebrate his life.
[Bring back the ""Fun"" in Funeral.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85dmcg?context=5)|I put the 'fun' in funeral.
[Ever had strange occurrences of a supernatural nature?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c8595u9?context=5)|Every so often, yes. One time I had prepped this man. I came into the prep room to do some laundry and things. As I walked passed him, I noticed a small piece of lint in his ear from the towel I used to dry him off. I took my gloved pinky and kinda swiped it out. I proceeded to fold some towels. The next thing I know I felt something touch my ear, near the ear opening. It felt just like someone stuck their finger in my ear but there was noone around. The next day I was looking through the obituaries (i read the obituaries of the cases i work on) and sure enough this man had one. It mentioned how much of a prankster and fun he was. I guess I was his last prank.
 |My first experience at work was when I first started my embalming career. I worked at an independent mortuary service. I had just started my shift and was using a restroom in the back. When I came out, I heard what sounded like a girl sobbing and the sound of feet shuffling around on the floor. The floor was kinda gravely and had a distinct sound if you scooted your feet on it. The sound was coming from around a corner that led into a small room where we would store embalmed bodies ready to be delivered to their respective funeral home. I figured someone was upset and crying. So I kinda snuck in, still hearing the sobbing. When I peaked around the corner, the room was empty. No living person in there. I noticed that there was only one body in there as well. A young girl. She shot herself in the side of the head. I wasn't scared per say, but I'm pretty sure you could audibly hear my heart beat.
[Have you ever been physically attracted to one of the bodies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c858foo?context=5)|I've never been attracted to a dead body.
[Have you ever killed anyone in order to increase your own business?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c858foo?context=5)|Never killed anyone but some funeral homes joke when it's slow. ""better take my pillow to the nursing home""
[Have you ever had to handle a body that was so disfigured/decomposed/etc that it made you sick? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c858foo?context=5)|The odors associated with decomposition will irritate your system. if you are around it long enough you can feel sick to your stomach and vomit. I have felt sick around it, but never vomited. I have a pretty strong stomach.
[Have you ever seen the show Six Feet Under? If so, how realistic do you think their portrayal of funeral homes is?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85aa42?context=5)|I have seen every episode. I think they did a good job making it look real.
[Would you say you're a fan? Or did you just feel obligated to watch it because you knew people would bring it up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85g75r?context=5)|I became addicted to that show very quickly. The stories were good and their portrayal of the business is fairly accurate.
[Related to this show, what did you think of the ""green burial?"" I realize that it probably takes a cut in your business, but after seeing that, I kept thinking about how unnatural it is to fill a dead body with chemicals, put them in a casket, then bury them in a sealed cement box. Do you think that there is a trend toward the green burials?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85gxwi?context=5)|I see a definite rise in the demand for green burials. There are alternative funeral homes that specialize in them, usually small firms with low overhead so they still make money.
[Have you ever pumped Worcestershire sauce into a body?  Edit: I fixed it. Everyone can calm their tits now.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85csgb?context=5)|That's how you get a zombie, sir.
[What was the grossest job you've had to do so far?  Thank you for the AMA..this sub needs more everyday AMAs like we use to have!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85anxv?context=5)|We had this house call one time. The lady was dead a while. On the couch all bloated as hell. When we started moving her, the abdomen busted. I had goo and maggots all over my leg.
[Are there usually maggots if the person has been dead for just a day or 2? Under what circumstances does that occur?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c86wdfe?context=5)|Once the body starts decomposing, flies can sense that. And where there are flies, the maggots will come.
[Omg did you throw up?!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85bwgp?context=5)|No, but I threw my suit away.
[I too am a funeral director/ embalmer. We call maggots disco rice. I hate them so much. Pro tip: Kerosine kills maggots fast. So happy you are doing this AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85d454?context=5)|Use a real high index and watch those little fuckers put some pep in their step. they don't like the chems at all.
[Have you ever had to deal with children? What was it like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85eogt?context=5)|Yes, I have embalmed many children from babies to toddlers and up. It never really bothered me. Probably because I didn't have kids at the time. I've seen people get in this business with kids and absolutely cannot embalm or even attempt a child. I now have a 3 year old, but it hasn't changed my ability to effectively prep a child.
[IF your child, by any given circumstance would die, would you prefer to prepare the body or someone else to do it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85h2h0?context=5)|I would not allow anyone else to touch her.
[How is saved by the bell related to the funeral service? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c858wlh?context=5)|Back in the early days it was a huge fear to be buried alive. This has to do with the fact that medical science was shit at the time. Some people were just comotose, they couldn't tell if you were dead or not. That's why there was a 'wake' service where they would lay you out in state to see if you would 'wake' up. So these caskets were developed with a hole through the top, a string was placed in the deceased's hands and ran up out of the hole, through a tube to the top of the ground. The string was attached to a bell. So if you weren't actually dead, you could ring the bell. You would in fact be, 'saved by the bell'.
[When you're slow, business wise, is it pretty dead in the shop?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c858bc7?context=5)|In the busiest of times, the body shop is always dead.
[I just did my first head autopsy today! But in the future, what are some things us ME people can do to better prepare the bodies for the mortuary?  Ninja edit: morgue -&gt; mortuary.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85bvza?context=5)|Wow! You mean one of you actually care about the mortician? The most frustrating thing for an embalmer with a posted case is that when you guys remove the throat, tongue sometimes the carotids are cut or nicked so high up it becomes a very difficult challenge to get the head injected. And the head is the most important part. Whenever this happens we say, ""must've been training day"". I would say try your best to preserve the arteries, especially the carotids. Veins don't matter in a posted case.
[When you say farewell to somebody in public and shake their hand do you say ""I'll be seeing you""?  If so, what is their reaction?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85er8s?context=5)|I've said it to elderly family members. ""see ya soon!"" I usually get a chuckle. Another fun thing is to carry a tailoring tape measure. If someone ever tries some stupid stunt or something, bust it out and start taking their measurements. Gets a laugh every time.
[Did you ever bring in a hot plate and cut off a slice because you had *the hunger*?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c859v62?context=5)|No, but one time I was working on an autopsy. It was getting close to lunch and I was deciding what to have. I had bbq ribs that day.
[Were you, at any point, disgusted with/by your job? If so, how did you get over it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c858fe8?context=5)|When you are new in this business, there will be a time when you step back and say, ""what the fuck am I doing"". Mine was at mortuary school during embalming lab. The county would have their cases embalmed at the school for practice. The deceased was an autopsy and had no legs. I was just looking at her, autopsy incisions open, the empty cavity inside. Her hands looked as if to be gripping the edge of the table. Her mouth wide open because we haden't closed it yet. She looked like she was screaming silently in pain. That was my wtf moment, you get over it.
[I work in eye tissue donation. I've had people refuse because ""They need them to see their loved ones when they get to heaven."" What exactly happens to the eyes during an embalming? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85b9nq?context=5)|The eyes usually start to flatten after death. Think of an old grape. They do, however, remain with the decedent. We don't remove them. You can use what is called an eye cap to put over the flattened eyeball to recreate the natural curvature of the eye. You can also inject tissue builder directly into the eyeball and fill it up. And sometimes, the embalming fluid will fill the eye to normal size.
[Is the same true for when business is good? Pretty dead in the shop?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c858ge6?context=5)|It will always be a dead end job.
[Did you go into the business by choice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c858b9x?context=5)|Yes I did. I was fascinated by the industry as a kid. When I was 12, there was a bad head on collision near my house. A man in a truck didn't make it. My family and I were standing around with all the other neighbors when the coroner arrived. He pronounced, then they took him out and put him on a stretcher, his head turned to the side looking straight at me. I remember being curious as to what happens to people when they die, as far as the physical body.
[Are women creeped out by your career choice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85d4a3?context=5)|Some are. I like to date other morticians or nurses. They seem to understand and are over the whole novelty of it all.
[You seem way 2 calm about a head turning and looking at you when you are 12 lol.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85aci4?context=5)|It was exciting for me, lol.
[Is there really a dating site for morticians. Can I have a weekend at morts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c861bzq?context=5)|I've never heard of one but that's a good idea for a dating website. Another good dating website would be for people who work the night shift. I've worked the nightshift before and it's hell on your dating life.
[Other than the Clown Funeral, any other ""funny"" funerals that stand out in your memory? By funny I mean something memorable or humorous happened, or the attendees did something that you recall as being unusual in the context of normal funeral behavior.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85b9fc?context=5)|One time we had a person who did some acting and modeling in California. A hand model. The family came in early for the visitation to set up pictures and things. I show them in, help them get started then leave them so they can do their thing. I come back in about 10 min to check on them and just about every picture they put up was this persons hands from the various ads they did. There were some family photos, but most were a pair of hands. It was funny to me because most people will put up whole pictures.
[When you cremate someone, how often do the ashes from previous customers make it into the current customer's mix?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85cod3?context=5)|There is some co-mingling involved, although very minimal. It is unavoidable, you can't get every single grain out. As long as you sweep it properly after each person, it is very minimal.
[The funeral home that took care of my husband let me come back with him and see how clean it was and called me back when it was finished.   I felt certain this was a strange request, but my husband asked me to make sure I brought him home and not some bag of dust.  I am still amazed by the compassion and sensitivity we were given.  Is this taught?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85gv4t?context=5)|Not really. Good, caring people usually gravitate to this career and excel at it. I'm glad you had a positive experience.
[That's really interesting. It'd be easy to assume that, seeing as you're dealing with dead people, only empathetic, cold people would be drawn to the career.  Have you ever had problems with people thinking that?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85la1v?context=5)|Not really, but they do exist in this business.
[As someone who works closely with the recently deceased, how has it affected your own belief/disbelief in any kind of afterlife?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85c994?context=5)|I have heard enough stories from families and have had enough experiences around the funeral home to feel that there is something else afterwards.
[Would you be embalmed yourself? Or would you want to be cremated?  Do you do cremations? Which is more common, cremations or embalming? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c859jmg?context=5)|I'm ok with being embalmed and buried. I'm also ok with being cremated. I will let my family choose the method which best suits them at the time. We do cremations also, yes. The cremation rate is on the rise, big time. Our firm is 60% cremation.
[What the most 'interesting' death that occurred to a person you mortified? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c859rp0?context=5)|Lot's of interesting deaths. I embalmed a man that was found dead, leaning over a balcony in the front of his house. It was October and with all his decorations, neighbors thought he also was a decoration. He was there for days.
[Who would you recommend this job to? Like what kind of person would make a good mortician?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85bkea?context=5)|It's funny. I was a waiter for many years in my younger days. I always say, If you can be a successful waiter, you can be a successful funeral director. They are similar in ways. They both wait on families, both provide what should be excellent customer service. Just that one puts a pizza in the oven, the other puts a body in the oven. But really anyone who is good with people and customer service should do well.
[Hey Mortician. I've worked with the dead for a few years in my life. One time I picked up a woman who OD'd and I believe had been ruled dead for over a day. When I put her in the body bag, I started talking to the coroner. While my attention was distracted, the bag started rubbing against my leg. I could feel the blood flush out of me like a tidal wave and literally turned bone white. I was told this was caused by the gases escaping the body. Do you see this phenomenon often or at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85ewiq?context=5)|So the bag filled with gas and pressed against your leg? I've never seen that. Sometimes when you move them, air escapes the throat and they make noises. Sounds like a snore.
[I am an ICU nurse. Do you guys really appreciate when we leave the central lines in?  I was told it saves you a step,  but I always wondered if was true. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85f0un?context=5)|I appreciate it due to the fact that dead blood doesn't coagulate and leaving the lines in saves a lot of leakage on my stretcher and in the vehicle. I can see where it would save an embalmer a step in that they just leave it in. But such an embalmer would be lazy. All medical tubes, IV lines, etc should be removed during embalming and the holes left behind are sutured and glued.
[Do they teach you in school how to pull various lines? I've sent people to the funeral home with urinary catheters in for various reasons (mostly I forget about them\). Am I making a mortician somewhere swear at me? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85ieke?context=5)|No, it's all very easy for us to remove.
[Does your occupation make you think about your own mortality? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c8599jy?context=5)|I think this occupation helps you accept your own mortality. I have no fear of death.
[Have/Will there ever be a job you refuse to do? ..like under any circumstances of the body/family/whatever.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85bpu5?context=5)|I've seen pictures and have heard about people being embalmed and placed on a motorcycle, stood up in the corner, in a recliner.. This all seems ridiculous and disrespectful to me. Especially if the deceased did not request it. I say I would refuse to do this to someone but who knows. I mean if the family really wants it.
[Mouth closure: what do you prefer? Dental tie? Mandible suture? Or the needle injector? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85dg6l?context=5)|First choice for people with teeth is the needle injector. Mandibular suture for no teeth. I have perfected my technique. I never have a visible divet under the chin.
[What's an average day on the job like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c858v3f?context=5)|It depends on what's going on. an average day you might have a funeral service, meet with a family for arrangements, run death certificates to the doctors that are not online, pick up a body from a hospital.
[So a mortician is the person who prepares bodies for funerals then?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c859jb2?context=5)|Yes. Mortician is a term that applies to a person who is both funeral director and embalmer. In my state, not every funeral director is an embalmer, but every embalmer is a funeral director. The embalmers will prepare a body for burial.
[I'm from Ireland. Is a mortician the same thing as we would call an undertaker over here?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c869w7y?context=5)|Yes, they're pretty much synonomous terms: funeral director, undertaker, mortician.
[What's the pay like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85ajym?context=5)|Depends on the funeral home. Large corporate funeral homes will low ball you. Independent's will usually pay more.
[I know  I'm late to the party, but if you're still taking questions, what are your thoughts on independent homes and transfer services versus homes and transfer services owned by multinationals like Service Corp?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85gi8v?context=5)|I have found that the money is better at an independent.
[Where would you rather work and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85gi8v?context=5)|There are pros and cons with each. In a corporation you have an HR dept on your side if the managers an ass. In an independent, if the owner is being an ass, you're kinda screwed.
[Proof?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c858fbt?context=5)|[IMG\]\[Link to i1291.photobucket.com](http://i1291.photobucket.com/albums/b549/spicemaster242/DSCF1730_zps004fe1e1.jpg[/IMG])
[What happens when the certification expires?!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85div8?context=5)|Have to renew every 2 years.
[Is renewing just like renewing your driver's license or is it more complicated?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85gal1?context=5)|I have to take 16hrs of continuing education classes to renew.
[When it comes to these supernatural experiences, do morticians like telling these stories to each other or do they not say anything out of fear of being thought of as crazy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85fpve?context=5)|I have shared stories with mortician friends, But I wouldn't have a serious supernatural conversation with the owner or anything. I can't even say that it is supernatural or ghosts or anything like that but the fact remains that weird shit does happen, sometimes with no logical explanation.
[Could it be that it's just your mind playing tricks on you?  I can imagine how creepy it would be if you're alone in the building, working late in a room full of corpses..](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85i6af?context=5)|Sounds like a pretty normal day to me.
[I heard somewhere that morticians hang bodies on a hook via a cut in the back of their neck. Is this true?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85berr?context=5)|No! But that would be awesome! j/k. It's funny to me about exactly how little the general public knows about this industry. It's a myth. People are embalmed on their backs. Another myth is that we cut off the legs of tall people so they fit in the casket. Our secret: put something uner the legs so that the knees are bent.
[This might have already been asked, but what is the most common thing that the public thinks about the industry that isn't true?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85brok?context=5)|The misconception that every funeral director is filthy rich. you might make a decent living, but only the owners get rich.
[Id like to get into this business myself. Is there any sort of internship involved? Id love to know.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c858e2h?context=5)|My state requires attendance at a mortuary school to obtain a provisional license. You can then move into a 'student' or 'intern' position at a funeral home.
[Awhile back, a firefighter posted a photo of the..erm...cork used to hold internal organs in.  Do those giant cork things really exist, and do you really have to insert them?...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85buuo?context=5)|I'd have to see a picture. They do make anal plugs that 'screw' in to prevent leakage. The anus and vagina are usually packed with surface embalming chems and cotton to help prevent leakage. Not everyone will leak from these areas though.
[Hi. First of all: Thanks for your service.  What does a dead body smell like? - What exactly, as a mortician, do you do? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c859eeg?context=5)|Depends on what happend to it. Burned bodies smell like burned meat, no different than if you burnt a steak. Electrocuted bodies have a sweet scent to them, reminds me of roasted marshmallow. Decomps can be really horrible to be around and if you're around the long enough it will make you sick. -I am a licensed funeral director and embalmer. I make arrangements with families, I work on funeral services, I embalm all our bodies at the funeral home. I run errands, I take clergymen, hospice people out to lunch sometimes. There's a lot to do.
[What's the weirdest thing you have found on a body?  Also we need proof.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c8591o3?context=5)|I added proof. One time we made a house call. The deceased lady was over 500 pounds. We just wrapped her up in the sheets and blankets she was on and dragged her out. When we eventually got her on the prep table and started taking the sheets off, all this debris started coming out. Potato chip bags, candy wrappings, 2-liter coke bottles. Then I hear a clang on the ground, the lady had a locked &amp; loaded glock.
[How do you think the hospice movement has affected the funeral business?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c858cr9?context=5)|We actually work very closely with hospice organizations. They can't refer business to you but they're good to have on your side.
[Hey! Thanks so much for this. I think this is my first time actually asking a question on r/IAmA, actually.  Anyway, I live in New Orleans. And if you've ever been there, you'd know that we pretty much put our dead on display. Because of that, and the inordinate amount of funerals that I've attended in my 19 years on earth, I've found that I have a fascination with death. More specifically, the traditions that are synonymous. I've put serious thought into becoming a Mortician, but as of now, I don't think that it's the right choice for me. I thank you for your service.  I have to know, can you give me one singular moment when you sat back, perhaps after a funeral, and thought: wow. I did a good thing today?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85dhc5?context=5)|When a family member hugs and thanks me for whatever. It makes it so worth it. It can be a thankless career path. You gotta pat yourself on the back and say attaboy because noone else is gonna tell you. But when it comes from the family you served, it is very rewarding.
[Do funeral directors always slice the back of an outfit in half so it's easier to slip on in two pieces?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85c6hk?context=5)|It's funeral director preference. I always slice the back of tshirts, shirts, and jackets. It just makes it easier to dress. I don't like jostling around with the body incase they purge some fluids. You can get the pants on without cutting unless they are too small. I work with a guy that cuts nothing, I chuckle as he struggles with a body.

I forgot to retrieve my cellphone out of the coffin. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85cpxb?context=5)|Sometimes things are forgotton or left behind. Usually our equipment. One time I was on an out of town service/graveside. 2hrs away. I ended up forgetting the pew markers in the church. It happens.
[What's your salary? Enough to lend me tree fiddy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85dhbr?context=5)|I make a good living. Although, I'll never be rich on my current salary.
[How many religions can you accommodate?  There are funeral homes that specialize, say in orthodox Jewish funerals, but are you supposed to be able to handle anyone who calls you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c859ykv?context=5)|The majority of our church services are Catholic. But we have experience with LDS, protestant, lutheran, methodist, etc 
[Have you ever an Orthodox Jewish funeral service?  If so, can you explain some of the nuances to me?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85d3hd?context=5)|It's been a while. There are Jewish funeral homes here. They typically bury the next day. No embalming, if they do embalm you have to save the blood in jars to bury with them. Orthodox Jewish believe that part of your soul resides in the blood. That's why the body is usually intact. Typically in a wood casket, all wood, no metal parts. That's about all I recall without looking it up.
[Do you ever get weird requests about the body from family members? I went to a funeral where they had the (open\) coffin propped up so the dude was standing up, it was bizarre. The mortician said they used a brace up his legs/back to make him sit still &gt;_&lt;](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c859wuy?context=5)|I've never had a request like that, but you do what you do to please the family.

[I've read some articles claiming morticians get looked down upon by every day people. Have you ever had this experience when telling someone about your profession?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85d5uw?context=5)|Some people do get all weird when I tell them what I do. In my everyday life, I don't want anyone to know for this reason. Others find it fascinating and want to know all about it.

[I've been told that funeral homes work with florists so that after the funeral, any remaining floral arrangements sent to the home, are given back to a local florist to reuse the flowers.

Thanks!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17gdq5/iama_mortician_with_time_to_kill_ama/c85quls?context=5)|A good florist will usually give the funeral home a kickback of some sort for sending them tons and tons of business. But we never re-sell the flowers. Any flowers or plants the family doesn't want get donated to local nursing homes. The staff will use them for arrangements in the dining room or other places.
[Where does the blood go when you embalm someone?  Do you remove the organs?

You would think there would have to be some kind of special septic tank or something to catch everything but nope. No organs are removed during the process. There is a step in embalming that involves treating the internal organs. I certainly hope that nobody could feel it. Excrutiating pain would be a gross understatement.

17hmb5,5,2013-01-29,Career advice anyone?,secret-user,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/17hmb5/career_advice_anyone/,"**Hello Reddit.**

First I want to say that I'm sorry about bad writing in this post. It's just a subject that is really close too my hart. And I'm not super good at english grammar. 

Let me introduce myself. I'm 19 years old. I've been in love with games since I was a young one. And I figured out early that I some day wanted to work with games. But I didn't think it was possible for a normal human being. So I started taking computers apart, and setting them back together to better try to understand how it all fit together. When I understood the aspect of computer parts, and their role. I quickly got bored of just doing hardware. Thats when I started exploring web applications.

I guess I was about 14-15 years old when I started exploring the different web technologies. I started learning html and css. It was a lot of fun. But everything I made looked like crap. I remember one day I got into my classroom, And I saw a lot of people standing in front of the one computer in the room. I heard them laughing, So I walked up to check out what they where laughing about. And it was my website. It was a rough time to get though. But after some time, I decided it wouldn't break my spirit. And thats when I started learning Photoshop, JavaScript and PHP. It took some time to get it all down. But It was god damn worth it. Now I'm one of the two interns in town. Actually in this whole region! And i'm proud of that. 

Here is where the game development comes in. I started learning c++ and java after work hours the last year. And I feel like I'm starting to get a ok grasp of the basics. I guess what I'm asking is:

- Do my web development work make me more valuable in the game development industry? 

- If I keep up doing what I do here as an intern, I have quite the opportunity to have a good stable income. Is their any chance to get a good paying job in a game development office for one like me? 

- And does anyone have any solid advice for how I should go about my career? I want to one day become a good game programmer.


**TL;DR**

- Do my web development work make me more valuable in the game development industry? 
- If I keep up doing what I do here as an web dev / design intern, I have quite the opportunity to have a good stable income. Is their any chance to get a good paying job in a game development office for one like me? 
- And does anyone have any solid advice for how I should go about my career? I want to one day become a good game programmer.

I have past work experience, however, it's complicated.

As part of an honor's program at my high school, all students were required to work an internship one summer, I managed to score an internship at a small independent game company, and managed to even get hired back after my internship was completed. But then things got rough. Eventually, I ended up walking out.

Now, I'm unsure about whether or not I want to put this job on my resume. I feel I grew a lot as a person from my time working, and I feel like having past experience gives me a huge leg up on the competition.

I'm a sophomore in my engineering program and am having a hard time choosing a declared major between civil and environmental engineering. I was hoping to get some input and advice from engineers working in either field. 

As I said, I am a sophomore and I'm doing very well in the program so far: 3.9 major GPA, involved in ASCE, EWB, etc, and I've begun looking for internships. There are a few more internship opportunities at my school for civils, which is one of the draws for that major, but I'm still drawn to environmental, especially as I'm told that the job prospects are supposed to be better in the coming years. I'm obviously still learning, but I think I'm more interested in water systems and water resource engineering than say structural engineering, and I'm told that environmental is a better path for that. However, I've also been told that as a civil I can take classes on these subjects, get my emphasis in them, but still be more employable in the long run since it is a broader degree.

I realize you probably get asked these kinds of questions often, so I apologize for that. But any advice as to the job outlook in either field, what you think the future holds, or suggestions on what to emphasize in would be much appreciated. Thanks!"

During my first internship as an athletic trainer, I wasn't allowed to get paid according to my school, and yet I managed to personally work with athletes until they turned pro. One internship, I was a test cook, and I did many of the projects for my supervisors, coming in before everybody arrives and leaving after everybody leaves. I even taught one of my supervisors how to perform certain methods that he never heard/thought of as well as basic math &amp; statistics skills. When interning as a research assistant, I found the appropriate enzyme and bacteria to use to create real vegan cheese, the french classical way. Another internship had me in the kitchen for 15 hours a day, 7 days a week, and I never gained recognition. My current unpaid internship had me in the office until 8pm last Friday, while my supervisor left early, and they're having me create an algorithm for their website (something that isn't remotely close to what I was supposed to be doing), but at least they started paying me with a bus/subway pass. 

Despite all of these internships being unpaid, people keep telling me, ""Oh, it's a great opportunity, you'll gain experience and you'll be given a job in no time!"", and I've gotten zilch. Just yesterday, after applying for a job as a receptionist with a salary, the CEO emailed me back saying that I was ""over qualified"" and offered me an unpaid freakin' internship. When can one actually get a real decent job, without flipping burgers, that pays something? How can these companies get away with these unpaid ""internships"" even when I'm putting more work than the people that they're paying?! Has anybody else experienced this? Is this normal?"

The county bought a couple hundred iPads and quickly learned that iPads work best with Macs. So like the poorly budgeted morons they are, the county went out and bought a couple hundred iMacs. I’m good with macs, I was good with macs in high school, and I got hired to teach the other ITC how to administrate macs and fix most issues.  Anyway, a few months into the year, one of the teachers reported that some his keyboards and mice weren’t working. I went in after school and took a look at his room. All of the computers were fine. Keyboards and mice were working fine, so I told him this and let him know that if it happened again, let me know. The next day, he told me that all of the computers weren’t working, I went in after school and took a look. Every thing was fine, so I came back the next day during class. Sure enough none of the computer’s mice and keyboards were working. 
	I took one of the computers into my office and plugged it in. Still broken. I waited until after school, when the computers started working again, and started testing things on it. All of the USB ports worked, cables weren’t frayed, etc. Then I noticed that wifi was on. This was odd since I had set it so that you needed administrative rights to turn wifi on. I tried logging in as root(root password never changed I had to change the administrative password every month) and I got back the most confusing error. It said the password was wrong. I tried it a few more times and asked my boss if he had changed it. Nope. So I logged into my account and checked it out. I changed the root password back to the old one and went back to the classroom. Sure enough, the root password was changed on all of them. I changed all of them back and told the teacher about it and told him that that should fix it. The next day, all of the machines were back to being broken. I told the teacher that I’ll have to send them all in since I’m out of ideas. Just then, a note popped up on the computer I was sitting at. It said “Be in your office at 12:30”. Since I really wanted to figure out what was going on, and I had lunch that period anyway, I decided that it would be a good idea to be in my office. 
	At exactly 12:35, a student, lets call him Dave, walked into my office, sat down in the chair next to my desk and pulled out his laptop. I asked him flat out, “Are you the reason why (Teacher)’s computers haven’t been working?” His response, being quite cocky I might add, “Yup, and I’m going to show you exactly how I did it, two more ways to do it, and how you can fix it.” 
	At that point, I just stared at him for a few moments, confused as hell. He broke the awkward silence with, “I heard you say that you were going to send the computers in for repair. I didn’t want to cause you that much of a headache and this was getting boring anyway.” I told him okay.
	He pulled out his laptop, opened Apple Remote Desktop and showed me how he was disabling the keyboard and mouse. He also showed me quite a few other things you could do with it and I wrote myself a note to ask the school to buy a copy. 
	The next puzzle is why the root password was changed. I asked him about it and said nothing, stood up, and gestured for me to follow him. He went into (Teacher)’s room and sat down at an iMac. True to his word, he showed me the way he did it and two other ways to do it, all of which could be done in under 90 seconds. (The methods he used are openly available and can be found with a little bit of google, so I’m not going to post them here. If you really want to know, send me a message.)
I was so impressed that he could do this the I bought him lunch in exchange for him telling me everything else he could do and him agreeing not to change the passwords again and not to tell any of the other students about this. Over lunch, I asked him if he’d be okay being an intern with the ITC and me. He said yes, and now he has my job as part time Mac guru for the school.

TL;DR: Defaults are evil, some students are smart, and there are good people left in the world.

I've been learning C++ pretty much since high school but I do not feel I'm all that good. The only things I really did was coursework and anything really advanced feels too much for me.  I also do not know what to even look for when I get out, in other words I do not know what I like because I have only gotten a small flavor from my classes.  When I am coding on something I really know about I do enjoy myself and have a fun time figuring out how to solve the problem.  Recently I started using codeacademy and have done some script and later move on to things like html and python.

My main problem is I'm bad a starting something on my own and even if I want to start it I don't know where to go.  Is there a place where I can at least get an idea of what I'll be able to do with my CS degree and somehow study for that field?  Is it bad that if I only know C++ and feel very insecure about my skills to still look for an internship?  What do you guys advise I do if you were in my position?

I get a ticket that seems easy enough. ""Not able to load access database."" Probably user error so I put it in my queue and head to the user's desk. 

Apparently, all new hires to the engineering department have to go through training. This curriculum was put together quite a few years ago and was built on top of Access forms for reasons that either nobody could explain or nobody would own up to. They had been around so long, in fact, that nobody actually knew where they came from or who made them. But at the time, I did not know this. 

When I got to the desk, I saw that the user was running Win 7 and Office 2010 on a brand new laptop. I asked them what the problem was and they said that Access threw up an error when trying to load the file. So I ask them to show me how they would load the file. They correctly browse to the file and try to open, and lo and behold, an error. 
""This database was saved in the Microsoft Access 2.0 file format."" Oh ok...wait, what?? 

This critical company training, without which a new employee could not continue to work in the company, was done in Access 2.0 and never updated. 

Well, no problem. Naive me makes a copy of the mdb(!) file and tries to do an import. Doesn't work. Not even a little bit. 

So, I spend the next two hours installing XP Compatibility mode, installing access 2.0 in that (which doesn't have an installer...just a dll file!) and running that in Windows 95 compatibility inside of the XP vm.

He is not terribly old. Of course, he is not terribly young, either. He is my grandmother’s brother, on my mother’s side of the family and he is dying. I am sitting on his bedside and outside, far away, police sirens are roaring. He was always our uncle, but he was more of a cousin, he was more of a peer. Uncle was a child at heart. With my brother and I being the only children in the family, he was our de facto cousin. He was the family friend we could relate to. He was not a condescending source of maturity; he was as ridiculous and optimistic as we were. The fact that he is dying destroys us. It destroys me. An obnoxious measure of sirens blots out my thoughts. 

Adam is taking it with particular difficulty. He is the truest baby of the family and my younger (and only) brother. That is not to say that the rest of the family is coping any easier. Uncle Jack was the youngest of his siblings, as well. It is a terrible situation no matter how you word it. He would always be the one telling me, “John, you take care of Adam if anything ever happens to us,” meaning, the older relatives and my parents. That advice gives me little solace today. 

Uncle Jack was a police officer for many years. He married a beautiful woman who we came to love as our aunt in his early thirties and that was probably the symbolic ending of our “peer relationship” with him. At that point, he was our elder. We were no longer arbitrary cousins. It ironed out the family. We knew who we were and what our family consisted of, at last. Adam was almost out of middle school when this happened and I was just graduating high school. 

It is incredible what a decade can do to your being. Adam is now a police officer, very much so following in the footsteps of his beloved uncle. But Uncle Jack, dearest uncle… he is not nearly as thriving. He maintained a lustrous career in the New York Police Department and was looking forward to retiring by fifty. Instead, he contracted a rare cancer, probably due to a consistent bout of responding to emergency calls in this one devastated area of the city. You know the area: uprooted partitions of asbestos and every god damned carcinogen known to man were crudely molded into low-income housing. Now, every time some schmuck with a gun let a slug fly, these chemicals became airborne. These chemicals infected the lungs of the men and women who were there to protect the innocent bastards who were unfortunate enough to live in these areas, to live besides the walking scum of mankind that fought such petty wars. And now he was dying, before sixty years of age. 

I will not get into the philosophy and utter bullshit that comes into play when discussing such matters. Would a just god allow a kind and fair person to die before the age of seventy? Would an omnipotent universe allow a schoolyard of young child to be slain at the end of a gun belonging to a madman? I am not one to even begin rationalizing these conversations and will sure as hell not begin to do so here. The fact remained: my uncle was dying and my family was preparing for the absolute worst. And we struggled against futile efforts. 

Adam and I, we grew up and matured under almost direct-influence from my uncle. Of course my dearest mother and father crafted our personalities. Of course our friends and schoolmates helped to form our ideas. But, as far as anything beyond our genetic destinations, our uncle was probably singlehandedly responsible for our identifications as selves. From our profound interest in the afterlife to our preference to spending the weekends playing paintball in the mountains, he forged us. Honing in on the whole “afterlife” aspect of our interests, he gifted us one item that truly solidified our love for the macabre. When I was just beginning high school, however many years ago, our dearest uncle gave my brother and I a simple Ouija board. 

It was a mass-produced and super commercialized item. We were, concurrently, super skeptical, but my brother was feebly open-minded and I was always looking for a way to spook myself and my family out. The silly board game even had a “glow in the dark” feature that added to the ridiculous nature of the whole ordeal. This led to Adam and I spending countless afternoons in the basement, sitting cross-legged on the floor in the dark, peering into the softly glowing, barely visible face of the Ouija board. 

My skepticism had never left me and Adam was never particularly deft in the craft of manufacturing a storyline and characters of a fictional persona. So, when we began “meeting” otherworldly beings and dead humans through this board game, I was a little bit more than pleased and worried with our findings. Whenever we would ask their names, we would get a handful of random letters that only loosely resembled realistic names. But their backstories would always be spelt with the utmost of tact and grammar. While their names were gibberish, their explanations were perfect. It was a tad unsettling, sitting as the elder in the room. 	

With all of this apparent fright, let it be known that I was never upset with my younger brother. I did not receive these paranormal readings as malcontent on his part. It just surprised me, at times in pride, at others in fear, that he could move the dial on the Ouija board and spell out entire life stories of people who had lived in the 14th, 18th, and 19th century. How did he, a public student living in 21st century America, know the politics of Luxemburg? How did he know that women in historical China would bind their feet? How would he, a boy who had barely begun to pick up the guitar, know what a mandolin was? I could not tell if it was my practical joking getting the best of him and I concurrently or if otherworldly forces were at play. Could this ridiculous board game actually channel… something else? Of course not. I refused to believe it. It must have been something about our subconscious or some other psychological phenomena that I could not explain.

Time went on and I found other vices to occupy my time. I found petty flirtations with girls my age that never came to fruition. Young puppy love and relations that never manifested themselves into an actual relationship. I was far too afraid to actually ask a girl out on a date, so these feelings only resulted in my confiding with my good friends. But I had not kept tabs on my younger brother. As where I had grown tired of playing with the Ouija board, Adam kept at it with his friends and even, at times, by himself. In the days that we had played with the device, we had “met” an entity known as Xenon. It was a completely ridiculous and unbelievable name, but she was supposedly an Asian immigrant of the Luxemburg storyline that I had previously alluded to. She was a servant of a household in the European micro-nation. She had also played the sitar. How my brother had created these characters, I have no idea. My imagination was certainly not at play and I, even as a younger teenager, truly did not try to disenfranchise the results of the board by creating my own metaphysical stories to frighten my brother. 

I allowed them to play with the board without supervision for quite some time. He had shown it to various girls and boys from the neighborhood whenever I was working at the local craft store. As I had said, I was no longer interested in the game, but his young mind surely was. Life went on. 

As we grew up a bit, we would cater to our love for the paranormal through alternative means. Fortunately for us, it became a topic of popular culture and many television series and specials were produced for broadcast programming. This allowed for our parents to become involved in our hobby. After a few episodes of a ghost hunting show on television, my mom confessed, with a slight bit of sarcasm and enthusiasm, that she had thought she had seen a “woman standing in our living room, late at night.” This was, of course, an appeal to my brother and I, an attempt at stirring our imagination. I nodded and worked on my dinner as Adam stared in amazement and swore that he, too, had seen such a manifestation. Our dog, a small Jack Russell Terrier, entirely white except for a splotch of brown on her head, took this opportunity to steal some food off of his plate. The little rat had always sat right behind Adam, sharing his chair and hoping that he dropped food. 

Having been next in line for our creative development (behind my beloved uncle), my mother would consistently drop little story starters into our daily lives and never provide much more to go on. Much like the short story about the woman in the living room, she would give us a mental image and an out-of-the-ordinary situation, and let the ideas cultivate in our young minds. This continued for a long time and at certain points, I could not tell if she was merely being whimsical or actually telling stories which had occurred in her life. I remember when I was a freshman in college, visiting home for the winter, she swore that when she was working on her computer in the kitchen, our dog walked past her legs and into her bed which was typically at my mother’s feet. She reached down to pet my dog and realized nothing was there. A few moments later, after searching, she found the dog sleeping upstairs. 

Weeks later, after watching one of these television series with the entire family, we found ourselves enjoying a scene, invariably scripted beyond oblivion, of the “paranormal investigators” utilizing a Ouija board and attempting to talk to spirits in the attic of an old house in Washington State. Adam sat there on the couch, with this knees held against his chest in rapt attention. It was pleasant to see that childhood enthusiasm alive and well. Although he had still regularly played with the board, seeing this television show had completely rekindled his love of the game. He asked that I would play with him that weekend when he had his friends over. 

There were two boys and a girl. They were all around fourteen years old and, naturally, little shits. There is really no other way to put it. I am all but positive that one of them and the girl were a couple. He’d take every opportunity of physical contact as a grace-lacking attempt at touching a personal area of the girl’s body. Were this incident to occur today, modernly, there would absolutely be harassment issues brought up between the girl and the boy, their school’s guidance counselor, and possibly the police. But that is merely my age revealing itself. Unfortunately, the curse of young adulthood and piss-poor personalities did not keep its hands off of my younger brother. 

Before we began the séance, we sat around the board and Adam gave the instructions, their objectives, and his “house rules” of sorts. The girl lit three candles and turned the lights off at his request. He warned his friends to be very serious in this exercise. He warned that it could be a lot of fun, but that they may end up talking to very powerful and sometimes malicious entities. He did not want them to display any disrespect or rudeness, because he frequently had spoken with “demons” who had initially introduced themselves as benevolent spirits. One of the boys asked what he meant and Adam, appealing to the annoying nature I had previously mentioned, told him that he would be temporarily cursed. Further inquiring to what Adam meant, he told him that “whenever he went into the bathroom, your face would be replaced with white eyes and a horrible screaming mouth” – I intervened and told him to knock it off. There was no point in playing with this if you were going to be a lying schmuck throughout the ordeal. 

He laughed at my objectivity and apologized. The three others laughed nervously too: they still believed in my brother’s ridiculous warning. No such “curse” ever came about, so there’s always that. Ha.
Before long, we encountered an entity that refused to give a name. The boys teased, saying that it was afraid of us, and the board said, simply, “bullshit.” They asked if it was a boy or a girl and it did not respond, again. The group was quiet for a little bit, nervous, and the girl hazarded, “Are you a demon?” The room was still for a moment, then the dial moved, all of our hands on it: yes, you little slut. I chalked it up to the touchy-feely boy, but he looked as shocked as everyone else. They were a little upset. 

Adam looked genuinely worried at this point. He apologized to the board, for our rudeness and whatnot. It responded with a simple “fine” and the group did not really know where to go from there. One of the boys finally asked, adding an additional apology, if they could speak to someone else and the demon could be on its way. The board told us that he would not release the board to any other entity. We were going to speak to him and him only.

This seemed to really not sit well with anyone. I, well, I was interested. I held my smirk behind a straight-grit in order to keep the group still and petrified. Without asking another question, the dial moved once more and scribed a sentence that chills me to this day: tell that brother of yours to stop being a smartass. My eyes widened and I looked at Adam. Adam looked at me and then wore an expression of a man twenty years his elder, so far removed from the comforts of modern living. He wore the face of a parent burying his child, of a surgeon failing, of a war veteran outliving his comrades. He bore too much knowledge about the situation at hand, far more knowledge than anyone in the room. Essentially, this was not a joke. We had all removed our hands with this last insult and Adam motioned to return them, clearing his throat.
“Demon,” Adam asked. “Is that you, Amney?”

The familiarity and tone in my brother’s voice made the hair on my neck stand. Without a second to contemplate the situation at hand, the dial read “yes.”
“Listen, we were just interested in showing our friends how the board works. We mean no harm.”
“I know, you little fuck. I was just checking in. How’s the family?” The board wrote.
After the response, the dial rapidly shot to each corner of the board, to the decorative pictures that branded the extremities. Nonsense.
“We’re… we’re fine, Amney. I know we haven’t spoken in a while.”
“Good. Good.  Which parent do you love more?”
At this point, I picked up the little dial and clutched it tight, standing.
“No, we’re done. This is bullshit. Adam, I don’t know if you’re fucking with your friends, or… or what. But we’re done.”

The fucking thing tore from my grip and landed upright on the board. The candles went out immediately after and the girl screamed. I moved towards the stairs and turned on the light. The candles were tipped over and the wet wax smothered the board. Most of it was covered, except for the smiling sun in the upper left-hand corner.  The wax encompassed it and most of the mess was already drying. Adam looked up at me and told me he was sorry, a single tear running down his face. He sniffed, looked away, composed himself and rapidly stood, cleaning the mess. His friends never saw his tear.

We quickly packed up and that was that. We did not talk much about it. He was obviously bothered, but got over it by midweek. We played plenty of shooter video games and we even drank a little bit of our parent’s alcohol when they went away the next weekend. That Sunday night we watched a horror movie which focused around a demon. Upon realizing the story’s premise and hearing the word “demon,” I silently hated myself and prayed that it would not bring some shell-shocked flashback to my brother’s being. No such break down occurred; in fact, he calmly and happily brought up the experience after the movie. He simply asked, “Do you remember that whole ‘Amney’ bit?”

Of course, I said yes.

“Yeah, that fucker is creepy,” he smirked.
“You talked to him a lot?” I asked him.
“Yeah. I don’t really know how to explain it. Maybe those things are like… creative unlockers? You know? Like they tap into your creative invulnerabilities and just pour words from you.”
“I don’t know, man.”
“Well, I hope so, at least. He described himself to me one time. Real creepy stuff.”
“Like what?”
“Well, he was a demon. First of all,” he chuckled at this. He was nervous at first, then the seriousness caught his voice. “He was a demon, and he told me that the  most relatable thing he could call himself, the thing I would most understand, was the shape of a dog. Except instead of your typical ‘dog-shaped’ head, he said it resembled a mask. Like a large, porcelain, V-shaped mask. Mostly blank, besides large black eyes.”

I think of my mother sitting at a computer desk in the kitchen, thinking she saw a Jack Russell Terrier move past her feet.

“Weird, man,” I reply, offering nothing else.
“Yeah…” he cleared his throat. “What did you think about when he asked about mom and dad?”
“I,” I thought for a moment. “I didn’t.”
“Good,” Adam nodded. “He would have done something vengeful.”

I did not know what he meant, but I did not want to pry. I was happy enough that we covered this topic without a breakdown of tears. We proceeded to watch some mindless programming for a few hours and he went to bed, happy.

Later that night, or rather, early that morning, I received a call from the police department informing me that my parents had died in a car accident on I-95. I did not tell Adam until later that day. He went to school, like any other day, and spent six or seven hours in ignorance. He went to his part time job at the grocery store and worked, happily and stupidly, like any other day. I had to tell him when he got home. Our uncle and grandparents were there. It was inevitable. It was not my choice. He had to know. Were it up to me, I would have kept him, to this day, ignorant of the fact that our parents died, one with the melted and molten iron and steel that cocooned their bodies. Their carcasses were inseparable from the frame of the vehicle that carried us to however many family vacations. The vessel that brought us to Disney World was now their tomb; the vehicle that brought us to the beach was now the same chemical composite as our parents. Were it up to me, I would have prolonged his revelation with bullshit in the vein of, “oh, they are traveling in Europe,” or, “they continued their weekend trip and their flights are delayed!” Bullshit. Ignorant bullshit that keeps the emotional mind at bay.

We mourned. The community supported us. I was on the verge of suicide for months. The thought of my brother being alone kept me going. Our uncle was our guardian for a while, although officially, per the government’s papers, our grandparents were our guarantors. I grew older, completed college, and watched my brother finish high school. The years that followed were uneventful. Adam got a community service commendation; I managed to break from alcoholism. I got a job in mid-management at the state health department; Adam earned an internship at the police department. We were the most typical fucked up brothers you could fine. That was until our uncle became sick.

Yes, I know what you’re thinking: oh, a family member was diagnosed with something malignant, aren’t you a special snowflake. Well, you can go fuck yourself. Uncle Jack is in hospice as we speak. I already told you this. Uncle Jack is in hospice and the sirens have been blaring all day. From all around our sleepy town in the middle of nowhere, crisscrossed by highways and interstates and roads that lead everywhere but here, the sirens have been blaring. Fire trucks and police officers from towns that never knew our name are here, portioning off an exit on the highroad.

Uncle Jack takes my hand. He looks me in the eye. The morphine is already terribly strong and it is getting stronger by the day. At this point, it is not to relieve his pain. It is simply a race against nature to cease his organ’s function. It is no longer palliative, but a challenge to god. Earlier this morning, he talked about cats I don’t own and family members that never existed, such as a sister who was “bringing him water” all day. His delusions were terrifying and pathetic. I could no longer bear to see such a loved person dealing with so much bodily failure and ultimately, pain.

Staring me in the face, he said, “Son, I appreciate everything you’ve done… but please, get your dog out of here.” At this, I was confused. I knew it was another symptom of the morphine, but I wanted to help him, however I could.

“Uncle Jack, we don’t have a dog. You know that,” I held back tears.
“Stop. Just close the door. Stop him from staring at me. Stupid… fucking… dog,” he choked.

I rose and closed the door. I could tell the end was coming. But it is never easy. It is never immediate. It is always a matter of hours, days, weeks. Sometimes, months. The sirens outside grew louder. On a day like today, no solace was spared. No grieving, nothing. Your problem was just another piece of rubbish in the mosaic that society is composed of. Little did I know that the sirens were clearing and helping sort out a pile up that was on the same interstate that killed my parents. Little did I know that my brother was driving home from classes this afternoon to help me take care of Uncle Jack. Little did I know that his sedan may have been involved.

“Son,” Uncle Jack cried. “You’ve always been as good as any child of my own that I could have prayed for. Your parents loved you. I loved you. And I could never have asked for anyone better to see me out.”
I will admit to having cried at this display.
“But please, close that damned door, that fucking dog…”
I turned to see the closed door and dropped my eyes to the floor. Poor, poor drug-induced illusions.
But, of course, he continues.

“He keeps asking me, John. He keeps asking, who do I love more, ‘Adam or John?’ Get that little bastard out of here.”

I'm definitely capable enough to work an entry level java or c++ job, but every posting I see requires a masters or bachelors degree. I feel like university students will always be chosen over me for internships. I'm embarrassed to show my resume to anybody because I have nothing to put on it. Should I be looking for an IT job? Where do I start looking for a CS-related job?"

If I don't do something myself, I'm going to disappear slowly and painfully.",not__okay,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/17medy/i_think_about_dying_all_day_long_i_have_no_drive/,"I’ve been depressed for several years now, but the past year or so it’s been the worst. I’ll have periods of time where I’m just sad, and periods of time where I’m just numb, and periods of time where I’ll ignore the outside world and all my responsibilities and I won’t get out of bed for a week. Right now I’m in one of those really low periods where I can’t make myself do anything. The semester has just begun and already I’m missing my classes, not doing the assignments, calling in sick at my internship. All because I can’t make myself just get out of bed and go to class, or just turn my brain on and do my work. 

The past couple weeks, I can’t stop thinking about suicide. I used to think about it on occasion, but now I think about it for hours and hours every day, all through the day. I think about the different ways I could do it. I fantasize about getting hit by a bus, or having some stray bullet fly through my window straight into my head, or some other freak accident that'll do the job for me. It isn’t that I desire death itself, I just am tired of living. I don’t enjoy life. I don’t enjoy anything about living. Living hurts and I am not getting any happiness from it. The only reason I am still here is because I think about my family, and I don’t want to hurt them. Really though, they don’t need me. If I died, it would hurt them initially, but they’d heal with time. I’m a minor part in their lives. My dad has a wife and a young child. My mother just recently got remarried as well. My brother is married now and is in the stages of creating this whole new life with his new wife and new job and new home. They all have their own immediate families that I’m not a part of. 
 
The thing that really makes me feel like a worthless piece of shit is that fact that I SHOULD be happy. I have no right to hate life as much as I do. If I had the motivation to, I could excel in school and start up a successful career and have a good life. I don’t have any friends, but I do have a boyfriend that loves me. I have enough money for comfortable food and rent. I don’t have any huge life obstacles, any terminal illness, any major life traumas. I feel like a spoiled brat little shit because objectively, I have a good life. I have a good life, but I don’t care, because I don’t want it. I should be happy with life, but I’m not, and I can’t even pinpoint why. I feel so empty and hollow. All I want to do is find a nice dark hole where no one can find me and curl up and sleep for the rest of my life. 

I can’t keep living the way I’m living. I’m going to fail college and be unemployed and be wasting away in some gutter somewhere, because I won’t have the motivation to get myself out. I’ll just end up even more miserable than I already am. 

Living and feeling the way I am, it’s like I’m dying slowly. I don’t want to die slowly, I want to be at peace and not have to deal with the burden of living.
