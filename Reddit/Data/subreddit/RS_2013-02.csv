17pu14,5,2013-02-01,Advice for an Intern?,[deleted],sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/17pu14/advice_for_an_intern/,"Hi everyone, 
I landed an IT internship in the summer and need some advice on how to get more prepared for it. 

I know that internships are there to help gain experience and to have you learn the ropes with real systems, but I feel like I need to grow my knowledge so I can integrate with the company quickly and not dissapoint.

I'll be doing projects for the most part, and a little bit of support. I do have the LPIC-1 certification (mainly got it to help learn linux more intimately) but I don't often practice sysadmin type projects at home because I never felt that I needed to.

Any advice on how to be a better intern? I'm focusing on Linux but any advice is helpful"

17p194,11,2013-02-01,I'd like to hear your professional stories. How did you end up where you are?,ExplosiveHippo,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/17p194/id_like_to_hear_your_professional_stories_how_did/,"Hi /r/webdev. I'm currently a university student (almost a senior) and my ultimate goal is to become a web developer. I thought it would be interesting to see how others got to where they are now. I guess it wouldn't be fair if I didn't share my story.

I started out around 14 or 15 I think, playing an online game. I eventually became a moderator on the forum for the game and many of the other moderators where heavy web geeks. That inspired me to start messing with HTML and CSS. I did a bit but never really got super heavy into it. 

I knew I wanted to do something with computers but I figured I'd want to repair computers or help set up systems. In my junior and senior year of highschool I went to trade school half day for computer repair and networking. I ended up getting my A+ certification but by the time I finished the program I'd really lost interest in fixing computers. It was really the same thing over and over and I required something a bit more creative.

I ended up going to a community college for web technologies and finally got a good grasp of HTML and CSS. I then starting taking classes in Javascript and Java and had some serious doubts in my ability. I just wasn't getting it and got very discouraged. I ended up getting through community college with pretty decent grades but felt like I really lacked much knowledge outside of being able to Google everything. I ended up getting an internship as a web designer and developer (developer as in HTML/CSS and jQuery plugins) which I worked at through my whole community college degree. This really helped me get a better grasp on my skills and I learned a ton. It was great.

I kept my head up though because I really enjoyed it when it worked. I then started to attend a real university. A highly established tech university in my state. Once I got in it gave me a big confidence boost that I *could* do this. I finally dedicated myself to it and I had matured a lot since community college. I'm now finally starting to feel like I can definitely do this as a career. I've finally started to break through the ""I have no idea what I'm doing"" phase and it feels great. This past Summer I co oped at a large supermarket's corporate office as primarily a web designer (I've always loved the design aspect of it too and I'm fairly good at it) with some development stuff on the side.

I'm finally in my last year of college and will be doing another co op this Summer and by next Summer I'll be graduated and be searching for full time work. I'm hoping everything works out but I have high hopes!

So, webdev. How did you get where you are? Is there anything you wish you had done differently. Any advice for us younger guys (and gals) getting in the business? (Sorry for such a long post!)"

17o57g,5,2013-01-31,"Amney - a Ouija board experience (part two, previously broken up)",[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/17o57g/amney_a_ouija_board_experience_part_two/,"Continued from: http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/17mfqb/amney_a_ouija_board_experience/

Adam looked genuinely worried at this point. He apologized to the board, for our rudeness and whatnot. It responded with a simple “fine” and the group did not really know where to go from there. One of the boys finally asked, adding an additional apology, if they could speak to someone else and the demon could be on its way. The board told us that he would not release the board to any other entity. We were going to speak to him and him only.

This seemed to really not sit well with anyone. I, well, I was interested. I held my smirk behind a straight-grit in order to keep the group still and petrified. Without asking another question, the dial moved once more and scribed a sentence that chills me to this day: tell that brother of yours to stop being a smartass. My eyes widened and I looked at Adam. Adam looked at me and then wore an expression of a man twenty years his elder, so far removed from the comforts of modern living. He wore the face of a parent burying his child, of a surgeon failing, of a war veteran outliving his comrades. He bore too much knowledge about the situation at hand, far more knowledge than anyone in the room. Essentially, this was not a joke. We had all removed our hands with this last insult and Adam motioned to return them, clearing his throat.
“Demon,” Adam asked. “Is that you, Amney?”

The familiarity and tone in my brother’s voice made the hair on my neck stand. Without a second to contemplate the situation at hand, the dial read “yes.”
“Listen, we were just interested in showing our friends how the board works. We mean no harm.”
“I know, you little fuck. I was just checking in. How’s the family?” The board wrote.
After the response, the dial rapidly shot to each corner of the board, to the decorative pictures that branded the extremities. Nonsense.
“We’re… we’re fine, Amney. I know we haven’t spoken in a while.”
“Good. Good.  Which parent do you love more?”
At this point, I picked up the little dial and clutched it tight, standing.
“No, we’re done. This is bullshit. Adam, I don’t know if you’re fucking with your friends, or… or what. But we’re done.”

The fucking thing tore from my grip and landed upright on the board. The candles went out immediately after and the girl screamed. I moved towards the stairs and turned on the light. The candles were tipped over and the wet wax smothered the board. Most of it was covered, except for the smiling sun in the upper left-hand corner.  The wax encompassed it and most of the mess was already drying. Adam looked up at me and told me he was sorry, a single tear running down his face. He sniffed, looked away, composed himself and rapidly stood, cleaning the mess. His friends never saw his tear.

We quickly packed up and that was that. We did not talk much about it. He was obviously bothered, but got over it by midweek. We played plenty of shooter video games and we even drank a little bit of our parent’s alcohol when they went away the next weekend. That Sunday night we watched a horror movie which focused around a demon. Upon realizing the story’s premise and hearing the word “demon,” I silently hated myself and prayed that it would not bring some shell-shocked flashback to my brother’s being. No such break down occurred; in fact, he calmly and happily brought up the experience after the movie. He simply asked, “Do you remember that whole ‘Amney’ bit?”

Of course, I said yes.

“Yeah, that fucker is creepy,” he smirked.
“You talked to him a lot?” I asked him.
“Yeah. I don’t really know how to explain it. Maybe those things are like… creative unlockers? You know? Like they tap into your creative invulnerabilities and just pour words from you.”
“I don’t know, man.”
“Well, I hope so, at least. He described himself to me one time. Real creepy stuff.”
“Like what?”
“Well, he was a demon. First of all,” he chuckled at this. He was nervous at first, then the seriousness caught his voice. “He was a demon, and he told me that the  most relatable thing he could call himself, the thing I would most understand, was the shape of a dog. Except instead of your typical ‘dog-shaped’ head, he said it resembled a mask. Like a large, porcelain, V-shaped mask. Mostly blank, besides large black eyes.”

I think of my mother sitting at a computer desk in the kitchen, thinking she saw a Jack Russell Terrier move past her feet.

“Weird, man,” I reply, offering nothing else.
“Yeah…” he cleared his throat. “What did you think about when he asked about mom and dad?”
“I,” I thought for a moment. “I didn’t.”
“Good,” Adam nodded. “He would have done something vengeful.”

I did not know what he meant, but I did not want to pry. I was happy enough that we covered this topic without a breakdown of tears. We proceeded to watch some mindless programming for a few hours and he went to bed, happy.

Later that night, or rather, early that morning, I received a call from the police department informing me that my parents had died in a car accident on I-95. I did not tell Adam until later that day. He went to school, like any other day, and spent six or seven hours in ignorance. He went to his part time job at the grocery store and worked, happily and stupidly, like any other day. I had to tell him when he got home. Our uncle and grandparents were there. It was inevitable. It was not my choice. He had to know. Were it up to me, I would have kept him, to this day, ignorant of the fact that our parents died, one with the melted and molten iron and steel that cocooned their bodies. Their carcasses were inseparable from the frame of the vehicle that carried us to however many family vacations. The vessel that brought us to Disney World was now their tomb; the vehicle that brought us to the beach was now the same chemical composite as our parents. Were it up to me, I would have prolonged his revelation with bullshit in the vein of, “oh, they are traveling in Europe,” or, “they continued their weekend trip and their flights are delayed!” Bullshit. Ignorant bullshit that keeps the emotional mind at bay.

We mourned. The community supported us. I was on the verge of suicide for months. The thought of my brother being alone kept me going. Our uncle was our guardian for a while, although officially, per the government’s papers, our grandparents were our guarantors. I grew older, completed college, and watched my brother finish high school. The years that followed were uneventful. Adam got a community service commendation; I managed to break from alcoholism. I got a job in mid-management at the state health department; Adam earned an internship at the police department. We were the most typical fucked up brothers you could fine. That was until our uncle became sick.

Yes, I know what you’re thinking: oh, a family member was diagnosed with something malignant, aren’t you a special snowflake. Well, you can go fuck yourself. Uncle Jack is in hospice as we speak. I already told you this. Uncle Jack is in hospice and the sirens have been blaring all day. From all around our sleepy town in the middle of nowhere, crisscrossed by highways and interstates and roads that lead everywhere but here, the sirens have been blaring. Fire trucks and police officers from towns that never knew our name are here, portioning off an exit on the highroad.

Uncle Jack takes my hand. He looks me in the eye. The morphine is already terribly strong and it is getting stronger by the day. At this point, it is not to relieve his pain. It is simply a race against nature to cease his organ’s function. It is no longer palliative, but a challenge to god. Earlier this morning, he talked about cats I don’t own and family members that never existed, such as a sister who was “bringing him water” all day. His delusions were terrifying and pathetic. I could no longer bear to see such a loved person dealing with so much bodily failure and ultimately, pain.

Staring me in the face, he said, “Son, I appreciate everything you’ve done… but please, get your dog out of here.” At this, I was confused. I knew it was another symptom of the morphine, but I wanted to help him, however I could.

“Uncle Jack, we don’t have a dog. You know that,” I held back tears.
“Stop. Just close the door. Stop him from staring at me. Stupid… fucking… dog,” he choked.

I rose and closed the door. I could tell the end was coming. But it is never easy. It is never immediate. It is always a matter of hours, days, weeks. Sometimes, months. The sirens outside grew louder. On a day like today, no solace was spared. No grieving, nothing. Your problem was just another piece of rubbish in the mosaic that society is composed of. Little did I know that the sirens were clearing and helping sort out a pile up that was on the same interstate that killed my parents. Little did I know that my brother was driving home from classes this afternoon to help me take care of Uncle Jack. Little did I know that his sedan may have been involved.

“Son,” Uncle Jack cried. “You’ve always been as good as any child of my own that I could have prayed for. Your parents loved you. I loved you. And I could never have asked for anyone better to see me out.”
I will admit to having cried at this display.
“But please, close that damned door, that fucking dog…”
I turned to see the closed door and dropped my eyes to the floor. Poor, poor drug-induced illusions.
But, of course, he continues.

“He keeps asking me, John. He keeps asking, who do I love more, ‘Adam or John?’ Get that little bastard out of here.”

17rkj5,14,2013-02-02,My sister's stupid fucking wedding,stupid_fucker,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/17rkj5/my_sisters_stupid_fucking_wedding/,"My sister and I grew up together taking care of ourselves. We were poor as shit and our parents had to work many jobs just to have enough to eat. Poor as in sometimes we couldn't afford the $0.40 school reduced cut lunches. My parents worked their way up, sacrificing everything, and now they can afford her a luxury like a fucking $10,000+ wedding.

I am to be her maid of honor, with six other bridesmaids in the party. Then comes the time to buy the dresses, in which she forced my parents to foot the bill for half the dresses. I had to buy my own because she didn't want to ask money from her friends. Whatever, angry time #1. After this, her friend didn't like her dress so my sister GAVE her friend MY dress without asking me ever, forcing me to shell out another $250 for another one.

I've never said anything to her about it, except that I think it's shitty that she let her friend have two FREE dresses and I have to shell out $500 total. I complain and she gets my parents to try to buy me out. I'm not okay with this. I got fitted today and the conversation turned to the old dress again after I found out my mom gave my sister my parent's credit card to spend whatever the fuck she wants, including the alterations to her dress and I had to pay for mine.

I brought it up to her again, not even asking for the money back. All I wanted was an apology and a confession that she continually chooses her friends over her family. She then freaked the fuck out and said that she has been paying for the entire wedding even though she got $3000 from my parents for Christmas just for her reception. I told her that she hasn't paid for everything- or really anything for that matter, to which she started screaming at me in the car with my mother on the ride home telling me that I need to ""shut the fuck up"" and that I need to ""grow up"" and to ""pull over the car, she has to get the fuck out and walk home."" My mother was driving and I was five miles away. When I didn't get out the car to walk home she started to call me names and say hurtful things and about how she thinks family members are more appropriate to foot the bill for her wedding and not her friends.

I wasn't letting up, but I also wasn't being an asshole. I just kept saying I wanted an apology. She then tried to open the car door and jump out to get away from me when we were driving 50 mph on a major six lane road, causing my mother to panic and scream.

My mother has cancer right now and my parents are getting to the age where they need to start thinking about retirement and medical bills. The fact that she did that to my mother is the most abhorrent act I've ever witnessed. My mother who gave her everything.

Combined with the fact that I'm broke as fuck. I only have $4 to my name until next week when I get paid and I'm too proud to even ask for a small trip to the grocery store to eat a normal fucking meal, and not sips of the last almond milk and whatever fucking leftover dried out cheese slices. I want to do it my own way and I don't want my parents to have to sacrifice any more than they already have.

I just don't understand how she can't feel even a little bit guilty about her $200+ trips to Victoria's Secret, her $1000+ shopping sprees, her $20,000 initial wedding reception, but cancelled last minute and lost my parent's $10,000 to have it a year later. Draining their savings, just to give her something they never thought they could.

I'm just so sick of her. I'm sick of her bridezilla bullshit. Her excuse to freak out and try to jump out in traffic going 50 mph, even as a threat. I'm sick of her never talking to me unless it's about her wedding, for over a year now. Her not even trying to apologize. Her throwing tantrums in public. Her shitty and victim attitude. Fuck her, fuck her, fuck her. She's a selfish fucking bully who has tormented me since I was a child. And I have to see her again in a few hours, where I'm sure she'll give me the silent treatment and ruin my dad's birthday party tonight. Fuck her. Worst part is, she's gone through medical school, she's currently living at home rent and expense free for her internships, and still thinks the world owes her something in her late 20's. FUCK."

Unfortunately I won't be able to post any code as it is copyright, but I am looking for any references/advice. All the code is C++ and the IDE I am using is Visual C++ 6.0 (I know this is old but it's what most of the original code was written in). 

I have been asked to add a match value to indicate how similar two images are. Thus far I have been approaching this by trying to binarize an ROI for each image and compare the two using a matlab algorithm. This is where things get rough.... I have been working on this project for a week now and have barely made it anywhere. While I have been able to print out bitmaps of the binarized ROI's for some examples every time I think I fix something it breaks for a different image (often one that used to work). Most of the project relies on using previously written functions but this program is HUGE! I am having a hard time navigating through it, and am approaching the limit of my abilities to debug.

My concerns are as follows: 

-Does this seem like the right approach to the problem?

-I need to learn more about image processing, fast: ROI managing, how bufferes work, how multi-threaded processes initiate, GUI work in C++. Any suggestions?

-There is a memory leak somewhere in the program (one that I probably introduced) but am not sure how to find it. I have two object instantiations on the heap but have made sure to call delete and assign the pointers to null (in that order). Any common places for MEM leaks in image processing? I know some of you will ask: no, I am not sure I need heap allocation but do not understand enough about multithreaded processes so I thought this might be the safer approach? In retrospect that might be a terrible assumption... 


Really appreciate any constructive comments this community could give me. I am working on this project for the most part by myself... Should I possibly post these questions in /r/programming or stackoverflow? I just didn't know where to go as  I said before I won't be able to post code. Sorry for length. "

I had a really hard time adjusting to college work as my high school was really easy to just coast by in. I made it through the first 3 semesters with something like a 3.0 then through some circumstances and stress in the non-academic world basically I fell into a cycle of depression. I dropped most of my classes the 4th semester, failed the other 2. Went home for summer got a job, thought I would be okay, and then failed again the next fall semester. My GPA is now a 2.0, I have no hope of doing computer engineering anymore (I'm not good at the EE) and am transfering to comp sci major. 

I've been going to counseling this semester and the latter part of the previous semester, still have my job (transferred to a store here. it's retail, but i need it to pay the rent) and am doing better now but I'm still struggling to succeed. I really don't expect my GPA to get much above a 2.5 or 2.75.

My questions are basically: 1) What should I be doing alongside making better grades to help me. 2) What can I do to get noticed/get a job seeing as I now will never get those ""Minimum 3.5 gpa"" job/internship requirements I see on almost every posting.

 I sent out some resumes/applications for summer internships around thanksgiving and haven't heard anything back yet.

I am a second-year (out of 3) student in UK, studying Economics in a target university. I'm trying to get into Back office (Finance) position
For the past 4 months I've been trying really hard to secure an internship in IB. Out of 30+ applications I have sent, I only got 4 invites to interviews, all others rejected me instantly.
I built my CV with careers advice staff at university, and there are a few positions of responsibility and finance/research/economics based projects on it.
At this point, I am almost sure that I won't get an internship, and would like to focus on developing new skills that would be useful and would potentially look good on the CV. 
From this subreddit I have found out that learning Excel is always useful and I have recently enrolled in a MS Office Professional training course, someone else also suggested learning a programming language. 
Is there anything else that you guys could suggest ?

P.S. English is not my first language, sorry any mistakes.

tl;dr: I won't get an internship in IB (back office - Finance), would like to learn something (Excel, etc) that would improve my chances of getting in. Suggestions ?"
17sogv,4,2013-02-03,All I can think about is a rope around my neck,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/17sogv/all_i_can_think_about_is_a_rope_around_my_neck/,"It's become less of a thought and more of an urge, again. How it would feel to hang from a rafter, to plunge a 5 inch knife into my neck, just above the jugular, and cut from ear to ear (that one's my favorite), to feel the trail of a bullet trace it's way from my forehead, through my brain, and pop right out the back. 

They're urges that yield results. How do I mean? When I take my fist and push it against my neck, as if I'm holding a knife, and imagine the blade sliding through my flesh, I feel a real sense of relief and satisfaction.

I feel it most every day. From when I wake up to when I go to bed. It makes my legs weak, my chest sink, and creates a sensation as though someone is tuggung on my esophagus. I'm going to puke.

The anxiety hangs behind my eyes, engulfing my senses in a numbness I can't quite push away. It has triggers. Triggers I've taken the time to distinguish, but I have no idea how to deal with them. 

I'm living a good life. Full time student, a good internship, an accomplished and loved local DJ. What the fuck do I have to be depressed about anymore? I guess the last 5 years of my life I spent numb and alone really made a lasting impact.

I don't sleep. I don't relax. I'm stressed 100% of the time.

I thought I was okay. I thought I was getting better, but it's all falling apart again, worse than last time. I don't know what to do."

Kerry: What did you think when you lost the ring?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885ufd?context=5)|I was just really mad at myself for wasting our time and energy more than anything else. Ring bearing is hard man.  Not at all. Shit happens. That's why we filmed it. I mean, when things go wrong, it can often times make documentaries more intersting. And we found it in the end so Sauron didn't win. -Chris.
[Boobs?  Kerry.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c886ez3?context=5)|Yeah, definitely boobs. -Chris.

I think my favorite reaction was Geoff one day when we were trying out our costumes. He just sort of smiled and shook his head. He was in the army so I think he had a good idea of what we were in for. - Chris.
 |I'm pretty sure there were some bets going on. I'm still waiting for my cut.

[So how good did it feel to finally bury the ring?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885tos?context=5)|Better than sex. -Chris.
[What does sex feel like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c8873f6?context=5)|Like burying a ring into the ground. Except not as good.

[ what were your favourite Moments of the trip?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885kvt?context=5)|As lame as it sounds, the first time we saw the Mountain was pretty spectacular for me. It made it feel like we actually had a chance of finishing.
 |Kerry.
 |When we first saw the mountain I got chills. Also, when we got to the end of a 70km stretch of road on day 5 it was pretty awesome because that was when we knew we might actually have a chance at finishing. I also immensely enjoyed anytime we sat down. Especially when candy was involved. - Chris.
[Nick, are you a regular guide in New Zealand? Or how did you get involved with Chris and Kerry's adventure?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885lh1?context=5)|When Kerry and I first started planning the trip, we realized we'd need help with transportation and supplies from someone in New Zealand. Then I remembered I'd met Nick a couple months earlier when he came to visit our office. And Nick was perfect: a talented film professional, a fan of Rooster Teeth, and physically able to do it. Plus he's just an awesome guy. And after realizing all of that, we decided to have a third person come with us on the walk. And that was the best decision we made. -Chris.
[Who smelt the worst at the end?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885pfk?context=5)|Probably Kerry or me. We wore our Hobbit outfits the whole time without changing or showering and Nick at least changed clothes every once in a while. We were some pretty stinky hobbits. Just remembering the smell of our feet when we took off our shoes makes me want apologize to Nick again. -Chris.
 |Turns out, chaffing smells just as bad as it hurts.

[Boobs or ass?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885kkc?context=5)|Boobs please -Chris.

[What do you prefer about LOTR in the books and films? Like, what bits were skipped from the books that you liked, and what scenes were better in the films? Also, what do you think about the Hobbit being three movies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885lx3?context=5)|I love both the books and the movies. I read The Hobbit when I was 12 and then immediately went and bought LoTR (and a map of Middle Earth so I could follow along). When I finished the books and heard they were making movies, I was stoked. I still remember the first time I saw the trailer in theaters. I got goosebumps and my stomach dropped. I was sad the scouring of the shire wasn't in the movies, but as a filmmaker myself, I understand why it wasn't included. I thought it was ridiculous they were making The Hobbit into three movies when I first heard about it, but I also trust Peter Jackson so I'm excited to see the next two. Plus, it means two more movies of Middle Earth. -Chris.
 |I'm a big fan of both. My favorite scene out of the series is coming up, when Bilbo and Smaug first talk in his den. Pretty excited for that. I trust Peter Jackson and I feel like there is enough content to work with, so I'm excited that it's going to be 3 movies.
 |Kerry.
[How did you familys feel about you guys going?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885ld9?context=5)|My parents were worried about me but felt much better once they found out Nick was going with us. They thought it was brilliant/dumb. Much like a lot of my ideas as a child. This one didn't end in a hospital trip so that was good.
 |Kerry.
 |Well, you actually see my mom in it but after that skype session she told me how genuinely worried she was. My sister thought I was insane. And I don't think any of them thought we would finish but they were supportive. I mean, they kind of had to be because they knew I was going to do it regardless. - Chris.
[Which prior ideas of yours have resulted in hospital trips?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c8861zm?context=5)|Deciding that I wanted to use a chisel to make art when I was 4.
 |Kerry.
[That can only end well.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c886zt3?context=5)|That's exactly what my 4 year old brain said.
 |Kerry.
[Loved the series, thought it was a great idea, but also *kind of* felt bad for y'all and your gross blistery feet n stuff. Anyway.  What was the first thing you guys did when you got home? (i.e. sleep for a year, cuddle with each other, play some halo\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885pl4?context=5)|I wish we could have come back and relaxed but we pretty much started editing it immediately since we wanted to get the whole series out before Christmas. That meant working non-stop for 3 weeks and pretty much living in the office. I also developed Bronchitis during the trip so that plus no sleep made post-production almost as difficult as the actual walk. But thankfully editing doesn't require you to move your feet. -Chris.
 |Right before sleeping for a day I replied to all of the emails I had from family/friends/and co-workers letting them no that we didn't die.
 |Kerry.
[What was your inspiration to do this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885nu4?context=5)|Fuckin love Lord of the Rings -Chris.

[What was it like working with Elijah Wood for season 10? Did you guys fangirl out when you saw him?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885r2z?context=5)|I didn't get to work with him directly on Red vs Blue, but I was lucky enough to meet him once when he came to our office. I absolutely [geeked out like a fangirl.](http://roosterteeth.com/members/images/image.php?id=2975667) -Chris.
[If given the opportunity, would all three of you do it again?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885knh?context=5)|I would definitely do it again if we had lost the footage or something like that before it got released, but if I'd much rather do a new walk than the same one again.
 |Kerry.
 |I would do it again but take a lot more time with it so it wouldn't be as painful. New Zealand is absolutely beautiful and it was amazing just seeing the country while we walked. That being said, I'd rather attempt a different adventure in the future than do this one twice. -Chris 
[What was the hardest part of the trip?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885lbz?context=5)|Walking through the cut-down forest was pretty rough. It was high noon and there was zero shade.
 |Kerry.
 |Climbing up the mountain on the last day was the hardest part for me. My leg sort of stopped working. -Chris.
[Hey Kerry, how stupid is Chris?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885sz6?context=5)|Stupid enough to go on this walk. Smart enough to edit it.

[Since Kerry and Chris were carrying the Ring and were basically being Sam and Frodo, does that mean Nick was Gollum?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885r9n?context=5)|We actually cut a bit from the first episode where we compare him to Aragorn. They actually look pretty damn similar. -Chris.

 |We met Matt and Burnie after entering a short film contest where they were the judges.

[So, we saw your feet Kerry, but your thighs...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885wop?context=5)|They got pretty bad. It was definitely one of the many things that slowed us down.
[Just how bad did they end up being?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885wop?context=5)|Compression shorts.

We were really scared he would kick us out and not let us keep going and that would have made it impossible to finish without missing our flight home. Or when we were out in the woods on day 3 past sundown without our tent or more water. Or when I took my shoes off on day 2 and smelled my feet. -Chris.
 |Definitely getting caught on provate property. The only thing worse than going to jail is going to jail in a foreign country.

No, not at all. We actually only passed through one small town along the route we took. We also hiked along several trails so that helped it feel more like Middle Earth. And then when we got to Mount Doom, no one was there because the road was closed so that felt the most like the movie and books. -Chris.
[Why didn't you just take an eagle?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c8862fw?context=5)|Eagles would have been waaay to easy.

We knew we were going to piggy back this trip with some Australian conventions in the fall of 2012, so we had that long to plan. Unfortunately we were also very busy during that time so we didn't get to plan as much as we would have liked.
 |Kerry.
[Did you guys encounter any crazy animals other than Chris.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885phb?context=5)|Just sheep and cows mostly. Though there was a time when an entire herd of cows just followed us around until we passed their field. It was surprisingly creepy. They just stared at us... Cows are scary, man. - Chris.
 |Does NZ have crazy animals? I thought everything was fluffy or edible.
 |Kerry.
[How many times did you guys bang.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17rfxs/we_work_at_rooster_teeth_the_company_behind_red/c885sqi?context=5)|Over 9000. -Chris.

17vegf,3,2013-02-04,2 Questions: Procrastinating on accepting a job offer? And possibilities of returning to companies after summer internships? ,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/17vegf/2_questions_procrastinating_on_accepting_a_job/,"I recently received an email saying that I got a job offer for the summer from job A (they recruit early because there's security clearances you need to go through, so the lag time isn't really lag time, it's necessary). It's a GREAT company doing COOL stuff but not my absolute ideal company. However, the ONLY thing I really don't like about it is the location. It's pretty bad.  

Since it's still early, I've filled out dozens of other applications for internships at my ideal location (California) and likely won't hear back from those for a while. I also have 1 other interview lined up (job B) in the coming week for an ALSO GREAT company that's more directly in my line of work AND it's in a better location!  

So here are my two questions:  
1) How long do I have to respond yay/nay to the job A offer? Should I immediately reply to the email I got this morning with some sort of statement? What should that statement even say?  
2) I'm a junior studying engineering in college; what's the likelihood that the internship I take this summer could lead to a full time position post-graduation? I'd LOVE to work full time for job B in the future; it's really the line of work I'm interested in. Job A is pretty great also but I would HATE to be stuck in that location. I'd really rather move to California asap.  

Ty for advice!"

First of all, sorry if I seem naive. Just a quick note; **I live in the UK.**


**Some background first:**


I'm a programmer with a strong background in mathematics. At my current job, I do slot machines maths modelling and verification, so I do a lot of statistics but it's all basic level, it requires thinking a lot but it doesn't require a great deal of mathematical background. Verification is based on coding simulations in C# and checking that my statistics are correct (I guess that's called Monte Carlo simulation)


I want to get into banking, I will be straight honest, it's for the money and the position and because I'm in London so it's the best place (one of) for this kind of jobs. However, I do actually enjoy mathematics and programming mathematical applications, I have always had A* in my mathematics courses, but I studied Computer Science so I didn't do ""Advanced"" level mathematics.


**My situation now:**


I have a **first class degree Computer Science bachelor** from a recognised university but it's not a top-ten one.
I'm going to do Master's soon hopefully, and I thought I will do a course related to the field I want to get into.
Now here is the thing, I don't necessarily want to be a quant, I basically just want to have a job in the financial industry that requires a lot mathematics-oriented programming.


**My options:**


So I have three different courses:


Oxford - MSc Computational and mathematical finance


Imperial London - MSc Mathematical finance


Imperial London - MSc Statistics

One of the tutors at Imperial advised me to do Statistics instead of Mathematical finance because, according to him, it's getting more difficult now to get a quant job and Statistics is broader so I have more options regarding my job perspectives.


**My queries:**


1 - **Which jobs satisfy my needs (mathematical-oriented programming in a financial industry) other than quantitative finance?**


2 - Do you agree with the tutor at Imperial that I should do Statistics instead of Mathematical Finance, the main thing that attracts me to the Maths Finance MSc is that it includes a three months internship (if I can) which is EXTREMELY important in my opinion, but I still want to hear what you think.


Thanks, I tried to break it down to make it easy to read. Cheers, any advice would be appreicated."

I could use a little guidance on my visa situation.  I'm starting an internship in London in a week and because the salary is so low (400 pounds/month) they told me I could stay and work on my six-month tourist visa.  I'm a recent college grad (finished in June, studied Computer Science and Business) with a Bachelor's degree.  The internship would, if all goes as planned, lead to a full-time position with the company.

My main question is this:  Can I do the internship on my tourist visa?  I would hate to come this far just to be burned because I was careless about immigration.  If not, do I have any alternatives?

Thanks in advance for your help!

17y92f,51,2013-02-05,Job search story from someone not in the upper-crust,StateSchoolScum,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/17y92f/job_search_story_from_someone_not_in_the/,"You will first need to know my story to understand where I am coming from:

I come from a poor background. In my home town, no one goes to college. Many don't even finish high school because such things have no credence; anyone can get a job in town (as a construction guy, contractor, or gas station attendant) without a high school diploma. I left high school at 16 to work concrete. College just doesn't entire into these people's minds as a possibility. The culture is very anti-intellectual as well. 

I've always liked math and science a lot. I was always described by teachers as a ""gifted"" student in these areas, and I always try to deeply analyze how things work. Eventually I got a PC. Rather than simply say ""that there be one of them magic boxes"" and stab at the power button with my chicken grease covered digits, I tried to figure out how this incredible machine worked. 

I had no idea how a computer worked, but I started to form certain concepts in my mind about how I thought it worked after a while. I knew it wasn't ""magic""; it was a machine. Electricity flowed through it. I had so many ideas (and later on I learned the academic definition for what I was thinking of: finite state machine) and I started going to libraries, old high schools, etc. to find books on electricity, circuits, and anything else remotely related to computers. I learned a lot about capacitors, transistors, cathodes, etc. but never really figured out the operating system part.

Eventually, dial-up internet was brought to my neck of the woods, and man, was I ever fascinated by that. Every spare moment I'd be trying to learn something new on there. I figured out that I was an intelligent person and felt my mind was being wasted stripping roofs and digging holes in the ground. I started to come across the term ""computer programmer"", but I had no idea what that meant, but I very badly wanted to find out. The colors on the screen, the mouse movements, the start-up/shut-down functions, I knew it was all simply the very rapid interaction of hardware, electricity, and something else...which turned out to be code. I read books on C, but was never able to program in it because I had Windows and could not download Linux or BSD on dial-up.

I ended up getting my GED in 2005. I was 22 years old. I applied to the local state college and to my astonishment I was accepted. This is not a very good school at all, and I knew that, but it was better than nothing (at least that's what I thought). I had a big problem though: school costs mucho pesos, which I did not have.

Going to college meant moving into the ""city"" part of the county, so I applied to every job in town. One of these jobs was in a big warehouse so I applied to be a forklift selector. At the HR office, I did something that seemed to shock the HR people: I divided one number by another in my head (they lost the calculator so I just spit the answer out to help them). They asked how I did that, and I explained that division is easy for those numbers and you can just follow a step-by-step process (which I learned later was an ""algorithm"") for arriving at the answer or best approximation. 

The nice ladies of HR recommended me for this other job, in the warehouse offices. It was part data entry, part input-output (print and such), and some other stuff. The computer were all green-screen IBM terminals and the computer system was a mainframe. I'd never heard of one. I just knew I liked Windows better. This job paid like $10 an hour though so I was practically rich. 

I worked overnights and went to school during the day. I was even doing over-time and pulling 60+ hours per week. My life revolved around a series of naps, but I sure was learning a lot. I breezed through the first semester, mostly because I was just having such a blast in my intro to programming and math classes. They weren't hard, but I would read the entire book for a class in the first couple weeks, do all the practice problems, and do well.

I love the programming stuff the most. This was the answer I'd been looking for for a while. You take a language a person can read and create a basic set of instructions that the computer can compile, read, and execute. The logic just made so much sense. In the meantime, my job got moved to a new office because we got a new data center for the warehouse. Now we had Windows XP PCs to work from and everything. They also expanded the responsibilities of the job as the company updated it's technology. I became a helpdesk, network ops, Unix, and mainframe operator all rolled into one, still working full-time and going to school full-time.

As school went on, it got harder. Not unmanageable, but I was getting stressed doing both things full-time. I couldn't quit though, because without the job I couldn't pay for school, and they would throw me out and it would have all just been a waste. As I learned more about the company, I switched majors to Business. 

After three years, I got my Business degree. I took that straight to the HR department at my company. However, these were not the nice old ladies that had hired me. A new crop was put in place. These were young, pretty, and very mean girls. They came from schools like Cornell, and the company paid them top dollar to recruit from top schools in order to bolster the companies profits with top-tier graduates and their Ivy-League intellects. I was told that they don't hire low-tier scum like me and to get back to my till or leave. 

I felt awful. Before, I thought I'd made something out of myself. I really did, and everyone in my department pretty much was rooting for me to move on and become successful. I returned with my head hung low, realizing the caste system I was up against. I stuck around that job for another year or so but ultimately went back to my old habits of studying computer science and mathematics. I signed up at the college again to finish the degree I originally stated.

By that time, I was working second shift at my job and was effectively the lead/supervisor (although I was not being paid for this). I couldn't handle the upper-level classes and the job, so after a month of doing both I had to give my notice. The higher ups were infuriated that their lead was leaving and they had no one competent to replace me. I asked them how long it would take to train someone up to my level, to which they said they would need two years. I said I've given my required two-week notice (I actually gave them three) and I would happily work out my final time training someone else as best I could. They fired me on the spot. 

Unemployed, but now with a good chunk of change saved up, I put my full brain power to work on my final semester of CS. I learned all kinds of interesting stuff like linear algebra, number theory, self-balancing search trees, and cryptography. I started to like Java a lot and made that my main language. I learned everything I could about Java and the VM; whenever something presented itself that seemed like hocus pocus I just learned how it was working, like concurrent threading or how the VM does garbage collection, and what exactly happens to methods on the stack and objects on the memory heap at run time. 

Finally, I got the second degree (not too long ago), and here I am. That's my story. Here's my problem:

I feel like I'm in no better of a position to get a job other than gas pump monkey. Like I said before, this school isn't exactly MIT. Realistically, it's lower than whale shit on the the prestige scale for CS, and I'm still in that lower caste no matter how I rationalize it. I spent approx. $100,000 of my own hard-earned money earning those pieces of paper but I realize they are practically worthless. 

Every day, I get up and apply for jobs online. Sometimes I get a rejection notice, sometimes no reply. I've never gotten an interview. I know I'd make a great business systems analyst or software engineer. I worked along side so many of those Cornell graduates in my time at my company, and let me tell you, those people aren't smarter than me, and they don't do anything that I can't do. 

I see a lot of questions on here about the interview. I know I could impress people given the chance. I know CLRS by heart and have seen every video CS lecture Stanford, Berkeley, and MIT has every put on YouTube (I actually have them all saved on my laptop). It just seems like I can't get there from here. 

I typed out that long story because I feel like there are more people out there like me, just not on /r/cscareerquestions. So many people on this subreddit never had to work a day in their life, then got some internship and were offered high-paying jobs just like that. I'm at the point where I think I should just give up because it won't happen for me. I now live in a big city but I work for minimum wage because it's all I can get.  

Is there anything else I can do besides randomly apply to jobs on Dice? I already know the advice some of you are going to give, which is create some personal projects and/or create an app. Well, I don't want to make apps for a living, and there's no projects a person could possibly create that are going to impress people who work on multi-million dollar software projects with millions of SLOC. 

What do I do? Is this it for me? I went from nothing right back to nothing 7 years later. I feel like I could have taken that $100,000 I spent on school and bought a house instead."

Last Friday afternoon, I had an interview for a summer internship at company A.  I completely choked and didn't solve the question within the allowed time limit. We've all been there.  However, there are some reasons to believe that I may at least still have a shot:

* I successfully passed one technical interview prior to this one, so they know I have some ability.
* I ended up solving the problem about 5 minutes after we concluded the interview, and sent along the solution per the interviewer's request.

However, I haven't heard ANYTHING from the recruiter at all.  After the previous interview, I was notified of another round approximately 1 hour after the interview concluded.  My questions for you:

* Should I reach out and inquire as to what my status is?
* When should I do this?  Only one full business day has passed so far.

Thanks!

I've been reading a lot about America being extremely overworked and in my own life I have seen it. My dad works upwards 50-60 hours a week and only gets 1-2 weeks vacation a year. Almost every person I have come into contact with complains of being overworked.

I live at home because I can't afford a place right now, I'm currently looking for work as a pharmacy technician (I just got my certification), and I'm planning on marrying my fiance sometime in the next 1-2 years.

I have had 2 jobs before now. A part-time retail position and a full-time 12-week internship at a public park. I hated both of them because for some reason I suck at absolutely anything manual labor. I'm fine with working 40 hours a week, but not much more than that.

Overall, I have to say that I just feel depressed. I have no reason to be. But I just feel like this is it. Once I move out, my life will suck forever. All because of the place I was born. You can call me entitled or lazy. I don't care. The fact that I will never have any time to enjoy my life and I'll likely never be able to retire or have financial security depresses me to no end. I value my time. I value my family, my hobbies, traveling the world. And I'll never be able to do that. Yeah, first world problems and all that, but it depresses me all the same.

Fuck it, I have one life, one chance to do what I want, and I've decided that I will not work myself to death while having enough to live. So if I ever decide to leave America, how should I do it and where should I go if I should leave at all?

I know a few languages, C, C++, Java, and Python; but would not consider myself a pro at any of them. I currently work as an IT support in an office on campus and was approached by a professor that teaches a software class called ArcGIS which is used data mapping. Long story long, she went to a colleague and told him I was looking for an internship. Which he asked me what I do I told him I'm looking for a coding internship and want to learn to write software. This was somehow confused with ""This kid can write software"" and when I told him I knew C++ he had a heart attack. I'm pretty sure this guy has 0 code experience. He now wants me to write software for him that will modify this ArcGIS program. Trouble is he wants to pay me 20$ an hour for it, which is hard to say no. I'm just not sure I can do it, as the hardest program I've written in C++ is equivalent to a simple ATM.

I guess my question is: should I break the news to this guy that I'm unable to do what he asks, or should I go ahead with the internship and attempt to write this software."

I finally got my bachelor's degree in the scientific field last summer, but I decided I didn't want to continue in that direction. One very promising and obvious master I could choose was one that combines science and business. 

The first year consists of an 9 month internship I'm running at a science department at the university I'm at, one course and some presentations/report I have to do. 

The second year consists of business related courses, like business economics and finance, and a half-year internship at a business/institute, preferably with a link to science. 

I'm really looking forward to have some practical courses and to acquire skills that gives me a broad choice of a future job, but my academic scientific skills seems to falter: I don't seem to be able to keep up with the level that they're asking from me. 

I'm currently 4 months into my science internship, and it has it ups and downs: I'm pretty sensitive to winter depressions, which had lowered my motivation and performance, and I'm horrible at giving presentations in front of people whom I know that are better educated on the subject that I'm presenting about. After overcoming these hurdles, I got a small boost in motivation, but now I'm suddenly confronted about my underleveled performance. 
It really starts to demotivate me. I also don't seem to be able to mingle with the people there, making it a hostile environment to me. I'm also starting to look around for job openings as a back up in case I decide to drop out, which also doesn't increase my motivation to go on. I'm also not aspiring to get a job that requires an academic education or to a position I can't work myself up to. 
I've had experience with leadership functions, finance, creative/innovative thinking and getting the job done, and I can say I've got a broad skillset, able to learn new skills up to a very functional level (just not able to get it up to an academic scientific level), so I don't think I'm a worthless asset. 

I tried talking to an adviser, but he didn't really help me, just said I have to persevere. I was thinking to go to a psychologist to deal with the motivation issue, but that seemed futile, seeing my current feelings about the matter. 
I'm also scared to tell my parents about these thoughts, although lately they seem to have softened up on this matter due other relatives having trouble with school. 

What should I do?

tl;dnr: Finished scientific bachelor, started science/business master, don't have to motivation for the science part, want to stop and start working. "

Is this a ""preference"" or is it a hard and fast rule?  I have quite a few years until I graduate with a CS degree, but I casually started perusing jobs last night, and it was bleak.

Every single one of them required experience in my hour long search.  Every, single, one.  I understand internships are a good way to get some experience, but this is a tough option.  I financial can't intern too far away.

I am a 3rd year International Media and Entertainment Management student from Europe. In my 4th year (January 2014) I should start writing my bachelor thesis on a marketing topic of my choice while working/doing research in a company. This would be my 2nd and final internship.

As I am very passionate about online marketing and digital marketing trends (which I also blog about), I really want to do some research in mobile marketing (mobile ecommerce). The thing is that I really don't know where I should start looking.


So, having one year left to find an internship, I had the idea to go for the giant companies: Amazon, Ebay, Facebook, Google and others.
My questions to you:

1.	Do you think it is a good idea to do research/ an internship in such big companies?

2.	Where should I start looking? I know that companies like this rarely reply to emails about positions, which are not advertised...

Thank you very much guys.

Cheers, D.

184693,0,2013-02-08,"Getting a computer science minor as a backup plan, is it worth it?",Straoos,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/184693/getting_a_computer_science_minor_as_a_backup_plan/,"The two fields I can imagine going into is medicine (mostly), and then computer programming or a related CS field.
I'm debating between a Biology or a Biochemistry degree (there is very little actual difference in course load at my university) while taking a pre-med curriculum. I have enough room to fit in a minor and computer science seemed like a natural choice with my interests. I have also really been wanting a backup in case medical school doesn't pan out, especially since the job market for bio majors doesn't look too good.

However, I don't even know if I could enter the field of computer programming or get internships with just a minor unless I devote myself to becoming competitive outside of school. The minor is 6 courses long so it eats up quite a bit of my schedule for my college years. I could possibly finish my minor at earliest junior year (without giving up too much in my major early on because I need to remain competitive on the MCAT).

It makes me think, while trying to be competitive for medical schools, could I turn my computer science minor into a possible backup career plan? I'm unsure of the ability to get any internships with only 6 CS courses under my belt. The only thing I could think of is maybe mixing the CS and the Bio/Chem and trying to find something at a lab or go back to school and get another degree in CS. I know experience trumps degree but with neither it seems like I would be in the same boat as if I didn't get a minor in CS."

:--|:--
[ of all, I want to extend my sincerest thanks for making it easy to understand the complicated corruption at the highest levels of our political system. I can honestly say that your reporting is the main reason I still have a print subscription to Rolling Stone. Thank you very much and keep it up.  Basically my question is this: What can be done about it?  What do you think is the *ONE* thing that the government needs to do to stem the tide of corruption and start fixing things?  What do you think the average American can do to help change things for the better?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8azir4?context=5)|Hello, 3rdCulture. A great question that I struggle with a lot -- normally, ""What do we do about it?"" isn't really the province of reporters like me. But in terms of the stuff I cover, the obvious thing that needs to be done is that the banks need to be broken up; all of our major corruption problems stem from the Too-Big-To-Fail issue. How we accomplish that is of course problematic. There are two ways it gets done, legislatively and through prosecutions, i.e. the DOJ could charge a bank with something and then make breaking itself up a condition of its settlement. Or the state could legislate changes like the Brown-Kaufman amendment. Either way we need to elect people who recognize the problem and are willing to take those steps. Sentiment for this is growing. 
[“You've now written two well informed and well documented columns harshly critical of SEC Chair nominee Mary Jo White. But Neil Barofsky, author of “Bailout”, former Special Inspector General of TARP and himself hardly a friend of the Too Big To Fail spoke glowingly about Ms. White when her nomination was announced by the President. Any sense of why you two differ so strongly on this nomination? Thank you for your time.”](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8azhz4?context=5)|Gruasty, great question. Neil and I talked about that just the other day. He knows Mary Jo, worked with her, she actually hired him if I'm not mistaken. And I trust his judgement about pretty much everything. So this has been confusing to me. One thing we talked about is that in most cases, the switch she's making, from defending Wall Street for millions to policing it, doesn't really work. But he believes she's in the small minority of people who can pull it off. We'll see. I like Neil a lot, he's an honest person, hope he's right. 
[Did you really throw your coffee at Vanity Fair's James Verin when he said he didn't like your book?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8azl74?context=5)|I absolutely did throw coffee at James Verini, and it had nothing to do with him not liking my book. Let's leave it at that for now. I'll tell the full story someday. 
[Matt, you lived in Russia for a while and wrote about and did a lot of interesting and intense things, like messing with the mob, checking out Siberian prisons, and partying pretty hard. Russia is a place where they kill journalists for merely existing, so my question is: how did you not die? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8aznqo?context=5)|Purely by accident. Honestly, there were some close calls. A lot of bad decisions while I was there, many of them under the influence. One very funny story I've never told: I once worked with a Russian paper called ""Stringer"" to wiretap Alexander Voloshin, Putin's chief of staff. We published a week of his phone calls. I was so afraid of the consequences, I stayed out of the country when we published. Upon my return I was detained at the airport for 10 hours. I thought I was going to jail for life. In fact, the Russians were simply concerned that the lamination on my passport was coming up in one corner. They thought my passport was fake. Once they reached the embassy, they let me go. But that was one scary 10 hours. 
[Did you ever meet Hunter s. Thompson? I know it's been quite a while since he worked for rolling stone. Jw.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b0bjn?context=5)|Years ago, when I was in my twenties, I was asked by a book publishing company to edit an anthology of ""Gonzo Journalism."" Not long into the project I realized there was no such thing as ""Gonzo Journalism"" as a genre per se, it just meant ""written by Hunter Thompson."" But I was broke and needed the job. So I called Hunter to ask him what he thought. He said, ""That's a shitty assignment."" I told him I probably agreed. He said, ""How badly do you need the money?"" I said, ""Badly."" He said, ""Well, good luck, but I'm not going to help you with it. No offense."" I said none taken and that was it. That was the only time I ever talked to Hunter. It was a funny call, though. 
[Obama just mentioned new rules for taxing carried interest, do you think anything will be done? Do you see him making any drastic changes to Wall St. in his second term?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8azjdm?context=5)|Benjamin, hey, thanks for the question, this is a good one to start with. This AMA thing is wild BTW, thanks for being here. On carried interest, don't expect changes. Politics almost annually propose repealing that break. Changes never actually get made -- usually the threat is used as leverage to secure something else they really want. I would bet my house that you won't see major changes to that law. 
[Matt, a line of yours is lodged in my head: ""Organized greed always defeats disorganized democracy."" Unfortunately, while the animosity of Occupy Wall Street is still strong in early 2013, the disorganization of the movement might be even stronger.  So, if you were in charge of Occupy Wall Street, what single achievable goal would you (re\)organize the movement around?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8azmp3?context=5)|Again, to repeat, breaking up the banks is the big thing. That should be the Holy Grail of activist goals. Everything flows from the TBTF problem. If that can be accomplished, we're off and running. And it's not farfetched. There are a lot of people even in DC coming around to the idea. 
[Matt, huge fan of your writing. In some bizarro alternative universe, you are left as supreme dictator of the USA, but you only get a month, and any laws you implement are now as good as scripture. What are some of the things you do? What would be the first thing you'd fix and how? Thanks. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8azyg8?context=5)|First of all, I'd want my official title to be ""Interior Minister."" I seem to recall that Ivan the Terrible once had a giant frying pan built so that he could roast the captives from a battle in Pskov. The frying supposedly was done in Red Square. I think I might try that with the cast of ""Jersey Shore.""
[Matt, would you ever tip your hat into the political ring? Please think about it, I mean, look what happened for Elizabeth Warren! I think you would have a major populist pull.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8azpnb?context=5)|I wouldn't last 10 seconds as a politician.

Plus, I'm totally unelectable... if you look at some of the early eXile issues, I couldn't win a county dogcatcher race with all that in my past. I wouldn't vote for me. 
[You're often pretty cynical about politics and society from your writing. Having worked in DC politics/journalism for the past 4 years, I often just want to get out. What gives you hope? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8azkz8?context=5)|I get accused of being cynical a lot. I would say I'm the opposite of a cynic. A cynic is someone who recognizes that nothing changes.

 |I think writers like David Brooks and Tom Friedman are cynics, even though superficially they're a lot more positive than I am.

 |Also read Bill Simmons on sports obviously, we're both from Boston, so there's a mutual-suffering factor there. EDIT: Sorry, I keep forgetting we won all those championships in the last decade. Hard to explain but a Boston sports fan always feels like he's suffering even when he should actually be thanking God on a daily basis that he doesn't live in Cleveland.
[How do you stay refreshed mentally? Does reporting the things that makes me rage quit reading the news for the day give you the lift you need to continue in itself, or do you find hobbies or a different way of recharging and reporting on more?  If I can't even read Greenwald then Taibbi in the same day because I get so outraged, how can you guys write it every day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b0dmp?context=5)|Chainsaw, I keep my focus extremely narrow and try to avoid upsetting things when I'm not working. That's why I don't even read much about things like the drone attacks or torture -- my head would explode. On the other hand, I could write ten books about the NFL draft. 
[I was wondering if there was a legal reason the SEC or other financial enforcement agencies cannot use some of the settlement/court decision money for their operating budgets, as police do. I don't agree with the incentives law enforcement has to pursue the drug war, but if its happening all the time why should the SEC or FDIC ever have budget problems, wouldn't they be one of the most ""profitable"" branches of government?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8azs3u?context=5)|I believe last year the government claimed it made 15 dollars in fines for every one it spent on enforcement. I'm not sure why there should be a resources problem when it comes to policing Wall Street, big Pharma (which had three monster settlements last year including Abbott and GSK). We have a gazillion police patrolling the streets in bad neighborhoods in all our major cities, where there is very little potential for major economic damage to be done, while there are, what, 1000 SEC agents policing the whole country? There's no reason it should be that way. 
[Thanks for taking the time to pay us a visit, and for your insightful and entertaining work in *Rolling Stone*.  If you were an activist, rather than a writer, what do you think you would be working on now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8azjoq?context=5)|The thing is, I'm not an activist. One thing people don't realize is that my primary attraction to the subject matter I write about is that it's so interesting from a literary point of view -- I mean the corruption is just so dark and disgusting, there's something almost humorous about it, I'm very attracted to it as a writer. I also love the labyrinthine complexity of the scams. It's kind of the perfect subject for me. On another level, it outrages my social conscience, but that's secondary, if I'm being honest. So do a lot of other things -- I mean, that business yesterday of the government giving itself the power to extralegally assassinate without evidence is monstrous. As an activist, there's no shortage of crazy things to fight against. But to me, the most interesting problem is this financial cartel issue. 
[Have you ever received a refutation of an account of events you given, specifically from those within finance? I read both your work and mainstream financial publications.  As I am sure you're aware, the authors of the latter do not hold the highest opinion of you or your work.  I am curious as to whether or not this ever plays out directly, or merely in the volley of articles back and forth?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b1nks?context=5)|I'm very often criticized by people on Wall Street, but I get just as many people from that community contacting me and helping me with what I do. A lot of what people take issue with, when they do criticize me, is the fact that I don't have a background in finance and I'm presuming to have opinions about things they think I don't really understand. But when you ask most of those critics to point out something I'm wrong about, usually what they're quibbling about is a conclusion, not a set of facts. So for instance, when I did my story on Goldman, I quoted a hedge fund guy who said that Goldman selling bad mortgage bonds while it was shorting them at the same time was a classic case of securities fraud – “the heart of securities fraud” was the quote. I had numerous people, like Megan McArdle for instance, jump down my throat about what an absurd notion that was. But it was a view that many people on Wall Street had – I got the idea from a millionaire hedge fund manager. Some people didn’t see anything wrong with what Goldman did, but I did and do. A year or so later, Goldman was facing a massive investigation by both the DOJ and the Senate for engaging in that very sort of activity.
[Stated plainly,  do the people you write about ever send hate mail?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b1nks?context=5)|Again, almost all of my sources are from the financial world. I’m obviously not going to come into a subject like this that’s so broad and complex and start making wild end-run calls about this or that. I’m listening to people on all sides of the equation and making a decision about whom to trust, whose point of view seems most valid. That’s what journalism is and you always do that, no matter what the subject is. With finance there is a very consistent criticism of the big banks and their misuse of government influence that I hear from all corners and the people who have this view are both very convincing personally and very consistent with each other. So that’s where this critique is coming from. I may not be an economist, but all journalists do what I do – listen to people, conduct interviews, and draw conclusions from what you hear.  
[After ""The Great Derangement"" was released, did any of the people you dealt with undercover in Texas find out about the book? Did any reach out to you/the fake you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8azge1?context=5)|Yes, they did reach out. Well, one of the characters did. I haven't been good about getting back to her. I know she's a big fan of Bill MAher, because I always hear from her anytime I do that show. 
[A common criticism of your work is that your colorful rhetoric detracts from your serious and substantive reporting.  Do you see any merit to that critique?  Do you feel the rhetoric is necessary to keep readers engaged?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b1k83?context=5)|I think without the color it would be very hard to get large numbers of people to read about credit default swaps and so on. It's a challenge from a writing point of view to creative a narrative about this world that makes the subject matter accessible to people who aren't into it naturally. Again, I find the crazily complex stuff these people dream up fascinating and I'm trying often in my work to let readers share vicariously in the excitement and wonder I feel in learning about it all. I'm sure some people think that detracts from the seriousness, but I feel pretty sure that rhetorically, it's all a net plus. 
[Hey Matt, any good behind the scenes stories from your early mornings on the Imus in the Morning show? I always enjoy your commentary with that crew.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8azlpf?context=5)|I love Don. He's always been great to me. One very funny thing is that he dependably reams me out about how much the titles of my books suck. When you see us chatting off camera in breaks, it's usually about that. 
[Hi Matt, I'm a sophomore at Bard College, and I was just curious as to what you thought of Bard as a school.  Also where did you live here anyways? Toasters or Tewks?!  Do you make regular visits to old man Botstein?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b0co7?context=5)|Hi Th0rsday. I lived in South Hall. Loved Bard, wrote an article last year about it. 
[If bankers were a particular type of sandwich, what type of sandwich would they be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b0ee5?context=5)|Not sure, but I think it would have both Haggis and farina as ingredients. 
[This is a weird question, but did you ever write a piece with a parenthetical about Battlestar Galactica bring one of your favourite shows of all time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b0d8m?context=5)|I definitely did not, because I watched my very first episode of it Monday night. I do like the show, though. I recognize a lot of actors from one of my other favorites, the Canadian cop show ""Da Vinci's Inquest.""
 |Can I ask why you ask? 
[You met me a little over a year ago in a book signing in Brighton right after you signed a magazine for three giggling teenage girls. I'm in that bearded leftist demographic. My question is: You are a regular critic of the entire system of finance, of wars, of lobbyists, and of stuff like Iraq war contracts, but you have never translated that criticism into one of capitalism generally. Indeed, you defend capitalism and assert that these kinds of things are perversions. Why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b1pdw?context=5)|I get that question a lot. My view on this is, if there's something fundamentally wrong with modern industrial capitalism, we'll find that out when we actually see it in practice. But when it comes to modern Wall Street, we don't have the data to make that assessment, because there's so much anti-competitive collusion and intermingling with government power. Anyway those larger questions -- what sort of economic system we should live in -- are kind of above my pay grade. 
[You tackle a lot of contentious issues with powerful people. Have you ever been afraid for your life because of a story you were looking into?  EDIT: Grammar.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b1y6r?context=5)|Never. When I worked in Russia, I had friends who were Russian reporters who really did have to worry about those things (in fact two acquaintances -- I won't go so far as to say they were friends, but I knew people like Anna Politkovskaya -- were killed). But someone like me only needs to worry about litigation. I really... I get that question a lot, and it seems to me that people misunderstand the risks of reporting in a country like ours. The way to defeat journalists in this country is to ignore them, not kill them. 
[Matt,  What is the single most thoroughly corrupt entity \[institution, person, practice\] you have come across during your career?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b10s7?context=5)|I had a Russian reporter friend, Leonid Krutakov, who was trying to trace some money that disappeared from the Russian treasury. He followed the cash from bank to bank, transfer to transfer, until one bank listed the destination of the next bank in line as an address on the outskirts of Moscow. Leonid found the address and it turned out not to be a bank at all, but an electrical exchange box on a telephone pole. I'm not sure how they effected the actual theft, but I remember the punch line was that somebody had transferred tens of millions of dollars to a telephone pole. That was pretty much the best corruption story I ever heard. The top 10 are probably all Russia stories. 
[What are the best and worst parts about being on the Bill Maher show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b1w2x?context=5)|That show is terrifying to do. Huge studio audience, huge TV audience, and you have to fight to get your comments in. Whatever people think about Bill, when you're on that set, you really appreciate how quick he is to keep that show flowing the way it does. 
[Matt, after reading Griftopia, it became even more obvious to me that right after the bubble burst, you somehow got the money (I'm assuming from Rolling Stone\) to travel as much as you needed to, and spend as much time as you needed to, to interview hundreds of people about it. That you were doing first-hand reporting, at a time when everybody else was just quoting press releases or (if they were really ambitious\) quoting what they heard on CSPAN. It's why yours is the #1 book I recommend on the subject.  But lately you haven't been doing as much of that; the sources you cite lately are (like the hacks back in 2008\) what your sources call you and tell you on the phone and what you see on TV. What would it take to shake loose some more travel expense money so you could do so more first-hand reporting? And if we did, who do you want to interview now that you can't afford the money or time to track down and spend time with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b2qje?context=5)|I still travel a lot, as you'll see with my next book. But what you're describing has a lot more to do with time constraints, and age, and being married, than lack of funds. I don't have the ability to go spend weeks at a time in some faraway place anymore. 
[I used to intern at Democracy Now! and I met you once. You still writing that piece on ID's?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b1gey?context=5)|Yes, I remember you. That will be in my next book I think. 
[How did your father's connections help your journalism career?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b0v9d?context=5)|I should answer this, since it seems to come up a lot. My father was always supportive of me growing up. But he never once helped me get a job in journalism. My first gig in the business, with the Moscow Times, I actually got through family friends, a couple my parents knew in their college years who had worked with the Moscow Times editor in her previous job in Paris. After the Moscow Times, I worked at the eXile, which I started myself with Mark Ames. While at the eXile, Rolling Stone did a story about the eXile, which is how I met the editors there. So the only time anyone ever made a call for me was back when I was about 22 years old, and even that only got me the opportunity to submit freelance articles for the Moscow Times. Again, it's not that my father actively didn't help me -- he would have if I'd asked him to -- it just never came up. My father's an excellent TV reporter, he's really old school, and he taught me a lot, but our two businesses really don't intersect much. 
[Have you ever felt like your life was in danger because of a story you've written?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b2npy?context=5)|It's amazing how often this comes up. Maybe I'm naive, but nobody kills journalists here. They just let them rant and rave and get drowned out by reality shows. Much cheaper!
[Do you interact with the other writes often?  Do you have round table discussions to develop avenues for your stories to follow?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b0yso?context=5)|Writing is a pretty solitary profession, you don't see writers hanging out a lot -- the best ones are cranks/curmudgeons, I think I'm heading in that direction.  
[Do you do as many drugs as Hunter S. Thompson did?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b2r96?context=5)|I think Hunter at his peak probably did more drugs in one week than I did in my last five years in Russia. 
[Would You Rather Fight a Horse-Sized Duck or a Hundred Duck-Sized Horses?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b2ivt?context=5)|A horse-sized duck, no question. And that's probably the best question I've ever been asked. 
[If you had to leave America, which country would you choose to live in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b1m6k?context=5)|Thailand probably. Great food, excellent people, elephants...
[Don't you feel any need to attempt to be objective in your reporting?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b2d8l?context=5)|There's no such thing as objective reporting. All reporting contains a point of view. Even if you're writing in the third person in the New York Times, there's bias in which facts you choose to present, and in what tone you use, what's in the headline... I believe it's better to be up front about the bias and let readers see it. 
[If you have one particular story you are proud to have written, what would it be and why? Thanks for what you do...been enjoying your work for years. I especially love you during election years.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b2y1r?context=5)|My favorite piece of all time was something I wrote after New Year's Eve in Moscow called ""10 Seconds in a Moscow Police Station.""
[Hey Matt, I'm a Junior at Bard -- who were your favorite professors? Have heard your name come up in classes a fair bit, and was just wondering.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b1tsl?context=5)|Ben LaFarge and Peter Sourian were my guys there. LaFarge was incredibly good to me. Say hello if you see either!
[Did you go to J School? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b1a9s?context=5)|No, I just grew up around a buttload of journalists. 
[Favorite Cheeseburger!?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b1lnl?context=5)|Fatburger is pretty good. I used to like Astro Burger, which Ames called ""Ass-Blow Burger."" 
[How awesome is David Rees?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b169s?context=5)|David Rees is indescribably awesome. He goes to 11. 
[I used to real the eXile religiously. How much of what you wrote about life in Moscow was bullshit and how much was actually reality? I always had trouble believing that anyone could party so much and actually survive largely unscathed. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/c8b0gwr?context=5)|Sadly, it was pretty much all true.

[Hi Congressman McGovern - thanks for the AMA and for your efforts to scale back the Citizen United decision.  Can you tell us how we should interpret PAC contributions to your campaign? For example Norfolk Southern donate the maximum $10,000 to your 2012 campaign. Do they donate because they want access to you or do they donate because they believe in your ideology?  If a PAC donates the maximum $10,000 will they have greater access to you? Do they receive any special treatment when they want to discuss upcoming legislation? Do you think this system of pay-to-play also needs to be reformed?  How do the $10,000 contributions from Raytheon Co, Union Pacific Corp, CSX Corp and others effect the way you govern as a congressman? If these contributions have no effect on you, then why do these organizations take their time and money to donate in the first place?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8ajsno?context=5)|It's a fair question.  I am not going to unilaterally disarm.  The system stinks, but it's the system we have if you want to run for office.  If you want to change it, I hope you'll join with me in the effort to change how we finance campaigns.
[How do you feel about marijuana legalization? Do you believe it will ever be legal in the United States on a federal level? I heard about a bill being introduced in Congress but people are saying it won't get very far. What are your thoughts on this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aitcp?context=5)|I'm looking at legislation that will likely be introduced.  Unclear in a Republican House how much traction it will get, but I'm open to considering it.
[Hi congressman Jim McGovern! Thank you for taking the time to do this AMA. What is your stance on gun control? Do you think stricter gun control laws should be put in place?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aic9j?context=5)|I favor universal background checks, assault weapons ban and legislation to prevent gun trafficking.  I'm hopeful we can at least get something done this year.
[How about term limits for the HoR and Senate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aj06q?context=5)|Real campaign finance reform, so that we have a level playing field, is far preferable.  People ought to be able to decide who they want for as long as they want (or as short as they want).  I also support public financing of campaigns.

[Being in a country with over 300 million people, don't you believe there is a need for massive amount of campaign spending to reach out to these people?

The notion that you are only a serious candidate if you have lots and lots of money seems contrary to who we are.  Members who raise millions of dollars from the oil industry will be influenced by that industry.  We need to empower people, and not Big Money special interests.
[As your last name is McGovern, did you always want to be a politician?  =\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8ajebp?context=5)|No.  I thought I'd probably end up working in my father's package store (liquor store).  But I interned for George McGovern in college (no relation), he became my dearest friend and my hero, and my inspiration.  I was privileged to deliver the eulogy at his funeral.  I was a congressional staffer for 14 years for Rep. Joe Moakley before I ran and won in 1996.  McGovern taught to me to believe that one person can change the world, and Joe Moakley showed me how to do it.

One of the reason i want campaign finance reform is i believe members of Congress spend way too much time dialing for dollars.  This is not a good system.  I have 'dues' for the DCCC that I'm expected to raise. $200K last cycle, and I'm expected to raise $ for other candidates.
[How is it that the House only allows bills to come to the floor if they are supported by a majority of the majority party (currently Republicans\)?  This amounts to rule by a minority of the members.  Why is this allowed?  Isn't there a more democratic (small d\) way of proceeding?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aj940?context=5)|That's the way the Rules of the House are structured.  The Speaker controls the calendar.  Technically, there is something called a 'discharge petition' whereby if 218 Members sign then a bill automatically goes to the floor, but these are very very rare.  
[Hi congressman. Thank you for taking the time to speak with us here today.  How has the technology available today changed the way in which you approach your role as a congressman?  And how do you see technology impacting the political landscape in the future with services such as Twitter and this Reddit AMA granting easy and direct access between the people and their representatives? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aj5wq?context=5)|10 years ago I never thought I'd be doing this.  But I appreciate the fact that technology has made it easier for people to communicate with me and vice versa.  That's a good thing.  One issue, though - I get lots of ""petitions"" here in the office that many people don't even realize they electronically 'signed.' When you had to put pen to paper, it resulted in more thoughtful correspondence.  So I would urge people to take a little time when communicating with their elected representatives.  It goes a long way.
[Hello Jim,  MA resident here.  I was happy to see a resolution to overturn Citizen's United on my ballot this past election.

[Hello Congressman, thank you for doing this AMA. I am also quite upset by the Citizens United ruling and its consequences, but I do have a question.  If the ruling is overturned or negated through an amendment, how do you intend to reconcile the issue of corporations not having necessary rights to conduct business (such as the right to own property, the right to free speech etc\) with your proposed amendment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/180lxh/i_am_congressman_jim_mcgovern_sponsor_of_two/c8aiybo?context=5)|Those are two separate areas - property rights are commonlaw rights under state laws.  On free speech, my amendment specifically makes it cleat that people maintain the right to free speech and free press.  But the notion that the artificial corporate entity, created under state law, should enjoy the same fundamental constitutional rights as citizens is just wrong, in my view.  NY Times did a great editorial on this ...

The main things I'm a little lost on are RAM and HDD.  Are the choices I've made in here good ones for the builds?  Also, I've read that the Corsair AX series is really good, but I'm less certain about the Antec I put in the cheaper build.

Is there a huge difference between the 7970's I've selected and the Vapor X GHz edition?  Cause the GHz Edition is like $80 more, and that adds up.  Even with the second build, I'd prefer keeping it under two grand.

Since I'm not buying *right now*, current sales aren't as useful to me.  I really, really hope to buy within the next month.  I *am* considering going ahead and buying the graphics card, so I can get Crysis 3 and Bioshock Infinite.  I'm not certain yet if I'll actually drive to Microcenter to get anything, it's a three hour drive; might not be worth it.  If it is worth it, though, I will.

Thanks for your help! :D  Really looking forward to building, whichever one I end up with.  I haven't built my own computer in like seven years.

Edit: Forgot to say what it's for.  Will mainly be using it to game and internet, stream to my PS3 and such.  Will likely do some video encoding.  I have two monitors and plan on eventually getting a third.  I know that the second build is likely overkill, but it's been way too long since I've had an overkill machine."
186pyf,4,2013-02-09,Secret to getting an Internship?,theBenger,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/186pyf/secret_to_getting_an_internship/,"I am a Junior computer engineering major at Cal Poly Pomona, and even though I have been applying like crazy, I have been unable to land an internship.  I have a good GPA (3.4) and among other things, I am second in charge of the electrical systems on the Rose Float my school builds every year.   Even with all of that I am finding it impossible to get even interviews.  Am I expecting too much or am I missing something?

**EDIT 1:** I have a resume, a cover letter, and a portfolio of projects.  I have attended job fares at my school and handed these out, but the vast majority of my applications have been over the internet.  All of my material has been review by the career fair on campus and a few other people.  I think that my documents don't get across the work I have been doing, especially within Rose Float (I have completed 5 major projects, including making and programming a ""secondary"" animation system to control mechs our primary is unable to)

**EDIT 2:** Just for perspective, the Rose Float program is a massive year round project.  I put 10~20 hours in many weeks, with the 3 weeks coming up to the parade being 14 hour work days with almost no breaks.  It is done in conjunction with Cal Poly SLO and between people who have positions and volunteers, upwards of 200 students work on the project over the course of the year.   Outside of sports, it is the single largest program budget wise on campus."
186mcx,6,2013-02-09,Can I get my Associates and then continue right where I left off for my Bachelors?,chriswilliams54,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/186mcx/can_i_get_my_associates_and_then_continue_right/,"The reason that I ask is that when I graduated High School I wasn't really ready for college. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life, and I wasn't really mature enough to handle school. So I drifted through school for a few years failing classes(which caused my GPA to plummet.) and changing majors a few times before I finally straightened up. I decided on a degree in Information Technology and everything has been great since. The problem is that I am now 23 and I still have at least a couple of more years of school left before I can graduate. However, I should be able to get my Associates by the end of the fall 2013 semester. I live in rural Oklahoma so there aren't really many jobs unless you want to go work in an oil field (which I can't due to a heart condition). I am still working in retail, and even though I am in a supervisory position, I am barely making above minimum wage. I don't make enough to live on my own so I still live at home with my parents. I am anxious to start working on a ""career"" instead of just having a job. So my plan was to get my Associates degree coupled with as many IT certifications as I can acquire and try and find a job while continuing right where I left off to still get my bachelors. Can I do that or will I have to start over? If it is possible would it be a bad idea if I were to have to relocate for the job, meaning I would have to transfer schools? I looked into doing internships but my (slowly recovering) GPA is a big roadblock for those. So I tried to get involved at school and do the ""College Life"" thing, but living 45 minutes away makes it difficult. Plus now that all my friends have graduated (or are close), I am feeling more and more like Pierce or Leonard from Community everyday. Both at school and at work. And it is only going to get worse as time goes on. So any advice? Is this a dumb plan? Sorry about the wall of text; it's late and I am exhausted.

Thanks for any help."

""I'm 17, 18 in September. For the past 6 months I've gone to countless fast food joints, retailers, car washes, etc and no one will take me. I even went on Monster.com and sent out hundreds of resumes, even to ones I know I'd never get (because who knows?). I feel so bad because my mom still has to buy me stuff and I feel like I should be helping out since she's a single mother that doesn't make all the money in the world. It makes me depressed and I want to help. Any suggestions?

A few more details:
-I've volunteered at libraries, cafeterias and carnivals.
-I've had no jobs prior besides the volunteering above.
-I am home schooled since 8th grade. Don't know how you'd take that.
-I'm not good at too much, so there's nothing I know of that would stand out of me.
-Out of all the job applications I've never gotten ONE phone call or interview. It makes me so depressed.

One last thing is that my mother and uncle work at the same company and are in VERY good standing there. Both there for 15+ years, barely missed a day of work, and I've met and talked to quite a few people who run things over there. I'm not sure if I'd be able to have any kind of opportunity there, even a internship or something. I would however have to be 18 so even if that was in the realm of possibility it'd be months. That's just me grasping at straws because I have no idea what else to do. I know there's people out there who search for YEARS and don't get anything that will say ""you haven't gone through half of the hardships we have to"" and all that. I realize that, but I just feel bad sitting around like a bump on a log while my mom goes to work and STILL pays for everything I do.""

Anyone have any tips, ideas, etc? The best advice I've gotten is to start my own dog walking/snow shoveling/etc. business which would be great, if I didn't live in a small community where that's already taken care of and there's no snow. I don't know what to do."

I've already submitted it, but was curious about how feasible/viable y'all thought the idea was.

Concept: Not many people use Klout on a regular basis. I wanted to make a Klout-oriented product that did provoke more constant usage. This is a business card application that allows you to receive/store virtual business cards, and share your own preset cards with others. Your Klout score could be influenced by who you network with in-person

Notes:
* Handshake shows you people around you with the app, who you can send cards to (after in-person networking). Otherwise, you can search if you want to send your card to someone not near you, or text/email if they don't have the app
* Tilting your device horizontally while on the pile shows you the business card you were highlighting full-screen. The drop down arrow shows you the bottom half.

I can answer any questions about my design decisions but really want some feedback from all of you. Thanks guys :)

So I want to make a portfolio site at home in my spare time as a little side project and also to get better at the whole thing.

Since I have a Mac, i'd like to request a nice little list of helpful tools and applications I should have to help me with all this.

Some good resources would be helpful, and also some tips?

Thanks guys.

I am a second year CS student, and I have just been accepted as a software engineering intern at a major tech company. Honestly though I'm a little freaked and have no idea what to expect. I have only been in the major for a year and while I get good grades and do well on all the class projects, I feel like I don't have any of the ""real world"" skills they might expect of me. Does anyone have any thoughts on what I should expect? Any experiences as tech interns they are willing to share? "

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Does anyone pre-record their performances at the Grammys?  Or perhaps enhance the performance with recordings or electronic aids?  Is it a big deal among musicians to do so?  Are there famous artists who get nervous about a live performance before people who may not be fans?  On the other hand, are there artists who just thrive on performing live?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8csu9o?context=5)|Yes, but I can't name names.  We never do on principal.  I can say at country awards shows it's usually about 2/3rds pre-tracked except for lead vocals.  It's much less in the rock world.  I've heard only 3 bands are using tracks tonight.
 |Last time we had a show with usher he had tons of laptops running.  3 keyboard players onstage and not even one of them even bothered to mime playing that 2 note intro.
 |Electronic aids is pretty vague.  There are plenty of drum machines playing click tracks in our ears...ear monitors could be considered electronic aid.
 |There's definitely a machismo to playing live as opposed to doing the milli-vanilli.  But pre-recording means you get paid twice...for the performance and the recording, so they kinda win that way.
 |Dave matthews came offstage at an award show and his response when we complimented him was (approximate quote) ""I almost shat my pants I was so scared"".  We thought somebody with his experience still being that moved by it was awesome.
 |Miranda is definitely one who thrives on the performance.  sometimes you have to reassure the producers that it will pick up for the real show.  I feel that for sure.  The stakes get high and I get lost in the fun of the moment.  I liken it to mountain biking.  It forces you to be as focused on the moment as you are capable of.  Seeing Pink doing pushups and jumping around like a badass just before she hit the stage at iHeartRadio was awesome to see.  However you feel about a star's music sometimes you can't deny the energy and entertainment they provide live.
[""I almost shat my pants I was so scared""  He scares easily. I heard he got scared crossing the Chicago river a few years back.  It landed on a boat full of tourists passing under neath.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8cvqz3?context=5)|We often get lectured on being careful because we represent Miranda's name...but it truly is funny how much people exaggerate when celebrities have messups.  I have a little inside info on that one:  The driver for one of the crew busses, probably full of technicians that never even interact with dave, decided to dump his toilet illegally...it smells awful when they get full and sometimes the drivers are too lazy to find a truck stop to empty the shitter properly.  Years ago I stepped in a stream of pee from Miranda's bus when her driver dumped on the desert roadside right when I was walking up barefoot to check on another crew member...pee mud, ugh.  I boiled my foot.  Anyways, going over a river on a grated bridge seems like a sneaky place to dump without getting caught.  But the decision had nothing to do with Dave himself...I'm sure he was asleep on another bus miles in front or on a jet.  And I'm sure that driver was a good man who got fired over a careless decision.  Still, it makes fun enough headline that people latch on to and don't care about details.
[Just a wee bit of proof is all we ask, and then I promise the questions will come flooding in.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8cs6u4?context=5)|Everything I've heard about Frank Ocean paints him as one of the nicest people on the planet.  His dressing room isn't far from ours, maybe I'll try for a fiver.  Last time I saw the bieb's he was flanked by 4 bodyguards who tensed up when we said hi.  It's fun being an unknown backstage because the celebrities always say hi back in case you might be somebody they should know.
[Preemptively, will you please kick Justin Bieber in the balls for me? Oh and give Frank Ocean a high-five.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8cs6u4?context=5)|Edited for proof.
[Who are you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8cs7k1?context=5)|Chris Kline.
[What are you performing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8cs7k1?context=5)|I don't think I'm allowed to reveal the song but it's a Miranda Lambert hit.
[What's your opinion on the nominations.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8cs7k1?context=5)|I don't really follow award shows, but I heard some people grumbling about album of the year snubs.
[What's your opinion on the current state of music and the music industry? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8cs7k1?context=5)|It seems like rock is going through an 80's sounding phase but with more modern and tasteful production.  Keyboards are suddenly cool again.  #1 songs may not have an acoustic instrument but they are far from say AHA.  I don't really follow pop though.
[Vertexguy?!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8e1fxj?context=5)|Nope...I think of him as the ""more famous musician/programmer named Chris Kline"". I had never heard of him till I won bioshock years ago... imagine my surprise when his/my name came up in the credits!
 |It didn't take much time on YouTube to see he knows his way around a guitar neck more than I do! 
[Being a country fan I was pissed Chief wasn't even nominated...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8d716t?context=5)|It was released summer of 2011!  It wasn't eligible for anything ""of the year 2012""...
[Ooooh I love Miranda Lambert! Saw her in concert once, wonder if you were there too… She is awesome live!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8d3yo2?context=5)|I you saw her in the last 7 years, then yes, I was probably there!
[How do you feel about the current state of country and western? Has becoming more mainstream been good or bad for it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8ct120?context=5)|It seems to be going through a hair-metalish phase.  A lotta drop D loaded with distortion.  Country is more rock than it's ever been.  It's growing in popularity and I think that's a good thing.  Good music will always be made, what sells or gets radio play in a given year is not directly related.  I'm a fan of more songwriterish stuff.
[Sounds like my kinda music. I gotta listen to you more often. You're the Chris Kline of ""The Bionic Jam"", right?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8cszn8?context=5)|No, the Chris Kline of Bioshock fame is not me but I've been meaning to invite him out to a show.  I've seen him on youtube and he is a shredding guitar player.  As a CS major/musician he gives me a nerd boner.  Also I loved bioshock.
 |He's definitely the most famous Chris Kline unless you count Chris Klein of American Pie fame (I've gotten so many funny emails meant for him).  But there are literally hundreds of us on facebook last I checked.
[Maybe you two could start a band and really confused a whole bunch of people :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8e3ukh?context=5)|It's one of those John Smith kind of names... hundreds on Facebook.  There's another Chris Kline I know of who is a drummer.  We grew up in the same city, went to the same college, have the same middle initial... We easily spent 2 decades in the same city and somehow never met.  But I thought it would be cool to track down all the CK musicians and make an album.   Of course, people would just think it's a Hunter Hayes kind of thing.
[If country is getting more metal, then pop is getting more folk. Funny how that goes...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8cwb4m?context=5)|I just saw this comment ...that's a great way to simplify it!
[Have a good time at the Grammys, and let us know if you see anything gossip-worthy!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8cwb4m?context=5)|I saw plenty of funny things happen and I love to tell stories, but as a high-school nerd the word ""gossip"" makes me think of degrading somebody for entertainment and I'm really not into that.  As far as fun little details involving celebs: Kelly Clarkson was still going on about getting stuck on Miranda when she made her way back to the dressing rooms just after her grammy.  Miranda later said Kelly was not the first or last person to get stuck on her dress...it was an accident waiting to happen with every hug and many a faux diamond was lost.
[Hey, to be fair, Google's Suggest feature suggests your name as first result, and that's generally a good indication of fame.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8d4lw9?context=5)|[Link to imgur.com](http://imgur.com/rnELRxF)
 |Hmm, maybe if I insist on the spelling...and I think that re-ordering is recent, but i'll take it as a good thing! 
[I swear, it wasn't doing that four days ago!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8fmf3a?context=5)|It's all about incognito mode if you want unbiased results, and it still might use your IP region.  The kind of tailor made results and advertising that goes on with your average google search is a little creepy.
[How does it feel? Is it your biggest gig yet? How is the dynamics in the band during the show? Any room for improvisation - not so much melody/chords I would imagine but perhaps phrasing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8csg2o?context=5)|We did the grammy's a couple of years ago so not crazy jitters...but we were a little shaky at rehearsals so there is a little danger factor.
 |No...playing a sold out wrigley field with paisley felt bigger/more significant.
 |We are combining 2 bands for a medley,,,lots of musicians onstage who haven't jammed together much playing through quickly built ear mixes.. it's a bit like walking a tightrope together but we try to relax and remember to have fun.
 |I'm playing B3 on a song with no B3 so im completely improvising...I've been changing up some inversions on the fly...just feeling it out.  I'm not the sort of musician who knows exactly what I'm going to play but there's not too much wiggle room when just padding some big chords.
[Will your grammy watch the grammys in her pajammies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8cs701?context=5)|That is entirely likely.
[Can you punch Chris Brown in the nuts for me?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8d2827?context=5)|That would be very cathartic for the sane people in America.
[Who are you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8cs33q?context=5)|A musician.  A redditor.  Chris Kline.  You've never heard of me.
[Can you take a picture of Katy Perry's boobs while you're there? We have vast amounts of Karma to share and no one to give it too. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8d1g3z?context=5)|Dat dress...  i hope it's not too sexist to recount my most special 53rd grammy rehearsal experience.  We sat out in the empty audience seats while the rest of the bands rehearsed.  Katy Perry had a bubble machine going during the rehearsals which put out smoke filled bubbles everywhere.  They looked really cool, caught the light, and made little smoke poofs when they popped.  But they popped a lot and the dancers started slipping on the pools of soap.  After the song she announced into the mic that it was too slippery and they couldn't dance with the floor that way.  As she demonstrated to the producer how the bubbles made them slip she lost her balance for real... and to catch herself she had to double over in a full forward fold with her ass to the audience.  She was wearing a very short skirt and very thin underwear.  I'll be in my bunk.
[Is Blake Shelton really that awesome??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8ct32c?context=5)|He is effortlessly funny.  It's not just for the camera.  He could easily be a comedian for a living in an alternate universe where he didn't play country.  He's a kind soul as well...Its that certain honesty that goes hand in hand with being a comedian.  If he has a bad side I haven't seen it.
[Congrats on the TV gig. How different is it to play a TV gig versus a live show? Is it different playing in front of other professional musicians? Will you be watching the show when you're not playing (and if so, do you have your ""I'm so glad so-and-so bad musician won and I'm on TV"" face practiced?\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8csznl?context=5)|Staring at seated celebrities instead of wild fans is way different...and occasionally a camera gets in your face and you have to pretend its not messing with you.  I intentionally don't wear my contacts so I don't space out looking at say Elton John or Jack White.
 |We will be backstage gherming after we play.  We stand by the stage exit and say hi to the celebs as they pass...it's tons of fun.
[I love the fact that you said gherming here... Fellow musician with a lot of Nashville background in my family. Didn't realize how significant this word was until I started spending more time in Nashville. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8de40q?context=5)|I think the word extends to the film world as well...but I had never heard it until I started working around famous people.
[Do you see celebs gawking at mega-stars? I don't care if I'm King of the Universe, I'm gonna gawk at Aretha... :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8cw9gz?context=5)|Of course!  I think most stars don't think of themselves as stars unless they buy into the ego trip.  And as much as people love shitting on celebs, the majority of them get to where they are by having an amazing talent.  At awards shows stars bump into each other in the hall constantly and as they are walking away you will hear them saying stuff like ""OMG that was amazing"".  It's kind of a mutual admiration society (older than facebook)... and I think that's half the purpose of putting all the dressing rooms in close proximity.   Miranda loves Beyonce and was giddy to talk to her.  Dierks looked like Mcauley Caulkin saying ""yes"" to himself after talking to Steve Martin at the ACM's, it was sweet to see.  Dave Grohl seemed excited to talk to everybody, but I think he's just the human equivalent of a happy puppy.
[I would space out immediatley after seeing Jack White in the flesh.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8cxe6g?context=5)|As a band we pretty much did that.  Nobody came up with anything relevant to say besides ""we loved your performance"" so the awkward small-talk came to an end with him walking away saying ""see you around Nashville"".
 |In retrospect some good ice-breakers would have been ""We are guys from the rock world playing in the Nashville scene...we love what you're doing there...You'd be welcome to jam with us anytime (you never know).""...but no, instead we hosted our own little Chris Farley show.
[Can you say hi to Reddit when you're on camera? Something so we know you're acknowledging us?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8csvtn?context=5)|I doubt I'll get any camera time...and there's no way for me to know if they do have me in a shot.  I wore a reddit pin for many of the country award shows we've done but they are psycho abour not allowing logo's onstage at the grammy's.
[Have you ever sang a Miranda song at a karaoke bar?  May I recommend you get drunk and try it sometime?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8cuu1s?context=5)|Oh jeez, yes a few times.  Never sober.  Everybody thinks they are clever signing me up for a miranda karaoke song.  The thing is I sing all her songs for soundcheck every day so I'm very experienced with performing them.  But this one time I was in hell when Blake's sister secretly voluteered me to take over for the pianist at a crowded piano bar and play Kerosene.  This was downtown little rock after a concert so it was packed with fans.  I had never actually played the song on anything but harmonica and I was unsure of the chords or how it could even be done with a piano.  I mouthed to Miranda ""help me"" but it was too late to let the bar down.  The bar crowd ended up being so noisy that nobody minded me searching for a few chords and lines...but I still catch flack from Blake's sister for not knowing all the words.  We ended up getting escorted from the bar to the busses later by a team of 4 mounted police.
[I really appreciate the way you elaborate on your answers and tell good stories.  Storytellers like you make for really interesting AMAs even when I'm not familiar with the subject to begin with.  Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8cv9ke?context=5)|Cool, I figured it would be fun and I'm glad you are enjoying it.  I get so much out of this website so it's great being able to contribute.
[Do you have a solo career?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8csr28?context=5)|Sort of.  I post my new songs to [chriskline.com/mp3](http://chriskline.com/mp3) when I finish them... But I got this gig after I was finally crushed enough by the harsh reality that is the music industry...and started looking for work as a side-man.  I've been kicking around getting involved in the Nashville songwriting scene but I'm mostly a rock guy and the one point everybody makes about country these days is it doesn't need more people trying to dress up rock songs as country songs.
[Do you mind telling what is the harsh reality that is the music industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8dabyd?context=5)|Nobody cares about the art you nurture and birth to the world.  Also, nobody will tell you if your art simply isn't original or passionate enough to be interesting... You just get ignored until you can bring warm bodies into clubs or sell records.  Then everybody wants a piece whether it's good or not. Also, it takes money to make money... The day of the starving artist getting discovered is over. 
[What about Carrie Underwood? nobody to huge star in a few years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8dc98m?context=5)|Does she write songs?  I'm not saying you can't be a great performer and achieve fame.  She has a voice and show that can sell tickets and albums and so a big label invested in her. 
[Miranda lambert played saxophone in high school.  Why didn't any hot girls play saxophone at my high school?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8cuykg?context=5)|I do think girls should find more things like band instruments or science fun, but american culture just doesn't reward these sorts of activities right now...it's all about popularity and fun.  Don't get me started.  But the cool nerd does seem to be making a comeback lately.
[Link to soundcloud.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8d5mjs?context=5)|Holy shizzle-fries! That is hilarious and disturbing to hear something I wrote with the voice inside my head spoken in your voice...a professionally smooth voice I might add.
[Can you get me a job with Miranda's crew? I'm really fun to hang out with.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8cxgat?context=5)|""The hang"" is so important.  And we had so many revolving crew positions when we were a Texas based band... hiring friends and friends of friends to tune the guitars and such...but somewhere between 2008 &amp; 2010 it got so big that we hired mostly nashville professional technicians, which is a professional pool that just isnt as big in texas.  To put it another way, we outgrew the supply of TX touring professionals.   Now we are such a well oiled organization that suggesting a friend for a position would just be laughed off if that friend hasn't already proven themselves in the hellfire that is the touring industry.  There were too many people at the shows to just stop things and say ""sorry, the guitar tech put the capo on the wrong fret"", as happened from time to time in our clubbier days.  People expect a bigger, tighter production once thousands start showing up for the show.
 |It's important to note that the texas region is big enough that it has its own country market that is often at odds with ""nashville country"".  Bigger Texas bands never have to stray far from Texas to make enough money to support themselves.  But if you want to play arenas you have to make it to a national market and Texas alone can't provide that...it's a hard or impossible transition for many southern country/rock bands.  Once you become a nationally famous band the Texas markets might reject you for not being Texas enough.  These are very vague generalizations but my point is that the nashville vs. texas tension is quantifiable.
[Is that a no then? : ( PS Miranda and Dierks did awesome!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8d8y1m?context=5)|TL;DR: No.  (Management specifically announced a ""no more hiring friends"" rule years ago)
 |I'm glad you enjoyed the mashup!
[Thanks for doing this AMA. How did you land the job as a musician? Are you a 'studio musician'? What does your job require of you (hours put in, how much creativity, etc\)? What other artists have you worked for? How different is working for a a singer as opposed to being in a band? what education do you have for music/keyboards? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8cv1h8?context=5)|No prob...just sitting here otherwise.
 |It's all who you know basically...networking, networking, networking.  Having enough talent only puts you on the field, not in the game.
 |I record my own songs for fun and have the occasional session, but my touring (and insecurity about my skills) keeps me from any regular studio work.  Also, producers in Nashville generally have sets of musicians they prefer working with.
 |Before I moved to nashville, which is geographically convenient, I was gone more days than I was home.  We worked it out to 191 days on the road in 2009.  Now it's mostly Wednesday evening through Sunday morning and back home.  On a normal day I roll out of bed, sing a few songs for soundcheck, work out or work on songs, pretty myself up, then rock out for 90 minutes...and usually have some fun after the show until we roll to the next city in the wee hours.
 |I haven't worked with anybody as big as Miranda except in Miranda-related events.. I got to back up Fogerty when he joined us onstage.  I got to trade vocals with Carrie Underwood while standing in for ML at a rehearsal.  I got to jam with Charlie Daniels once and he tossed me a solo.  Paul Shaffer wanted me to do a solo on Honky Tonk Woman at a Letterman commercial break...but I didn't see his gesture...when he told me later all I could say was ""wow"" and froze up like a giddy little girl.  We have Blake join us every now and then.  Dierks, Paisley, Urban, whomever Miranda happens to be jamming a song with on a given night.  I almost forgot:  I played keys on Will Hoge's latest single [""Song Nobody Will Hear""](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/another-song-nobody-will-hear/id590963757)
 |She treats us like family.  We are a band and we love being that way.  She's said we should get our own name, but we never play as a group without her.  I'm still the new guy after more than 6 years.  She likes us being able to roll with situations on the fly and not clam up when shit goes wrong.  Bands that don't really know each other are more susceptible to train wrecks without that trust.  We've finished out playing unplanned songs, the wrong song we started but played anyways, capo's being in the wrong place so we transpose on the fly, jamming until the microphone can be fixed, or when she wants to talk...that sort of stuff.
 |I had piano lessons as a kid and a teenager but I didn't really fall in love with music until I could learn songs I loved on guitar.  I had the odd guitar lesson here and there but nothing consistant.  University of Texas' music program was very old school: Jazz or Classical only.  But I took studio engineering classes at Austin Community College in the 90's.  I ran a music studio and played with local bands for next to nothing for years until I got this gig.
[What is your favorite Miranda song to perform live? Favorite song of hers that you don't perform in concert?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8ctmnq?context=5)|In the current set Over You is my favorite because I get to play a prominant guitar part, sing a big harmony, and swell an organ note in and out with my feet.
 |I absolutely love Fine Tune but we never play it because the crowd gives us blank stares.  It's not very country.  I miss Crazy Ex Girlfriend too because the B3 part is wacky but she's been tired of that one for a while.
[How emotional does Over You get? I imagine it's worse for her husband than her.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8d2mxq?context=5)|She gets choked up and lets the crowd sing sometimes.  It's about the same with House That Built Me...she didn't write it but she's internalized it.  As far as Blake, that's not something I know or would ask about...but I can say he has been side of stage at plenty of shows when she sang it and spoke about it's significance beforehand.

I was not as confidant about it as I was at rehearsals...not as clear an ear mix but there are a million possible reasons for that.  Hopefully didn't muff any notes, I haven't heard it yet.
 |Did you mean Beyonce'?  If you're going to pick on an entertainer for prioritizing entertainment over a live display of musicianship then put it in an envelope and mail it to madonna in the 80's...nothing has changed.  Ill bet if Beyonce' thought she could relate more to her crowd by strumming an acoustic and singing with a bluegrass band around a single microphone she could pull it off.  Just my impression of her.  I didn't see the inauguration but I'm guessing it was enough of a formality rather than her regular crowd having a good time that she might have said ""fuck it, let's run the vocal track tonight"".  Or maybe she had a cold.  I don't know why I'm defending her, she just seems like she genuinely cares about music and has talent... and that's good enough for me.

Last time I got to make a fool of myself with Neil Patrick Harris, Jamie Foxx, Usher, Gwennyth Paltrow, Beyonce', Polly Peret, said hi to the beibs.  I invited NPH to go get ""a sandwich""...I'm pretty sure he was very unamused but he was nice about the gag.  Usher held my hand for about 10 seconds when the crowd pushed in...he looked back and presumably realized I wasn't his bodyguard and let go without any explanation.  Jamie Foxx loves Miranda's music and recognized us from the performance...he approached US which was awesome!  I hope this year is as exciting as the 53rd was!

For the most part the nashville recording clique is seperate from the touring clique.  I haven't tried to break in.  I'm a bit insecure about my abilities in the studio...I lean more towards the showman side.
[What did you do at dell?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8d13dd?context=5)|It changed a lot over 7 years.  Most of that I was a contractor with no bennies coding in ASP and PHP, but it allowed me to work part time and run my music studio at night.  At first I was contracted to do internal facing customer relationship sites for people who needed inside information but didnt work for dell.  Later I was the junior developer for the Internet Partners Division...which was a specialized arm between small and large business for Dell partners who had few employees and large profits, and offered venture capital to potential companies like that.  Then the big tech bust happened in 2000 and those companies mostly flopped like fish in a dried up lake.  My entire division of about 300 dried up.  First the sales force was redirected to the small and medium business divisions.  Then one by one the marketing executives were either laid off or reassigned.  Before the admin (that's Dell-ese for secretary) knew she was to be laid off she handed me my contract.  She mentioned she had tweaked the employee database to give me a status somewhere inbetween a contractor and direct employee.  Eventually the Director and everybody I worked for was gone and I was left alone in the empty cubicle farm for 20 yards in any direction with no standing orders or responsibilities.  I realized it was some sort of glitch that might soon be fixed so I started wandering around looking for people that needed computer help...excel spreadsheets, mouse ball cleaning, pc load lettering, whatever.  About a month later I was helping somebody and they realized I could edit web pages and shouted to their colleagues ""WE HAVE A WEB RESOURCE!"".  Apparently they hadn't been able to update their web pages since the layoffs.  I handed their admin my contract, which was somehow pre-funded by Intel for keeping their logo on the site, and my job continued for another 6 years...now with flexible hours since I was effectively an independent contractor.  My contracting company had lost every employee but me and gone under...they sold out to another arbitrary entity whom I kept faxing in my hours to and I kept getting paychecks.  I did internal and external coding, photoshop work, copywriting, at my most prestigious point I managed the home page...then I took it a step further and re-did the menu system on the home page.  It was kind of a disaster because I went around the usual dell content and made a javascript system that was only PC compatible, but was there really much business we lost from people on Mac's trying to buy Dell's?  I knew it would be fixed soon enough and i knew I would never again get the opportunity to work on web pages that get millions of hits daily.  I had no more ambition left for the tech industry.  Right about that time Dell started gearing up for the second round of layoffs in 2006...maybe third if you count how many contractors they let go at any given time.  I had been forced to go full time and forced to lead a team of programmers, which was cool but i had turned it down because as a perfectionist it made me want to get there early and leave late to make sure shit got done.  It was a responsibility trap.  I had to escape and my solo music career had fizzled in the last few years.  So I told all my musician friends I was looking for a road gig...I'd even play country..but corporate money is a hard addiction to kick!  Miranda wasn't the first audition to come up but it was the first one I'd leave Dell money for...
[Are you involved with the songwriting process, or are you given sheet music to learn?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/189e8g/im_performing_on_the_grammys_tonight_anybody_care/c8dcu7q?context=5)|Miranda's songwriting process? No.  I do hole up in the back lounge and write songs while we're on the road but that's just my own thing.  She gives us rough mixes as the albums are in progress so we can have the songs ready to play before the album is released.  We often make nashville chord charts to get started and Keith always writes drum charts, but the songs are always quickly memorized.  It's all done by listening.  We use our own best judgement as a band on how to translate studio parts to a live performance by a 6 piece band.  We're very against using tracks to have a slick production in the live show.

I hope to get involved in the songwriting scene so I can continue to pay my bills with music and not computer skillz...it's just more fun.  Although I do enjoy programming, I enjoy it much more when it's not for a company that I am not attached to..I like hobby programming like VST plugins and the Reaper SWS extensions i'm playing around with.

I'm a senior math/CS student (graduating in May, whooo!), and through a combination of not knowing what I want to do with my life and general anxiety about working in the real world, I didn't do any internships during my undergrad.  Now I'm faced with the reality of applying for jobs, and I'm freaking out because I feel like an idiot for not doing an internship.  (If I could do undergrad over again, I would have definitely done some kind of internship.  I feel like a dumbass.)

So I feel unprepared for a full-time job, but I know that internships are typically for current college students.  Is it a faux pas to apply to both an internship and a full-time position at the same company?  I aim to be applying to programming jobs/internships.

For further background, I go to UT Austin (a top 10 school for CS, whatever help that is), with a decent GPA and a heavy tutoring background.  I've had the same tutoring job for 3 years, and it was a long-semester only job.  I've had jobs during the summer, but they were mentoring/tutoring jobs with extremely flexible hours.  I want to stay in the Austin area after graduation if possible.

Thanks in advance!"

I haven't had an internship before and this is my last summer before graduating. As it stands I have two options.

1) A position in the Technology division of an Investment Bank doing most likely software development. My title would be that of an Analyst, and I'd be in the same New England city as my school which would be nice.

2) A position in Miami in the IT division of a Fortune 100 company, in a group overseeing the international IT operations of its foreign subsidiaries. The role would be more about strategy, and management. It's also paying 50% more than at the Investment Bank. That said, although it's closer to home, and I have some family there, I don't really have any friends in the area. Although I considered maybe going there after Graduation because of the more agreeable weather.

I know career advice is difficult to dispense without my career goals, so here it goes:

Long term I would like to open my own business in the country I'm from, or to be CIO of some company. I enjoy business problems more than I do coding. I enjoy development and programming and I'm pretty good relative to my peers, but I feel I'm not as good as other people out there and I won't ever be ""top of my field"". I always considered Project Management to be my eventual destination, and coding as more of a step in that direction. 

I've been leaning towards the bank despite this though, just because i feel an Investment Banking internship is more prestigious, and I feel I can leverage that better than I do this position.

I'm talking with the career center at my school but I just wanted other people's thoughts on the matter.

Thanks!!!"

Unfortunately, it seems like I have a real possibility of not getting accepted anywhere.  So far I've received 2 rejections, and 7 other schools have already sent out offers. I'm still waiting on 3 schools, but I'm not very hopeful for those.

I should also mention that I only applied to top-20 schools in theoretical CS, and this is probably a big reason why I didn't get accepted anywhere.  In my defense, I kind of bought into my professors and friends telling me I'd probably get in places, but in any case it's too late to do anything now.  I mostly just want to know why I'm not getting in anywhere, and how I can fix that when I apply to graduate schools next year.  I would really like to be competitive for the top schools, and even if I'm not able to, I think it's a reasonable goal to have.

So yea, here's my profile.  Just FYI, I'm going to include some identifying information, and I'm fine with everything I post here.  However if by chance you recognize me, it'd be great if you didn't mention anything I don't list here (not sure if that's reasonable or not).  And sorry in advance for the length -


Undergraduate Institution: MIT, majoring in Mathematics with Computer Science (18C)

GRE: 169/161/4.5 Q/V/AW, did not take the subject test

GPA/Coursework: 4.83/5.0 overall, 4.93/5.0 in just math and computer science courses

In particular, I've taken 5 (+1 in progress at the time of application) graduate courses in theoretical computer science, 3 undergraduate courses in computer science, 2 undergraduate courses cross-listed in computer science and math, and 5 (+1 in progress at the time of application) math courses.  Among these, my only B was in Real Analysis freshman year.

Research Experience: 1 semester in a computational biology group freshman year that was only mentioned in my resume, 1 summer in a mathematics REU that resulted in two poster presentations at undergraduate conferences, 1 summer doing mathematics research in my school that resulted in a single author publication that's in submission, and 1 summer doing theoretical computer science research in my school where I only got small results, but was acknowledged in a paper for ""helpful conversations.""

Recommendations: 2 recommendations from my research advisors from the past two summers, and 1 recommendation from the professor I took a graduate course with (unlike other grad courses, this one had a midterm along with a research oriented final project).  All of them seemed positive about me applying, and all well-known theoretical computer scientists.

Personal Statement: To be honest, I didn't spend as much time on this as I should have, and this is definitely something I need to be better about next time around.  I just wrote that I liked theoretical computer science, about my research experiences, and a customized paragraph for each school that mentioned a few professors I would be interested in working with.  I didn't include any ideas for research projects, or grand reasons for going to grad school.  I did not mention anything about my pre-college years.

Random Extras that may or may not matter: I got top 500 on the Putnam last year, one of the surveys I wrote for a final project for a grad course turned into a publication in an undergraduate expository journal, have written a few articles in a mathematics magazine for middle school students, have graded for various courses in mathematics and computer science, have done two winter internships in finance.

Thanks in advance to everyone who got through that."
18gyep,22,2013-02-13,"CS student here. Depressed. Under qualified. Confused. Desperately need your help, Redditors. ",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/18gyep/cs_student_here_depressed_under_qualified/,"Background:
--------------
I will be graduating next year from a CS program from one of the top 5 universities in Canada. Its depressing for me to say that despite having a really good cumulative average in my program, a relatively decent grasp of the theoretical concepts we are taught in school, and a 16 month internship experience with a multi-national software firm, I don't think I'm worth anything and so will not be able to find a job after I graduate.

Let me clarify what I've said above: 
1) While its one of the top 5 universities in the country, apparently all the universities in that list have the same quality of education or 'training' that they impart to undergrads.
2) Yes, I have been a lazy bum when it comes to talking to professors about research opportunities they could provide me with, or in general networking with them - learning more about the course outside of the curriculum. I am not a scholar. Not one who'd think about going to grad school and doing research. I am one who sticks to school curriculum, does well, and parties the time he's left with. I realize that this habit of mine is possibly one of the bigger reasons or probably THE reason, why I think I'll be a failure after I graduate.
3) The 16 month internship experience I've had with the software firm has been that of a Test Associate intern. This is one of the decisions I regret most in my life until now (I know there are many more to come). I was offered 4 developer position internships and 2 test associate internships. I chose the internship of the testing position because of the money and the name of the software firm. And believe me when I say this, I really needed the money (no, not for parties. for family related issues). When I was deciding on which internship to choose, I knew I should go with the developing positions, but should I have gone with them, I wouldn't have been able to finish school.

I believe that internships are the best way to start off your career and a great opportunity for those who can get these. I faltered here big time. 

Now, coming back to my original point: 
--------------------------------------------
I'll be graduating in slightly over a year. And I believe that 1 year can be a relatively long period of time to set things right if one really wants to.

But here's my problem, I don't know how to do this. I know what I want. I want to be able to sell myself in a year from now to potential employers on how I could make a difference to their firm. Basically, get them to hire me. 

I'm not great with any particular technology. I have had some experience with a few of them. Nothing that would dazzle anyone. I know people without CS degrees have better experiences and work than I do.

Under web development, I have come across technologies such as HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, SQL. My experience here limited to creating a simple website I made.
Under core development, I have come across technologies such as Java, Python, C++. But my experience here is limited to school assignments extending up to a writing a few classes.
Under app development, I have developed a couple android apps. No exposure to iOS.
Under testing practices, I have written a few shell scripts and dealt with some automation testing. Nothing useful here.

I haven't ever worked with Open Source. Never had experience with GIT and open source projects on github. This, I hear is a very good way to expose yourself to real world problems and real world programming. However, I really don't exactly know where to start with this. Which projects to contribute to. How to contribute. I know what you're thinking.. its sad, I know. But that's why I need your help..

I have heard and read a lot about TopCoder. Apparently, you do well in topcoder competitions, gain a good rating and you can easily get hired by some top software firm. I don't know if this is really true. The problems on top coder are based on your knowledge of algorithms. I don't know if this is really worth the time and effort that will be put in to it. If just having a good rating, which obviously isn't guaranteed before hand, will do it for you.

I don't know if I should go about making some kind of web app or a phone app myself and bank on that.

TL;DR
-------
I don't know how I should spend the last year before I graduate to make myself sellable to firms, so that they hire me. I have no experience with open source, top coder. Don't have any fancy projects. Don't have advanced development experience. Just whatever one learns in school curriculum. These days, that doesn't seem to be enough.

Please tell me whether putting all my time in Top Coder can be worth it. Why? 

Or please tell me if I should start contributing to Open Source projects. If so, how? And what I can gain from it. 

Or please tell me if I should disregard the previous options and go about making some personal project of my own. If so, please tell me which technologies should I look to be working with? As there seem to be countless of them out there!

OR what would you do, if you were in my place facing the situation I am."

Which is understandable as I have a large coding background.

My question is whether after I complete an internship in something like financial software development, could I potentially easily transition into a quantitative analyst position once I graduate or will I end up limiting myself to software type roles?

EDIT: I should add I've taken some economics courses and in the Fall I'm planning to take some heavy math based finance courses (stochastic processes in finance, numerical methods in finance, and design/implementation of systems to support computational finance)"

My boss told me about a guy he had met at a bank conference that was a (civil?) engineer for many years until he was laid off. In an attempt to find work, he applied to many different places and explained how his knowledge of advanced math could benefit their firm. He ended up working in a bank, and used his math skill to find customer account decay rates among a fairly homogeneous customer base. His background was stress testing materials used in buildings bridges, and he found that many materials used had a long life and some had a very short life, much like the customer base in a financial institution. 

He spoke at lengths with my boss about his work, and years later, my boss is very interested in precisely this kind of research. I am tasked to approach engineers at the local university with this problem, but I thought I would first turn to Reddit. I am going to try to detail exactly what I am looking for, but please keep in mind that I have no engineering background so I may (will) use incorrect terms or assumptions.

We have a homogeneous customer base that will all eventually leave the bank for very different reasons. Some may leave due to dissatisfaction or a better competitor, while some may leave the bank due to death (i.e. lifelong customers). We are trying to find the availability of funds in deposit accounts (savings, checking, CDs, IRAs) over a number of years, and the interest rate risk involved in establishing new accounts and gaining new funds as necessary, which would involve establishing new accounts at current rates. We are also trying to determine the point--or number of years--at which 50% of available deposit funds will no longer be available to the institution due to regular activity and account closures. 

We have the data for account closures, and are just looking at the best way to apply the data. This is a mock graph of what we THINK a chart would look like that would be generated by this application of data, and what we hope to gain is insight on how to do it.

I am sorry if I am being vague, confusing, or am unable to accurately describe what exactly I am looking for from Reddit, but I was hoping to just bounce some ideas around for sure. I really appreciate you guys reading. Thanks!"

Just a bit of background.  Im a sophomore at Miami University (Ohio) trying to get an internship for Information systems and analytics. My problem is that my GPA is currently a 2.5 (had a bad first year). I feel that my resume just isn't that convincing that I'm not a dumbass. Any help would be appreciated."

[Hey Burkie, how did you feel about JVR toe-dragging Luke Schenn last night?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dumii?context=5)|I was out scouting the Beanpot last night. Had to find more talented young players to keep our playoff streak alive. 
[Why do you think hockey and soccer are the first two professional sports to create You Can Play videos? Is there something intrinsic to those sports that makes them more open to LGBT rights?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dujgb?context=5)|Hockey and soccer (in the US, at least) do seem to be leading the way on this issue. I think the international diversity of the leagues help (Canadians tend to be very gay friendly, for example). There's almost certainly a large number of socioeconomic factors at play as well. It's an unfortunate truth that minority groups (whether based on racial, religious, economic, etc) tend to have different attitudes towards the LGBT community. We've tried to emphasize adding LGBT people from those groups who can really target our outreach.
 |Esera Tuaolo, for example, is a gay ex-NFL player who is religious and also Samoan. He's helping us as Special Advisor on Faith and Religion, and will also help with outreach to the many Samoan NFLers out there. Wade Davis, another gay ex-NFL player, works at the Hendrick-Martin Institute, working with inner city LGBT youth. He has tremendous, tremendous insight into how to reach inner city athletes, and will help us on that front. 
[Thanks for doing this AMA and for your amazing work with YCP. I recently attended an Invisible Athlete Forum where you touched on the fact that you set up YCP as an 8 year project because you think that the work will be done in that amount of time or less (I hope you're right!\). Can you expand on how/why you picked that time frame? Do you think that homophobia in sports can ever truly be completely eliminated? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8duxrj?context=5)|8 years is the amount of time it takes for a high school freshman to graduate college. That's why we picked that time frame. Give a kid who was getting out of the 8th grade in 2012 a full 8 years of YCP before he gets out of college.
 |It's never going to be completely eliminated. Like racism, sexism, or any -ism. Unfortunately hatred and ignorance will always be able to find a home. I firmly believe in 8 years it will largely be a non-issue, however. We will have openly gay athletes in every major male team sport, and it will be common place. Athletes coming out will be a non-story, and openly gay youth athletes will be drafted into pro leagues. At that point we'll have to re-visit YCP and see what we want to do.
 |I never had any intention of making this my life's work. I do this to honor my brother, and to try to do my best to do some of the work I think he might have done. I do this to give back to the LGBT community who was so good to my brother, and has been so good to our family. I do this because I love sports, and I want everyone to have the chance to experience the joy that I find in the game. I do this because kids are quitting, kids are being beaten up, and kids are dying from this. And I think I'm in a position where I have a story, a voice, a message, and a personality that lends well to being effective at reaching athletes. But my life before my brother's accident consisted of drinking beer, working out, watching hockey, and chasing women. I would very much like to fix this bullshit so I can get back to that. 
[Hey Patrick. Great cause. I love telling people about this project, especially when they inquire about my You Can Play tshirt.   There seems to be less of a stigma for female athletes who are out. I see that a big part of your poject has your message coming from male athletes. Is You Can Play more interested in getting the message out through male athletes or are you looking for female athletes to partnership with too?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8duk6k?context=5)|We've made female athletes a priority from the start. We're official partners with the CWHL (professional women's hockey), which was our first official league partnership. Our advisory board has many strong female voices. And we've made a priority to emphasize the voices of female athletes in our speaking engagements and videos. Our college videos prominently feature female allies and lesbian/bi/trans athletes. Too many people think it's a non-issue in women's sports, and it's really not. There's still a lot of work to be done. 
[Why is it so hard for athletes to come out of the closet ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dud9i?context=5)|There's a variety of reasons. Some guys don't want to be first and have to deal with all the media attention. Some guys don't want to be a role model. Some guys just want to play sports and not be a ""Jackie Robinson"" for gay rights. Some are nervous about their teammates' reaction, or about their job security, or about the fan reaction. There's dozens of reasons that may keep a professional athlete closeted, but I think we're rapidly seeing those reasons disappear.
[Also, what's your new favourite NHL team now ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dud9i?context=5)|I work for the Philadelphia Flyers. So, them. 
[Do you actually know gay NHLers ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dugks?context=5)|We have a no comment policy on that one. 
[If you're curious, Chris Kluwe is also a big Reddit user over in /r/nfl.  They say if you say his name three times, that he'll appear.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dvxcw?context=5)|I follow Chris on twitter and check in on him on Reddit at times. Really good guy. Funny as hell. 
[I know I've already asked a question, but I'd love it if you had some perspective on this for me: what's the best way to support a family member who's closeted?  It's still a secret to almost everyone, obviously, but I don't want him to feel like it's taboo either.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8duk84?context=5)|Be respectful of them. Mind your language. Find ways to be LGBT-supportive. It's a tough line to walk, because every closeted LGBT person has their own journey they have to take before they come out, and it's not up to us to force it. 
[Hey Patrick, I'm a big supporter of the project. Have there been any NHL players who have refused to support the cause?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dudv0?context=5)|We have a no-comment policy on whether or not athletes respond. We do not want any athlete to ever feel pressured to participate. Same thing for the teams. We've been asked to endorse email campaigns or Change.org petitions, and we always refuse. I don't want athletes who were guilt tripped into this. I want athletes who are excited about it. 
[Do you think when sports teams receive negative publicity because a single player said he would not be comfortable with a gay teammate, that that response helps reinforce your message? Cam Jansen or that 49ers player who said he would not feel comfortable with a gay teammate come to mind.  What the hell is going on with the Capitals, and what do you think GMGM is going to do between now and the trade deadline?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dud40?context=5)|I think that the responses from the sports world towards comments like Cam's or Chris Culliver's illustrate how far we've come. Ten years ago, those comments would have been shrugged off with no response, or even endorsed by people. Now they're being critiqued and analyzed. It's very encouraging to see. 
[What should I tell people that are hateful towards homosexuals and attribute it to their religion?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dufcq?context=5)|I wrote this in response to Torii Hunter's quotes about being uncomfortable around gay teammates because of his religion. Long story short, if you're trying to emulate Jesus, there's no justification for being an asshole to anyone.
 |[Link to deadspin.com](http://deadspin.com/5972579/what-would-jesus-do-about-a-gay-teammate-a-christian-response-to-torii-hunters-comments)
[What's your favourite memory from your time in Vancouver with your Dad?  And, can you still recognize Henrik and Daniel after all these years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8duj3i?context=5)|I could never tell Hank and Daniel apart. No one could. One of them had a chipped tooth for a while, and everyone was thrilled because they finally knew who was who.
 |I really loved Vancouver. I was there from 87-92, roughly. The best memory of that time was Gino Odjick scoring on a penalty shot against Calgary. To this day, that was the loudest I've ever heard a stadium. I'm pretty sure he injured himself celebrating. 
[Do you think the flack Tim Thomas received for not going to the White House with the Bruins hurt your cause at all?  The guy basically 'came out of the closet' as a right-wing conservative and a lot of people feel that it was a huge distraction to the team.  You've proven the players will support their team-mate, but do you feel that the media reaction (even if positive\) might be a problem?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dujpe?context=5)|No. Most professional athletes are conservative, politically. Tim's actions had no affect on what we were doing, it simply underscored why we never take on any political issues. They're too divisive. Why give a player an excuse not to join you? We don't endorse candidates, we don't campaign on issues, we don't say or do anything political. The most right-wing athlete in the world can feel just as comfortable working with YCP as the most left-wing athlete in the world.  
[Is the point of YCP more about tolerance or acceptance- because if it's just tolerance, that stance totally makes sense. If it is acceptance, are you working first towards tolerance and then acceptance?   ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dwt5i?context=5)|I'll take tolerance to start. Then we keep moving. If we could get every athlete in the world to say ""I'll support an openly gay teammate"" and eliminate homophobic slurs, (which would be the basics for ""tolerance""), I'd be pretty happy. 
[What do you think is the proper punishment for athletes who use homophobic slurs in a game? I feel like Kobe's punishment 2 years ago ($100,000\) was a bad idea just because the fine only teaches him not to use the words BUT not why not to use them. Do you feel that sports leagues need better punishments for those that use these slurs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dupit?context=5)|Education. I don't care at all if a player is fined, suspended, whatever, as long as there is mandatory, EFFECTIVE, education. Not just some token, bullshit gesture to make it all go away, but real work, with real LGBT athletes.
 |That said, there should be discipline. My feeling is that as long as the leagues are going to regulate what players can and cannot say in terms of racist/sexist comments, comments about officiating, comments about fans, comments about league officials, etc., then the LGBT community deserves that same protection. If the leagues ever wanted to say ""We no longer police anything our players say on or off the field, on any issue, at any time,"" I'd also support that. Because it would be entertainingly chaotic and a total disaster for everyone. 
[Would you like to see players start to police themselves in this regard--so that using a homophobic slur was a reason to drop the gloves even if it wasn't directed at you? How much do you think those slurs are accepted/shunned right now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dvv7x?context=5)|I have no doubt that will happen once the first players start coming out. Someone's going to say something stupid and get the crap beat out of them. 
[What steps do you take to get a team to take the pledge? Do they come to you or do you pitch it to them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8due68?context=5)|Teams have generally come to us. The Toronto Marlies (AHL) originally reached out to us to have a speaker come in and address the team. So I went in alongside Scott Heggart, a gay goalie. We talked to the team for 30 minutes or so and then bounced out. Scott was amazing, as he always is. Afterward the team asked if they could do something more than just make a video. So, we drafted the Pledge for them. The Pirates and the Providence Bruins heard about it, and both called me asking for information. Now Hamilton is filming theirs for release soon. Wilkes-Barre, same thing. AHL teams are really excited about this. 
[You're a scout right?  Who would you take 1st overall in the 2013 draft if you had to decide right now?  What about 1st overall in the 2014 draft if you had to decide right now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dumx4?context=5)|I'm a pro scout, so I don't do the amateur side of things. I haven't seen those top amateur guys. I would recommend trusting Bob McKenzie on that stuff though- he's pretty plugged in at the scouting level. 
[Hey Patrick, you're the president of You Can Play, you're going to law school, and you're a scout for the Flyers. That sounds like a ridiculous work load, how do you balance everything?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dunq8?context=5)|I train for the Boston Marathon. Keeps me sane. We'll be making that a fundraiser soon, I think. 
[As a Hockey Enthusiast and fellow Runner trying to qualify for Boston (3:18:38, so close\), I'm glad to hear you raise money for this event!  I'd love to donate to your fundraiser when it comes up or (Even better\) run Boston for the cause!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dvg2a?context=5)|I'm just trying to finish the stupid marathon. The first guy who ran this distance died, and then other people went ""I bet I wouldn't die doing that!"" It has to be the dumbest thing I've ever done while sober. 
[Have there been any times where you've had trouble recruiting a particular athlete or team to support the cause? If so, how did you handle it? Were you able to change their minds?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8duhju?context=5)|We've had overwhelming success recruiting athletes. It's reached the point with hockey players where we no longer really recruit guys- they just call me and ask how to get involved.  We have a pretty easy message- support any teammate that's good enough to help you win games. It's something that's very simple for athletes to understand and endorse. 
[Hey Burkie.  I know you've got a lot (all?\) of the AHL teams on board with the project, how long do you think it will be before you get an NHL team (officially\) on board?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dv5hs?context=5)|I think we can count some of the teams as officially on board at this point, even if they never signed anything. The Canucks marched in Vancouver Pride with me this summer, as an official team event (and my thanks again go to Manny Malhotra, Jason Garrison, and Fin, the mascot, for showing up). They had several players express support for YCP publicly, they ""dyed"" their rink purple for Spirit Day, and they recently did a feature story on a transgender goalie. The Leafs regularly run our PSAs in-arena and have been working behind the scenes on some LGBT outreach as well.  
[My question: there was  a scandal with the SF 49ers the week before the Superbowl, when it turned out that 2 of the 4 players who appeared in an ""It Gets Better"" video had no idea that it was to end bullying specifically of LGBT teens (because LGBT teens have a 3-4x higher rate of suicide than other teens, among other things\).  Their responses to a reporter's question indicated they may not have done the video if they had known it was targeted to LGBT teens.  The video was subsequently removed from the ""It Gets Better"" site.   Watching it, I can see that neither of the two make any reference to LGBT status; and I can well imagine that a team PR guy put them in front of a camera, had them read a sterile script, and they had no idea what the recording was for.  This made me feel like my rights are being used for sports PR, and that the people there don't really stand behind what they are saying.  It makes me question every single ""It Gets Better"" video, and also the ""You Can Play"" videos.  So: what re-assurance can you give that the players who appear in ""You Can Play"" project videos know that it is for gay players specifically, that they back that cause, and are not embarrassed about speaking for equality of gay players?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dvhzt?context=5)|I spoke with every player that appeared in the original NHL videos and they were aware specifically what it was for and what it was about. In our first couple videos, we did not push the players to say the ""magic"" words- gay, LGBT, homophobic, etc. This allowed guys to get their feet wet a little bit and allow the league to be comfortable with the idea that NHL players were standing up for gay rights. Now we ensure that athletes are saying gay, or LGBT, or homophobic, or otherwise making a specific reference to the gay community in the videos. There's no doubt about what our athletes are appearing for. If you don't want to take my word for it, here's part 1 of a 3 part series of NHL athletes being quoted on YCP.
[I love the fact that Brooks Oprik is the NHL representative in commercials for YCPP.  Do you have any relationship with Brooks?  Keep doing what you're doing.  Great cause.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8ducqk?context=5)|Brooks is good friends with my brother-in-law Jared. When we approached NHLers, we already had Tommy Wingels and Andy Miele on board, but Brooks was the first non-Miami University guy to respond. He became a bit of a pied piper for us. I could go to other guys who might be hesitating or confused and say ""Brooks is doing one."" It helped a lot of guys realize they wouldn't be the only one out there talking about this. We've incredibly grateful to Brooks (and his lovely wife Erin!).
[Hi Patrick - firstly, Sorry about your loss. Brendan seemed like a truly wonderful person.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dvnug?context=5)|No. He had talked about doing some outreach, and had given a couple speeches, but the idea for the campaign had its genesis after the accident, in an article I wrote for Outsports.com.  Actually, what we had talked about was Brendan speaking on gay rights, and me speaking on mental health. I had a long bout with depression that I had to overcome, and we thought going into high schools and sharing our stories might be useful.  I put some of that aside in order to focus on YCP in his honor.
[Was YCP something you and Brendan had thrown around prior to his passing?  What has been the biggest hurdle you've faced as an organization? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dvnug?context=5)|The biggest hurdle has been the political, turf war bullshit that goes on behind the scenes with fundraising, advocacy work, speaking opportunities, etc. I don't have the patience for the type of crap that goes on behind the scenes. I don't want to get famous, I don't want to throw parades, I don't get paid for any of this. I want to do the work. Put me and my speakers in front of athletes and let us do our thing. Someone else can take credit, I don't care. I'll be the GE Coors Light NBC Universal speaking bureau if people let me stop playing politics and let us do what we do best- real, effective, practical, outreach. 
[What is your position on transgendered athletes playing in their own gender (sorry, the terminology gets confusing for me\). That is, someone who is born a man but identifies female. They theoretically have a physical advantage playing in a women's league. Is that fair? How is this issue handled? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dxio1?context=5)|Good question. I'll give you a overly simple response, with the notation for anyone reading this that it is an overly simple and not at all in-depth look at trans issues. We recently added Christina Kahrl to our Advisory Board to help on trans issues.
 |First, since everyone only seems worried about male-to-female trans athletes, I'll say this: the hormones taken during the transition period mean that transitioning athletes are actually at a disadvantage within a few weeks of starting their transition. It's harder for them to recover, to retain muscle mass, and to be an elite athlete. This is not Ladybugs, where Johnathan Brandeis puts on a wig and is a women's soccer star. This is an intense, deeply personal, and physically trying medical and psychological procedure. The competitive argument simply doesn't hold water.
 |Second, are we really, really worried about this? I'm pretty competitive. I've been in fistfights over Monopoly games. I once broke up with a girlfriend of three years because she beat me in bowling. I was that kid in gym class who tried too hard. Let's say you came to me and said if you cut off my finger, I could win a Stanley Cup. I'm in. Now let's say you came to me and said you could cut off my dick, but I could win an Olympic Gold Medal in women's soccer. Do we really think there are elite athletes out there saying yes to this idea?
 |Trans athletes should be able to play their sport as their identifying gender. And they deserve our support to do so. 
[1\) Do you find certain sports are more receptive to talking about homophobia, admitting it's rampant, etc. than others.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dv7ab?context=5)|At the college level, every athlete listens and responds well to us, regardless of the sport.
[2\) Do you find certain areas of the world respond differently?  A baseball played from PR vs a hockey player from sweden?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dv7ab?context=5)|There are absolutely cultural differences for international players. We learned that with Yunel Escobar and his discussions with us about Cuban culture.
[3\) (multiquestion, sorry\) Has Moneyball changed hockey scouting at all?  Do you use advanced metrics, or is more your eyes than anything else.  I know in baseball there was a lot of pushback between what eyes were telling people and what computers were telling people.  How do you attack the game (other than being where the puck will be\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dv7ab?context=5)|I know some teams that use advanced stats, but unlike in baseball (where each individual play is a set event), the chaotic nature of hockey tends to limit their value. And the ones that I've looked at tend to do a poor job translating from CHL-AHL-NCAA to the NHL. In addition, our game is so emotional and based on passion, work ethic, and desire. Different players serve different roles on a team, and building a great NHL team for an 82 game NHL season and 25 game playoff run isn't as simple as finding 22 guys with great Corsi or whatever. 
[, thank you for your work with You Can Play. I'm also in law school so I can't imagine how busy you must be.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dv4rc?context=5)|There's some overlap, obviously, between LGBT issues and sexism issues. Pro sports definitely has a sexism problem, and it trickles down to lower levels. I'd support a charity that wants to take that on- I've got 4 sisters who I love more than anything. But it's not really what we're geared up for.
[My question: Do you have any plans to discuss sexism in pro sports? I'm a big sports fan (especially NHL hockey\) and I often find the sexism to be really frustrating. It's so normalized that most people don't seem to even question it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dv4rc?context=5)|That said, we do our best to take stands on it when possible. We amplify voices of strong female athletes, media members, and front office members whenever possible. We try to do real work with women's sports leagues and groups. We've refused to work with certain pro athletes who have done some of the more egregious examples of sexism.  I'd love to see women get more opportunities in front offices, coaching staffs, scouting staffs, even media roles. But it's just not what we're built for. 
[Do you think the increasing acceptance of the You Can Play pledge by NCAA and AHL teams will help encourage NHL, NFL, and other major sporting league clubs to make their own organization wide commitments to YCP and LGBT rights?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8duo6m?context=5)|I think that at the one-year mark we've shown that the other leagues can trust us, if they choose to. Things like the Pledge give teams an easy and effective way to hop on board. We've shown we can handle crisis situations like Yunel Escobar or Cam Janssen. We've shown we can handle the PR side of things, the fan relations side, the media side, and- by far the most important- the athlete side.  Addressing athletes isn't easy. You have to be a part of their community before they take you seriously. I've seen some LGBT speakers doing sports outreach who aren't sports people, and it drives me fucking crazy. Some aren't even fans! And you listen to them talk about sports and it sounds so forced and unnatural. They try to make jokes about sports related things, or talk about the locker room culture, and it's just...off. You have to be part of the culture before athletes will listen to you. And with the background our advisory board has, and with my background growing up around the game, athletes relate to our speakers. It's effective because they feel at home. 
[Congratulations on the great work with You Can Play!  During the last year, what defining moment made you realize people were really embracing the movement or that you had such a hard road ahead?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dusqw?context=5)|The day we sent the emails out to every NHL GM. I was sitting there watching the emails go out one by one and was just thinking ""Holy crap...if this doesn't work, I'm going to be the laughing stock of the NHL."" There was no turning back, really.

[Just wanted to say thanks for all you have done. I have some friends in the LGBT community so this is a cause that hits close to home. I feel like the hockey community is the perfect sport for us to have our first openly gay athlete.  With comments like that of Chris Culliver in the NFL driving home how far the gap still is. Have you been in contact with the NFL or other leagues to try and get this initiative to the other big sports?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8duqil?context=5)|We've spoken with every major professional sports league about getting involved. I think you'll see each league start picking how they want to do their involvement (whether through us, or GLAAD, or Athlete Ally, or StandUp, or GLSEN, or some combination of all of us).  I think the first hang-up we encountered was that the other leagues don't know me. So a 28 year old NHL scout who's still in law school walks into your league offices and says he can run all your LGBT outreach and education initiatives. When I did that with the NHL, our guys knew I wouldn't screw it up. When I did that with the other leagues, it was kind of ""Wait, who the hell are you again?""
[How'd you go about becoming a scout?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18dnhy/i_am_patrick_burke_president_of_the_you_can_play/c8dv5bw?context=5)|I started breaking down games with my Dad when I was like 6. When I was 12 I realized I wasn't good enough at hockey to be an NHLer. So I told my family I wanted to be a GM. I started to try to watch games as a scout and analyze players. When I got to college, my Dad put me on to help out in the midwest as a ""bird dog"". I got fifty bucks a game. So all through college I gave up my Friday and Saturday nights and went to watch games- ND, Michigan, Michigan State, Bowling Green mostly. I sent email reports to the chief scout for him to critique. I also spent time in the front office with the Capitals, working a bit with the coaching staff for the Portland Pirates when Kevin Dineen was there, and I spent a year with the New England Patriots as their chief legal intern. Long story short, I had an in because of my last name. That cracked the door open for me. Then I worked my ass off for the last decade to make sure I didn't waste any of that advantage. 
[Hey Mr. Burke, how do you personally feel when guys like Culliver from San Fran, and Torri Hunter from Los Angeles Angels (now Tigers I guess\) make homophobic remarks using the public platform.

And does it anger you, or do you just want to try to help those individuals get past their closed minded ignorant ways?  For my hockey specific question...do you agree with me that young d-men with potential are the trade chips in the league at the highest premium? And if you do agree, do you expect that to be consistent looking into the future?

Some players are actually homophobic. Most players are actually just uneducated or unfamiliar with the issue, so they say stupid things some times. As a group that works on educating those athletes, I can't hold grudges. I have to give the athlete the benefit of the doubt and work with him to talk him through the issue, then set him to work making things right. Anger is unproductive.

 |Two ways to fix this. One is a modification on the instigator penalty to allow for guys like this to get the crap beat out of them. Almost certainly never going to happen. I'd like to see some sort of Cumulative Asshole Penalty. Right now guys have figured out they can be a little bit obnoxious after every whistle as long as no one act reaches the point of a penalty.

Kind of tough for religious groups to argue with that. We also make sure we are always, always treating religion with respect. We recently added Esera Tuaolo as Special Adviser on Faith and Religion to make sure that we are respectful and inclusive of the many Christian athletes out there.

I'm a Business student concentrating in Information Systems and Computer Science at a fairly well known Top 30 University.
I haven't had an internship before and this is my last summer before graduating. As it stands I have two options.

1) A position in the Technology division of an Investment Bank doing software development. My title would be that of an Analyst, and I'd be in the same New England city as my school which would be nice.

2) A position in Miami in the IT division of a Fortune 100 company, in a group overseeing the international IT operations of its foreign subsidiaries. The role would be more about strategy, and management. It's also paying 50% more than at the Investment Bank. That said, although it's closer to home, and I have some family there, I don't really have any friends in the area. Although I considered maybe going there after Graduation because of the more agreeable weather.

I know career advice is difficult to dispense without my career goals, so here it goes:

Long term I would like to open my own business (leveraging software and technology) back in my homecountry, or aim to be CIO of some company. I enjoy business problems more than I do coding. I enjoy development and programming and I'm pretty good relative to my peers, but I feel I'm not as good as other people out there and I don't see myself ever being ""top of my field"". I always considered Project Management to be my eventual destination, and coding as more of a step in that direction.

I've been leaning towards the bank despite this though, just because i feel an Investment Banking internship is more prestigious, and I feel I can leverage that better in the future.

Any thoughts?"

My boss told me about a guy he had met at a bank conference that was a (civil?) engineer for many years until he was laid off. In an attempt to find work, he applied to many different places and explained how his knowledge of advanced math could benefit their firm. He ended up working in a bank, and used his math skill to find customer account decay rates among a fairly homogeneous customer base. His background was stress testing materials used in buildings bridges, and he found that many materials used had a long life and some had a very short life, much like the customer base in a financial institution. 

He spoke at lengths with my boss about his work, and years later, my boss is very interested in precisely this kind of research. I am tasked to approach engineers at the local university with this problem, but I thought I would first turn to Reddit. I am going to try to detail exactly what I am looking for, but please keep in mind that I have no engineering background so I may (will) use incorrect terms or assumptions.

We have a homogeneous customer base that will all eventually leave the bank for very different reasons. Some may leave due to dissatisfaction or a better competitor, while some may leave the bank due to death (i.e. lifelong customers). We are trying to find the availability of funds in deposit accounts (savings, checking, CDs, IRAs) over a number of years, and the interest rate risk involved in establishing new accounts and gaining new funds as necessary, which would involve establishing new accounts at current rates. We are also trying to determine the point--or number of years--at which 50% of available deposit funds will no longer be available to the institution due to regular activity and account closures. 

We have the data for account closures, and are just looking at the best way to apply the data. This is a mock graph of what we THINK a chart would look like that would be generated by this application of data, and what we hope to gain is insight on how to do it.

My significant other of two years and I broke up recently, and now I'm devastated, disoriented, and in a catatonic-like state. But this is not your typical post-breakup depression.  

Before I met him, I had been struggling with depression and anxiety related to a chronic pain disorder I've suffered from since 2004. Threatening to derail the completion of my undergraduate degree, I doubled down on my studies and eventually graduated. At the age of 22, I moved to a new city to try to start a career. I eventually landed an internship, and eventually, was offered a permanent position. I've been stuck, spinning my wheels, ever since. I'm still at the same, miserable job over five years later. 

I won't elaborate too much on my health condition. Honestly, what it's labeled as is irrelevant, and I am not looking for sympathy. I no longer obsess over finding a cure that clearly doesn't exist, and I've long since stopped going to doctors, besides routine check-ups once a year. But I suffer from unrelenting chronic pain in my neck, shoulders, hands, back, and feet. I have a constant headache that never truly goes away- just vacillates in intensity. My eyes always burn. My skin always hurts. My ears ring loudly, constantly. I cannot really sleep- I wake up dozens of times in the middle of the night. I have good days and bad. And until now, I've had the strength to carry on. 

I had tried dating in the past, but nothing really came out of it. I was also a late-bloomer- I came late in college and had only been dating for a few years. A few dates here and there, a few summer flings. Nobody I had truly loved. I didn't think it was possible. Loving me would be a bad investment for anybody, I thought. You know, damaged goods. Sure, I'll hook-up with someone every now and then, but for me, a longterm relationship was just not in the cards, right?

When I met him two and a half years ago, I was in a very dark place. I had been invited by a friend to a dinner party, and begrudgingly went. Once there, I saw him. Our eyes met, and by the end of the night, I knew that I had found somebody special.

Shortly after, we started dating. Things progressed quickly. But I knew it would not be forever- he would find out about my health problems and they would quickly obstruct our relationship. After a couple months, I broke down and told him about my problems. He said he understood and was shocked that I feared he would leave because of them. It seemed like I finally found a person willing to give me a chance. I was the happiest I had been in years. 

For a while, things were amazing. We hung out often- constantly on weekends, laughed, cried, travelled around the country, attended music festivals, ate at every restaurant in the city, and loved each other. But things started to unravel last year. Aspects of his personality started to become unattractive, and eventually, I even lost most of my physical attraction to him. He would also become easily annoyed at me. Our time together felt increasingly monotonous and tedious. We both knew the end was near, but I was afraid to let go. 

The end was a few weeks ago, and I'm still trying to pick up the pieces. I never thought a mutual break-up could ever hurt so badly. The only things getting me through the days are Jameson and Xanax. Almost every night, he haunts my dreams, and when I am sleeping, we are still together. When I wake up in the morning, a jagged knife stabs me in the stomach and I remember that he is no longer by my side. I am alone. 

You might think, well, you got along okay before him, so you'll get through this as well. But now things are different. I now know what I had, what I've lost, and it's something that I most likely won't ever have again. Even though I had been looking for an out in the deteriorating relationship for the past few months, I am now dealing with feelings of self-hatred for my part in the failure of the relationship.  

Now, I have nothing. I have alienated most of my friends, as I made the rookie mistake of letting the few friendships I had fade while I spent most of my free time with him and befriended all of his friends - and now they're gone, too. 

I was shown what life could be- that I could be happy, even with my chronic health problems - and now it's all abruptly gone. 

I'm not sure what the point of writing this is, possibly someone can offer some perspective that I haven't thought of. But I feel that my days are numbered, and I can only keep pulling myself out of bed for so much longer. I have the tools to do this, and at this point, it's really only my pride (and not wanting to hurt my family) that's keeping me alive. I feel like that won't sustain me for very much longer. 

Thanks for reading, I know it's an essay. "

this is my first draft for my computational linguistics masters application, its due march 1st and I'm in dire need of more eyeballs so I would greatly appreciate some reviewage. If anyone wants to trade statements for me to review just let me know.

I expect to make a lot of changes so don't be afraid to tear me down.

***/

My long-term professional goal is a career in natural language processing. This career will allow me to do what I find most fulfilling and satisfying in life; it will allow me to apply my analytical skills to solve complex real world problems. The &lt;school&gt; Computational Linguistics Master's program will ensure that I have the skills and experience required to achieve this goal.

My interest in linguistics derives from my love of solving puzzles. Picking apart and analyzing linguistic data to find patterns is like solving a verbal Rubik’s cube. A Rubik’s cube has over 432 quadrillion unique states, but any Rubik’s cube can be solved with an understanding of the patterns that govern its movement. Similarly, the complex surface variations of Language arise from simple underlying rules which can be deduced through careful analysis. I find it thoroughly satisfying to pick apart and explicitly describe these elegant linguistic processes that exist in my own unconscious mind. Through my undergraduate Linguistics courses I have learned how to think like a Linguist; how to analyze data, recognize patterns, and describe phenomena. I applied these skills in a syntax research project in which I provided arguments for the existence of null complementizers.  Other projects of interest I completed include a description of Swedish phonology and a study of American dialect perceptions. My efforts have given me a broad and comprehensive understanding of Linguistics that will serve as a framework for my learning in Computational Linguistics.

My aptitude for solving analytical problems also precipitated my interest in Computer Science. Every assignment I was given during my programming classes presented me with a new puzzle to solve. After starting a project, I could not stop thinking about it until it was finished. It was not uncommon for me to wake up in the middle of the night with new ideas for optimizing my code. What I enjoyed most about my Computer Science courses was the sense of accomplishment I felt when my hard work resulted in a functioning application. I am now applying the skills I acquired in school to build ASP.NET web applications at my current internship with the tech company CodeSmart Inc. My ability to focus on implementing theoretical concepts into working programs will be crucial to my success in the &lt;school&gt; Master’s program.

So far my academic studies have only covered Linguistics and Computer Science separately, but I am most interested in the intersection of these two fields. In order to learn more about natural language processing, I recently began an internship with the developers of an iPhone application called Nuiku. The application acts as a virtual sales assistant, managing sales data through a natural language user interface. Helping to test the Nuiku natural language processing engine has opened my eyes to the immense potential Computational Linguistics has for practical applications. I am particularly interested in ways that natural language processing can improve search engines. Search engines serve as mediators between the user and all of the wealth of information on the internet. The large scale implementation of semantic categorization and information extraction will one day revolutionize the way we interact with information. This is one of the many ways in which natural language processing has the potential to empower users of the internet with better access to more useful information. I am a firm believer that knowledge is power. It is my dream to apply my practical problem solving skills to empower the average person with better access to the wealth of knowledge on the internet. I will do this through a career in natural language processing.

The &lt;school&gt; Computational Linguistics Master's program is the ideal means for me to achieve my career goal. No other program places the same level of importance on preparing its students for the challenges they will face in the industry. The curriculum promises to provide me with the knowledge base, practical experience, and relevant relationships necessary for success in my career.

/***

Some specific questions:

1. How can I improve my intro/conclusion? Right now they feel very generic and my conclusion doesn't really do any concluding
2. Does the rubik's cube analogy help me at all or am I wasting my time? At first I tried writing it like an anecdote about my first experience with a rubik's cube but it was long and flowery and didn't seem like it fit in this paper. Same question for my lame attempt to show how much I loved my programming assignments.

18l5ba,8,2013-02-15,Sort of just came to the conclusion that my Uni's Software engineering course sucks. Or are they all like this?,bustyLaserCannon,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/18l5ba/sort_of_just_came_to_the_conclusion_that_my_unis/,"I'm in my 3rd (out of 4) year of a Software Engineering degree in a fairly large University in London.

I'm currently in a work placement creating software for a few more months until I return to do my final year and one of the people I work with graduated from my University. He had plenty of previous programming experience where as I had none. 

Now being at this company, i've been asked to do things (programming-wise) which they expected me to know how to do. And after a few months here, i'm realising they barely taught me shit at University. 

The only OO language taught was a one year module in Java, and a few other bits of MySQL, Prolog, PHP, basic web dev and I have an optional C++ module I can pick next year which I will. There's also the choice of a Haskell module (any good?) and some other bits I can pick. Things like data-structures and algorithms were taught but there was nothing low-level, nothing practical, not a lot of programming, it just seemed very vanilla. 

That might help but I know for a fact that my software engineering course has less programming involved than the Computer Science course. I'm just disappointed to be honest, and wondering what I could do to 'catch up' on people that had a better CS course.

I also feel sorry for the people from my course that didn't get a placement and went straight into the final year as without the experience i'm picking up from this internship, I would've gone into my final year as a pretty shitty programmer.

However, if I take one of these internships, I'll be unable to attend the undergraduate business school at my university (Richard Ivey School of Business for those who know about it) and do the dual degree with Software Engineering and Business.  I have a few connections in that school so if I am accepted (guessing about a 60% chance speaking with past students) then I will have the opportunity to interview for good banking jobs.  However, I have no interest in banking.  I do not enjoy DCFs, or anything of that sort.  My passion lies both in Software Development and the industry as a whole.  I love talking about what I think about major companies, the next big technology, the quality of a recent release, etc.  My roommates are in IB and constantly ask me questions regarding the tech industry.

I'm not sure what to do.  Does anyone have any insight?  Like I said, I enjoy software development, but I also enjoy researching the industry and coming up with ways to make money from it, but I don't like the actual banking work behind it.  I've heard of banking firms that recruit solely software engineers because of their knowledge, but is there any validity to this?

My biggest fear is going the traditional software route and having my salary peak at ~100k.  But, if going the business school route, I fear being 50k in debt and being in a field I don't enjoy.  Or, not getting into business school at all and losing out on the chance of getting $60k in my bank account before graduation.

Does anyone have any advice?  My position is a bit unique so any advice at all would be appreciated.  Thanks."

I love the business aspect of it, and I also love the technical, hands-on computer aspect of it as well.  Growing up, I was into HTML and CSS and had a basic understanding of how it worked.  I loved learning it and using it on my awesome pre-teen/teen blogs (I wish I still remembered the names of them, they're hilarious).  I know those probably won't be used in that major, but just a little background on me.  And if you're familiar with the Myers Briggs test, I tested as an INTJ, which I feel fits me perfectly. Down the line, I could see myself as some sort of analyst.  

My biggest fear is graduating with a degree that is worthless.  I've read that if you do go with an MIS degree, you should defiantly get an internship while in school.  What kind of internship would be best?  And are there courses or skills I should take to help with an MIS degree that aren't necessarily part of the program? Also, how are women viewed in this field?  As in, are there a lot of them?  Would it be harder for a women to get respect(for lack of a better word) from their peers/supervisors/etc?  From just experience already with technology, I feel a lot of people think I don't know what I'm talking about just because I'm a girl, and most girls ""don't know computers"".

Also, would a bachelors in MIS be useful? Or something more like accounting/computer science, then getting a masters in MIS?  I plan on getting my Masters in whatever degree I choose anyways.

My ideal career: A nice mix of working alone, and working with others.  A 9-5, M-F work week(or something similar).  I want to have a family one day, and I don't want to have to choose family or career.  I want something that's challenging, something that will also find fun though, so I don't mind taking classes and staying up to date as I get older.  I want something that pays well, and something that will be easy to find a job in."

My long-term professional goal is a career in natural language processing. This career will allow me to do what I find most fulfilling and satisfying in life; it will allow me to apply my analytical skills to solve complex real world problems. The &lt;school&gt; Computational Linguistics Master's program will ensure that I have the skills and experience required to achieve this goal.
My interest in linguistics derives from my love of solving puzzles. Picking apart and analyzing linguistic data to find patterns is like solving a verbal Rubik’s cube. A Rubik’s cube has over 432 quadrillion unique states, but any Rubik’s cube can be solved with an understanding of the patterns that govern its movement. Similarly, the complex surface variations of Language arise from simple underlying rules which can be deduced through careful analysis. I find it thoroughly satisfying to pick apart and explicitly describe these elegant linguistic processes that exist in my own unconscious mind. Through my undergraduate Linguistics courses I have learned how to think like a Linguist; how to analyze data, recognize patterns, and describe phenomena. I applied these skills in a syntax research project in which I provided arguments for the existence of null complementizers. Other projects of interest I completed include a description of Swedish phonology and a study of American dialect perceptions. My efforts have given me a broad and comprehensive understanding of Linguistics that will serve as a framework for my learning in Computational Linguistics.
My aptitude for solving analytical problems also precipitated my interest in Computer Science. Every assignment I was given during my programming classes presented me with a new puzzle to solve. After starting a project, I could not stop thinking about it until it was finished. It was not uncommon for me to wake up in the middle of the night with new ideas for optimizing my code. What I enjoyed most about my Computer Science courses was the sense of accomplishment I felt when my hard work resulted in a functioning application. I am now applying the skills I acquired in school to build ASP.NET web applications at my current internship with the tech company CodeSmart Inc. My ability to focus on implementing theoretical concepts into working programs will be crucial to my success in the &lt;school&gt; Master’s program.
So far my academic studies have only covered Linguistics and Computer Science separately, but I am most interested in the intersection of these two fields. In order to learn more about natural language processing, I recently began an internship with the developers of an iPhone application called Nuiku. The application acts as a virtual sales assistant, managing sales data through a natural language user interface. Helping to test the Nuiku natural language processing engine has opened my eyes to the immense potential Computational Linguistics has for practical applications. I am particularly interested in ways that natural language processing can improve search engines. Search engines serve as mediators between the user and all of the wealth of information on the internet. The large scale implementation of semantic categorization and information extraction will one day revolutionize the way we interact with information. This is one of the many ways in which natural language processing has the potential to empower users of the internet with better access to more useful information. I am a firm believer that knowledge is power. It is my dream to apply my practical problem solving skills to empower the average person with better access to the wealth of knowledge on the internet. I will do this through a career in natural language processing.
The &lt;school&gt; Computational Linguistics Master's program is the ideal means for me to achieve my career goal. No other program places the same level of importance on preparing its students for the challenges they will face in the industry. The curriculum promises to provide me with the knowledge base, practical experience, and relevant relationships necessary for success in my career.

18muvk,2,2013-02-16,Engineering: start-up or arbitrage in a hedge fund?,Laugarhraun,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/18muvk/engineering_startup_or_arbitrage_in_a_hedge_fund/,"Good morning,

I'm a French engineering student and I'll soon start working (in 1.5 months).The French cursus is a bit different than US ones. I have a strong background in math and in {electrical, electronic,energy,software} engineering.

I've had a bunch of interviews over the last weeks and I'm now at a crossroad: I have several propositions by startups (esp. working machine learning on recommendation engines), including full-time positions. I also have a few opportunities in finance, the most interesting being an internship in a hedge fund specialised in arbitrage on financial markets. This would include modelisation (using R and python) and conception of trading automatons, probably involving financial maths, machine learning and genetic algorithms.

I like maths and I love computer science.

Both companies would be around the same size at my arrival (~80 coworkers, but the hedge fund does not grow while it's the startup's goal).

Here is what makes me hesitate:

* should I take this 5-months internship when I'm offered full-time positions? (I'm not really in need of money right now though)
* what should I expect in terms of career &amp; wages evolution? In case of a full-time position (which should occur if my internship goes well), finance pays *a bit* better than software engineering the first years.
* finance → every day is suit day, startup → every day is pajamas day
* finance → 50 hours/week, no public holiday, startup → 40 hours/week
* if I do not enjoy working in finance I believe I'll be able to go back to a startup after any length of time. Is that right?

Did you have such a dilemma? What did you decide? What tips can you give me?

Thank you very much, and have a nice day!

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[What's your favorite meteor/meteorite occurrence in history that you find fascinating?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frxbm?context=5)|Ever heard of Antoine de Saint-Exupery, the man who wrote The Little Prince? In the '20s and '30s he was a French Aeropostale (air mail) pilot, flying wood-and-fabric airplanes to deliver the mail to far-flung corners of the world. He was once forced down on a small, high plateau in Africa by mechanical troubles. Stranded, he walked around the plateau. He noticed that the plateau was too tall to ever have been visited before, and that it was composed entirely of light-colored rocks. There in the moonlight, he found an odd, dark rock that had no place there. Saint-Exupery identified the rock as a meteorite, as the only way it arrived was from the canvas of stars above, ""just as a blanket spread under an apple tree receives only apples"". He went on to find three meteorites there in the darkness, and to identify them as such back in the 30's was quite the intellectual accomplishment.
[What is your favorite mind boggling scientific fact?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frtu1?context=5)|Stretch your arms all the way out, and let's imagine that the distance from one fingertip, across your body, and out to the other fingertip represents 4.5 billion years. That's the age of most meteorites. Now, take a nail file and make a single swipe across the fingernail on your middle finger. If the distance across your outstretched arms is 4.5 billion years, then with that nail file swipe you just erased ALL of recorded human history. But your average meteorite has been around for the entire outstretched-arms distance - for 4.5 billion years!
[About how often do meteors of about the same size as the one from today enter our atmosphere?  If Superman was out there patrolling the skies this morning, would he have been able to spot the incoming meteor in time to do something about it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frn5n?context=5)|Meteoroids (that is, a body smaller than as asteroid) of this size strike the Earth's atmosphere about once a decade or so. As for Superman, it would depend on how closely he was paying attention! I suspect that he would be watching out for us if he saw it coming.
[Where the Mayans off by 2 months or what?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frspp?context=5)|Heheheh  Meteors like today's must have occurred during Mayan times as well. You have to wonder what they must have thought about such events.
[How do scientists go about tracking meteors? How do some meteors pass through undetected? (Like the one in Russia\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frpjc?context=5)|Meteoroids and asteroids are tracked using optical telescopes and sometimes by radar, although scanning the entire sky with a radar wouldn't work to detect everything out there - the sky is just too big. Some meteoroids get by because they're too small and/or dark to be seen by optical telescopes.
[Too dark? Could you expand on that please? And does the 'and/or' mean that we could  have a massive but dark one which would still get past our monitoring?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fss0g?context=5)|Yes, too dark as in, the surface is nonreflective and black.  Like coal! Many asteroids contain a significant amount of carbon, and so they can be very dark to look at. Trying to find these ones against the black night sky is a challenge.  So with the and/or, I was trying to say that some are too small to spot until they get very close to us, and others are too dark to pick out against the night sky. And then some are both dark and small.
[How common is it for meteorites to contain radioactive or otherwise harmful material?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frua4?context=5)|Asteroids, meteoroids, and meteorites (rocks that actually reach the ground) are NOT radioactive. On Earth, rocks usually are radioactive if they are part of a radioactive element's ore. That requires the movement of a lot of hot water in the Earth's crust, and that process does not happen on asteroids. Meteorites are safe to handle.
[What dangers does a meteor of this size pose? Is this a rare event?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frple?context=5)|This event has done all the damage its going to do. It was too small to reach the ground without breaking up in the atmosphere, so it didn't create an explosion crater on the ground like that seen in Meteor Crater, Arizona. The damage in this event was caused by what is basically a powerful sonic boom, as the very fast meteoroid struck the Earth's atmosphere like a rifle bullet fired into a swimming pool.
[This is truly your day to shine!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frt9w?context=5)|Thank you! I like to see it as a great day for the average person to come in contact with planetary science. It's a wonderful research field.
[How big must a meteorite be to destroy say, an average house?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frt9w?context=5)|To destroy a house, a meteoroid would have to be even bigger than the event today in Russia. It would have to be large enough to reach the ground without slowing down to an aerodynamically-limited speed, and to strike the ground and cause a crater. With that said, falling meteorites can still cause damage. Look up the Lorton, VA meteorite fall from a few years back - a ~fist-sized meteorite plunged through the roof of a doctor's office, which was luckily unoccupied at the time.
[How big of a bomb would Bruce Willis have needed to blow up that metor?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frvcn?context=5)|Hm.  That's a tough one. Scientists are divided as to the best course to take to eliminate dangerous asteroids, and blowing them up may not be the best action. If we were to blow one up, however, I would approximate that your average non-thermonuclear warhead (tens of kilotons TNT yield) would be enough to completely disrupt the body from today's event. Bear in mind that that is a VERY rough guess, though!
[Did we have any advance notice that the asteroid/meteor that hit Russia was coming? -I also heard that the one flying by is worth $195 billion, is the one that hit Russia (or whats left of it\) worth anything near that amount you think? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frt62?context=5)|No we did not. This meteoroid, for as much damage as it did on the ground, was too small and/or too dark to be seen before it hit the atmosphere.
[Suppose that we have spotted a meteorite, that will inevitably collide with Earth in, let's say, a decade. It has a very high density so it's hard to destroy, it has a diametre of about 7 miles. In what way would it be possible to prevent the extinction of mankind? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frx3m?context=5)|The best option, if we had all options available, would be to have thriving human civilizations on multiple planets and moons. That way, even if some doom-rock of an asteroid were to cause a mass extinction, humanity would carry on. Bear in mind that this HAS happened on Earth before - notice that there aren't any dinosaurs roaming your neighborhood at the moment (other than birds, but that's another story).
[What is the largest misconception the public has about meteors, meteorites, or asteroids? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frwky?context=5)|Hm. Pick your favorite - that they're radioactive, flaming hot, show up unannounced on your lawn overnight, or bring hazardous bacteria to our planet. None of these things are true.
[But are used to make magical swords right?   ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fteui?context=5)|Heheh  There actually are daggers made out of meteorite metal, to include at least one in the Smithsonian's collection. To the best of my knowledge they don't glow when orcs are near, however.
[Any word yet on what type it is?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frlad?context=5)|I've seen pictures of a hole in an icy lake that seems to have been caused by a falling meteorite. The description in that article says there are small, dark stones 0.5 to 1 cm in size among the icy debris. That hints to me that this was a chondrite - a type of meteorite composed of stone and small bits of metal. We won't know exactly what kind until the fragments are examined by an expert.
[Wiki said meteorites are most likely to impact at 45 degrees. Why is that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frw2a?context=5)|Beats me.  Very few to none are going to strike perpendicular to the atmosphere, so I doubt the average is 45 degrees. Sounds like a mistake to me.
[Thank you so much for doing this! I keep hearing rumblings about the meteor that is going to passing over today closer than some of our satellites, but I haven't read anything recently about when it may be passing back around potentially even closer. Do we have anything to worry about?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frly6?context=5)|You're welcome! And no, we have nothing to worry about. The asteroid 2012 DA14 will pass very close to the Earth today, but scientists have been watching it for many months now and are confident that it will miss our planet. On the other hand, we get a close look at this interesting asteroid without having to pay for a space mission!
[So... do the exhibits come to life at night?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frrm9?context=5)|Only when I'm not watching, apparently.
[I have nothing to contribute other than I hope your nickname is ""Big"" and your middle name is ""And"".  So you would be 'Big' Marc and Fries.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fy592?context=5)|Two of the scientists I cross paths with regularly are named Burger and French. I'm dying to write a paper - ANY paper - with them just so that we'll have the French, Fries, and Burger paper. A Happy Meal of Science!!  whee.
[What is the smallest meteorite we are able to detect from space? What technology exists to stop meteors?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frwy4?context=5)|The smallest meteoroid? (A meteoroid is a small rock flying through space, and a meteorite is one that reaches the Earth's surface) I'm afraid I don't know exactly, but it will be about the size of the parent asteroid of Almahatta Sitta (AS). AS is a meteorite recovered from Sudan that was detected in space before it fell to Earth, so we knew when and where it was going to fall. It managed to get pretty close to Earth before it was seen, so that's probably the lower size limit for detection.
 |As for stopping them? We currently have NO defense against asteroids. If one were spotted on a collision course with Earth, we could make preparations on the ground but there is no real plan in place right now for dealing with it before it strikes our planet. My humble suggestion is to fix that little discrepancy...
[How did you become an expert in meteors and meteorites?   When did you first become interested in the field?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frwmt?context=5)|I still have a lot to learn, and I'll be working to correct that until I'm too feeble to pick up a book. But I was first interested very late into getting a Ph.D. in materials science. A friend of mine brought a funny rock into the laboratory and asked me to collect some spectra on it. He told me it was a meteorite and I tried to kick him out of the lab because I thought he was pulling my leg - only museums have meteorites, after all! Turns out I was wrong on both counts. It WAS a meteorite called Portales Valley, and meteorites are actually very easy to come by, and are wonderful in the sense that they are ancient relicts of the formation of our Solar System that you can actually hold in your hand. I examined the meteorite for him and was spellbound by this incredible rock, which was unlike anything I'd ever seen. I was hooked, and have been studying them ever since.
[Why do meteors explode? Aren't they just large pieces of space rock that is heated up when entering the atmosphere?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frwyu?context=5)|They explode because they strike the atmosphere at very high velocity. Meteoroids are moving between ~10 and 80, even 100 km/s when they hit the top of the Earth's atmosphere. At those speeds, meeting the atmosphere is a pretty brutal event. It's like doing a belly flop into a swimming pool - sure, the water is nice and liquid and squishy, but if you hit it hard and slow down quickly, it's gonna hurt!  In a meteoroid's case, that belly flop into the atmosphere occurs at speeds high enough to turn solid rock into a superheated gas, and quickly enough to slow down from 10s of kilometers per second to tens of meters per second, all in only a few seconds' worth of blazing fireball.
[How often do people come to you with chunks of things like hematite or other oddly shaped mineral deposits and ask you if they are from space?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frp8f?context=5)|All the time! I enjoy it, actually. Most rocks that people bring to me are not meteorites, but I'm happy to show them what a real meteorite looks like and offer advice on how to find them.
[What are the chances of a meteorite smashing and destroying the earth?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fru0e?context=5)|The chances of physically destroying the Earth are vanishingly small. About 4 billion years ago, the Earth was struck by an approximately Mars-sized body and the resulting collision produced our Moon. Even then the Earth survived, and today there are no large bodies in irregular orbits that could reproduce that event. But if you mean an asteroid large enough to cause extinctions, the chances are very small. ...but not zero. Bear in mind this exact thing happened 65 million years ago with the Chixulub impact which played a major role in wiping out the dinosaurs.
[How would you compare the asteroid that hit Russia and the one that's going to miss the earth by about 15,000 miles?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frwqz?context=5)|We saw one coming, and missed the other entirely!  :-)
 |Seriously, we'll know more about both when we A) get pieces of the Russian meteorite into a laboratory, and B) get a good look at the near-miss asteroid later today.
[Where can one keep updated on such things? Normally this sort of thing is all over the internet/news for a day or 2 then seems to disappear! I find it fascinating too, and would love to know more about it after testing. Very jealous of your job, keep up the good work!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fstzh?context=5)|For meteors in the United States, I suggest the American Meteor Society's web page: amsmeteors.com.
 |There are websites for the various astronomy organizations who are watching for Earth-crossing asteroids as well, but I'm afraid I don't know them off-hand. A web search will get you there, though. Search for ""near Earth objects"" or something along those lines.
[Is the Russia meteor the same one the news said was going to pass between the moon and earth?  or something completely different? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frvxq?context=5)|We don't know yet.  The best way to find out will be to compare the trajectories of the two bodies and see if they are similar. At this point, we don't know enough about the trajectory of the Russian bolide. (A bolide is a very bright meteor that includes a detonation event)
[How does the angle at which a meteor strikes the earth affect its destructive force? For example, had this meteor entered our atmosphere at a shallower angle could it have exploded with more force like the one over Siberia a century ago? Or if it had come straight in, would it have struck harder, therefore resulting in a bigger blast on the ground?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fs2vt?context=5)|Ah, physics!  We love physics. The infall angle is one of the factors in destructive force. An asteroid plunging straight into the atmosphere MIGHT have a better chance of reaching the ground than one that enters at a glancing angle, but it depends strongly on the velocity, mass, and mechanical strength of the asteroid. The meteoroid that struck today would not have reached the ground in any event; it was too small.
 |With that said, some of the PIECES of today's Russian event probably reached the ground, but only as free-falling rocks and not screamingly-fast cosmic bullets.
[What about this particular meteroite was so different when it made the news? If they happen every ten years or so, why is it such a huge ordeal? The media plays it up to seem as if this is a once in a lifetime thing. But I don't recall anything ten or so years ago about a meteorite like this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fsbjb?context=5)|In a word, it was BIG. That, and people got hurt. Take your average everyday event and find a version of it where people have to visit the hospital, and you've probably got a news item.  And there have been several very large events like this over the past few decades. Another very large one was several years ago over Indonesia (and mostly over water). It didn't make YouTube, so it was overlooked. There was another one over India/Pakistan a while back during a particularly tense period in their relationship, but that was over a rather remote area if I recall correctly.
[(Also, unrelated, but I'm starting an internship with the Smithsonian in a couple weeks, what are some fun things to do in the DC area?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fsbjb?context=5)|As for DC - go ride the Metro and watch the people. It is a train ride, an underground excursion, and a circus all in one.
[Due to this unexpected event in Russia, myself and several others I'm sure, are curious as to how safe we really are from space? And what precautions are being taken to ensure all dangerous space projectiles are spotted and accounted for?  Have there been any instances where rare Earth metals have crashed and been recovered for use here?  How large of an asteroid would it take to guarantee all life intelligent on Earth be destroyed?  Has your knowledge in this particular field ever had you wondering how we haven't been blown to kingdom come yet?  What's the most bizarre thing you've encountered in your line of work?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fs49j?context=5)|Oh boy...  I'd love to answer all of these but there are a lot of unanswered questions I'd like to get to. Let's see... I've answered the first one already, so I'll answer the second one here. There are no ""new"" elements in meteorites, in the sense that there's nothing in there that we haven't seen on Earth already. That makes sense, because fundamentally the Earth and asteroids were all originally assembled from the same cloud of dust that gas that swirled around our Sun some 4.5+ billion years ago. There are a few unusual new minerals in meteorites, however, and that's a consequence of their formation under chemical conditions that are unlikely on Earth. They were then protected from wind and rain by ...well, the fact that there are neither wind nor rain on asteroids! Kinda convenient, that.
[Are you trackin, gang? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frsw1?context=5)|Papa Whiskey, what's your position?
[It was reported that the meteorite today exploded while it was still in the air. Why did it not crash into earth as one, flaming ball? If I heard right it created a sonic boom when it exploded.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frxh3?context=5)|It lost the battle between mass and air pressure. The air pressure it experienced upon striking the atmosphere started breaking it up, and it wasn't massive enough to shrug off the damage and plunge into the ground. So it broke up between ~50 and ~20 km above the ground. If it were larger, it might have survived the trip to the ground and formed an explosion crater. As it is, the damage it could cause was pre-programmed into it by its size.
[Did the whole meteor break up into smaller pieces during entry? Or was there a larger piece that impacted?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fryus?context=5)|Most of the meteoroid was destroyed - the bright part of the fireball was basically the process of turning stone into gas. But some of it - a small fraction of the original mass - almost certainly survived to reach the ground as meteorites.
[Is global warming responsible for the Russian meteor incident?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frseg?context=5)|Nope.  The two are completely unrelated.
[How is the search conducted to find the bits that fell to earth (falls\)?  Follow-up: If I find one, do I get to keep/sell it or am I supposed to turn it in somewhere?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fs2j0?context=5)|The science/art of finding meteorites includes assembling eyewitness accounts, some trigonometry-heavy analysis of videos and pictures to re-create the path of the body, and some physics-based calculations of the expected flight paths of falling meteorites. Or, you get lucky and someone saw where they landed! As for keeping them, that depends on the law of the land where you found the thing. Some US agencies like the BLM are forward-thinking enough to have policies in place on what you can keep for yourself. Some countries, by contrast, have very restrictive policies and as a result the meteorites in those countries tend to rot into the ground, lost to science forever.
[What sized near-Earth asteroids/meteoroids is it currently possible to track with the systems nowadays in place? It seems this Chelyabinsk event caught everyone by surprise and wasn't on anyone's proverbial or literal radar...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frz4m?context=5)|The best tool in use is the optical telescope. We have radars, but there's simply too much space out there to effectively scan it all, given current equipment and funding. Many amateur astronomers contribute to this effort.
[Can you hooked me up with an internship on the anthro side?  Serious question: What is the most interesting thing to you that has been found/learned from meteorites.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8frzbi?context=5)|The most interesting thing is basically that our Solar System is composed of many bodies, all orbiting the Sun and still running into each other even today. Before a few prominent meteorite falls a few centuries ago, this fact that we take for granted today was not commonly accepted. In ancient times, meteorites were explained as rocks ejected by distant volcanoes or ejected from caves! I'm glad we got that straightened out.
[If a large meteor impact was immenent, could we actually do anything about it?  Would we blow it to tiny pieces, or somehow split it into 2 large pieces whose trajectory would miss the earth.  If a dinosaur-extincting size meteor was on the way, could the government somehow keep it secret and only the privileged get into the shelters?  Or is it easy enough to spot these meteors such that your local university would see it and spill the beans?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fs7zm?context=5)|There are a variety of plans floated about for dealing with dangerous asteroids...  Blowing them to fragments is certainly an option, although there's some discussion as to just how possible and/or preferable that option is. (As a former Marine myself, I REALLY like the idea! hehe) Other plans include painting one or more sides of it and letting sunlight push it away from us. That sounds insane, but it really is an option - physics gives it a thumbs-up. There's also the option of putting some sort of engine on the thing and thrusting it away from us. The thing is, NONE of these options are currently available. All current nuclear-tipped missiles on Earth are designed to go from one spot on the planet directly to another, and don't even make it to Earth orbit much less a distant asteroid. The only plan we currently have available is to make disaster-preparation plans on Earth.  As for keeping it quiet, personally I think the notion of conspiracy is to antithetical to human nature to work well. People love to blab. But that's a discussion for another venue.
[How long until we start collecting raw materials from space?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fshn8?context=5)|The planet already is, in a sense. Some 40,000 tons (give or take) of meteorites fall to Earth every year. As for mining asteroids and such, that is a VERY difficult endeavor and I'm skeptical that it will be practical any time soon. But we should start NOW, or we never will.
[Why do these objects ""explode"" at a certain altitude, rather than slowly burning up little by little to nothing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fs1xu?context=5)|It lost the battle between mass and air pressure. The air pressure it experienced upon striking the atmosphere started breaking it up, and it wasn't massive enough to shrug off the damage and plunge into the ground.

[Does the phrase ""meteoric rise"" when used to describe someone who has obtained some sort of fame frost your cookies?  \[it does mine.\]  They actually fall from the sky burning in flames if I remember correctly.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fs56m?context=5)|I'm convinced that the English language was invented pretty much to befuddle anyone who didn't grow up with it. But then, I suppose one could have a ""meteoric FALL"", too, which is a pretty dramatic descriptor.
[I'm a geology major and I want to go into planetary geology. Do you have any suggestions or tips for me?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fshhv?context=5)|Talk to lots of people.  LOTS of people - professors, other students, scientists, grad students. More than you think you need to. Ask anything and everything you can think of - they'll either help you, or you didn't really want their advice anyways because they suck. Research the schools that do the sorts of things that interest you, and talk to people there. Form a plan, but be willing to change it as you go. Try lots to things in order to figure out what you love to do, and then do that.
[How different do meteorites tend to be in composition from one to another?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fsm32?context=5)|Great question! There are iron meteorites, which are formed when molten iron-nickel coalesced into the infernal core of a larger body, then that body was broken up to scatter its iron heart through the cosmos. (I've been writing for a few hours now and I'm waxing poetic!) Then there are ""stony"" meteorites composed mostly of silicates, either from small bodies that never got hot enough to form a liquid, metallic core, or from the metal-depleted surfaces of those bodies. Then there's the carbonaceous meteorites, which contain - you guessed it - a large amount of carbonaceous material. That's the simple version. There are dozens of types of meteorites, from asteroids, comets (maybe) and even other planets. There are some whose origins are still mysteries, as well.
[Hi, thanks for doing an AMA.  One question:  How big do you think the meteorite that just hit Russia was before it hit our atmosphere? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fsjfs?context=5)|My pleasure! I've heard numbers from 10 to 50 tons pre-atmosphere, but we don't have enough info in hand to really tell yet. My estimate lies towards the top end of that range, but we need to know what kind of meteorite it is and how much power the fireball generated.
[Why do they always fall in Russia? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fsipd?context=5)|GREAT QUESTION. They have some sort of national meteorite greed over there! Seriously, there were four meteorite falls in the US last year. Two in California, one in Nevada, and one in Alabama. Meteorites were recovered from all of these events.
[I've heard that the event in Russia has nothing to do with the huge meteor that's passing by us... how can that be true? It seems like a big coincidence.

We will be able to answer that question when we know the trajectory of the Russian object, and can compare it against the trajectory of the near-miss asteroid. I understand that Phil Plait of Bad Astronomy was hinting that the two events are unrelated, and so was the NASA Space Environment Office. But I retain a healthy degree of uncertainty at this point. :-) &lt;snip&gt;
[What made you interested in meteors/ meteorites?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fsko2?context=5)|Had a buddy bring one into the lab one day, when I was finishing up my degree (of course! bad timing). After I stopped trying to throw him out of the lab because I thought he was pulling my leg, I was fascinated by the Portales Valley meteorite he had and was hooked on meteorite research. I then served as a post-doctoral student at the Carnegie Institution of Washington. The Carnegie is a wonderfully permissive laboratory where research is involved, allowing and encouraging the scientists to follow their interests. I was able to start studying meteorites in earnest, and have been doing it ever since.
[If there was a huge meteorite hurtling towards earth that would cause significant damage to society or completely wipe out civilization, would astronomers tell us ahead of time? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fs9ga?context=5)|Would the astronomers?

Why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fsln4?context=5)|Not necessarily. Impact craters like Meteor Crater in Arizona require an object to hit the ground, making a big hole and flinging debris over a large area. If the same amount of energy were dissipated into the atmosphere by an airburst, you'd still get tremendous damage but no hole in the ground. There are a few cases where this apparently happened and left great quantities of molten glass, called tektites. But both types of events are very destructive in their own way.
[About how many joules of energy does a meteorite coming into the Earth's atmosphere produce?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lakm/iama_smithsonian_meteorite_scientist_ask_me/c8fsf6p?context=5)|Depends on the mass and velocity of the meteoroid. The vast majority of meteors are caused by tiny (sand-grain sized), fast-moving (30+ km/s) little fragments, and many of those aren't even powerful enough to be seen with the naked eye.

I'm inclined to believe a number towards the upper end of that range. We won't know for certain until we find out what kind of meteorite it is composed of (by finding pieces) and by measuring the total power of the meteor (e.g. from seismometers, the same as measuring the Richter scale number of an earthquake).

His estimates also state that the pre-atmospheric size of the meteoroid was roughly 15m in diameter. Compare that to 2012 DA14 passing by the Earth later today, which is twice that diameter! Now imagine what would happen if THAT one were to strike us...
[The 'darkness' of a rock out in space is called its albedo, which tells you how much light it reflects. It if has a really low albedo, it means the surface material doesn't reflect much of the sun's light, so it's difficult to see out in space.

Basically, once you measure the angles in the pictures and videos and locate the spot where the pics were taken, it is a matter of trigonometry. You re-assemble the 3D path of the meteor from the various images. From there, you will get an idea of where any meteorites landed.  Yay, science!

In the next few months I will finish a Bachelor's degree in software engineering and want to try to find an entry level java or sql programming position with my ultimate end goal as being a database administrator. I figured my best chance at being a DBA was to become a developer first and then make the move over. 

To get the current position I have, I had to do an internship in order to get experience. Now, I am older and don't have the ability to an internship due to finances. Will I be able to land a job as an entry level developer somewhere? Or will I have to have an extensive profile of work on somewhere like github? Any advice is appreciated.

Since I've had the opportunity to teach future software engineers at my old university and since I am now helping interns in my company, I have started to write articles with dozens of screenshots and explanations about the various features that Eclipse can provide you with while you are developing a Java application.

While learning to code, people are mostly taught about the language and the popular frameworks but not that much about the tools that they will use to code. So I've created those articles to help you master Eclipse for Java development.

Starting slowly with the details about the creation and organization of your project, those articles move later on the feature available to code your Java application. Then I talk about how to configure properly your Eclipse in order to let it help you or even handle most of the boring work for you. Finally, I conclude with a presentation of the various refactoring and debugging tools embedded in Eclipse.

I have intentions to move to her city when my internship ends in October.
Recently she met a new coworker and has been hanging out with him almost every day since. I've met the guy once when I visited last and he's a really nice guy but other than that, I don't know him very well. He's a fairly attractive looking guy and he's single.

This week she told me that she's stayed over at his place (alone) a couple of times after nights of drinking and being 'too drunk to drive home'. On the first occasion she asked if it was ok, and I said yes because I definitely didn't want her to drive drunk. I've since discovered that she's stayed at his place multiple times in a single week after more nights of drinking alone with him.

I do trust her around other guys but I know first hand that people make mistakes when there is alcohol involved. She's never lied about it but she hasn't been extremely open or direct about it either. She usually drops it casually in a conversation the next day saying things like ""oh I just crashed at _____'s place""

Questions:

1. Would you be upset if you were in this situation?
2. When I talk to her about how uncomfortable that situation makes me feel, what kind of response should I expect to receive from her?

For the last few months of 2012 I worked a full-time, 3-month, internship doing a pretty niche job that I absolutely loved  (I am an unemployed graduate previously in crappy min wage jobs so I took it to gain some office/'real job' skills, and never expected to enjoy the substance of the work as much as I did). I have since been out of work for a couple of months and have been unsuccessfully seeking another 'real job' in any sector that will take me.

The same company that I worked for has recently advertised for a position that is essentially my internship, plus a few additional responsibilities. Due to my previous experience I believe that I would be a strong candidate, however, the catch is that the job is only part-time and lasts for only 2.5 years. If it were full-time and permanent it would be the dream first 'real' job, but it isn't, so there you go. However, I am still considering applying for it.

Like I said, I loved the job, but there are some clear downsides to applying for it on this basis. The job was pretty niche, and as a career it is only as enjoyable when working for a company with the most interesting projects (i.e. good jobs in the sector are very few and far between). It is almost inevitable that I will face another stretch of unemployment afterwards or face potential relocation across the country to do the same job for a less interesting business. I will also have to find a second part-time job to supplement my income; this may be tough in this economy and there may be logistical problems in balancing two part-time jobs.

Alternatively, there *may* be networking opportunities, the contract *may* be extended (the job is key to the business and will probably still be required in some form in 2.5 years) and, because it's part-time, other jobs/volunteering opportunities may prepare me better for the job market in future. The skills are transferable to an extent.

As a graduate I have had a tough time in the job market over the last few years and it seems silly to stop seeking my first stable, full-time job to pursue something that may be unsustainable long term. However, it seems equally silly to avoid a job that I actually enjoy in favour of a full-time 'real' job that may be months/years away in the current economy. 

Has anyone dealt with this before? Should I be more focused on sorting my graduate employment problems short-term, as opposed to potentially stretching them out into my later 20s through short-sighted decisions (I'm 24 now)?

Any advice welcome!



TLDR; opportunity to continue a job that I love part-time with a questionable career future or should I hold out for something full-time and permanent but, perhaps, with less job satisfaction?"

I gained gained all of my colleagues and customers appreciation. I was always willing to help. If I was stressed I would hide it, because I really enjoyed working with my customers to solve their computing issues. I only left the job so I could focus on getting my transfer degree in a shorter amount of time. Beginning in Fall, I will look for a similar role and take night classes to work toward my Bachelors. I think I want to stay in the desktop role the though. Sure, it doesn't pay a sys admin's salary but it's enough for me to have a life outside of work and put food on the table.

**tl;dr**

I really love desktop work, particularly in fast paced environments where I can do some leg work. Would holding the desktop role for my whole career be suicidal? I feel an aversion to becoming a network / system admin...seems really stressful and complicated.

I really want to go to grad school for Industrial engineering or Systems engineering, I find both fascinating and complementary. I know I have waited to long, but I'm just starting to send applications to certain schools. 
The reason why I didn't send applications before is because I didn't think my grades were good enough. I have a 3.6 GPA, but a 4.0 in the Comp Sci major. I'm minoring in Math, Physics, and Economics.
In addition I had an internship over the last summer, along with an IT job for 3 years at the school I go.
I recently took the GRE and I got a somewhat low score in english (mainly because it is not my first language). In verbal I got 151, and in math I got 161. I just learned that those scores are not too bad, so I finally decided to go ahead and apply to grad school.

I have a student visa, and I'm really looking for ideas to places where I can go either to continue my studies or to get an internship as a computer programmer. I'm scared that, if I don't get accepted, I will have no other choice but to go back to my country were my chances of getting a good job are very slim.

I'm just the average Joe who got into a Computer Science degree (Technical degree, not really sure of the equivalences, a 3-year university degree quite similar to the ""superior"" degree) because I wanted to make video games. Although I really loved the coding (And design) related courses, I got a bit unlucky due personal issues and took way too long to finish the degree, as I ended it with 27 years.

I started the search for some work and things got messy. I managed to score an internship for a big company, only that in their IT department. The position was advertised to me as a more coding-related position (Not exactly ""developing"", but with chances of get dirty with code), and, given the lack of any other offer as a programmer, I accepted. I have spent over 6-8 weeks there and, besides some small scripting work, I haven't written a single line of ""serious"" code.

So doubts arise. I'm now 27, I have some small personal projects going on which I develop on mi scarce spare time, and I don't really know if the pros of the position (The place is great, the coworkers are really smart people, I'm learning a lot of new stuff, the company really cares for its employees -even the interns-, having a big name in the CV...) over weighs the cons (The STRONG feeling that I'm getting too old to start a successful career as a programmer and that it will be harder for me when I end the internship, the fact that time spent there is time not spent programming, the doubt that anything that I do here will ever be useful on a programming career, the fact that I don't really like the job...) 
Right now I don't really know if I can take it easy and enjoy the ride until it ends (""I'm being impatient"") and put it in my CV or jump through the window in mid transit and search for other opportunities (""I'm being realistic"") as this is going nowhere (besides me being older).

So.. any advice, Reddit?"
18u4ja,72,2013-02-19,Advice to aspiring web developers,aquilaFiera,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/18u4ja/advice_to_aspiring_web_developers/,"Here are some tidbits that I've found successful in my career as a web developer. I'm only about five years in the field, but I've been pretty successful. I certainly can discuss my credentials if you wish, but that's not what I want to dwell on.

1. College degrees are far from a requirement. Development and in particular web development is very much a meritocracy: those who are good do well and those who don't sink. As someone who has done hiring, I looked more favorably on one year of professional web development than any four year degree. A degree *will* help get you interviews but little more than that. I am not at all implying degrees are not helpful, particularly if you want to do some of the more specialized types of applications like natural language processing, machine learning, or Bayesian analysis. Even then, with some spare time and a desire to learn you can do those too.
2. A good place to start is HTML and CSS. Too many web devs can't do CSS worth a damn. Both of them are pretty easy to wrap your mind around and pretty essential in my opinion. After getting a firm grasp, then I'd move to more server-side learning. I personally started in PHP and was happy to have done so. I think it's among the easiest to pick up. As far as a first database, I'd say start with MySQL. You'd be hard pressed to find any major app that doesn't use MySQL in at least some minor way. Be sure not to neglect JavaScript either. One of my former colleagues made a very astute observation that knowing JavaScript will likely make you the most money. First because no matter the back-end language, you're always going to be using JavaScript on the front-end and with node.js occasionally on the back-end. And secondly, they're just aren't as many good JS devs as there are jobs for them.
3. Keep your LinkedIn up to date. I can't tell you how many awesome opportunities I've gotten because of this. It's not just Joe's Dev Shack in Timbuktu that's calling (though he does call), but cool new start-ups and cool tech-giants calling too. I've interviewed with Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Tesla Motor Company, SpaceX, Amazon, and some other really cool companies. Where did they all find me? LinkedIn. Every time.
4. Going back to experience, open-source work does indeed substitute for real job experience. I'm not great at this because I don't contribute regularly to any particular open-source project, but I have hired based on it. Contract work (as in small, one-off jobs for Consuela's Maid Service made in Wordpress in a week) does not substitute. I rarely bring those up, if ever, in a professional interview.
5. Look for internships if you can't get a junior position. Maybe the pay isn't great, but the experience and the résumé material is far, far more valuable than any sum of money they could offer you.
6. When you do get hired somewhere, find somewhere where there is a deficiency of knowledge and become an expert in it. At one of my companies, we were going forward with the idea of using MongoDB as the database. The issue was that none of the devs had any experience using it. These are opportunities to make yourself indispensable to your company. I went on a weekend coding bender and built an entire app using MongoDB and by the end I was pretty proficient at it. By the end of my tenure with the company, I was still known as the MongoDB guy.
7. Keep up to date on new technologies. Occasionally have a weekend when you lock yourself in a room and build a whole new app just to learn a new technology. When I got one of my jobs, I didn't know the back-end language of what was being used there. However, the weekend previous I had just gone on a node.js bender (despite the fact that it really had little to do with the then-present job.) That fact that I showed I picked up on a new language over a weekend was enough to convince him that I would have little issue working in a new language. In extension, always be tinkering on your own. I've had so many positive experiences that way and learned a lot. Apps don't have to make you money. If you learn something while making it, that's an investment that will pay off later.

That's all I got off the top of my head. From the other grizzled dev-veterans, what tips can you offer to have a successful career in web development? What do you wish you had known beforehand? 

**TL;DR**: Be a web dev. It's super rad."

Just last night, I tried to beat my boyfriend up. I punched walls until my knuckles were bleeding. I threw my phone, multiple pieces of furniture, and hid in a corner banging my head against the wall. This is even harder to admit but I have done self harm (cutting) and woke up not knowing what I had done. I hate it.

I cannot stop. I cannot stop. I want to so bad and it just gets worse. I really do not remember everything I do. It is terrible and I am ashamed.

I cannot focus in school. My boyfriend is afraid of me. My mother is miserable.

I am miserable. 

I have hidden it from my friends and family but they can now tell something is wrong. I have fully admitted that I have a problem but no one knows what to do. I have always been angry but over the past six months, my anger has become another person.

As a broke, college student without insurance, I am so lost. 

I have been to a free weekly therapy session through my university. It only helps so much. My therapist/counselor is an intern and unsure what to do with me. She is kind but I can tell I overwhelm her.

I do not know whether I need therapy or a complete brain transplant. My mother believes I have a hormone imbalance. She thinks it is something biological. My boyfriend and intern therapist think I have just held in too much and now it has exploded.

This angry person is not me. She is the cruel She Hulk. I cannot control her anymore. 



My questions:

* Should I see a doctor, therapist, hormone doctor or someone else?

* Is there anyone out there with this kind of crazy, uncontrollable hulk anger? What helps you?

* Does anyone out there have a hormone imbalance and receive shots? Have you behaved in this hulk-manner?

* **What do I do?**

I recently graduated from college a couple months ago with a B.S. degree in EE. I'm currently searching for hardware engineer/EE positions and have been applying for posted positions on company websites and on LinkedIn. I even tried putting my resume on job sites like Monster and CareerBuilder, but I've only been getting phony sales/recruiting job offers via email and phone. So far, I haven't had any luck. 

In terms of waiting time, a website once told me that 40 days after the original job posting, if you don't hear back from the job, then it's safe to assume that the position has been filled (or no longer available). **What's a good rule of thumb when applying for jobs to safely assume that the position is no longer available?** I keep hearing different things. What about applying to jobs and internships on LinkedIn? I have a well-polished profile and a decent amount of connections which are mostly classmates, friends, and family. I heard that recruiters browse around on LinkedIn a lot and they usually look for those with recommendations. I know it's helpful to have them, but is it really needed?

I also heard that in order to get the first job, you must have experience, which most people get from internships/co-ops while they're still in school. Since I'm a couple months out of school, do I still have a chance of getting an internship after college? I heard that they usually only want college students with 3.00+ for internships. I'm aware that around this time is internship application season and I've applied to a couple internships. However, only one of them replied asking for my GPA, which isn't that impressive (2.77/4.00). **How do I get a post-college internship with such a GPA?** I feel embarrassed and awkward to put it on my resume or even mention it. However, if I don't put it on, it'll be assumed that my GPA is even worse than it actually is. Besides my poor GPA, I have nothing else to hide.

18wm63,1,2013-02-20,Former soldier / Columbia student looking to pick up an engineering major: Advice Requested!,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/18wm63/former_soldier_columbia_student_looking_to_pick/,"Hey folks,

I’m currently in my junior year as an economics major at Columbia University and am planning to pursue my school’s combined degree program with SEAS starting next year. Unfortunately, one of the aspects of the combined program is that I must choose an engineering major in advance and do not have an opportunity to change majors once I make my selection.

To that end, I was hoping I could get some of your opinions about what path I should pursue. The two majors I am currently most drawn to are Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering, but that is not to say I’m not interested in other fields as well. The only majors I’m really not terribly interested in are Applied Math/Physics, Civil, Environmental, and Financial.

For a little background about me, after high school I served 5 years in the Army as an infantryman, radio-telephone operator, and drone pilot. I’ve been at Columbia for the past two and a half years, and had originally planned to work in finance upon graduation, but after experiencing the industry through recent internships I’ve realized that I’m not at all interested in the work.  

It would probably help to list some of my motivations for studying engineering in the first place, so below is a very non-exhaustive list of my interests:

Augmented Reality,
Automation,
Artificial Intelligence,
Cloud Computing,
Educational Technology,
Human-Computer Interaction,
Information Science,
Materials,
Powered Exoskeleton,
Prosthetics,
Weaponry

I suppose the common thread here (besides my status as a Heinlein enthusiast) is that I’m interested in making individuals more productive through the applications of technology.

I know that there isn’t a ton of demand for people to work in some of these fields, and I am definitely concerned about “real job” prospects upon graduation.

Thanks for your help!"
18wl12,5,2013-02-20,A new type of suicidal thoughts,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/18wl12/a_new_type_of_suicidal_thoughts/,"First off, might as well give some basic information. I'm 21 and I've been plagued with these thoughts since I was in my early teens. I've been through years of therapy, tonnes of different anti-depressants and anti-psychotics, none of it really seemed to help that much at all. I've just learned to live with it. Even after going through all these different professionals I've still never been properly diagnosed as having anything other than a slight anxiety disorder. 

I do like therapy though, it's nice to have that, but since I'm out of work for the next month or so, I'm out of therapy until I get my insurance back and I haven't been on any pills for over a year now.

In the past I used to idealize suicide as an escape from the pain and monotony of living, but lately it has become a much more intriguing idea. Nothing is necessarily wrong in my life, in fact things are going pretty well. I hang out with my friends as much as I can, I'm doing well in my college courses, I have two possible internships lined up for the summer, I go back to work in a month or so as I previously stated, and lately I've been hooking up with this girl every other weekend or so when we both are free. Despite all this I still constantly live with these suicidal thoughts.

They just seem to be there, as they've always had. The more I think about them, the more interesting it seems to actually go through with it. I honestly just want these thoughts to stop. Everything is perfect and I hate it because at the end of the day I still wish to not wake up the next day. I exercise frequently, I eat healthily, but I do smoke cigarettes and drink. I do not know if that's a contributing factor, honestly it's been something that I've picked up in the last year and a half to help pass the time and help cope with the stresses of juggling relationships with friends and family, work, and college courses. 

In short I want to commit suicide as an escape from having suicidal thoughts rather than as an escape from living and I have never experienced this before. I do not know what to do. Maybe it's because I have too much free time now, maybe it'll go away for a little while when I go back to work, but I highly doubt it'll go away fully. 24 hours is a lot of time and I try to use it as to the best of my ability with reading, exercise, writing, Netflix, video games, school work, classes, hanging out with people, but no matter how I do I'm still left alone with these thoughts and I'm getting sick of it. It's as though I don't know how to be happy."

I'm very flexible with the price and parts, so critique would help.",Nohomobutimgay,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/18wjrc/build_help_heres_an_almostcomplete_gaming_rig_im/,"Greetings. I'm looking to build an overclocked gaming rig that will also be used for programming and modeling, and of course internet browsing and media streaming.

Here is what I am going for:

* **Purpose:** *Gaming*--Skyrim, BF3, Crysis 3, blah blah blah all the good ones--on Ultra-high settings, or as close to it as possible; *programming and modeling*--engineering simulation programs for research; *entertainment* system in general--I'll be off on an internship for 8 months, so I'm looking to add a sound system for music and movies. The monitor will be my screen for movies, gaming, and my PS3.
* **Where?** I'm in the US, not by a Microcenter
* **Budget:** This is flexible, so I'll just put the budget at $1200. If you feel it's necessary, bump it up or bring down the price if it's possible.
* **What I need:** Keyboard and mouse, optical drive (with Blu-ray capability preferably), fans (fans fans fans!), wireless card, upgrade-able to watercooling in the future, possible addition of a second monitor in the future (so probably a second GPU to go with), a sturdy-looking case (get that Phantom crap out of my face), some color coordination with the parts--though I don't really care to make it look like a nightclub in my room with a bunch of LEDs 
* **What I have:** Monitor ([ASUS VH238H 23-Inch 1080P LED](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004J6BIJ8/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)) and Win8 OS

I'm not committed to any parts, so please feel free to form and mold the design to how you see fit. The mobo says Microcenter below, but I'm going to go with Amazon. Let me know what you think. I appreciate your help.

18wckm,49,2013-02-20,Something is in my room.,GoldenCoin,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/18wckm/something_is_in_my_room/,"I have always been known for my creativity and my fantasy. When I was little, my fantasy used to spread around me at night or whenever I was bored. It was fun because I didn't have many friends to play with, but now it's killing my sanity. Sometimes when I look around I see dark spots or figures, I thought that it was because my eyes weren't clear any more so I shrugged this off.

Whenever I can't sleep I like to look around in my room or outside the window. I like how there's little to no light, but you can still make out the shapes and silhouettes of your possessions. How you can easily put a hand in front of your face and make that little bit of light ""Disappear"". Since some time I had some weird moments at night.

I would hear things fall from my desk. I first thought it was because of the fact that it was right under my bed, I sleep in a high sleeper, but I could never find what had fallen onto the ground. One time I heard one of my pencil jars fall, I got out of bed and turned on the light. There was nothing on the floor, my jar of pencils was sitting perfectly on my desk far away from the edge. I shrugged it off and went back to bed, it was too late to even deal with that. But now it started to get worse. My mom usually wakes me up in the weekends. I heard her once asking me kindly to get out of bed. I told her that I would be downstairs in a minute. I stayed in bed for a little longer before deciding to get out. I had a strange feeling that morning, but couldn't put my finger on it. On my way down my mother came up. ""Oh, you're awake, I was just about to wake you up!"" She smiled and went back down. She was planning on waking me, strange, she had just been in my room. That's when it hit me. I didn't hear her opening and closing my door. After breakfast I asked her if she had been in my room and was just messing with me on which she replied: ""No, I was here packing out the groceries."" I was confused and slightly disturbed, but shrugged it off anyway. This happened a few times more and then stopped.

Today it happened again. I woke up and checked the time. 5:40 AM. I turned around in my bed and before I could close my eyes again, I heard something. ""Are you coming?"" It was my sister's voice. I remembered that mom had asked her if she wanted to come with her to work, but that she had to wake up around 5:30 AM to do so. I turned around to tell her that I didn't had to wake up until an hour later, but there was nothing in my room. I heard my sister loud and clear as if she was standing just next to my bed, yet I was looking around in my room and nobody was there. 

I could make out the shapes of a chair with a pile of clothing, my small closet on which my aquarium stands, my fan and my desk chair. Again I got an eerie feeling, but went to bed anyway. I kept on thinking about it, when mom picked me up from the station I told her that I had heard my sister in my room around the time that she wakes up. Mom told me that my sister hadn't come with her since it was too early for her. 
At home my mom asked my sister who got confused. ""Could it be that I was sleepwalking?"" ""Well I turned and look in my room and-"" ""And? Was I standing there?"" ""No. There was nothing in my room."" My sister looked weird and confused, but we didn't talk about it any more and mom laughed it off telling me that I was just dreaming of my sister. I went back to my room and I probably wont be able to have a good night's rest. I am certain something was in my room. I know something was in my room. I know this, because I saw it. I don't know what it was, but I saw it and it probably saw me too. 

I was too sleepy to notice it at first, but I now know why it all felt so weird. I don't own an aquarium any longer. I got rid of it a few days ago. There is nothing on the spot where it used to be. But last night, something was sitting there. Something was watching. Something is in my room and it's watching me.

[UPDATE] Somebody has been in my room today. I came back from internship and found my desk chair in the middle of the room. It couldn't have been my father, he would've opened my curtains and complain about the mess in my room when he'd see me. My mother is also not possible, she would've told me so. There's only one person left, my sister, but she doesn't come into my room at all. She says my room is ""too cold to stand it for longer than a minute"" I actually don't notice my room being too cold. Maybe I am just losing my sanity.

[UPDATE] Why? Why did I have to double-check? I asked my mother if anybody as been in my room today. It turns out that nobody has been in my room. My mother and sister, who I freaked out a little bit, are saying that it was probably dad. He may have been on the level where I sleep, but I know my father well enough. I never open my curtains in the morning, if he had been in my room he would've opened them and left my door open. I just hope it was him, because I forgot to mention one big detail. (I thought it was useless) 

Now that night is almost here I really need this written down. The open little spot, that was created when my chair had been placed in the middle of my room, is actually right under the place where I have my head when I sleep. It's also right across from where my aquarium used to be. My chair was facing me when I came in, as if somebody could've been sitting there. Waiting for me. I don't know if I will get much sleep tonight.

[UPDATE] It may have left my room. I am not certain, but it could be running around the house. My mother said she heard somebody downstairs in the morning after I left yesterday. It was about 10 minutes after I left that she heard noises. She got up and checked downstairs, only to find nobody. If it had been me she should've seen me still closing all the doors on my way out."

That being said... I'm at a loss about what to put on a resume, considering I have practically no extracurricular stuff that can relate to CS or ECE. Nothing to make me stand out aside from my video editing hobby and unprofessional youtube channel with a few hundred thousand views. I don't think DECaF companies will really care for it/about it. 

How do you guys talk to these company representatives? How long should a conversation last and what should be discussed? Paid internship vs unpaid?

18vcvg,4,2013-02-20,Lost undergrad needing insight to software engineering career path,daayyvid,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/18vcvg/lost_undergrad_needing_insight_to_software/,"Long story short, I am lost as to how I should proceed in a CS or software engineering career.

Some back story:

I am a third-year undergraduate CS major at UCLA with ~3.6 GPA. I grew up teaching myself web development in PHP. While at UCLA, I’ve learned C++ and done many projects in C. I’ve dabbled with Python and a little of Ruby. In classes, we cover other languages and various theoretical CS topics as well, but I feel like I haven’t learned anything practical during my time here.

I’ve recently been trying to land an internship for the summer. With my peers already on their second internship, combined with the stress of the interview process, it is making me question whether I am fit for the CS field. I couldn’t land an internship last year, and have landed interviews but already received a few rejections this year. I have one interview left with another company. How do I get better at the interviewing process? Do I prepare for it like a test (I have Cracking the Coding Interview book), or am I expected to know these topics already? I think part of it has to do with my nerves and anxiousness (I need to relax), but the other part is probably not enough preparation for a lot of these interview questions.

In these interviews for big companies I’ve been having they mainly interview on core CS concepts, algorithms, data structures, etc. It gives me the impression that to be a software engineer I need to be a “super nerd” who is always engrossed in algorithms, etc, when really what I enjoy on a high level is making cool things, and understanding how things are built, which is probably why web development was appealing to me in the first place. Seems like sort of a disparity between CS and SE.

Lately I haven’t been doing much coding or side-projects on my own. What should I learn and what should I do as I am nearing graduation and will soon be in search of a job? As I’m already experienced in and enjoy web development, I could learn Python/Django or Ruby/RoR, or get into mobile development. The problem is that I don’t want to be stuck in this web development world forever. How is job market and pay for RoR developers right now?

I know there are a lot more cool things out there in CS. If I don’t keep going down this web dev road, how should I maximize my time left in college, and what should I learn? What other kinds of things do software engineers work on?

Is grad school an option? I don't really want another two years of school. Something like AppAcademy looks fun, though.

Hope this wasn’t too long or boring of a read! Looking for some advice and insight into the software engineering world. Just trying to figure out next steps as I will soon be approaching graduation and have yet to have any real-world experience in this field."
18vanm,2,2013-02-20,Should I move out?,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/18vanm/should_i_move_out/,"I'm in a tough situation at home now. My sister and I (I'm 19, she's 14) are always fighting at home, when I'm home. I haven't been home much because of work, school, and seeing my girlfriend, but when I am home, there's always something happening. My sister is always disrespectful to everyone in the house, doesn't listen, etc, and quite frankly I'm sick of it. My dad stays out of it unless it's absolutely necessary to get involved, and because of the relationship my mom has with her she doesn't do anything about it, and when she does my sister just ignores her. I try to keep out of, but it bothers me a lot when she does this and if I keep out long enough everything bottles up until I can't take it and I need to intervene. My sister shows no remorse for anything she does which doesn't help.

I already snapped on my sister once, essentially telling her how hard she makes it for me to enjoy living here and pretty much disowning her. Tonight I snapped again and said to her how surprised I was that her boyfriend hasn't dumped her with the attitude she has. That sent her over the edge, which in turn sent the rest of the house over the edge. My sister yelled and started cursing at me and my mom and my dad left the house for a bit to get away from everything. My mom came up to talk to me and pretty much said that if it were possible now she would want me to leave the house. 

My dad is leaving for a few days next week (pre planned trip) and my mom wants me out of the house completely while he is gone.

When my dad came back we all talked and my mom said she wants me out of the house. I said fine, just give me the money (this money is explained below). My dad said I need to at least finish my degree before I leave.

Here's where I'm at now. I'm a 2nd year Graphic Design major. My plans were to do community college, graduate, then transfer out to get a four year degree. My grandparents put away a substantial amount of money for me to go to college and after I'm done with my education any money left is mine to keep. I won't know for another month if I got accepted to the four year university, then I need to apply for housing too. I have a part time job as a web designer now, it's not big money, but it's enough for me to at least buy my own stuff while I live at home. I did some rough estimates in my head and if I budget myself correctly I could live for a year and a half on my own with that college money alone (nothing used from my paychecks). And this is assuming I stay part time at my job and keep my same pay rate. So here are the two options I have:

**Option One:**

Chances are high I'll get in to the four year university. So I get in, get a small loan, go there, and stay in the dorms. The loan will let me have some money left in the college fund to have when I get out. However I still need to come back home during breaks and such. But after I get out with my four year degree I won't know how much money will be left and I don't know how long I can live on my own for until I run out.

**Option Two:**

I get my degree after two years, take the money, and move out. On that money alone I can live for about a year and a half on my own just on that money. That is if I still work at the same place, for the same pay, and just part time. Obviously stuff like my job can change, so I didn't factor in my job effecting my money to live.

------------------

Either way my main concern when I move out is my job. I'm not too sure what's out there, if I can get a job to hold me over when the money runs dry. If I go with option two, who's going to hire me with only a two year degree? My portfolio isn't bad, but I feel like employers see a two year degree and will think less of it, and in turn go with someone who has more education. My current job doesn't really have room to advance in the company, it's more of a learning experience at the moment and I more than likely won't need to do an internship because of this job."

I live in a small city with a small web dev community.  There's a couple companies that are focused on specific apps and have ~50 employees, but in terms of 'clients can hire you to make their website', there's about 5-7 companies that have multiple developers and then about 10 'pro-level' one person operations.

If you look around, it feels like the same 30 people rotating between companies.  It can be really hard to break in at a company if you don't know anyone and most of the new hires trickle in via internships they did during school.

Does anyone else in the same sort of environment feel like you're behind in the industry?  Like, since there's only a handful of viable choices for a company to hire, there's less innovation because there's less competition.  When a company wants to hire local and only gets realistic quotes from 4 dev houses, those dev houses can afford to be less competitive.  Responsive design and other new trends are just slowly taking off here.

Another weird thing I've noticed being in a smaller city is that the arts and film community has really grabbed onto the web industry.  They feel like we're all in this together, being creative, but I don't really feel any camaraderie towards artists, if anything, I identify more with corporate drones coding tax software somewhere!

Anyway, just wanted to see if other people were in the same boat."

Reddit, I need help. I'm graduating in May with a degree in journalism. I've had two successful internships, one of which turned into a weekend reporting job. I was editor-in-chief of my school newspaper last year and have worked there all four years of college. I have well over 100 published clips and a good GPA.

And now that I'm at the end of the road, I don't know if I even want to be a journalist at all. I'm burnt out on it.

What I SHOULD do is use my connections here in my home state to get a job in journalism as planned. 

Another possible option is Teach For America. I've made it to their final interview stage and I'll know in mid March if I made it. However, I'd have to decide if I want to commit by the end of March, which would likely be before I have job offers from other places. 

What I really WANT to do is move to Los Angeles and find some sort of job in media, and be with the guy I've been seeing on and off for six years (we can never get the timing right). I have a few connections out there, but I hear finding a job there in an field is really, really difficult.

Can someone help me reason this out? "

It only took me a few conversations to realize that everyone at this career fair were looking for primarily Microsoft track software developers.

18x5z6,0,2013-02-20,Programming Apprentice Looking For Mentor or Direction of Some Sort,Cannon10100,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/18x5z6/programming_apprentice_looking_for_mentor_or/,"I started teaching myself Java two years ago, and since then I have learned the basics of C++, Python, Ruby, Javascript, PHP, MySQL, etc. Though I am a junior in high school, I had an internship position at Rackspace last summer. For most of this year I have been working to expand my basic knowledge of programming languages and philosophy, but I've reached a stumbling block. I am feeling a lack of direction in my coding, mainly because I can't think of any projects I want to work on. 

My question is this: Is there anyone out in the internets who needs a sort of coding lackey/apprentice? I really want to spend more time coding, and I feel like practice is what I need at this point. Really, any language is fine, I just want to learn as much as I can. I have skype and Google+ for live chatting, though I don't have a webcam right now. Thanks so much for any advice you can give me!

P.S. I'm sure other novice programmers and programming students are in the same situation, maybe we could get a group going or something?"

I find myself in a bit of an awkward situation with internships. I would like to use an internship on my résumé along with a portfolio to get into a school of an appropriate caliber but I'm from what's called the Lehigh valley in PA. I'm currently in comm college here. The closest biggest town is Allentown which I doubt most of you have hear of save that billy Joel song or whatever. I'm about 50 miles from Philly, and I assume that would be the best place to actually look.. it's just a hell of a commute. So my question is.. should I try and transfer to a less prestigious school In an area that would Actualy have intern opportunities? Or should I just stay put and devote my time to making a killer portfolio to get into a good school? My high school grades aren't great, and my first year of college is hurting my GPA so I need to set myself apart in any way possible. but is searching for internships 50+ miles away really gonna help me as much as it's going to complicate my life? With full time school, that commute and an internship that feels like more time than I even have in a week. I'm worried about getting into a good school and I don't really know what the best option is for me"

[Any chance of some more vlogs in the future? Made in Korea was hilarious!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fu7rz?context=5)|Not vlogs specifically but I want to do more on camera stuff starting this summer once I move into a bigger place. I have a dream of doing a nightly 1 hour on camera stream in the style of a late night talk show, but one with a hugely unprofessional public access vibe. We'll see where things go in a couple of months but, yes, I think on camera stuff is definitely a big part of the future of this kind of content (not just facecam horror videos) and I don't want to miss the boat. 
[Where does the name ""Northernlion"" come from? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fucoc?context=5)|I was 13, lived in Canada (northern) and my name rhymes with lion. Thank god I didn't go with like xXxMOHSNIPER69.
[You spoke about eventually ending the ""Isaac"" series before starting the cheat engine runs. Now you are at episode #410(?\). Some could say that that Isaac is getting stale and it could be replased with fresh content. Have you thought how long you are planning to continue the BOI series.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fua9m?context=5)|The thing with Isaac is that there's a lot of people who think its run its course, but there's also a lot of people who still really like it and consider it part of their routine like a morning radio show or Regis and Kelly or something. I still enjoy playing the game and the metrics show that there's still a large chunk of my audience that enjoys watching it, so I'm going to keep doing it for the time being.
 |The thing to keep in mind is that Isaac videos never take away from the other content I produce, they're just in addition to it. I've never skipped over a game for a Let's Look At or something because I've felt an obligation to dedicate a 'timeslot' to Isaac instead. 
[How much is your steam library worth?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fu7nw?context=5)|Damn, this is a good question. According to Steam I have 400 games, but most of those are indie titles usually in the $5-$15 range. Factoring in AAA titles that I've received or bought myself, you're probably looking at maybe $5,000? That's kind of a staggering number to me, so guys that have been doing this a lot longer (TotalBiscuit, for example) must have libraries worth as much as a new car. 
[If this is your business, shouldn't you kind of know these numbers? Even for tax purposes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fvrlu?context=5)|95% of these games come direct from the publisher or developer, so I don't need to write them off as a business expense. 
[Bored of Isaac yet? I'm not, I adore the game myself, but I suspect you've played an awful lot more than me!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fu8k6?context=5)|Challenge runs have gone a long way towards stemming the boredom! 
[On that note, do you plan to do any more themed runs, like the current TF2 challenges?  Which boss do you consider most annoying? Mask of infamy can be damn near impossible sometimes, but then there's also the headless horseman occasionally showing up on the first floor...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fvt0x?context=5)|Headless Horseman or The Fallen early in the game can ruin you, but it's a rare occurrence. Mask of Infamy is a huge pain if you lack piercing shots, but champion versions of The Bloat are the most consistently rage-inducing for me.
[What game in your opinion, is the most underrated? Also, what is the most overrated?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fubtb?context=5)|This is a tough question so I'm gonna answer in recent terms as opposed to ""all-time"" context. I think Skulls of the Shogun is super underrated right now. It's a fun strategy game that seems to be getting no attention due to its weird distribution strategy/obligation.
[Fan since SMB, you're easily one of the best LPers on YT, dat voice.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fubtb?context=5)|Most overrated, recently? I think *DmC* is a decent game but I don't think it's ""85 on Metacritic"" good. *Borderlands 2* didn't hook me at all, either. 
[What introduced you to doing videos, was it watching others doing it too?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fu7yz?context=5)|Yep, I was primarily influenced by guys like AVGN, Spoony, and Angry Joe (who I had the pleasure of meeting at Paradox Con a couple of weeks ago) . I started out doing reviews in a similar vein to them but branched into more unscripted content once I found that I sound like a robot when I'm reading off of a page. 
[When was your biggest, ""Holy crap! People actually like my videos,"" moment? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fu9oa?context=5)|I try to stay pretty humble and self-deprecating so I get these moments all the time. Just yesterday Edmund McMillen tweeted and blogged about my ""Top 10 Items in The Binding of Isaac"" video and that made me a bit giddy. 
[Dude, you got Edmund McMillen in one of your videos! Retweet is nothing after that!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fvfa0?context=5)|True! We're going to probably do another collaboration in the future if I can get my shit together. He's really good about stuff like that but I'm terrible at setting it up.
[What's involved in managing your youtube channel? For example, what are your usual daily activities? How many hours do you typically work?  Edit: You're a pretty cool guy.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fuacf?context=5)|An hour or so shooting emails to devs/publishers, few hours recording, few hours playing games to get acclimated enough to record them later, maybe a half hour writing meta data and making thumbnails. Thanks!
[Oh yeah, onother thing. I really want to see one of your livestreams but I live in Europe, so fuck me, right? :D Totally screwed! Btw, will you do a Let´s play of the Day Z standalone game? Because you played the mod.. and it was nice! ;D.  So how about a season 2 on Day Z? :33.  And do you know the gamescom in cologne, germany? Will you be there someday? :DD THAT WOULD BE AWESOME! love you &lt;3.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fuizs?context=5)|Planning on playing Day Z standalone, yep. Not sure if I'll LP it, but at least a Let's Look At.
[Proof?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fu83e?context=5)|Just tweeted verification [on my account](http://twitter.com/NorthernlionLP).
[My question is, how did you network and advertise your content to gain your subscriber and following base?  (I am a small YouTuber, mostly LoL content with 700,000 views and 1400 subs\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fufqa?context=5)|It's mostly search traffic. I haven't done much network or many collaborations. The landscape is more competetive now, though.
[Yeah, I use to make content (on a separate account\) way back in 2008 and you would get 1000-4000 views on it if it was a popular topic... and now it is like 10-20... :\ oh well...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fv119?context=5)|YouTube is a pretty harsh mistress. You can have a decent following but if you stop posting videos and lose momentum, people will just go elsewhere since there's no shortage of channels doing similar types of content. 
[What Isaac items do you have little or no knowledge of? (Crystal Ball, Dead Dove, etc\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fui69?context=5)|Acording to commenters: all of them.
[How did you deal with the transitional phase from smaller channel to a medium sized channel? This is something I'm currently going through, and I'll be entirely honest here, it's extremely stressful at times. Knowing you need to focus all your efforts onto the channel to encourage growth leaves little time for anything else. This means income can be a problem. So, how did you deal with that period in your channels life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fubx7?context=5)|Luckily for me I was in a financial place where I could kind of risk it. When my contract teaching ESL in Korea expired in Nov. 2011, I had a decent amount of money saved up so even though my channel wasn't making me too much income, I could afford to dedicate a few months towards growing it without breaking the bank. Ended up being a good decision!
 |The big change for me from a content perspective was producing a lot more videos. I went from doing around 1/day to 3/day as I started to realize that there were people out there who relied (for lack of a better word) on my videos for entertainment. So from my perspective, that transition wasn't necessarily about hitting X number of subscribers, but rather a philosophical change from being ""that dude whose videos you watch now and then"" to ""that outlet where you can get a ton of gaming content every day"".
 |Hope that helps, and good luck! 
[How exactly do you make your money? Do you just strictly enter gaming competitions that award cash to the winner? Or do you have some sort of partnership with youtube? How can you support yourself by just playing video games?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fugpm?context=5)|It's entertainment, not competitive gaming. Basically, I have a partnership with a network. The network runs ads on my videos, and I get paid a small amount for each ad viewed.
[How does one obtain a partnership with a network?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fxl5r?context=5)|Basically just exist, make content, and have a reasonably sized audience. There are a ton of networks that will sign channels basically sight unseen but your best bet is to work your way up a bit until you qualify for a major and reputable network.
[Ey Ryan, watched literally all your videos and I´m addicted to you. :( Congratz! Greetings from germany...  Has your voice always been like this? Have you trained it somehow? Because i love it! :D.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fu9gr?context=5)|Just lucky I guess! Puberty hit me like a ton of bricks. Thanks for the support!
[What games, if any, are you playing outside of your usual Isaac and Let's Look At routine? Is there any time left to play games just for fun, without doing anything for the channel?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fvfv9?context=5)|I play a ton of games but usually it's for limited durations. I drop in, play a few hours (or if it's for review, beat the whole thing), make my content, and move on. The line between fun and work is blurry but I like it that way.
 |I played a lot of recreational XCOM:EU and, although I know it's blasphemy, spent a decent amount of time in BLOPS 2 online as well. 
[Are you getting tired of Isaac?  How many hours do you have played according to Steam?  Also, it's time for a reset.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fu90t?context=5)|I was getting tired of it for a while but after a short break I always find myself wanting to return. Challenge runs have also helped mix things up for me. I have almost 300 hours in the game according to Steam and I'm super excited for Rebirth to be here in the winter. 
[Was Roll Fizzlebeef responsible for moving that asteroid just out of impact range using telepathy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fucva?context=5)|All I'll say is that I have Roll in a cryosleep chamber in my basement ready to be thawed when the Earth needs him the most.
[Do you ever feel like following your degree in Biology might've been better for you/more interesting?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fugvx?context=5)|It's a touchy subject since what I'm doing now has literally zero relation to my degree (not that I'm necessarily complaining). I make myself feel better by thinking that the four years I spent in university made me a little more confident and a little funnier, which are probably skills that have contributed to my modest success so far.
[1\) When is the next Saving Progress podcast going to be uploaded on YouTube? It seems like it has been forever.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fuc3a?context=5)|We've having some problems on the SP front. We live in different timezones and Josh and Mike both work full-time jobs. When they're off of work it's only like 3PM my time and I feel obligated to complete my solo stuff before I do collaborations. On top of that, Fox had problems with his ISP and had no internet for 3 weeks, and then I was in Iceland/recovering from jetlag for a couple Wednesdays as well. SP will return and collaborations will become more frequent, but it's an adjustment period right now.  I'm kind of ashamed to admit I don't read much. I mostly listen to podcasts like Dan Carlin's excellent Hardcore History.
[Have you met any other youtubers before, and if so who impressed you the most?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fyaj7?context=5)|Not really. I met AngryJoe and RageGaming at PDX Con a couple of weeks ago and they all seem like nice people.  
[Have you gone to conventions before and was it strange interacting with your fans?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fyaj7?context=5)|I got recognized at PAX a couple of times last summer. Not strange necessarily, but surreal.  
[Do you feel like youtube is over-saturated in video game youtubers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fyaj7?context=5)|Yeah, definitely.  
[What do you feel like separates yourself (i.e. competitive advantage\) from other video game youtubers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fyaj7?context=5)|I started doing it earlier and I think I have a more mature angle than a lot of people are. I hope so, anyway.  
[Have you ever seen a lion before?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fyaj7?context=5)|Yes, at the zoo.
[Are you at liberty to comment on your payment/fee structure with YouTube?  How does this go from being a hobby to YouTube saying ""we'll pay you?""  Understandable if you want to refrain to avoid divulging 'trade secrets,' for the sake of my/our curiosity...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fvth3?context=5)|I'm not allowed to talk financial specifics, but the process is pretty standardized by now. You start your channel, eventually you grow to the point where a ""network"" takes notice of you and offers you a partnership whereby they serve ads on your videos, take a cut of the revenue, and give you the rest. You can monetize directly with YouTube as well, but networks provide some secondary benefits like promotion (sometimes) and protection from publishers/takedown notices (sometimes).
 |The landscape is changing though. Networks are going through major restructuring and it'll be interesting to see how things look a year from now.
[How do you find such terrible games for poison mushroom?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fubvl?context=5)|Metacritic and sort by lowest score in the past 5 years or something. Lots of gold to be mined there. 
[When are you publishing ""The Northernlion Story""?  PS: Loved your X-Com playthrough.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fubmb?context=5)|Thanks! I loved the XCOM series too. Fizzlebeef for life.
[What is, in your opinion, the worst game you have ever played ? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fuk45?context=5)|There's been a lot of games that are just broken, and by that metric I think Action 52 is definitely the worst. For me, though, I at least find those games interesting because they're such spectacular failures. The worst times I've had with games have been games that are bland in their badness, so for that I usually mention *Drug Wars* and *Tunnel Rats 1968*.
[Which ""series"" made you more famous ? (I know you since you posted videos about Super Meat Boy, but i wonder if you have statistics on that\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fu99h?context=5)|Super Meat Boy, Isaac, and Scribblenauts Unlimited have been the big ones in terms of bringing in a new audience. Terraria was pretty big as well when I was much smaller, and I think Spelunky and FTL helped out a lot on a smaller scale as well. One thing is for sure, without Isaac I wouldn't be as big as I am today, but without Super Meat Boy I probably wouldn't even be in the same ballpark.
[Wha tis your current stand in pixel art graphics in games these days? Its getting used more and more frequently but I kinda like that :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fvoo4?context=5)|It doesn't bother me at all. I think there's a backlash to it because some people think it's the developers jumping on a retro/nostalgia bandwagon, but the reality is that pixel art is relatively easy and cheap to do, which makes it a nice choice for small teams or programmers who have no/limited art skills.
 |As nice as it would be for every indie game to have its own unified and unique art style, it's just not practical for most of these studios in their current states. 
[I've been a big fan from near the beginning of your Youtubing adventure (not trying to be a hipster or anything...\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fvt7c?context=5)|There's obviously a lot of perks to my job. I work from home, set my own hours, can take sick days or vacations whenever I want (like today, as I have laryngitis), and perhaps most importantly from a grown-up perspective, even if I don't 'go to work' I still make money, which is awesome. The 14-year old in me loves getting big games a week before they release to the public as well.
[What is your favourite/least favourite part about doing what you do full time? I'm guessing favourite is quite easy to answer, doing what you love doing but for a living, but anything else? Certain perks that keep you trundling along?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fvt7c?context=5)|The worst part is definitely internet commenters. I've grown better at ignoring trolls but people often levy personal attacks at you based on your content/voice/appearance and it adds up sometimes. It's easy to say that you should just let it roll off your back and ignore it, but it's harder to do in reality. Also, when I genuinely make a mistake, I feel like Peter in Office Space, because I have one person who clues me in, followed by dozens/hundreds/thousands of people telling me exactly the same thing.
[Also, you should get a catchphrase. ""This game is great, and I ain't Lion"" could be a good one... ...okay, I just really wanted to make that joke and had to force it in somehow.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fvt7c?context=5)|Overall, this is obviously an awesome job and ignoring a few trolls is a small price to pay.
[Hey Northernlion, just wanted to ask what you think attributed to your success as a YouTuber. I'm a fan and love your commentary to be sure, but there are so many fairly entertaining channels out there that get completely ignored. This isn't a question about how to get famous on YouTube, but what you consider maybe turning points in the channel's popularity? Moments of success?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fuiyr?context=5)|My marketing strategy is basically just to make the best content I can and then make it as easy as possible for people to find it. Check out /r/letsplay. I have some posts there regarding how to optimize your metadata and tags in a non-sleazy way to improve your chances of new people finding you.
[Thanks for the help, much appreciated. Just quickly, how was the feeling when you realised you could live off your youtube channel?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8futog?context=5)|It was a pretty awesome feeling, I'll admit. 
[Are you looking at play Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate and if so how much?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fu95y?context=5)|I'll definitely check it out in March. I loved Dark Souls (obviously) and everyone says MH is similar to that, so I owe it to myself. Plus, I mean...what else am I going to play on my Wii U in the next couple months?
[What Isaac run have you had that you are most surprised was successful? Once, I was just screwing around using Maggie, and I ended up beating the womb with Number One, My Reflection, and Tammy's Head.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fuyne?context=5)|Hard to say, they all kind of blur together!

Since you have a huge amount of Isaac videos, when the remake/rebirth comes out, do you think that you will focus a lot of attention on that, or stick with 'classic' Issac.  Which gaming media outlets do you read/watch and do their review opinions ever sway you when it comes to purchasing a game?  When will the SP Podcast return, and do you think there will ever be guests?  Has there ever been a game that you really wanted to do a series on, but got shot down by the publisher, other than the Assassin's Creed LP?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18lkld/i_am_northernlion_a_professional_youtuber_who_has/c8fvcw6?context=5)|To be honest, I get most of the games I'm interested in direct from publishers nowadays, but when I purchase a game my decision usually boils down to whether or not I'm personally interested in it and whether or not it will make noteworthy/interesting content. As such, I shelled out $50 for Aliens:CM even though I was confident it was going to be garbage, just because I wanted to make a video of my thoughts on the game. I do read a lot of sites though, to keep abreast of news and developments, or just to see how their opinions of games line up with my own. I love *Polygon* and I think they have wonderful writers, and I'm a big *Rock Paper Shotgun* fan as well even though they turned me down for an internship position a couple of years ago! Also, big Giant Bomb fan.

190l4n,5,2013-02-22,Help with plans for future veterinary school?,ucdavisthrowaway,UCDavis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/190l4n/help_with_plans_for_future_veterinary_school/,"Hi, I'm Dave and I'm currently a 3rd year NPB student here at UC Davis.

I originally chose this major because I was planning on going into the medical field, but after partaking in the volunteer program at Davis Medical Center as well as after going to a number of animal science interest programs as well as enrolling in classes, I find myself fairly committed to a career in the veterinary field.

If it's at all possible, I would love to be able to attend the vet school here at Davis, and I would like to know what undergrad courses and experiences I am expected to take/have while studying here. This is the resource that I am primarily using as of now:

 http://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/students/dvm_program/admissions/required_prevet_courses.cfm

Quick summary of courses on that page:

CHE 2ABC, 8AB
 
PHY 1AB 

BIS 2ABC, 101

ABI 102

NPB 101

STA 13 or 100

as well as 12 units each of English and Humanities

So I guess I have a few (maybe more than a few) questions:

1. Am I not expected to take the CHE118 series, and can just take the 8 series instead? This surprised me because I had often heard that the required courses for vet school were similar to as of those for med school, and apparently the 118 series is required for UCD Med?

2. Are the requirements for UCD Vet fairly similar to those of other vet schools? For example, I don't want to take the CHE 8 series instead of the 118 and find myself being rejected from other schools because they had expected me to take the 118.

3. Are there any courses that are not *required* but are highly recommended/expected for me to take?

4. Are there any particular internships or volunteer services that I should be applying for or be keeping an eye on?

5. Is my NPB major okay for my future plans or should I change it? There are a few reasons why I felt that I was okay keeping it:

I've already started taking upper div NPB courses (such as NPB 101L) and I feel that it would be wasteful to not put them towards a degree, as well as the fact that I would have to take additional courses for other majors.

The subject matter of the major seems relevant enough to the veterinary sciences to continue studying it.

From what I hear, animal science majors are required to submit a thesis/undergrad project at the end of their 3rd yr. It seems that because of this it is too late now for me to switch to an animal science major, as well as the additional courses that I would have to take.

6. Not a question, but any general opinions about the veterinary field as well as information such as job outlook, personal experiences, and job satisfaction would be greatly appreciated. One of the reasons I was dissuaded from medicine was because of a trusted mentor of mine (a general surgeon) telling me frankly that he feels the medical field as it is now is not worth it, and although he does not regret working to get where he is, if he had to do it again there is no way that he would. Honest opinions such as these are extremely welcome.

Thank you SO SO much for taking the time to read through this and help me. I know that I really should talk to a counselor about this manner, but I'm working two jobs to pay for school and I really just have not been able to schedule a time that works for them (within regular day hours). Also, if there are any volunteer programs or internships that are incredibly worth it, I would not mind quitting a job and taking out more private loans to be able to work towards my goal, as I'm passionate about working with animals and getting some more hands-on experience.

I hope this was comprehensible. I apologize for any unclear statements as well as any errors in grammar or format, as I'm not the best at submitting posts and it's kind of late.

Thank you!

Go Aggies!

I'm a sophomore at &lt;insert state university&gt; majoring in both Computer Science and Business (the focus is UNDOUBTEDLY CS, the other is more for practicality sake). I guess I'm a little behind because I do not have a resume yet, but I've always been daunted about what skills/experience I actually have to write on one. At this stage, I'd be writing one solely for internship applications. 

My academics are solid, I think (3.45 cum GPA, 3.7 CS GPA, 3.9 Business GPA, two semesters on Dean's List) and I have a solid understanding of Java, C, OOP, and am proficient at HTML/CSS (but I know that's not necessarily connected). Every sample resume on this subreddit seems to have a dozen different languages on it, do I really have enough for a skills section of a resume?

My other question is about the idea of ""projects"". I don't know what level of project/assignment really constitutes as resume worthy. In my classes I've done some basic GUI things and implemented (in c/java) (and understand) a decent number of data structures (linked-lists, heaps, stacks, queues, etc.). I'm currently doing some assembly language work in MIPS (obviously the language itself would not end up on a resume), and there have been assorted projects of roughly the difficulty of the above description throughout the last two years. In addition I have a few small personal projects, but nothing extensive or enough to write home about.

Sorry for the novel, but does it seem like I have anything worth putting on a resume for an internship application? what can I be doing to make more of an impression on hiring managers? I just really have no experience doing this so far. Thanks for the help!

Lets cut to the chase. Devry teaches you a lot of basics, but very rarely are you going to be in a class that teaches you current up-to-date real world methodologies. I recently completed a Java Class in which majority of the class was spent writing programs in the console. We didn't learn about web services or really any advanced topics.

I have a friend that is going for a similar degree at Baylor University and has spent time at a community college learning how to write Java. Although his degree was cheaper, we basically learned the same amount of information. The biggest difference was that in one of his classes he got to write a game which I thought was pretty fun, but it was console based and still basic.

The point I want to make is this: For anyone who has been sucked into Devry University and think because they graduated that you will never get a job in your career field, I want you to stop and realize it's not the degree that will get you the job, it's yourself. The most important thing you can do to grow as a developer is involving yourself on projects outside of school and reading books. Hell, grab an internship if you can! 

Yes, a degree can help you get in the door, but I have interviewed many people who have degrees from all over and if their skillset doesn't match the job they are expected to perform, their degree does not save them. I know there are many companies who throw degrees away from Devry, but a good company with decent recruiters know that for development it's not the degree, it's the portfolio. 

Oh and yes I work at a job where people look down at Devry. When I told them they are working wtih someone who graduated from Devry, they were quite shocked. The majority that can make it look bad, but trust me - individually you don't have to be a statistic :)"

He offered me an ""internship"" as a software developer, but here is there deal:

1. He doesn't code. In fact, no one in the company does. I would not have any guidance for projects should I get stuck.

2. Unpaid. Would be developing for iOS and Android, and depending on success of a product, I would get reimbursed(probably like 25%)

3. No office. I would have to work from home on projects. Not sure if this would be a set back? I would hence not be working in a team environment.

The guy has awesome ideas for applications he wants to make, and I would actually have a choice for what I work on (and would probably be excited for it).  We discussed some projects and I feel like I wouldn't be taking on anything bigger than I could chew?  

Basically what I want to know is:

1. Does this sound legitimate to put on a resume? The most important thing is saying that I got experience and a possible recommendation from the business, right?

2. Is it a good/bad option for someone to intern at a start-up company that isn't a big name?

3. Is working at home a bad idea?

4. Is not having guidence a huge issue? I'm pretty good at programming and could always look up ways to do things (like integrate to facebook) online, right?"

I wasn't given the job immediately, but due to some deadlines I was verbally told that I had gotten the job with a guarantee of a year's worth of work. I was then given a task. I've worked a total of 6 hours so far (part time), but I don't know how much I'm getting paid. I probably should have asked this during my first meeting, but since I wasn't given the job there I didn't want to think too far into the future. I know that people who work in the computer labs at my university get paid $9.25 and hour. I don't want to think too much of myself, but I know that this is not a job that one can simply pick up. I plan on emailing the person in charge to discuss hourly rates. I'm thinking $12, up to $15? Does that sound reasonable? I don't want to be off putting, especially since I just started this job. "

______________________________________________________________________________________

Do you ever lay awake in bed to just think about the past year? Think about all the shit that went down, all the embarrassing shit you've pulled and all the moments you wish would last a lifetime.


I don't. At least, not until two months ago. When all was fine and we were just a normal healthy family. 


Haide was my younger sister but for some reason I've always been the one to look up to *her*. In fact, I even beleve my mom and dad looked up to her. And I think that's because, in a way, she made us feel like we would do anything and be anything she needs. It's amazing, really. Without trying, she could make anyone like her. Although some people were weirdly jealous of her. But not in a way that they would make orrible comments about her or try to bully her at school. No, no. It's much.. worse than that. They would simply befriend her, try to make their way into her heart and then take away all things that make her happy.


Esther was her best friend, they could barely stay apart from each other for one day. Cute, right? Nuh-uh. I knew what she was doing. She would convince Haide to stop practicing ballet, because she didn't have the right figure. She would tell her that no, she shouldn't try to get into Harvard. Because really, you could only get into Harvard in you have a shitload of money. Maybe that's true, I don't know, but Esther did whatever she could to prevent Haide from even trying. To make a long story short, Haide started feeling worse and worse about herself. She indeed stopped practicing ballet and stopped looking at colleges to go to. My and my parents watched her slip away but we felt there was nothing we could do. She wouldn't listen to us when we suggested that maybe she should stop seeing Esther so much.


After a few weeks of watching Haide feel like crap, my mother decided to step in. ''Finally.'' I thought. ''Thank god, now she will get the help she needs.'' Ha, were we wrong.


Haide started seeing a therapist in the town nearest by. My father felt skeptical about this. ''All they're gonna do is shove antidepressants down her throat and convince her it will all be fine, that it's just her age. Please Ellen, stop this at once.'' But my mother refused and convinced my father that we should at least try. After her second appointment with the therapist Haide told me and my mother that Dr. Harman indeed suggested that she should take some very light antidepressants. Sertraline. I remember the name oh so damn well. I could see that this startled my mother, but she tried to maintain a pokerface. After talking about it with me and Haide, we all agreed that she should indeed take the antidepressants, but not tell our father. ''He will just freak out over nothing.'' My mom assured us. So yeah, that was the plan. The next day Haide went to the pharmacy to pick up the pills and for the following two weeks, everything went back to normal. That is until Haide started telling me about horrible side effects. She said that the worst was the feeling in her legs. She just couldn't keep them still. She would lie awake at night, every night, constantly kicking and moving her legs around, til the point where she would start to cry and eventually cry herself to sleep. I told her to call Dr. Harman about it, but apparently he was on his once-a-year vacation. After that I told her not to worry about it, that it just takes some time getting used to the pills. I could tell by her face that she felt horrible, and I offered her to sleep in my bed tonight, maybe it would help her sleep. She agreed.


That night after we got ready for bed she whispered at me: ''Marit, it's really bad.'' With her lips pressed together and her eyes watery, I could tell she was about to cry. I fucking hate myself for doing this.. I just gently slapped her back and told her not to make such a big deal out of it. I'm such an idiot. A few minutes later we crawled in my bed. I fell asleep almost instantly, feeling extremely tired from my internship. It was about 1:30 when I woke up to the soft crying next to me. I turned around and sighed, feeling irritated. ''It's really bad, Marit. It's really bad. Is there nothing we can do? It feels like my legs aren't even mine anymore, I can't control how they lay, everything about them feels wrong.'' She would whisper. ''It's okay, I'm here.'' I said, cuddling her. I could feel her legs kicking around and I could hear her grinding her teeth. I should've know, I should've fucking known. I could feel myself drifting away, back to the dream I came from. I'm a horrible sister.


I dont know how much later it was, but I suddenly woke up to the most terrifying screaming I have ever heard. I could feel my body get numb in cold swear and extreme fear. When I got to my senses I realised it was Haide, my dear sister, who was screaming as if she was slowly getting tortured. I jumped out of bed and switched my light on, revealing something I will never ever be able to unsee again. Everytime I close my eyes, it's not the inside of my eyelids I see, but it's my sister. Covered in deep red blood. She was still screaming at the top of my lungs and my father rushed in, pushing me aside. He jumped on my bed and yelled at her ''what did you do, Haide? Baby, what did you do?'' I just stood there, frozen in place. My mother called 911, but by the time they got there, she was gone. My sister, my only sister, a part of me, was gone. 


She had taken my snowglobe, the one my grandmother gave me when she came back from Paris. She smashed in onto the frame of my bed and started stabbing her legs with the broken glass. There was so much blood, so much blood. They counted a total of 41 stabbing wounds in her legs. We should've listened to her, made her quit those antidepressants when she told us about the side effects she was experiencing. 


A few days later my father would tell me that when he rushed into my room, jumped on the bed and held Haide, all she would whisper was ''they're not mine, they're not my legs, get them off. Get them off.''

Think twice before taking antidepressants called Sertraline."

I'm a sophomore computer science student right now and I've recently made a commitment to really learning web development. Sorry if this might be redundant and if this is asked a lot, but how long will it take me (starting from scratch learning HTML --&gt; CSS --&gt; etc) to build a website like http://lifeandtimes.com/ or http://www.dreamvillain.net/? I know these are professionally done and it probably would take me forever to do these, but I would like to have a rough timeline on when I should expect to be capable of creating websites like these (both professionally made and sort of amateur-ish). One of my friends is an aspiring musician and I told him I would be able to build him a website by the end of the year. 

I'm currently starting my upper divs in my computer science degree so I won't have that much time to really learn during the week, but I can say that when I have time, I will be trying my best to learn! Also, the reason I decided to do web development was because in my search for an internship this summer, many firms ask me what I'm interested in or what I want to do and I never really have an answer, so I guess I'm sort of committing myself to something so that I can actually build something instead of giving a generic answer like (I want experience or I just know C/Java...etc) when applying for internships in the coming years. Any feedback would be appreciated, I would like to gauge how ""far"" behind I am so to speak. "

I've never done any internships and only have one non-school project.

I feel like the best way to advertise the programming skills I have and make my resume look desirable is to show the best/most complex projects I've done, even if they were school assignments. As an example, here is one project I thought I might add:

*Huffman Tree Text Compressor - herpderp.edu/link-to-applet.html*

* Implemented in Java SE 6 and tested in JUnit

* Compresses text files by assigning new bit encodings to characters according to frequency

* Re-expands text files that have been compressed with Huffman encoding

**Should I bother putting something like that on my resume?** If I do, should I indicate on the resume that I did it for a course, or just explain if I'm asked about it?

Even though I would be cleaning up the code of any school project and adding to it substantially, in accordance with my school's honor code **I cannot put the source code in a public place.** Therefore I would be providing a link to a webpage with an embedded applet.

Is it worth doing this, or is it a good idea to mention projects on a resume only if I can link directly to a source code repository?

However, I've still got some interviews with startups in the SF area, and I'm fairly sure one of them will offer me an internship soon. I'd also prefer not being tied down to a co-op.

I've also got another opportunity in Perth with a Rails shop that I interned with previously, and they're offering me significantly more money than Oracle.

However, I'm sure Oracle would look pretty awesome on my resume, especially considering I'm a freshman.  

What would be the best course of action right now? I've still got interviews with Tumblr, Khan Academy and a few other startups, so I'll definitely ask for some time to decide."

First I am an electrical engineering student at an Ok university (University of Oklahoma). My main goal is to one day work for a tech company, such as Intel, IBM, Nvidia etc... I am confused on what I should do to get there though. 
My first question is what classes should I make my electives? I can choose from a variety of topics and will list some. There is different areas with classes under each:

Signals and Systems:
Digital Signal processing,
Random Signals ,
etc

Solid State:
IC Fabrication,
Solid State electronics, 
etc

Electronics and Optics:
Electronics,
Optical Engineering,
etc

Radar(I am not listing this since I assume it wouldn't apply)

Communications:
Wireless Comm,
Comm,
Comm theory,
etc

Controls:
Control Theory,
Linear Systems,
Etc

Power Systems: Analysis of Electrical Transmission, Analysis of Faulted Power System

Digital Systems: Computer Architecture, Computer hardware Design, VLSI, etc

Software: Basically any software course I wish to take.

Now I can't be specific about what it is I want to do, but I do know I love computers and so far have loved my classes. If you aren't sure what the classes would be for but know some key words I should look for that would be great.

Also for internships: I know(well assume) that big tech companies like Intel, Nvidia, Google etc are extremely hard to get an internship at. If I can't get one there is there anywhere else I could look that might help with experience?

As for the minor question. What is a good minor for my goals? I was thinking computer science would help.

For my last question: When I first started college I picked the wrong major(I graduated high school early and none of my family went to college) and I found myself miserable which led to poor grades. At the end of this semester I will be looking at an Overall GPA of 3.0-3.11. How does this fare for me to get internships? My major GPA is probably about 3.8 as my grades have gotten much better after I changed my major and found my passion for what I want to do. Is there any advice for what I can do to make myself look better?

But after the exam I realized I made so many small mistakes here and there that probably cost me a good score. I'm so disappointed right now. 

In my next class today I was sitting there thinking about how terrible I feel for doing badly on the exam. Even though I do well overall, I've had a lot of these moments throughout my years in engineering, and it always causes me to feel terrible. And I asked myself, do you really want to do this? 

All of my internships have required walking into a cubicle every day for several hours, staring at a computer. I ask myself: Is that the end goal? Do I really want to feel terrible every time I do poorly on an exam, when the end goal is probably just sitting in a cubicle all day?

But on the other hand, for the most part, I DO do well. And for the most part, I really enjoy learning about engineering. But the times where I get stressed I just really wonder if the end is going to be worth it all.

Friends have suggested that I contact companies directly. How can I find a list of tech companies that employ linux admins for a given city? Is there any website or tool for this?

Are there any other tools/search engines that I should try? Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated!"

* I haven't graduated college yet, so aside from an internship this will be my first job

* I don't have any other offers right now

* cost of living is %124 compared to the national average. SF is %160 from the same source

*  I don't have any significant qualifications for the job - I am confident in my general abilities and I think I interviewed well, but nothing that specifically matches the job/industry.

* The offer is 72k + insurance and 401k, sick and vacation time. The extras seem to be good.

* The company seems really great, definitely somewhere I want to work. The culture seems awesome, everyone was nice and the recruiting process went well.

So basically, from what I've read a counter-offer generally seems to be a good idea, 5 minutes for potentially a few thousand dollars is a no brainer right? I just don't feel like I have much to negotiate with, and the current offer is pretty good in my opinion. Also, I really don't want to risk them revoking the offer. 

This is completely new territory for me so any advice is very much appreciated."

I'm applying to my first CS internship, and I'm a bit nervous, considering that I have a mediocre GPA and I'm still blooming as a programmer (i.e., I only have experience with HTML, Python, and C++).

My question is pretty simple. I have a LOT of experience outside the classroom. For example, I served as the vice-president of the student government. Or last summer I did an internship where I worked with juvenile delinquents in a restorative justice program. 

Basically, to those of you who have hiring experience, are these sorts of things something you'd want to see in a resume or hear about in an interview? Or do you just want to see a kick-ass GPA and a ridiculous amount of programming experience . . . neither of which I have. 

Thank you for any answers and for reading this!

I'm a CS major with a bad GPA (2.7 out of 4.3) in Canada. I haven't been able to land an internship and I'm about to graduate soon. My CV is pretty stacked with non-CS related extra currics (lots of student politics, club presidents, sports team captain etc). I don't have any out of class projects mainly because I haven't been able to find enough time to get anything done/time management sucks (my GPA would tend to agree). I'm graduating next semester.

Is it deadly if I don't have any professional experience before graduating and start looking for a first full time real job? Will I be at a major disadvantage when it comes to interviews/starting salary? When should I start applying for full time permanent employment?"

19cvme,1,2013-02-27,"Another unemployed, depressed artist.",[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/19cvme/another_unemployed_depressed_artist/,"I’m really, infinitely sorry for posting this, but I’ve been reading other people’s problems and frustrations and everyone seems to feel better, even if just a little bit, after posting, and I just want to not feel like I’m going crazy anymore. I’m afraid of posting this because, on another internet forum of which I am a member, I asked for related advice and was attacked. I am ashamed to say I am a person who gets offended at words on the internet, and I know how dumb I am. Am I stupid for saying that? 
Ok onto the bullshit: 

Graduated in ’07 with a BFA, wanted to make video games more than anything else in the world. 
I knew it would be hard to get a job, and I didn’t even really believe in myself skill-wise, but I thought I could do it if I just worked as hard as I possibly could. 
School was too expensive, couldn’t seem to get any grants or scholarships, so I had to attend a community college my first year, but it was ok! I was filled with so much hope, and I worked very hard with my studies, got top grades in all of my classes, all while drawing like crazy on the side.
Finally got to art school, signed my name onto $80k worth of private loans, but repeating in my mind what my admissions advisor said to me: “You are guarenteed a job!”  I was an 18 year old kid with no concept of money: no one in my family went to college, parents didn’t want me to get a “useless” art degree anyway, blah blah blah I know I’m a fucking idiot for signing my name on that line but its in the past and I can’t change it. 
Couldn’t afford to not have a full-time job to pay for rent, food, gas, very little else. Lived off of ramen and got pretty ill after a while because of it, funny story related to this tidbit I will tell at a later time. 
Due to working a 35-40 hour a week job, my homework suffered a little. I could have been much worse with it, but because of my dedication I always received A+ grades, I just knew in my heart that I could have definitely done a lot better if I only had more time to try. One example of this is when I started to learn 3d: the place I worked was shutting down and so I spent more freetime than I wanted on finding something else, including going to my career services and asking for an internship but being denied because… nope, I don’t have any idea. I think the woman there just didn’t like me, I know it sounds like a bullshit excuse but I have no idea why a persistant, capable student was denied an internship. Maybe I just came off as a shithead and she didn’t want to waste anyone’s time, who knows. 
Anyway, I was better than most of my peers at 3d, but I definitely wasn’t the best, unlike my 2d skills where I was easily the best if not one of the best in all of my classes. (Not bragging or trying to sound confident here, there were/are a lot of people who go to “Video Game School” who have never drawn in their life, and since I started at 14 I had a bit of a head start)

I got better and better, and to date I’d say I’m a good artist (not great, excellent, amazing, etc.) and with fresh degree in hand, I landed an interview. 
It actually went amazingly well, but I did not get the job. I think I failed the art test because it was in 3d and not 2d where I am most strong, and there must have simply been a stronger candidate. 
Had to move home due to lack of funding (quit my job the last four months of school to focus on portfolio work) and back in with my mom in Indiana. 
Depression set in halfway through my BFA, and I hesitated to type this because I can still hear my mother saying “Depression isn’t a real illness” in the back of my mind, but it’s definitely real and it’s so, so awful. My relationships were strained, and luckily that was the only thing that suffered while in college, but after I got out and failed at getting the job I had worked so hard for, it took away everything. 
Because of strained relationships in college, I have limited contacts. In this industry I have heard a million times that it’s not about how good you are, but who you know. Fucked myself over pretty big I guess. 
I finally got a job doing something administrative, just to pay the bills. 
Sallie Mae calls and informs me of my impending $1100/month student loan payments. My job at the time paid around minimum wage, I made about $1000 a month. 
Keep applying, but notice that drawing becomes more and more difficult. 
Some life drama happens including all friends from college dropping off the face of the earth, my 14 year old dog died, a sinus infection with no health insurance, bf becomes distant, some other things too etc. 
Stop drawing altogether. 


2009: Move to Oregon with $1000 in my pocket, get an admin job, start drawing again. 
Admin job is at a call center, “hostile work environment”, too exhausted to work at night, but am able to create some things. 
Had my boyfriend of ten years fuck me over, long story short: I was working to support the both of us while he found a job in his industry of study, he was supposed to do the same for me. Once he landed a job (after 2.5 years of virtual unemployment) I quit my job to take a risky position as an artist at a start-up company. He couldn’t support us because he was shitty with money, we end up breaking up after he tells me he hasn’t loved me for years anyway. The start-up company tells me not to come back via email due to lack of work on their end. 
Extreme depression. 
Crawl back to my call center job after a month of desperately seeking employment. 

Start to feel myself again slowly but surely. 
An internet guy I was extremely close to in college (but the ex hated that I talked to) comes back into my life. He tells me he believes in me, and gets me to believe again, too. 
I start creating more. 
Internet guy visits and eventually moves here to upgrade into boyfriend status. We are finally happy! 
With something in my life going correctly, I start becoming more and more productive. 
Do some 3d freelance on the side, it exhausts me working so much, and 3d is infinitely frustrating since I’m not great at it, but I feel I am finally using my degree! One of my clients is a small company that sells ideas to Adidas. Most of my projects involve Adidas things, so when I later saw Adidas hiring an on-site, 3d Artist, I put together my portfolio and applied. Denial email less than 24 hours later. Accept that I must be just “passable” at 3d and definitely not “good” but I should simply work harder if I want to be employed doing it. 
Stop doing freelance after this setback, but started doing projects that involve 2d things I enjoy much more.  

Left crappy, emotionally manipulative call center job for a much more relaxing, higher paying job. Take on crazy projects. 
Currently: 
- indie game project where I am the only artist, it’s slow and challenging work but I am learning so much and will be delighted to complete!
-illustrating a children’s book
-getting ready to release my webcomic

Find out last month that my new job is not going to hire me on full time as I intially thought, and instead they’re letting me go in July all due to budget constraints.
Was planning on relocating to Seattle due to less saturation in creative industries there. Overall more job opportunities, too. 
Not enough funds to move. 
Start looking for some kind of art job that I can apply to right now, something that I could definitely get hired for, but find nothing. 
Start looking for admin jobs. 
Nothing except considerable paycuts and more stress. 
Depression creeping back in.

What the fuck do I do with my stupid life? 

I'm sick of working administrative jobs where, it's childish to say, but I'm kind of always disrespected because it's a peon job or whatever. 
I am capable of working very hard and I accept that I must not be at a hirable skill level, but deciding what path to take is apparently my downfall. 
I can’t get hired because I lack experience, and I’m working for free on all these other projects hoping they will make me look good to employers, but I’m not sure if it will work.  

There seem to be more 3d jobs avaiable in general, in cities that I wouldn’t mind living, but I need to practice a hell of a lot more. I wouldn’t mind dropping everything and dedicating all of my free time into getting better at 3d, but if I stop doing 2d only to have all of my hard work not pay off again… I’m not sure if I could handle the disappointment. 
I love doing 2d, I’m best at it, but I’m finding a 9-5 decent paying (ie: not poverty level) job does not exist. I can do other things, I can use many different programs, but it seems like all of the jobs I’m seeing that are hiring require some other skill that I can’t even lie about having (ie: ability to code or program)
 I’m not sure we live in an economy that can support artists, or maybe I just haven’t worked hard enough. 
PS: I typed in a lot of incomplete sentences and I’m very sorry if it’s painful to read because of this, I was just trying to get it all out as quickly as possible. 
Tl;dr: I am a useless, talentless hack who cannot get a job.  If anyone has any specific advice I would be greatly thankful.

First, background information:

* I graduate in 2014.

* Major: Aerospace/Mechanical Engineering

* Minor: Computer Science

So, I have an internship offer for the summer I have already accepted for a large defense contractor named Raytheon (software engineering). I am also currently in the middle of talking with a couple of very interested people at Lockheed Martin (another defense contractor, software engineering).

In addition, I got accepted to [appacademy.io](http://www.appacademy.io/#p-home) as well.

So, I am kind of torn between working these two options (I am a student, so I am only free for the summer). I do not mind working for a defense contractor at all. I find software fun to program as well as doing web development. But, I am not sure which way to pick.


I am thinking of this... Tell App Academy to hold my admission for some time. Then, take the defense contractor internship and if I don't like it, attend App Academy.

Can I please have your opinions? Thank you for your times!"

Did you miss out on opportunities that would've made your life easier?

In college you always hear about how you're supposed to network and do all these extra activities like frats/soroties and clubs. And you meet those few choice students who do amazing side projects on their own and develop the new facebook or instagram or whatnot.

However I'm a 4th year Computer Engineering student and have never done any of this aside from my Society of Computer Engineers club membership (but even then I only go there to sit and study between classes). My classmates are out there creating amazing side projects and going to job fairs and amassing internships and I just don't have the urge to do any of this.

I take the minimum amount of units to be full-time and I work part-time and I feel like just that is enough to keep me busy at all times (and then add in familial obligations as I still live at home). Though when I see my classmates who have jobs lined up for the future and who all seem to have much more marketable skills than I do (usually from pre-existing knowledge before college which I never had) it makes me feel like I am very much behind the 8 ball in the industry. 

So redditors who took the same path that I am currently on, please share your stories. Are my fears justified? Any advice you can offer?

I ended up spending summer self-studying a bunch of programming languages and programming in general so that by senior year I felt like I was on top of things.

I have some questions about what to put on my resume (already searched /r/cscareerquestions but couldn't find anything relevant):

* **objective section on resume**: yay or nay? I've read one post where they said it's better to put a summary of yourself than a generic objective. The internet has divided opinions on the subject (but Google didn't show up anything specifically for Comp. Science, which is why I'm asking here). My objective currently reads as ""looking for a software development internship."" too bland?

* **list individual courses**: is this a good idea or is it a waste of space? I did this because I figured it would offset my lack of undergrad CS exposure. but after having been to the career fair this semester, i saw that most people just skimmed through that section. *edit: Also, I'm worried that this is eating up space that I could better use to provide more details on my projects.*

* **work experience**: I have work experience (4 years after my undergrad) in VLSI testing and design. not sure if i should include it. there are some transferable skills like mentoring and there was a bit of C coding involved. most of it was VHDL, RTL simulation though, which is not relevant to software development.

**TL;DR**: current Masters in Comp. Sci with unrelated undergrad degree needs advice on internship resumes."

19bcxb,21,2013-02-27,What is an entry level job?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/19bcxb/what_is_an_entry_level_job/,"I am going to try and keep this general, because I think (and I could very well be wrong it happens a lot) this is something a lot of people want to know.

What exactly is an ""entry level"" job or position in the tech or IT sectors? What are the job titles that different types of tech companies (software companies, ISPs, open source foundations, etc...) use?

For example, I have been told that ""QA"" was the entry level job for developers. I didn't know what ""QA"" meant so I gave it a google and found out it meant ""Quality Assurance"" (or some similar variant). I thought to myself ""Finally! I know what to look for!"" So I plugged that in to search engines and all I've found are jobs looking for people with 5+ years in QA. So I need 5 years of experience at an entry level position to get an entry level position? Normally you don't see this kind of recursion outside of poorly written computer science textbooks.

I am not looking for a job that pays over $30,000 USD (GROSS) annually. I am not looking for a job with benefits, long term security, Hell I'm not even looking for a growth position. I am completely aware that these jobs are contract positions farmed out to staffing agencies.

I am not looking to get rich quick. I am not looking to pad my resume with a couple hundred certification acronyms my gut tells me don't mean shit. I just want to know what Microsoft or startups or Amazon or whoever calls their bottom rung. I just want to know what the bottom of the totem pole is. 

So, TL;DR: what are the entry level positions in the most common tech company businesses called?

I finished with my undergrad in psych 3 years ago and am finishing a masters now in industrial organizational psych. I have been working at a consulting firm the last 2 years a week here or there every month or two. The reason I'm saying what I've been doing is to speak to the job prospects I would have in my field. I can remain at the small firm I'm at being treated like scum and barely making enough to get by since jobs are few and far between for the firm or go into HR. 

So 2 years ago I took an entrepreneurship class and loved it. I had an idea for a project and made a website for it and have since made many websites, logos and other design work. I spent a few semesters in a masters architecture career change program in between undergrad and masters psych. I enjoyed it, but none, and I mean none of the recent graduates were finding work so I decided I had to move on. So that's where my background in design comes from. So I've started to learn python and java on my own the last few months and really enjoy it even on a very beginner level. 

There's a masters CS program that's around 50th from the rankings I've found in my city that I'm planning to begin prereq's for this summer through the fall and begin the program in the spring. My gre score was pretty high and the program said with the prereq's I would be admitted. I'm really worried though that even after an internship over one of the summers during an MS that it would be very difficult with my background to find a job. Will my background really hinder me? Is this a reckless decision since I don't have the experience other students will have? I'm also a little worried about the research I've read a little about showing that there is basically two groups in programming, the one's that can and the ones that can't. I'm not afraid of working really hard but am worried that going off the 'I've been good at math in the past' thing might be way too small of a sample size to predict programming aptitude from. I would really appreciate any advice!! :)"

I have a few questions about changes I have thought about making and your input is greatly appreciated: 

* I think I have pretty good internship experience, should I list that ahead of education? Or perhaps my skills summary first? 
* I am pretty sure my first sentence in my skills summary before my bullets is just a waste of space, thoughts? 
* For my programming languages listed, what is a good way to differentiate between the ones I am highly proficient at versus the ones I am only relatively familiar with? 
* I went to a highly recognizable top high school for science and technology in my state- should I keep that information there still? 
* Can I list classes I am currently taking this semester under relevant coursework or what is a good way to show they are still in progress?  I have some classes (database systems, computer security, computer networks) that I want to show I am taking but am not sure how or if this is a good idea since I am still enrolled and it is early in the semester
* Should I include my knowledge of version control (Subversion and Git) under my skills section, or is that something employers assume you know or is not that important?

I have been hearing mixed reports on this, so I'm not really sure what to do. 

P.S. any tips for getting my self settled at UIUC? I'm the first in my family to go to college so this is very new to me. "
19ayyv,7,2013-02-26,Descent,Kinkaypandaz,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/19ayyv/descent/,"As of late I have been reading some of the tales others have shared here on NoSleep, I decided it was time that I share a story of my own. A genuine story that has been quite disturbing for me.

It was late in the fall, the time when most of the leaves are a deep crimson red and the wind is bitterly cold and biting, I was scheduled for a job interview that day. I had applied for an intern ship with a big time oil company. The interview took place in a tall building that seemed to surpass the clouds and the heavens, it hurt my neck looking that far up. I was greeted with the usual business front a warm inviting lobby with a receptionist behind a desk, she looked up at me with a soft smile and said ""How can I help you?"" I returned her smile and said ""I am here for an interview about the internship, can you tell me what floor I am supposed to be on?"" She looked down at her computer for a couple of minutes typing away, still glancing at her computer she said ""You will be seeing Mr. Harkinson on floor 22"" I thanked the receptionist and made my way to the elevator.

I stepped into the elevator and slowly began my ascension to the 22nd floor, while I waited and gazed at myself in the mirror I began to give myself a peptalk ""Alright, you have got to be confident, smooth, make him laugh a little... but be serious!"" The elevator rang as it approached the 22nd floor and the doors parted revealing rows upon rows of cubicles and a large glass board room near the back. A man that was dressed sharper than a sword came out to greet me with a hearty hello and a firm handshake. From there we hit it off, I made him laugh he told me he liked my business ethics and I would make a great addition to the company. 

All I can say is that I was teeming with joy upon hearing this, a little too much though. For when I re-entered the elevator, my excitement got the better of me and I failed to notice that the elevator had went past the lobby and down to the basement of the building. ""Funny,"" I began ""I don't remember there being a basement button."" To my surprise there was no button for the basement as I had previously acknowledged, the elevator stopped with a loud and resonating mechanical whir and the doors parted. There was an empty room ahead nothing in there, I tried to close the doors and return to the lobby but the elevator refused. Thinking that I might be able to find some stairs that led back to the lobby I stepped out of the elevator, just as I did the doors shut and the elevator left me. I searched the empty expanses of the basement for a door but there was nothing. By this point I went from uneasy to nervous

I turned to make my way back to the elevator and there was a man, or what I thought to be a man, standing there, my hairs stood on end seeing this figure and the air chilled me to my core. I couldn't meet the man's gaze not because I didn't look at him but because no eyes met mine. He only had a mouth, which looked as if it was muttering something but it was too silent and indistinct to make sense of. The man begun to slowly shamble towards me still muttering to himself, I froze in fear and panic, his words became more clear as he got closer. He was whispering ""I shall take your eyes..."" 

With what ever strength I could muster I ran past the apparition towards the elevator, furiously tapping the up arrow and slamming my fists on the doors. Glancing over my shoulder I could see him continuing towards me still whispering those horrid words. As he inched closer the lights behind him began to flicker and shut off. I turned to the doors again still banging my fists, but to no avail did the doors open. I felt his breath upon the nape of my neck, his whispers rang loudly in my ears, I whirled around and fell against the door only to meet my him standing before me. He seemed to be intently focused on me, relishing his soon to be eyes. Fear had frozen me again, I stood and watched as he placed his hands on my shoulders and brought his mouth closer to me still whispering ""I shall take your eyes..."" 

I shut my eyes as tight as they could go and waited for the inevitable, I heard his jaw crack and unhinge and I could smell his rancid breath, his mouth centimetres from my face. I heard a loud ding as the doors opened and I fell backwards with loud thump, I opened my eyes to find that I had fallen inside the elevator. I stood up and reached to press the lobby button but before I did I gazed out of the elevator to see the figure standing just before the threshold of the doors, still whispering ""I shall take your eyes...."" With that the doors closed and the elevator made its climb to the lobby. I walked out of there as fast as I could.

I never take the elevator in that building any more. However, I still feel  uneasy, I still hear the faint whispers reminding me ""I shall take your eyes..."" "

First, I think it's awesome that this subreddit exists. It's been hugely helpful to see the kinds of questions and answers that get posted here, and I want to thank you guys for being supportive of those entering this career.


To those wanting to get straight to the point, here is the resume in question (sorry, it's a direct download link): http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12995124/John_Doe_Resume.docx


So about myself, I'm going to be graduating with an M.S. in comp sci this May, and before that I graduated with a B.A. in comp sci and a social sciences major (double major). I went straight from undergrad to grad, so I have no in-between real world experience, and I also have no internship experience. I personally think this is going to be the killer (i.e. biggest downfall) for me, but please correct me if I'm wrong. Anyway, I think I'm a decent programmer, but I also didn't take the all the rigorous CS courses that the B.S.'s had to take (foundations of computing, undergrad algorithms, senior design, etc.) so I may be lacking somewhat in those areas. The biggest concern I have is that people will see M.S. in comp sci and immediately think ""Oh, this guy has a Master's, so he just MUST have all the theory down solid""...truth is, I don't. My school is okay, but they really didn't teach me as much theory as I thought they would in the past 2 years during grad school.


Really the only thing mildly going for me is my teaching experience (been a TA for the past 2 years during grad school), and one year as a graduate research assistant working with robotics (first year grad school).


Also, I'm sure this has some effect but I'm not sure to what degree, but I'm an international student so that automatically closes many doors for me (correct? wrong?). Should I include this on my resume?


Any input at all is greatly appreciated. Thanks for the help in advance."

Thing is, I need to pay for rent/food/etc in that time, and was wondering if it would be at all feasible to try and resurrect my programming skills as a way to get some supplementary income. I'm a little rusty now, but (if I may say so) I was a pretty good programmer back when I was doing it a lot; my original track was a double major in CS/math, although I never pursued any kind of internships or professional experience. Do I have any hope of finding part-time or freelance work, or is there too much competition from people with more experience/expertise than me?

The interview went really well, we basically had a conversation rather than an interview and she even followed up with some emails about the company and how she will get another person to interview me to discuss more technical aspects.

Well now she called and basically said the internship is likely going to another current worker because they need to save money. I guess she tried to lessen the impact by saying that she found me to be the best suited applicant because the primary communication is through the phone and I could actually speak fluent english. 

She said she won't know for certain until next week because they need approval from another higher up who is in another country at the moment but said ""it will likely go through"".

I was kinda dumbfounded by all this and didn't say much other than just agreeing with her and thanking her for the opportunity. What I really should have done is tried to sell my skills to her more, I didn't even ask for a call back if it does go through because I was in shock.

I am quite excited and nervous as this will be my first interview for a programming job. According to what I could read on their website, they aren't looking for a guru but someone who's willing to learn. Still, I know they will be asking technical questions and want to make sure to be ready.

Please do yourself a favor and review the companies that will be attending, the ones you're interested in, and then do some research on that company. Never go up to a company and say, ""so, what do y'all do?"" 

In Capstone and you're about to call a company for questions? Do some research first. Get on the company's webpage and dig around their technical site. Folks like to speak to ""intelligent"" students. 

Have an interview for a full-time, internship, or co-op position? Be early! Do not try to take Atlanta traffic into account if you think you're going to make it ""just in time"". Always have the mindset of being late when driving in Atlanta, especially if you have to drive through Atlanta. Also, if you're going to be more than 30 minutes late, call and cancel the interview (you should call regardless, but an hour is too excessive). Give your excuse and request an interview for a later date. Folks aren't sitting around at work just waiting to interview you, they're more than likely squeezing you into their schedule.

19en7c,6,2013-02-28,"Another depressed, unemployed artist...",foshohammer,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/19en7c/another_depressed_unemployed_artist/,"I actually posted this yeterday, but after having it up an hour I became more and more embarassed with myself for posting and coming off as such a whiner, but today I am more desperate for advice than I am afraid of hurting my pride, so here goes !




I’m really, infinitely sorry for posting this, but I’ve been reading other people’s problems and frustrations and everyone seems to feel better, even if just a little bit, after posting, and I just want to not feel like I’m going crazy anymore. I’m afraid of posting this because, on another internet forum of which I am a member, I asked for related advice and was attacked. I am ashamed to say I am a person who gets offended at words on the internet, and I know how dumb I am. Am I stupid for saying that? Ok onto the bullshit: 

Graduated in ’07 with a BFA, wanted to make video games more than anything else in the world. I knew it would be hard to get a job, and I didn’t even really believe in myself skill-wise, but I thought I could do it if I just worked as hard as I possibly could. School was too expensive, couldn’t seem to get any grants or scholarships, so I had to attend a community college my first year, but it was ok! I was filled with so much hope, and I worked very hard with my studies, got top grades in all of my classes, all while drawing like crazy on the side. Finally got to art school, signed my name onto $80k worth of private loans, but repeating in my mind what my admissions advisor said to me: “You are guarenteed a job!” I was an 18 year old kid with no concept of money: no one in my family went to college, parents didn’t want me to get a “useless” art degree anyway, blah blah blah I know I’m a fucking idiot for signing my name on that line but its in the past and I can’t change it. 
Couldn’t afford to not have a full-time job to pay for rent, food, gas, very little else. Lived off of ramen and got pretty ill after a while because of it, funny story related to this tidbit I will tell at a later time. 
Due to working a 35-40 hour a week job as well as school full time, my homework suffered a little. I could have been much worse with it, but because of my dedication I always received A+ grades, I just knew in my heart that I could have definitely done a lot better if I only had more time to try. One example of this is when I started to learn 3d: the place I worked was shutting down and so I spent more freetime than I wanted on finding something else, including going to my career services and asking for an internship but being denied because… nope, I don’t have any idea. I think the woman there just didn’t like me, I know it sounds like a bullshit excuse but I have no idea why a persistant, capable student was denied an internship. Maybe I just came off as a shithead and she didn’t want to waste anyone’s time, who knows. Anyway, I was better than most of my peers at 3d, but I definitely wasn’t the best, unlike my 2d skills where I was easily the best if not one of the best in all of my classes. (Not bragging or trying to sound confident here, there were/are a lot of people who go to “Video Game School” who have never drawn in their life, and since I started at 14 I had a bit of a head start)

I got better and better, and to date I’d say I’m a good artist (not great, excellent, amazing, etc.) and with fresh degree in hand, I landed an interview. It actually went amazingly well, but I did not get the job. I think I failed the art test because it was in 3d and not 2d where I am most strong, and there must have simply been a stronger candidate. Had to move home due to lack of funding (quit my job the last four months of school to focus on portfolio work) and back in with my mom in Indiana. 
Depression set in halfway through my BFA, and I hesitated to type this because I can still hear my mother saying “Depression isn’t a real illness” in the back of my mind, but it’s definitely real and it’s so, so awful. My relationships were strained, and luckily that was the only thing that suffered while in college, but after I got out and failed at getting the job I had worked so hard for, it took away everything. Because of strained relationships in college, I have limited contacts. In this industry I have heard a million times that it’s not about how good you are, but who you know. Fucked myself over pretty big I guess. 
I finally got a job doing something administrative, just to pay the bills. Sallie Mae calls and informs me of my impending $1100/month student loan payments. My job at the time paid around minimum wage, I made about $1000 a month. Keep applying, but notice that drawing becomes more and more difficult. 
Some life drama happens including all friends from college dropping off the face of the earth, my 14 year old dog died, a sinus infection with no health insurance, bf becomes distant, some other things too etc.
 Stop drawing altogether. 

2009: Move to Oregon with $1000 in my pocket, get an admin job, start drawing again. Risky, but I moved to be closer to more relevant jobs!
Admin job is at a call center, “hostile work environment”, too exhausted to work at night, but am able to create some things. 
Had my boyfriend of ten years fuck me over, long story short: I was working to support the both of us while he found a job in his industry of study, he was supposed to do the same for me. Once he landed a job (after 2.5 years of virtual unemployment) I quit my job to take a risky position as an artist at a start-up company. He couldn’t support us because he was shitty with money, we end up breaking up after he tells me he hasn’t loved me for years anyway. The start-up company tells me not to come back via email due to lack of work on their end. Extreme depression. Crawl back to my call center job after a month of desperately seeking employment. 
Start to feel myself again slowly but surely. An internet guy I was extremely close to in college (but the ex hated that I talked to) comes back into my life. He tells me he believes in me, and gets me to believe again, too. I start creating more. Internet guy visits and eventually moves here to upgrade into boyfriend status. We are finally happy! 
With something in my life going correctly, I start becoming more and more productive. Do some 3d freelance on the side, it exhausts me working so much, and 3d is infinitely frustrating since I’m not great at it, but I feel I am finally using my degree! One of my clients is a small company that sells ideas to Adidas. Most of my projects involve Adidas things, so when I later saw Adidas hiring an on-site, 3d Artist, I put together my portfolio and applied. Denial email less than 24 hours later. Accept that I must be just “passable” at 3d and definitely not “good” but I should simply work harder if I want to be employed doing it. Fighting off feeling really down about this acceptance. 

Stop doing freelance after this setback, but started doing projects that involve 2d things I enjoy more. 
Left crappy, emotionally manipulative call center job for a much more relaxing, higher paying job. Take on crazy projects. 
Currently: 
- indie game project where I am the only artist, it’s slow and challenging work but I am learning so much and will be delighted to complete! 
-illustrating a children’s book 
-getting ready to release my webcomic

Find out last month that my new job is not going to hire me on full time as I intially thought, and instead they’re letting me go in July all due to budget constraints. Was planning on relocating to Seattle due to less saturation in creative industries there. Overall more job opportunities, too. Not enough funds to move. 
Start looking for some kind of art job that I can apply to right now, something that I could definitely get hired for. Doing something creative, ANYTHING would make me feel less depressed and useless. Find nothing. 
Start looking for admin jobs. Nothing except considerable paycuts and more stress. Depression creeping back in.

What the fuck do I do with my stupid life? 

I'm sick of working administrative jobs where, it's childish to say, but I'm kind of always disrespected because it's a peon job or whatever. I am capable of working very hard and I accept that I must not be at a hirable skill level, but deciding what path to take is apparently my downfall. I can’t get hired because I lack experience, and I’m working for free on all these other projects hoping they will make me look good to employers, but I’m not sure if it will work. 
There seem to be more 3d jobs avaiable in general, in cities that I wouldn’t mind living, but I need to practice a hell of a lot more. I wouldn’t mind dropping everything and dedicating all of my free time into getting better at 3d, but if I stop doing 2d only to have all of my hard work not pay off again… I’m not sure if I could handle the disappointment. I love doing 2d, I’m best at it, but I’m finding a 9-5 decent paying (ie: not poverty level) job does not exist. I can do other things, I can use many different programs, but it seems like all of the jobs I’m seeing that are hiring require some other skill that I can’t even lie about having (ie: ability to code or program) I’m not sure we live in an economy that can support artists, or maybe I just haven’t worked hard enough. 
PS: I typed in a lot of incomplete sentences and I’m very sorry if it’s painful to read because of this, I was just trying to get it all out as quickly as possible. 


Tl;dr: I am a useless, talentless hack who cannot get a job. If anyone has any specific advice I would be greatly thankful.
