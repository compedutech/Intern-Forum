gua3j8,2,2020-05-31,I can't decide whether to accept a full-time role or to pursue another job with a different company.,rushbucks,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/gua3j8/i_cant_decide_whether_to_accept_a_fulltime_role/,"Hey guys, pretty new to this subreddit so I guess this post would fall under needing employment advice.

So I am currently a rising senior in college working in a business-related internship with a Fortune 500 company. The people have been amazing that I work alongside and I have a lot of respect for those I work with...however, I would not currently be interested in wanting to work in the current role I am in full-time, but would be open to applying for other roles within the company.

Meanwhile, there's another large company that I have longed for over a year now to work for. They host several college and post-college programs, with a few of these programs targeted towards my personal interests. For lack of a better way to say it, I have a huge passion for this brand and want to work for this organization more than anything.

It seems like I have already made up my mind on what I want to do, but here's the options I am faced with: I, and the rest of the interns I'm working with, have almost been promised full-time positions during our orientation if we so choose to accept by the end of the summer. Meanwhile, I would not be able to apply to work with this other company until January 2021.

What advice would you give to someone who is risking job security to lean towards a role that I feel would make me happy? Am I wrong for be willing to throw away an potentially-guaranteed job offer upon graduation for an organization that I possibly might not even get to work for after I apply? The anxiety of this decision has been burdening my mind and I want to enjoy this summer with the incredible people I'm surrounded by, but keep worrying about tarnishing my connections I'm making to pursue a separate company that I withhold a lot of passion for.

If you need any further details from me, I'll be happy to respond. I just want to enjoy this internship to its fullest extent without having continuous anguish about throwing away job security."

gucqfz,16,2020-05-31,"25YO, Graduating in August, 90,000CAD in BC/federal student debt. I have some savings. What is the most effective use of the money?",slrepayment,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/gucqfz/25yo_graduating_in_august_90000cad_in_bcfederal/,"I have 90kCAD student debt because I am disabled and my undergrad degree took 8 years to complete. No other debt. Strong credit rating. No real assets/investments. $1250/mo expenses in Victoria, BC, but eager to move. No income until I secure a post-grad job.

Luckily, because of disability grants, CESB, a previous internship, and reduced spending due to COVID, I was able to save some money (&gt;10kCAD) over the past year.

There are a few ways I was thinking of using it:

* Pay down some of the 90,000CAD debt in a lump-sum payment.
* Use the savings as a buffer during job-hunting as a new graduate. My major is software engineering, so I think putting in the time to prepare for a competitive job could be worthwhile in the long-run. I could grind alg/data structures, for example, and aim for a FAANG job. I have very relevant internship experience, too.
* Keep some of the savings as an emergency fund.
* Some combination of the above.

What are the most effective use(s) of the money? What should my priorities be when trying to pay down the debt?"

After all is said and done it will have taken me a little more than 5 academic years to finish my degree with a \~3.3 GPA with several classes retaken. The setback is mainly explained by being diagnosed with a chronic medical condition and the difficulties I've faced while learning to adjust to a different lifestyle.

While at college, I worked as an investment analyst intern at a VC firm for about a year, and I'll be starting work as a technical product manager at a Series-A startup backed by top 10 VC firms. Eventually, I'd like to go to a T10 business school, but I'm worried about how my undergraduate transcript will affect my chances of admission.

It'd be helpful to hear your thoughts and advice on how to make up for this blemish (additional coursework? A whole graduate degree?) as I begin to start my career. I figure it's better to start planning as early as possible. Additionally, what are actionable ways to take advantage of having GSB/HBS/Wharton/Kellogg alums in my network, if any?

Thanks in advance!"

I have been fortunate to get an internship/permanent role in a company that deploys network configurations and management of client networks. Sadly that company got bought by an ISP and morale and productivity took a turn for the worst so I jumped ship. I have been a network engineer for the past 3 past years. 

I recently got an offer to do an internship at a fintech company. The new role is systems related and automation. I had no idea what I was walking into and wanted to avoid specializing so soon as I will graduate from college in 2021. 

Today marks a month into the internship and I am very much frustrated about this internship and regretful that I left the previous role. While I am only here for until mid September I cannot find the motivation to do the role as expected. 

Is this normal? 

The reason I ask is that my mentor kept initially talking about staying on part time if I exceed expectations. I am not sure my mentor has realized it does not motivate me/surprise me as my mentor does not mention as often anymore."
gum66i,1,2020-06-01,Python or Java? (need an advice here),isaxved,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/gum66i/python_or_java_need_an_advice_here/,"Hi people,

Due to some circumstances, I need to get a job as a junior or intern web developer.

And I have stumbled to a crossroads, whether I should learn Python/Django or continue to learn Java/Spring. And my main aim for the future 4-5 years is to get to FAANG. 

If there will be a need for any details, I will be happy to support with them. 

According to my investigations  (no source, probably Quora, YouTube or Medium), there are the following:

Pros (+) and Cons (-) for Python:

\+ Easy to grasp.

\+ Low job entry level for a beginner. (Fewer legacy projects).

\+ Multipurpose language.

\+ Good for Leetcode/interviews.

Pros (+) and Cons (-) for Java: 

\+ Have some background; core and advanced (no projects).

\-  Higher entry level for a junior position.

\+ More fundamental?

\-+ More complex.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems that python overweight Java, but here is the real thing that bothers me. In the future, insha'Allah, I am planning to get to FAANG as a fresh grad or intern. So, how my experience with Python/Java will affect my chances to get through the screening process?

Since I have read (no source, probably Quora or Medium) that one should choose wisely, as top tech has some biases to some technologies. 

I am currently a 1.5-year student with some background in core and advanced PHP, Java. 

I will be more than happy to have your advice! :) 

Thanks in advance."
gum9sb,2,2020-06-01,Confused Rising College Junior with a Double Major in CS and Psych,csandpsych,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/gum9sb/confused_rising_college_junior_with_a_double/,"Hey Everyone, was just looking for some guidance or advice - and was hoping I could find some here. 

For some background, I go to a liberal arts college in the US, and have just finished my sophomore year of college. I had a research position lined up for the summer (as there was the potential for returning back to campus in mid to late June) but it has just been cancelled earlier this week. As the title mentions I'm interested in both CS and Psych but I'm not sure what to do for the summer. I have been scouring internship and job sites for the past couple of days - and have applied to a few, but am not sure how lucky I will be with those. Is trying to find an internship for the summer too late at this point, would it make sense to just focus on something else for the summer? I feel lost and unsure of what the next best steps for me to do are. 

As a side note, I was wondering what other opportunities there are for people with CS degrees besides programming. I have taken 5 CS courses by this point, and while I find programming interesting at times, I also sometimes find it extremely frustrating. Are there other things that a CS degree could be useful for besides have a desk programming job, and does anyone have any experience in those kind of environments. Any advice would be really appreciated!"
gumtrh,9,2020-06-01,One year out with nothing - where should I be looking?,neutral_applause,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/gumtrh/one_year_out_with_nothing_where_should_i_be/,"I graduated a year ago with a CS degree and math minor. I'm now competing with 2020 graduates as well as people who were unemployed before COVID as well as people who are unemployed because of COVID. I've applied to places in states up and down the country (US) - NYC, NJ, Austin, Seattle, CT, VT, DC. I've talked to at least three recruiters from job placement companies who sent my resume out with no results. I was about to start a job with Infosys before they put a freeze on everything, so while my post title might be slightly misleading, now I'm just back where I started. I'm not exclusively trying to get into FAANG. I think I would be perfectly content at most companies, barring those that blatantly mishandle their employees. I've applied for software developer, software engineer, data analyst, Java developer, Python developer, C++ developer, and other, more specifically-titled postings.

Here is what I'm guilty of: I graduated without any internship experience. Early on in my post-graduation experience, I was a little picky in telling a recruiter or two that I was unable of moving to certain locations, either because I had just lived there for 4 years and was done with it (my college town) or because I wanted to live in or near a city. I had been working at a movie theater while job searching, which definitely made me less consistent in sending out applications, and I had even stopped for a period of time. I've said no to other consulting companies due to terms of their contracts.

So here's what I'm asking - where should I be looking? What types of companies or positions should I be looking at? What locations in the country are going to be more open for work, if any (considering the current state of affairs, let's say pre-COVID)? I'm going to apply to more help desk positions to at least get a tech job. Location-wise, at this point, I'm open to a lot of places. I just feel like I'm getting closer and closer to being unable to secure a job."

He bought her a big pot of flowers/plants, but when I got home she said to throw it away and burn it. She said I am irresponsible, a liar, and a pig. She thinks everything I do has to do with drugs or sex. She told me to stay in my room for the next month, but she cant even do that when she works??? I am drained and tired of my mom constantly yelling at me for going out. She never lets me in general do anything. She constantly tells me my friends are bad influences even when she doesnt know them- she says they are dumb and lazy. I am just frustrated and dont know how to deal with this or make it any better. Im going back to college soon and I am still in need of a car, but she is refusing to let me get one and that is a slight problem because when I start school, I will be having an internship off campus at a PT clinic and I will need transportation. Yes, there is the bus and all, but will I really be allowed to use that with her being so paranoid about the coronavirus??"
guoc1i,2,2020-06-01,JP Morgan TAP program... maybe not what I expected?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/guoc1i/jp_morgan_tap_program_maybe_not_what_i_expected/,"Hi there. In one month and a half, I will start as a TAP intern at JP Morgan. I passed the interviews and everything (I was called for the interview when I literally thought I missed my chance). So, also did the questionnaire where they ask you what would you like to do and how much coding would you like to do (to which I said 75% of my workday).

So, I had the talk with my manager a few weeks ago. As I understood, my role would be working as something like Systems Analyst with Grafana. I tried to make him understand that I wanted to code and develop, and by his reaction, I had a feeling that was not going to be the case...

So, I was wondering if anyone could give me some insight into how does the TAP program address this? Will this be my final position? Do they change you into a different position during the program?

What should I do? They did not give me any further details and I am terrified of contacting them for this. (This is my first internship and for making things worst, it is going to be WFH, I really hope to jump into the full SE program they have afterwards)

Thanks for your replies :)"

gurj5c,3,2020-06-01,Is the name of the school on my diploma pigeonholing me into a field that I have no interest in?,[deleted],careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/gurj5c/is_the_name_of_the_school_on_my_diploma/,"This is a throwaway because this post is kind of rant-y and will probably make me look like an idiot, but I need answers.

Last year I graduated from Wake Forest University with a bachelor's degree in physics. My original plan was to earn a master's and work in either the semiconductor or photonics industry. (This might sound like a dumb or over-complicated plan, at the time it was the most sense-making option and Wake offered me the most financial aid of any school I got into). Unbeknownst to me at the time, the WFU brand gets a ton of recognition in business, but virtually zero in anything else.

Come senior year I didn't have the qualifications to make it into any such program so I had to hedge my bets on WFU's career office helping me come up with a backup plan, which was not to be. STEM companies at Wake's career fairs were few and far between, and those who did show up were strictly gate-kept in terms of GPA. Instead of trying to advise me on ways I could still get into field of my interest, the career advisors I met with put all their effort into selling me on ways that business-related stuff should be STEM enough for me. I was in awe of how few shits they evidently gave about my own interests. God forbid they let one person deviate and not be used as part of a statistic to help elevate their status as a business institution.

After that headache, I realized I was basically left to my own devices. To supplement my active job search, I uploaded a CV to Monster (Was not aware that this was a way to get spammed to death at the time) to see if it would get any bites. My only mention-worthy experience to that point (and now to this point in time as well) was my internships in experimental research laboratories. Since uploading my document to that site, I've received on average 3 or 4 phone calls and/or emails per month from recruiters who found me through it, and every last one of them has been contacting me on behalf of some business-related vacancy. Not even something that might remotely make sense for my discernible skill set like data analytics, it's usually for something in the bent of sales rep or client advisor. Where does anything in my experience or skills insinuate that I might even be a decent match for that kind of position? It has to be the name of the school that's compelling recruiters to annoy me about this sort of thing. That combined with my lack of success up to this point in my active job search is giving me a complex and making me question whether I will eventually be able to find work that is of some interest to me.

Did I play myself so hard by that hard by going to a school whose only recognition comes from its business program that I unwittingly signed the death warrant for my chances of getting into anything else?

My active job search has been mostly focused on academic research positions since I did enjoy doing that to a degree and I know it's one of the few things my gimp degree is actually viable for. I have made it to second round interviews at some tech companies as for positions like technical writer and data analyst, but I'm always a backup candidate in those scenarios, not really how to overcome that unless the first-choice candidate catches corona or something. I have been a finalist at some of said academic research positions as well, but the lack of succeeding at getting an offer in any of the above is disheartening to say the least."

gus1g4,1,2020-06-01,Psychology PhD admissions,deutschegal,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/gus1g4/psychology_phd_admissions/,"Hi everyone! I'm an overly anxious master's student in Germany thinking about my next steps and I would love some advice. I got my undergrad in neuroscience and psychology in 2019 and started my master's in neuroscience just last September. I'm planning on receiving my degree in about a year and have been strongly considering going for a PhD program in psychology once I'm done here. The thing is that I'm interested in quite a few subfields and I also have a severe case of imposter syndrome, so I have no idea where to begin and if I'm a good candidate yet. My undergrad GPA was good (3.83) and I worked in 2 psych labs (approx. 1 year in each) during that time. I also completed a summer research internship in Germany for a few months, but unfortunately wasn't able to actively contribute to some of the more interesting parts (like data collection or analysis). I will be working in 2 labs over the next year, after which I will complete my master's thesis. Currently I'm strongly interested in all things emotions, especially social emotions. However, I'm also intrigued by the interplay between sleep and memory. I'm also interested in anxiety disorders. So I really feel like my interests cover a few different subfields and have no idea how I would decide a psych program to apply to since they're often split into clinical, cognitive and social, for example. I'd love to get any advice or thoughts on this. Additionally, I'm unsure of what my next steps should be immediately after my master's. Would it make more sense to take a gap year and find work in a psych lab to narrow down my interests further, or is my current experience enough to get me into a good PhD program? Please help! Thanks!"
gust0z,2,2020-06-01,Interviewing for a Better Internship Even Though I just Started an Internship,bite_me_punk,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/gust0z/interviewing_for_a_better_internship_even_though/,"Last summer I interned full time at a nonprofit in their finance department. The pay was good, but the organization wasn’t super well run and I was able to carve out a much bigger role for myself than a typical intern. As a result, I got several solid references that like me.

This summer my internship recruiting plans didn’t quite go how I wanted due to coronavirus, but I reached out to my internship from last summer. They were happy to have me back and they even increased my pay by a $1, but they weren’t able to get the better title I wanted approved.

Today was my first day. I’m working remote and it’s the same work as last summer, which means I probably won’t learn anything new. The pay is good though and I need something on my resume for the summer. Then this afternoon I got a phonecall about interviewing at a different internship that I was interested in—similar pay and hours but a different experience.

I’m interviewing at the end of next week and I would probably know whether I got it the week after all.

How wrong is this, ethically speaking? And what are the likely consequences if I accept the job and quit this internship two weeks in? Can I ever use those people as references again? Do the ethics outweigh the benefits?

Thanks!"

1. What skills should I be looking to add to my resume? And on my resume where should I list skills I obtained through self study?

2. I have been told to develop a portfolio, what kind of projects are impressive?

3. I have thought about internships but everyone I have applied to wants a junior or senior working on their bachelors? Are their internships available for Just us Associates Degree holders?

4. What things disappoint you about candidates that you don’t hire? In other words, what are the main reasons you are not hiring someone?

guthqn,3,2020-06-01,Recent graduate in need of guidance,RunningOnEmptea,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/guthqn/recent_graduate_in_need_of_guidance/,"I am having a hard time figuring out where to go from here. Would really appreciate any kind of insight or advice. I just graduated with a bachelor's in Economics from an accredited state university after 6 years (18-24, 3.4 GPA). Unfortunately I had to drag things out longer than I would have liked because I ended up getting a restaurant job to help pay for housing at my brother's apartment.

School background:

When I first went to college I went in with the impression that I would figure out what I wanted to do along the way. As a result I selected a major in a field that I found interesting and relatively easy to understand without any thought about what the job prospects may look like on the other side. Needless to say I did not figure out jack. I also fell into the trap of; ""i'll figure it out when I graduate, i'll have a degree after all so everything should be fine!"". Wow, what a moron. In hindsight I would have gone back to get a degree in something that could directly translate into a job such as insurance or accounting.

The knowledge that I did manage to accumulate is centered around decision making and qualitative analysis. For example: the price of crude oil dropped to astronomically low levels earlier this year and world leaders would need to step in to bring the price to sustainable levels again otherwise a ton of oil producers would go bankrupt. A lot of their procedures involved cutting supply and turning off oil drillers. As a result the supply of oil became tighter and prices should climb when demand comes back online.

Most of it boils down to understanding how to make the most utilitarian decisions based on limited resources. Obviously I did not apply this in my actual life.

Retail stock trading experience:

Some of the decision making skills that I have accumulated I have translated into making investments. That crude oil example I gave above lead me to making an investment decision that yielded a decent bit of money, which I used to pay off a small percentage of my student loans (down from 25k to 20k). I enjoy making these investments but I don't think its sustainable, opportunities don't happen everyday and it doesn't always go the way I intend. It can also be stressful times, not to mention tedious and very boring working alone.

Work experience:

I've been working in the same restaurant for 4 years, I started out as a busser at 20, was promoted to server at 21 and shift lead server at 23. I really got sucked into the easy money and sense of camaraderie from serving. School became more of an afterthought. That was a mistake but unfortunately I can't change the past. Due to this I did not think about getting any real internship experience and I graduated with a bunch of skills irrelevant to my degree.

The best thing about working in a restaurant for me was the the camaraderie, I really did enjoy the team work aspect. Other than that it can be very stressful between the customers and management. Not to mention little room for advancement. It's not something I want to make a career out of, let alone even can anymore.

Much of the skills from a restaurant job are pretty straight forward:

Customer service, basic math competence, communication, coordinating with other staff and time management (when to start appetizers, main courses, drinks, desserts etc.). Unfortunately I was laid off along with many others across the industry. Sad to see, there are some really pleasant and hard working people out there in restaurants.

Where I am at right now and what I am considering. I would appreciate any kind of insight:

I am still living with my brother and collecting a decent amount from unemployment (CARES Act gives me a generous stipend every week). This is going to run out soon in July and I think its time to start getting proactive (hence this post).

Ideally I would like to get into a tolerable 9-5 job that has benefits and room for growth. Also one that isn't too stress inducing, I am not overly concerned with pay.

Would it be possible for me to get into something like underwriting or some other sort of entry level analysis job? One where I can bounce ideas off of other people, hear what they have to say and make decisions based on acquired data? Are there any entry level jobs out there that I could get into at my current position? Are there any certifications that I can work towards that would aide me in getting a job? Should I look into getting a Master's?

As a side note I have considered the military (would have loved to) but I have a permanently disqualifying condition that cannot be waived (anaphalaxis induced by peanut allergies).

Here is the fourteenth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?That's completely up to what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.

All the best,

gv0kij,12,2020-06-02,I need some advice,horriblyamazing,udub,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/gv0kij/i_need_some_advice/,"As a preface, I would like to acknowledge that there are multiple things I could have done along the way to prevent this and also to take full responsibility for my mistakes.

Last September I was accepted to UW and directly admitted to Foster as a freshman. I did running start and was able to complete almost all of the required lower division classes. As a result, I’ve had the opportunity to complete my degree (finance) within 2 years, which I am currently working towards.

Under my current plan, assuming nothing major changes, I am on track to graduate next spring. This would normally be great if it were not for the fact that I don’t have an internship this summer and will be graduating without ever securing one. Doing running start was great, but applying to summer finance positions as a small town high school student made it very difficult to secure an internship then.

When I was admitted into UW at the fall, I was admittedly overwhelmed with all the networking and recruiting and was a bit of a mess. Eventually, I got things sorted out, granted later than most, but was able to get an internship offer. Although I got an offer, I ended up turning it down. I turned the offer down because 1) I was still talking with several other recruiters and things looked promising and 2) I had a very short timeline to decide on the offer without the opportunity to postpone. Unfortunately, things didn’t work out with the other companies and in the end, I have been left without an offer.

So now I’m sort of stuck here in a tricky situation and I am not really sure what the best course of action would be. I am really worried that I will be graduating and won’t be able to get a full-time offer. Any advice offered would be greatly appreciated as I am completely unsure what my next steps should look like."

It’s odd to me that many Americans have a hard time discussing salary. I’ve tried asking my friends in the same field but they’re shy about it. Unfortunately this leads to a lack of transparency in this field. I was hoping you all could help give me an approximation of how much I can realistically negotiate for, given my credentials? Thank you preemptively. 

I’m a recent grad with 3 business related Summer internships under my belt, one belonging to the company I plan on going full time with. They are Accounting, Project Management, and Financial Analysis related respectively. My future role would be a “Financial Analyst”. This company is a F500 located in a city that has a cost of living thats 135.00 if the national average is 100.00. Average rent is $1600 and the average salary is $70,000 with median household income around $90-100k. The company’s industry is Computer Products and Electronic Components. 

I’m also planning on getting my CFA/Masters if that helps in any way too. 

I am aiming realistically for $60,000 but I didn’t want misinformation or a lack of it cost me what I may deserve! 

Appreciate the read if you’re this far, and whatever insights y’all might have! &lt;3"
gv1ue9,4,2020-06-02,no one cares,throwawaytodayloll,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/gv1ue9/no_one_cares/,"Content warning: race issues

My ex was black and he used to throw me around. His excuse was that I was autistic and racist (I am not either). My alleged 'racism' (an example being me not pointing out how there were no black people in the movie we were watching -spy kid) was so bad according to him that his violence was justified. And he claimed that I was too autistic to understand how bad my racism was, so even though his violence was bad, it was justified. I was brainwashed. I even bought him a house and a car with my inheritance because ""I only had money and he didn't because I was white.""

But after almost 2 years of being together I decided enough was enough. I realized I would fail out of grad school if I stayed and so I stood up for myself. I said that even if I was racist, that didn't give him the right to throw me around. Calling him the n-word for the first time after hearing him call me a bitch for years was empowering. I told him to get out. I got a restraining order against him. And the moment I kicked him out is when the ptsd started.

I could barely leave my house. Every noise made me jump. I tried going to the police station a week later but I didn't have bruises so they didn't even let me in the door. I tried getting his name off the deed to my house but we weren't married so the judge at family court laughed in my face. I failed my comp anyways and my advisor told me she thought I had a learning disability because of how poorly I did in the preceding few weeks and that she thought I'd never be able to get a phd.

I spent the next month drinking. Some guy even had sex with me while I was passed out but it wasn't traumatic because I don't remember.Then I spent the next 4 months abusing the fuck out of adderall so that I could work through the ptsd and pass my second attempt at my comp, which I did.

Fast forward 2.5 years from the day I left him. Now I only get really triggered when black people talk about racism (especially when they blame white people), or say the word bitch. Well this week hasn't been great for me. Everyone and their mother is posting on social media about how black people get to protest and riot amid a global fucking pandemic because of 'years of pent up traumatic anger.' Are. You. Fucking. Kidding. Me.I've been forbidden from posting ANYTHING on social media about how some black people are bad and racist, about how it's not white people's job to fix racism, etc. The only reason I haven't been fired is because when things were really bad and I was posting stupid shit on facebook, the human resources department took pity on me since my posts made it clear that I was only posting because of what had happened to me, even though some of my 'friends' tried to cancel me over it. They said it could never happen again though. I just have to suck up my years of pent up traumatic anger but other people are allowed to post theirs because they're black. And they get the support of everyone around them.

I tried posting something tonight on facebook. It wasn't exactly about race. It said 'stay home, save lives ya hypocrites.' And my current boyfriend, who's been there to comfort me for the past 2 years and has helped me grow past all the bad things that have happened to me, finally had enough. He didn't want to help tonight. He said he couldn't deal with this and that he didn't want to speak to me for the rest of the night. He said "" I'm not breaking up with you over this, and I appreciate you're working on it. But I can't be in a relationship where I'm looking over my shoulder to see if my partner is throwing herself off a bridge that minute "" I deleted it and apologized and asked him to just tell me he loves me. His response - not tonight. It was his night off and he didn't want to deal with my issues tonight.

I just want to be held and told that I have the right to feel hurt and the right to be upset.

I bet any comments here will just be people trying to get me to see the black perspective. That's what everyone does when I share this kind of thing. I was even kicked out of a domestic violence support group because the black intern started crying at me when I started opening up about my triggers and explaining how she 'understands' interracial relationships because of the difficulties her black dad had with her white mom (and for the record her dad was abusive, but in that moment his blackness usurped the abusiveness and all she could talk about was how horrible he had it for being black).

Just STOP SHOVING BLACKNESS DOWN MY THROAT. I AM SICK OF IT."

Hope you all have a very nice day wherever you are. As the title suggests, I need some advice on what to do with my current situation.

I have been living in France from late November 2018 with my wonderful girlfriend and our lovely cat in our studio apartment close to Paris. I did manage to secure one job as a customer service agent during this time which I was working at for 7-8 months, but was forced to quit due to my mother getting critically ill with stage 4 cancer and my job could not afford me going on a non-official nor official temporary leave.  My mother lives alone and has not many family members besides me to help her out, I needed to take the time to go back to Sweden and help her out for a bit until her health recovered a bit. Therefore I left my job signed under force majeure and has not had the time to apply for financial aid (if I would even get any).

Now I have been without a job for 3 and soon 4 months and doing well thanks to the support of my girlfriend. It's getting really tough being out of work and just sitting home all day so I have been spawning some ideas on what to do when the quarantine ends (which it now has as of 11th of May), and I've decided that I want to learn french and look for jobs involving intermediate to advanced computer skills. What I mean by that is basically repairing, cleaning, upkeep, and building computers or phones, tablets etc. Since I have a long personal interest and history with technologies like this.

I do not have a diploma corresponding to these required sets of skills and I want to ask you guys if you think I need to start learning french before I go for a diploma, internship or apprenticeship in this field? I have been looking around computer repair shops a little in the immediate area but they are pretty small shops with no special directed web page about possible hiring positions.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR 21 Y/O Swedish dude not having a job in France and needing advice about if I should start learning french or go for a diploma or similar experience in the IT field.

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts would be incredibly helpful and I thank you a lot for your time reading this.

&amp;#x200B;

edit: I also do not have much financial privilege in this matter either so I have a hard time finding something that would fit my current financial situation as diplomas usually costs a bit of money to some extent."
gvbooz,1,2020-06-02,How do you do programming?,NaraRayui,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/gvbooz/how_do_you_do_programming/,"Hello, i'm new to this subredit and i'm sorry if it's a bit out of topic in here. I just want to do a bit sharing, if it's violate any regulation in this subredit, you can warn me or delete this post straight away. Not that i haven't read the pinned post, but currently i've got an headache so i just read it shortly.

So I have been in this area for six years. It all started when I was in high school, the school had a software engineering major and I happened to be in it. I really did not know anything about the computer world at the time and was not really interested in getting involved in it. At that time I just went with the flow without knowing where I was going.

Long story short I just found my reason to remain in this area a few moments when I will graduate. I have a dream in it, to the point that I beg my parents to allow me to enter a university that has a major that I dearly want (Mobile Programming). Years in high school I have not really been serious about learning programming, so I have great hopes for the university I chose. But unfortunately the knowledge taught at the university did not differ greatly from what I had learned in high school, and not to mention the knowledge that I most wanted to learn (Mobile Programming) was only taught last year. Of course before that happened I had begun to explore the knowledge at the beginning of the first semester independently, but I really hoped to get a place that could help me to study better and deeper. I felt I had really wasted a lot of time, moreover I came to really realize it after I start do an internship. I really felt that I was still far from being a programmer and that made me quite depressed. Since the intermship, I often experience lack of sleep to complete the tasks assigned to me (No one forced me, this is my own will). It has been more than half a year running and until now I still feel all of that still cannot make me a programmer. I began to wonder where my mistake in studying and came to this post.

It already midnight in my country. I should still be doing the assignment that was given to me, but instead I sat in this living room while wondering where was my mistake..

So .. enough with sharing, I want to ask, how do you do programming? For example:

1. Make a flow
2. Starting the project
3. Looking for knowledge on the internet
4. Having an error
5. Looking for a solution
6. Return to step number 3
7. Complete the project

That is more or less what I have done so far. How about you guys?

PS: Sorry for my bad english, i just did a quick Google translate and a bit fixing it because of my headache.


Edit: Come to think of it maybe it was the way of my thinking. Can you guys tell me what did you do to solve a problem or what did you do to got the answer you want? It can be the way you surfing on the internet to found an answer or any activities that you might think of."

All of it happened pretty suddenly, my boss said I did a stellar job with my last project. Now, I got a 'promotion', and I am leading a team of 2 junior dev, 2 interns. Junior devs need handholding but they know -some- stuff. The two interns don't know much at all and require need quasi constant supervision. I am going at a pretty fast pace, so I am constantly pushing code. The interns always get stuck rebasing their stuff on my code since they have almost no knowledge of how to use git or what the workflow is. It usually takes them 3-5 days to complete a half-day task, which is fair enough for an intern, but I feel like I am failing them. The junior devs know basic git, but they can only handle elementary tasks and I clean up after them quite often because I don't want to keep asking them to fix their PRs.

This is something I never considered when I worked as a dev - I need to now consider the strengths, challenges and skill level of my team members. This really has exposed me to a few 'areas' where I lack as a (potential) project manager. I really want all four of them to be good, I want to help them excel at what they're doing.

They actually contacted our organization directly to introduce themselves and let us know about the program. At first, I was intrigued because they were aligned with Dr. Serena McCalla, who seemed to have some great credentials in terms of research mentorship. She wasn't just a current college student, so I was willing to hear them out and ask more questions.

Fast forward a couple weeks later, and I find out directly from one of the program organizers that Dr. Serena McCalla was dropping out of the program and would not be associated with it anymore. Huuuge red flag, given that she was the only legitimate person on the team. There are a few students with research competition experience and some accolades, but overall, I would not touch this program with a ten-foot pole. It's brand new, expensive, and doesn't seem to make much sense (online research program). 

Anyways, this reminded me of an article I wrote last year on how to identify worthwhile summer programs. I've been seeing a lot of posts asking about this lately, so I'm going to repost my article here. If you want to read the article directly on our blog, you can check it out [here](https://www.theadmissionsangle.com/2019/01/10/summer-programs-for-high-school-students/).

## Summer Programs for High School Students

*There are a number of ways for a high school student to spend their  summers: studying for the SAT/ACTs, working on personal projects,  interning, or attending a summer program for high school students. Find  out if the summer program you’ve found is worth the cost.* 

&amp;#x200B;

In January  and February, one of the most common questions I get from parents or  high school students is in some form related to what a student should be  doing during their summer vacation. Should they apply for a research  program? Have the father pull some strings for an internship at his old  college roommates firm? Enroll in an SAT/ACT program to boost scores?  Community Service? College tours? Or can they just relax and be a kid?

Unfortunately,  the answer to this question is not a simple one. Depending on what year  the student is in and what kind of test scores they already have, the  answer can certainly vary. In short, there are definitely some organized  summer programs in mathematics, science, business, creative writing or  art, leadership, and computer science that are definitely worth applying  for if you can put forth a competitive application. Many of these  worthwhile programs are hyper-competitive, sometimes reporting  acceptance rates lower than your chances of getting into Harvard or  Princeton. But if accepted, they represent a very sparkly addition to  any high school student’s resume.

However, I would say that the  vast majority of the summer programs that my students find online are  simply, not worth the cost of admission. It’s become an increasingly  growing trend for many of the top US universities to host “summer  programs” for high school students. They lure parents with the name  recognition of a top university and then charge them thousands of  dollars for a two-week residential program. It’s appealing, I get it.  The student gets to live on campus of their dream college for a couple  weeks, and it’ll help them stand out from among the other applicants  when they apply as an undergrad. Right?….

The truth of the matter is that most of these summer programs will do  very little for a prospective student’s college admissions profile. Many  of these programs are money-making schemes, sometimes not even run by  the universities themselves. The universities are more like landlords,  charging rent to third parties that will pay to use the school’s empty  classrooms in the summer. Although they’re usually qualified, the TAs or  professors are sometimes not even tenured at the university they’re  teaching in! The experience essentially boils down to taking one or two  university courses over the course of a few weeks. It’s in-person  Coursera that is MUCH more expensive. Caveat: I have had students attend  one of these college course programs and build really strong  relationships with professors there. Sometimes the professors will be  willing to write recommendations for the students, which CAN be helpful,  so if money is not an issue and the student has nothing else to do,  then they can add *some* value. 

 

### How Do I Identify a Worthwhile Summer Program? 

I can’t  stress enough to my students that many of these summer programs are not worth the time and money. Students could be working on their own significant projects or participating in community service or studying for the ACTs. Seriously. There’s a short list of programs that are actually worth attending and you can usually identify them by:

&amp;#x200B;

1. **The application deadline**.  The earlier the deadline, the more competitive it usually is. If the  applications open early and are rolling admissions, that doesn’t count.
2. **The number of essays and short answer questions**  required for the application. Top summer programs usually set the bar  quite high for their applications and the essay is the best way to get a  real look at the applicants. 
3. **The cost of the program.** A  number of the best summer programs cost next to nothing or even pay the  students for their work. If the program is just two weeks long and  costs in the thousands of dollars, it may not be worth it.
4. **Dedicated threads about the camp on College Confidential**.  Usually the competitive programs have threads for comparing application  notes, talking about experiences attending, or general advice on  essays.
5. **Recommend camps from the admissions blogs of top universities or on their .edu domains.** For example, MIT’s admissions blog has a great article about worthwhile [math/science summer programs](https://mitadmissions.org/apply/prepare/summer/). (somewhat old but still useful) Johns Hopkin’s Center for Talented Youth also has an [exhaustive list](https://cty.jhu.edu/resources/academic-opportunities/)  of summer programs/internships that are categorized by field. The list  is a great place to start, although it doesn’t really rank the programs  in terms of competitiveness and quality.  

&amp;#x200B;

There is a finite  list of programs that I deem ‘worthwhile’ programs. For younger  students, lower tier camps can be useful as a stepping stone for a more  competitive program the summer after. But at the same time, SAT/ACT test  scores represent a much more important part of a student’s college  application profile, and the summer is a great time for SAT/ACT prep  classes. High school freshmen and sophomores should think carefully  about where they’re at on their college roadmap, talk with their  parents, and then make a well-informed decision on what to do for the  summer.

Until this summer I really didn’t realize that I could actually very well be interested in a career in cs. If I would have realized earlier I would have applied to ga tech but I never even thought about it at the time. I feel as though I would have had a decent/ ok chance of maybe getting in if I thought to apply as I even got into to Emory, so it just sucks that I’m just now realizing this.I thought that ga tech was private and expensive but now I realize it not too far from the uga price and it’s public. I know that tech is far superior in the world of cs and though it will be much more difficult than uga, I will have far more opportunities. But anyways my question is should I try to complete all the required math classes for the tech major at uga first like calc 3 and linear algebra and applied combinatorics and just try to transfer after my second year (because math has never really been my strong suit and I hear math at tech is whole different beast) or should I just focus on completing my required courses and try transferring after my freshman year? If not all of them which ones should I do out of the 3? And also should I even wait to transfer my second year or should I just go for it after my freshman year(I really want to get the math classes out the way at uga but will this put me behind in cs)? I know that it will be very hard to be accepted on my first try especially as a cs major so I just want to be well prepared. I’m really sad that this seems to be the major that I’m most interested in and that I will want to transfer out of uga because I just love the uga vibe so much, but I know that this would just be the best move overall in terms of education, intern, and job opportunities."
gvhosw,2,2020-06-02,2 page resumes when applying to first job after graduation?,Daddy_Bronco,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/gvhosw/2_page_resumes_when_applying_to_first_job_after/,"Hi Everyone,

I'm 20 years old, graduating a year early (in 2021) from a CS program, and will be applying to competitive APM positions soon.

I've been writing my resume for fun since I was 12 and have revised it thoroughly as I developed career experience. However, I have always claimed to be a one-page evangelist and can feel the ruler rapping my knuckles whenever I contemplate a second page. I mean, c'mon I'm only 20.

I've taken advantage of my college's career center, where I've attended resume reviews, mock interviews, and networking events. Everyone I've spoken to from one of those events has suggested a second page, or at the very least creating a second page that is solely a project portfolio, but my stomach is uneasy hearing it since I'm concerned it may disqualify me.

I have a handful of awards (many omitted), numerous projects (most of which are omitted), relevant internships, product management experience from a university collaboration with NASA, and project management experience from a university collaboration with Northrop Grumman. Needless to say, I understand to cut the fluff and stick to what's relevant. I get told often that it's a lot for someone my age and have previously been told on this sub that my resume seemed either embellished (which it was not) or overqualified for the internships I was applying for.

So I'm curious to know, what does everyone think of 2 pages on a resume, especially considering my youth and that I'm not applying to senior positions?"

gvj6rp,124,2020-06-02,"I'm a former boarding school student, these schools are not healthy and should not be seen as easy ways to get into t20s",lavender_photos,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gvj6rp/im_a_former_boarding_school_student_these_schools/,"**Warning: Long Rant ahead**

Keep seeing posts about how feeder schools, boarding schools, and elite public high schools are the best way to get into a t20 and I think there is so much flaw in that logic. As someone who wen to a boarding school that often sends kids to t20s and transferred out of it, I can tell you that it honestly kinda sucks; and here's why: (also ***disclaimer, this is only my experience, not trying to bash anyone. I' sure some elite schools are wonderful)***

**Extreme Competition:** It is an incredibly competitive, unhealthy atmosphere with grade deflation, teachers playing favorites, and often times corrupt administrations. These high schools have very low acceptances rates, sometimes lower than top colleges, and the competition doesn't stop when yo get in. You are, in my experience, compared to your peers. Grades were sometimes posted publicly. There were few tutoring services. College admission season was cutthroat with constant comparison and judgement from both teachers and peers. The headmaster would often announce publicly who had the best grades, test scores, acceptances, etc.

**Limited social life:** I often found myself missing important teenage milestones, and having very few opportunities because these boarding schools are often bubbles. So much of your time is dedicated to being the best that you do not have time for extracurriculars, a social life, your own welling. We were not allowed to drive on campus so literally no one learned how to drive. Dating was heavily discouraged (although I met my bf there haha). Sex, drugs, alcohol, etc. are NEVER spoken about which leads to misinformation and fear. Friend groups were often cliquey and competitive (see above). Bullying, especially cyber bullying, was very common.

**Backwards Adminstration:** Racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and classism were so common. I honestly have so many stories about this. I had two friends who were dating, he was white and she was black. His father was a known racist and chummy with the headmaster. He put in some calls and my fiends were told to break up or she would be expelled. Another friend was asked to leave when she called out the school for not celebrating MLK day or talking about black history. For a school project, we had to film a video and during that assignment, a classmate of mine repeatedly said the n word (he was very white) but all he got was a warning. A teacher was put on probation for calling the racism in the school out. The headmaster was incredibly sexist. He publicly shamed working mothers, single mothers, women who stood up for themselves, and the #metoo movement. I had a friend attempt suicide after he was tormented after coming out, the school did nothing. Mental health was treated as a joke. I was called a bitch by the headmaster and other members of the administration for having panic attacks. Me and several of my friends were sexually harassed by other classmates but no one listened to us. There was no help for students struggling and they wanted you to fit in their mold. These are just some examples, there so many more stories from others. These schools are old and stuck in their ways, many of their policies are not up code and provides a very backwards atmosphere.

**Limited opportunities:** Like I said, your entire life revolves around school that extracurriculars and other oppertunites are limited. We had mandatory sports (all three seasons, varsity required past freshman year) which is great if you love sports but other clubs and activities were severely lacking. Despite 35k+ tuition from every student, no clubs were funded and teachers paid out of pocket for clubs. The art department was particularly lacking. Despite having many talented artists, musicians, and actors, the same roles and opportunities went to 5 or so kids that we favorites. The classes were also lacking. I'm a photographer and there was not even a basic photography class (despite it being offered at nearly every public school), no orchestra or band, no theater, none of that. Academic classes were the standard offerings with a lot of Ap courses, no IB or dual enrollment. Getting off campus was a pain as we weren't allowed to drive and students were only able to leave at certain times and always with teachers or your parents. This made it impossible to work, maintain friendships outside of the school and participate in out of schools clubs. After I transferred back to public school, I was astonished at how many oppertunites were stifled. I go to create my own photography business, take classes at the local community college, do research, write for my town's paper, have an internship, and work. All of that was damn near impossible at my old school.

**Cost:** Obviously these schools are so expensive and my school had basically no aid. Because most of the people who go to these schools are wealthy, scholarships and need based aid are an afterthought. My family worked hard to allow me to go there but we quickly realized that it would not pay off. Also teachers were paid pretty poorly despite living on campus and basically always being ""on call."" The tuition went mostly to the board and headmaster, which is obviously corrupt. 

**Outcomes:** I also found that these schools are not like the real world at all and alot of my peers who went to top schools were unsuccessful because prep schools do not prep you for real, independent, adult life. We had set aside study time that was heavily enforced, as such many peers did not know time management or how to study. Dorms were cleaned for us, all of our meals were cooked, and a lot of kids had maids at home, leading to a false understanding of what life is. Many end up dropping out of college. Many end up drinking and partying to an excess because their lives are so controlled and there was no communication about sex, drugs, or drinking. Success and hard work does not end after you get into a t20 and going to an elite school does not mean that you will be successful. Some of my classmates are incredibly successful but I know kids at public school who are equally so. And those public schools kids often deserve to be at t20s more because they balanced school and real life. They did more extracurriculars, supported their families, had lives outside of school, making them more well rounded people.

**In conclusion,** it might be the right path for some but I found it incredibly stifling and I am more successful, happier, and healthier after leaving that elite environment. Sure I got some great things from it, I work hard, I met some of my best friends, and I learned a lot about of myself but in reality, you can do that anywhere. You do not need an elite, controlling school to be successful and to suggest so breeds an unhealthy culture of classism, stress, and a workaholic mindset. There is wayyyyy more to life than going to a t20 and I think we need to remember that we are teenagers and need to experience some semblance of a normal, teenage life. I'll get off my soapbox now, ***just wanted to provide a mindset that isn't really talked about on here. Thanks for listening!***"

edit: all applicants will get an email about this tomorrow through WW.

Hey all, I’m a UW alum and a Pencil team member! Ever since I joined, I’ve been advocating for UW interns because well... I’m biased 🥰. We know how badass UW engineers are so we designed our assessments to be challenging enough.

First, I want to clarify our expectations for the assessment. Our intention is for it to be step-wise; we want to see how far applicants can get rather than an all-or-nothing cutoff for an interview. We care more about quality rather than how many features you can implement. Second, I apologize for missing the inclusion of Angular in the job description - I wrote the post so that's my bad 😬.

As some candidates have reached out to ask for more time given school commitments, we’ve decided to add 10 days to the deadline for the SWE assessment to Friday, June 12 at 11:59 pm PST. While I know the assessment look complex on-paper, we expect it to take about 3-5 hours. We feel this assessment is well-suited to test your ability to integrate multiple pre-existing tools to build a complex solution. Lastly, while we recommend using Firebase for auth, real-time db, and hosting, feel free to use any other service.

I hope I get to work with some of you this summer/fall and get to build our UW presence at Pencil!"

I have passed the resume screening for some of these companies before but failed at the leet code style questions. The odds are obviously incredibly against me if I do this, but it has been a short term goal to work at one of these companies for the past 8 or so years.

I finish up my degree in August. The only reason for the late graduation is that I just can't seem to stop working. And it is taking a toll on everything else I had in my life?

I began this journey the Summer before my Junior year. I was hired on at a small company to intern in IT. I then decided to continue working and take classes simultaneously. 30 hour weeks and 15 credit semesters from here on out. IT turned to fortune 500 SWE intern, then fortune 20 SWE intern, and by my Senior Year Spring semester I was full time at that same fortune 20. 2 years concurrently, work all day study all night.

I've had time to reflect recently as I only have a single Summer course left, and I realize I let all these companies take advantage of 2 years of my younger self. I ended up in a lower income city with a fraction of what some of you guys are making coming out.

So even since then I haven't changed course. My schedule is unchanged. Less the studying anymore my schedule has become 9-5 working, 5-9 portfolio building, 9-12 algorithms. It even creeps into my weekends and I can't stop it.

I'm not even applying until my degree is finished, I just have this constant drive to work and it frustrates everyone around me. I still have loved ones and yet they only refer to me as the workaholic and I've even lost some completely along the way. I just feel changed by this industries culture and I can't explain why I just don't really want to change anything about myself."

As yall know the times now is difficult so when I contacted my previous intern (advertising) company, they could only take me back as an intern and not full-time. However, I can convert full-time in the future if I ""perform"" well on the job - means doing a lot of OverTime or stay back late to rush work... (sounds risky?)

My other offer is to work in-house as the brand's designer. They have a creative department but I'm expected to handle most projects on my own although I can seek creative advice from the main team if I need. I always think it's easy to get into a company as an in-house graphic designer but that limits my opportunity for growth right. 

I have so many difficult decisions to make for a first job and so either I pick one route from here or I seek for more employment offers as I risk paying more time...

I don't really have much incentive to get out of bed early or exercise or do the things I was doing before that helped to concentrate better.

I'll soon be graduating from a very reputable London university with an integrated Master's degree in Computer Science. 

As it's an integrated Masters, I haven't been awarded a separate Bachelor's degree, and I'll be waiting for my results and final degree classification for a while. I've confirmed with my uni that if I had left after my third year, I'd have been awarded a 1:1 BSc, but I'm not sure how or if I could state that on my CV.

Additionally, I don't have any work experience. I didn't do any internships nor any other sort of work experience during my course. The only experience I do have is a few months of retail experience from the summer of 2016, and I'm not sure if that's worth including on a CV at all.

I don't want to make excuses, but unfortunately I've struggled with mental health issues for a long time and I believe my uni performance would've suffered significantly if I had juggled a job or internship alongside it, as uni alone has been very difficult at times.

I haven't really undertaken any projects outside of university assignments, so I don't have much of a portfolio on my Github page or anything like that.  

I'm not picky at all about my first job or which specific sector it's in. In the long term I'm interested in the gaming and esports sectors, but as long as I can afford somewhere to live and it'll get me a few years of experience to work towards a more enticing job, I'd be satisfied. 

As it stands I know I have the capability to do well. I'm a quick learner and don't have any trouble getting comfortable with new technologies, languages, frameworks, etc, but I don't have much to prove that with. Unfortunately my lease at my current place ends at the end of August and I won't really have anywhere to stay after that without a job so I'm feeling a lot of time pressure. I won't be homeless but it'd be incredibly far from ideal, I can't just move back to the family home or something while I search. 

I taught myself how to play the guitar and I play CS:GO competitively at a high-ish level, as part of a team of 5. We practice regularly and I take on a pretty significant leadership role, plus I do a lot of analysis and preparation between practice sessions. I'm not really sure if any of that is usable in a CV, and if it is how exactly would be best to put it across. I know with at least one company I want to apply to, they would appreciate that, but I'm not sure about most others. Some companies may consider both points to be irrelevant, and views on competitive gaming vary drastically from person to person. The 'soft skills' that I've developed through competitive gaming are definitely relevant, and it's absolutely helped them a huge amount, but I fear there's the potential for it to just be seen as a bit of a joke. Being able to teach yourself a musical instrument seems to be seen somewhat universally as a good or admirable thing, but I question if a CV for a software engineering job is the right place for it.

I generally feel pretty lost about where to even begin with putting a decent CV together, or what I can do to bolster it in the short term. I've been searching online for guidance and most of the CVs I've seen have a huge list of work experience, internships and significant projects, so I just feel pretty out of my depth and overwhelmed. Any advice you could offer would be hugely valuable to me. Feel free to ask any questions and I'll try to get back to you ASAP. Thanks!"
gw6ghv,5,2020-06-03,Am I screwing myself over by doing a Liberal Arts Degree?,Jazzmunchies,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/gw6ghv/am_i_screwing_myself_over_by_doing_a_liberal_arts/,"I accepted my offer from a college to do a liberal arts degree this autumn as they offered me a full tuition scholarship for the full four year degree, so I just have to pay for living costs. I'll be doing a BA in Humanities, the Arts and Social Thought, but I'm planning to major in ethics and politics. By accepting this however, I turned down four international relations and geography courses from well known universities in the UK (UCL, King's, SOAS, QMUL), with cost mainly being the reason. Whilst financially I'm making a good decision, everything I've read has basically slated liberal arts degrees, and some people are judging me for accepting it, along the lines of ""I thought you were smarter/better than that, why are you getting a useless degree?"". 

The thing is I really want to get a post-graduate degree (most likely master's but possibly a phd) in an area related to international relations and development, and want to work the for UN or the civil service, so I'm viewing this liberal arts degree as a kind of stepping stone. A large chunk of graduates from the college I will be attending do go on to graduate school for areas like this (including UChicago, NYU, Oxford, SciencesPo etc), hence my interest in it. From my perspective, by accepting this offer and doing a liberal arts degree I can work and save more money, and put this towards doing a graduate degree, as well as coming out with minimal debt. The school is also really big on internships (compulsory to do a long one in third year and encouraged to shorter ones in second year) and study abroad programmes, and my scholarship would also cover these, so I would be able to apply to (and afford to attend) some interesting programmes, which I think could be really valuable, and override the fact I have a liberal arts degree if I have good experience.

At the same time, I'm scared about something changing? What if I decide suddenly I don't want to go to grad school/something happens so I can't? Am I now stuck with a useless, unemployable degree? Am I going to be the laughing stock of the academic world? Would I be better off doing a degree at one of the UK unis and just take the debt, because I'll be more employable if I don't go to grad school? 

Any advice would be appreciated!"

I want to go to a school in a large, cosmopolitan city with ample cultural and internship opportunities.  

**Major:** Political Science (also interested in Philosophy, History, and Journalism/Communications for potential minors)

**Academics:**

GPA: 3.98 UW and 4.4 W

SAT: got cancelled 2x cos covid, but am now shooting for a 1520 in August (got 96 percentile on PSAT 10 w/o studying)

APs not offered at my school (but self-studied for APUSH and AP US Gov and Politics)

Have done out of school honors projects for non-honors classes to receive honors credit

SAT II: Hopefully will have enough time to take World History, US History, Spanish, and maybe Lit

**Extra Curricular Activities:**

Model UN - Secretary General of an online international conference (around 60 participants signed up so far). I have been spending almost 20 hrs a week on this. I am going to expand it to a club at my school so more people can participate (will be founder and president of this club senior year).

Bernie Sanders Campaign volunteer: In both English and Spanish (my second language). I spent 7-10 hrs a week on this for over a year.

Internship at LA city councilmember's office: About 40 hrs a week for a month. My research turned into policy in LA.

About to begin a fellowship for a congressional campaign (not simply volunteering, I had to apply and be interviewed). It is far away from home (6 hrs driving) but I will be working remotely. I am not entirely sure about the time commitment.

Work experience: camp counselor for 40+ hours a week for a month  
\- paid since last summer  
\- volunteer (as Junior Counselor in Training or Counselor in Training) from 5th grade through last summer

Creator of blog about hockey: in 7th a created an instagram account (over 1500 followers not) to talk about and analyze my favorite team, the Los Angeles Kings and in 11th grade, I turned it into a website where I now write articles covering them. This is purely a passion project as I love hockey and people like to hear what I have to say (they also always assume I'm a guy lol... who says a girl can't be more knowledgable than you about sports)

Co-Founder/Co-President of my school's GSA (Gender Sexuality Alliance): one of 2 surviving clubs at my school. We manly discuss current events through historical contextualization and promote intersectionality. Will be sole president senior year.

King's College Pre-University Summer Programme in Political Science: accepted into competitive, international pre-college program in London, specializing in international relations (one of the biggest eye-opening experiences of my life)

I also do art (painting and drawing), write op-eds and theater (have not been published... yet), and play ukulele, guitar, charango (Peruvian folk instrument), and a little bass for fun.

**Awards/Honors:** National Spanish Exam (NSE) bronze (freshman year) and silver (sophomore year.. scored perfectly on one of the sections). I know I do not have many awards... is that going to hurt me? I never really knew that they were so important, otherwise I would have entered in more competitions and stuff (rip).

**Essays/Letters of Recommendation:** I'm a pretty good writer and I have an army of people willing to read and critique my essays and I'm close with many of my teachers because I go to such a small school. I had a teacher ask me if he could write one of my letters, so I think my letters of recommendation will be pretty good!

**Last Bit:** Columbia is my dream school, I will be EDing. I'm just looking for other reaches, matches, and safeties."

gwdw86,20,2020-06-04,Social anxiety has ruined my life for more than 10 years. Is it too late to start now at 30?,ThoseLittleThings,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/gwdw86/social_anxiety_has_ruined_my_life_for_more_than/,"My social anxiety first got out of control when I was 17. That year, I chose to drop out of junior college (the equivalent of high school) even though I passed the exams because I was so anxious in school. Since then, I have struggled with social anxiety throughout my higher education years. While I managed to do well academically, it was extremely stressful as I constantly avoided conversations with people, dreaded turning up for classes everyday, and lost sleep whenever I needed to work on group projects or give presentations. Every single day was filled with dread, and my school internship and temporary jobs that I took up during those years were a nightmare.

After I obtained my college degree at 25, I did not know what to do. I needed money, but I knew deep down that I could not manage a full-time job because of my social anxiety and low self-esteem. Of all places, offices scared me the most. There are intimidating people, the environment is competitive, you are expected to act and dress in a certain way, and you are expected to lunch and socialise with colleagues constantly. Still, I did not know what else I can do, so I applied to many jobs (none of which I was genuinely interested in).

In total, I held 3 jobs over two years (all of which I resigned within 3 months). Working was horrible - I could not concentrate on doing my job at all when I was surrounded by people in an open office. They were constantly chatting right beside me and I was expected to participate with them. It was so distracting, and I could not gel with any of my colleagues. My days at the office were spent on constant alert mode as I worried about what people thought about me, that I could not be productive or perform well in my job. I like writing, but I could never write a report properly in the office. I even felt afraid of getting up from my desk to go to the bathroom or print something. To make matters worse, the anxiety aggravated my dry mouth condition, my scalp problems and made me extremely exhausted. I became really conscious of how I looked. I really wished I could work in a quiet environment, but none of the places that I went to were like that.

After trying and failing at 3 jobs, I knew I could not handle the office setting, so I went the freelance route. I have been doing private tutoring and some educational writing/proofreading for the past few years, but my income has been unstable and it is frowned upon by my parents. I also don't particularly enjoy the freelance work that I have been doing. To escape from the fact that I am a failure in life, I just stay constantly glued to my phone and spend time on self-pity, dwelling about my childhood problems and mental health issues.

I am turning 30 in two months' time, and am starting to reflect on what I can do better. I know that no office job is going to want me when they see that I have zero job experience since graduation (I am too ashamed to put in my resume that I have worked in a few places for just one or two months). Can anyone offer me advice on what I can do for myself career wise? I hope to have a more decent income (I am only earning 800-1200 per month now), and I was thinking of venturing into freelance copywriting and blogging. However, I am uncertain whether I can make a decent living from it. Please feel free to give me any advice or suggestions.

For anyone who took the time to read this long post, thank you for your time.

TL;DR : I battled with social anxiety since 17 and graduated from college at 25. I did not manage to build a conventional career due to social anxiety. I am now 30 and I want to be more successful financially. Can anyone offer their experience or advice on this?"

However, over the past few months I've been strongly considering going back to school and changing career fields to get into IT.  Specifically software engineering and programming.  When I was in high school (13 years ago) I was certain that I would end up in the field of computer science.  I taught myself some programming, joined my schools IT department, and even got an internship working at a repair shop in my city.  However, after graduating, I just never followed through with schooling and ended up taking a different route.  

Now that I've been in my trade for a while, I'm wondering if I could have done better by going into IT and if it's too late for me to make the change.  I work for a union now, so, for the most part, I'm not looking to make the change for financial reasons, as I would be likely taking a cut in pay.  But, I am looking to get into a field that's a bit more satisfying and gives me more opportunities to use my brain instead of muscle.  

Have any of you made the change in career paths and found it to be a simple switch?  Or was it more difficult due to age and a lack of work experience in the field?  Would you say at the end of the day that it was worth making the change (especially if you took a pay cut)?  How difficult was it for you to find a job once you made the switch, and how do you feel in terms of job security?

I'm also wondering what would be the best way to go about school and training.  Is a BS degree considered the minimum necessary in order to be qualified for most jobs?  The cost of school isn't as much of a concern as much as getting a degree in my mid 30's and finding that I'm not considered a desirable candidate for employment. 

 I'm sure most people have seen those ads online for coding programs that offer to teach for free, and you don't pay them back until you find a job making a certain salary.  Have any of you tried this and landed solid long-term employment with no prior experience?  I know programs like these usually come with a lot of stipulations that make it hard to no end up paying them back."

Hey all - my name is Chris, I've been a web developer for about seven years. Like many others' progressions, I started out fiddling with web development videos online, continuing to plug in work until I was able to land my first internship in 2014. Since then, I've been developing web apps professionally, starting out as a full-time employee at an agency, then branching off on my own to do independent agency work.

This video, although only covering HTML, takes the most useful parts of what I've learned throughout my seven years as a web developer. I don't go into extreme detail trying to cover every HTML tag out there, but rather, only the tags you'll be using a lot, and how to use them in a smart, organized manner that prepares you for success as you progress towards CSS.

I really hope this helps anyone new out there, trying to find a teacher or mentor that has experienced the hardships of learning to code and knows how to navigate around them now. If you have any questions at all about code, interviews, landing jobs, etc. please don't hesitate to DM here, I'm down to help, you specifically, in any way possible  🙌"

Right now i'm in my extended final year of university (computer science), working on my thesis coding project. It's not mandatory- I decided to do it in order to get more experience, and have an actual project to show n discuss in future interviews. I haven't worked on a full coding project like this before. I contacted a professor last September about it, and theoretically it should be completed by the end of this semester. However, for xyz reasons, I am veeery behind the schedule. I'm stuck in super beginner stuff, and it's difficult for me to continue with my limited coding knowledge.

I thought this is what I wanted, because coding is the only part of CS I kinda liked, and specifically front-end. But I feel like it's just not for me anymore. I'm struggling to get simple things working, and because of the time pressure, I can't think clearly. It's almost impossible to finish it with my deadline being this upcoming September, as I also have 2 exam periods for my last courses in the meantime, so it's not like I can devote my whole time to the thesis project.

The whole situation is stressing me out a lot, so I'm thinking of dropping the project. I want to graduate this fall, so extending my studies 1 more semester, in order to complete it, is out of the discussion. Its credits equivalent is 3 extra courses, which is kind of doable.

The thing is, if I decide to do that, then what's next? I don't know if I want to stay in the CS world, as I feel like im failing at the only thing I was interested in. I've had doubts about my career path since year 1, but decided to give it a chance, get my degree and see. Like i said, im in my final year, so theres no point of dropping out of uni now. Apart from programming, the only thing that interests me a bit, is UX design. I know it's still in the same department, kind of. Which is also why I tried giving coding one more chance and didnt drop the thesis earlier, as it would give me helpful insight for the future. But I just cant do it anymore.

The main questions are, should I drop the project? Am I giving up too early?

If I do drop it, graduate, and start looking for a UX related internship, would I have any chances in the UX world with basically no projects to show? My resume is pretty empty besides some basic volunteering stuff.

I also would like to ask for advice. Is GPA really important for employers? Is 3.2 GPA is low? I’m so worried right now as i am about to graduate but I haven’t had any internship experience. Also, I don’t want to go back home yet so I’m trying to find a good and legal way to stay in the US. 

I would really appreciate your help and advice."

* I'm a data science intern graduating end of August. 
* I've been at the company for a month, internship ends in September

During the interview process, my (now) boss mentioned the possibility of bringing the intern on full time -- now with the whole COVID situation, I'm not so sure what's going to happen. I'd say it's 50/50

My questions are:

1. When should I talk to my boss about the possibility of full time?
2. Should I start applying to other jobs now, try to get an offer and *then* talk to my boss? 
3. What do I say if my she asks if I've started applying?
4.  How do I bring up the conversation in general? 

Any advice is much appreciated!"
gwpg6j,3,2020-06-04,Majoring in psychology (How fucked am I?),Bennygamer123,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/gwpg6j/majoring_in_psychology_how_fucked_am_i/,"A little background about me:

I had every chance to choose engineering but I intentionally left it for three subjects I am majoring in right now (Journalism, psychology and English)

I do have an internship experience working under a psycho-oncologist in a cancer hospital.

Currently working on a research paper and preparing for GRE this year and planning for my graduate studies.

I am really passionate about this field but I just can't shake off the feeling that I will probably have spent years on something I love, and then end up making not as much money to support my family (because we really need financial support right now), and then hate the subjects I deeply loved, wish I'd gone for engineering and live a resentful, bitter life.

As much as I don't want to care what other people think, I am a people pleaser. So I feel like an outcast in my family who seem to be in love with anything and anybody associated with the term engineering and I don't feel respected. And respect means a lot to me. I feel like my parents are insecure about my education too because they always took pride in me for being a hard worker and expected me to go down the STEM path. Honestly, they did support me through this nonetheless but I think they are expecting me to not have a ""safe"" and ""secure"" job with a steady income. And I feel so pathetic because I love them so much and want to be the best for them.

And no matter where I go on the internet, from quora to reddit, everyone just hates psychology! Even the psychology majors! And with the virus and with our economy going to shit, everyday I wake up feeling worthless despite working really really hard to get where I am now. I mean... Isn't money important especially to a middle class family like ours? Am I too selfish and stupid for choosing the subjects I love?

I feel like this is it.

One bad decision and here I am.

I honestly feel like my life is done for. And I am 20 and I feel like 50 because all I am thinking is about job, work, studies, money. How will I support my family? I don't even remember the last time I went on a date. I feel so old and dead. And I really work hard but I see it all just dissipating as if I'm moving in the wrong direction.

Please tell me what to do before I just give up altogether."

I have been interested in programming since I was about 10, but I have only taken it seriously in the past year or so. When I was younger I had some crude attempts at mobile games, but in the past year I have done almost exclusively python and machine learning. I have made a neural network evolution simulator, reinforcement learning tic-tac-toe (it's horrible), coronavirus data analysis tool and a neural network digit identifier with MNIST. I have also partially made my own neural network ""library.""

Currently my learning about AI is on pause since my primitive knowledge of calculus is not sufficient to advance into more complex topics. I should start to learn these topics in school next year. Right now I am starting to learn about algorithms. I am also doing leetcode. I also recently started the CS50 web dev course to extend my knowledge and actually be able to create a tangible, deployable application. This has been interesting for me because I exclusively used python before this course.

I would like to try to get an internship or a job as a junior-dev (not really sure what the requirements are for that) in the next year or so. I think ML internships are out of the question given half the ones I found require high level of education. Could anybody give me some guidance on what I should be focusing on or learning to achieve those things?

I just want to share my story and give you guys some encouragement and don't lose hope because I was on the same path. I started my first ever coding exposure on freecodecamp and Udemy, and I finally got a job as an entry-level full stack developer in Austin, Texas 8 months later.

The only courses I took on Udemy in order:  
1/ The Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele.  
2/ The Modern Javascript Bootcamp also by Colt and Stephen Grider  
3/ Modern React with Redux by Stephen Grider (2020 update)

I started applying after I finished those 3 while also learning Computer Science theories like algorithms, data structures, some C++ &amp; blockchain coding .... on Udacity, Edx, Coursera and Udemy. I also have my own Shopify store and Travel blog on Wordpress.

Here is my portfolio website for your reference 📷[www.lucaslu.dev](https://www.lucaslu.dev/?fbclid=IwAR2BoXOy7NFIOaMnkqHBfXwpnWELf0DkSgdL7N_LF3kAGyRDJvOLzpHwdpQ)

Yes most of the projects are from tutorials, but most employers don't know where you get them from because there are too many courses, and they don't have time to check. So DON'T be afraid to apply even if you don't have any projects of your own. Too many people scare off beginners by saying you have to start your own projects, contribute to open sources, grind coding challenges in Leetcode, start your own company blah blah ... I have never done any of them. Even though they may help, don't feel discouraged if you feel like they are too much beyond your ability.

How I got the job: I was applying every single day to job postings on Indeed and LinkedIn with a few different keywords: junior/entry-level/ intern frontend developer, web developer, software developer, software engineer ... I also looked at a few different cities I would be willing to relocate to if I got an offer. After like 100+ applications and 3 months later, I got like 3 interviews but no luck.  
Then my friend suggested I look on Craiglist where he got his job. I was surprised people still using it. I literally applied to TWO jobs on Craiglist, and got a call for phone interview 2 days after. Then they asked me to create a form to capture customer information and autocomplete address using Google Map Api and a npm package to validate credit card number. I learned all of them from the 3 courses I mentioned above! I finished the assignment in 1 day after a lot of Googling lol and review some of my past codes. They asked me to come to the office to start next Monday. Hell yeah !!!

So if I can I know you CAN too. Keep trying and believe in your ability!"
gwqsai,2,2020-06-04,Best way to handle credentials for web applications that don't support SSO?,micka190,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/gwqsai/best_way_to_handle_credentials_for_web/,"I just started working for a very small business (6~ people) that has absolutely no IT infrastructure setup. Everyone has a computer and they're all administrators. The business uses web applications exclusively, they share a bunch of credentials and if they let someone go, they need to change every password for everything...

The owner has asked me to look into setting them up with some basic identity system so that if they need to lay off anyone, they can just remove a user's account and be done with it and also to avoid employees knowing sensitive passwords and being able to access business information outside of the office.

Now, I'm not a sysadmin by trade, I'm a software engineer, but I've worked with things like Active Directory, PDQ, etc. before (during an internship) so I'm not totally blind here.

The issue I've found is with the web applications. Most of the ones we use don't support LDAP, SAML or any kind of SSO that I can find, so I'm not sure if Active Directory is the right call. Does it allow us to simply assign credentials to users for certain web services? I'd imagine not, since that sounds more like something a browser would be in charge of (unless there's some AD integration, I guess).

They don't really need anything fancy, just identity management and preventing read/write to USB storage devices, really. I've noticed G Suite does Password Vaulted apps, where they save credentials, assign them to users, and then log them in without the user ever having access to the credentials (which sounds like exactly what we need), but then I feel like I'd be imposing G Suite apps on everyone in the office (moving them from Office would be a pain, since most of them are older and complain about the tiniest bit of change in Office's releases). 

Though if I had to go the G Suite route I could use something like JumpCloud (which would be free at our current number of employees) to integrate our G Suite credentials with the employees' Windows logins, but it seems like I'd also need to configure our company's mail servers to use Gmail to properly use groups and stuff, and Gmail's got a bad reputation when using it with Outlook... I don't know, it still feels over-engineered and complicated.

How would you guys handle web applications that don't support SSO? Through Active Directory? Through something else? I'm kind of stumped here, and I'm not really thrilled at the idea of introducing G Suite to the office..."

Does it make sense to get a CS degree despite the fact that I know I’ll be pushing for IB?

I (19M) am a computer science student and I am applying for summer internships. I worked on this hackathon where I make a project based on my chosen client. The first round of interview is with the hackathon organizers, then with the  client and followed by an I will get an internship.

In the first round of interview  (I have to submit my responses in a video), I answered that porn addiction is my greatest challenge and I told how I am fighting it with self-help, books, hobbies, etc. I am aware that this is bold but I mentioned because this challenge is a nemesis comparing to other problems I faced in life. I was being honest and answered every question with frankness.

I got a call today morning, couple hours before the second round, and the hackathon organizers told me that they are holding my application back because of my porn addiction. They told me to get help and contact them back when I ""resolved"" and ""addressed"" it through mental health services. They also mentioned something about sexual harassment which is weird. I assured that it is under control and I brought it up in the interview because I am resolving it. Overall, I did not get interviewed in the second round and I doubt if I can get the opportunity even if I ""addressed"" it.

It's pretty bold and naive of me to mention it in an interview. I did it because I want to be frank and not use cliche problems. What is the mistake in mentioning it? Should I call the hackathon organizers? What can I do next time so I won't be in a similar situation.

gx0eoq,2,2020-06-05,Dad is constantly pestering me about not working in a graduate position,TA-annoyingdad,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/gx0eoq/dad_is_constantly_pestering_me_about_not_working/,"Throwaway account because friends know my usual account. Sorry in advance for the messy post, wrote this in a hurry.

I graduated at the end of last year with plans to work at an internship or as a casual/part-time and then go travelling for the second half of the year, unfortunately, my plans have gone to shits. I started interning full time at place x (non-private firm) since the start of the year which I really enjoy and is a pretty decent job and pays pretty much the same (maybe 4k less annually) as if I had taken a grad job. However my parents especially my dad wants to find a job in the private sector and doesn’t really like where I currently work. The issue is I strongly detest working at the places he wants me to apply for and I am still unsure what I want to do. I have a dream job which isn’t feasible for me right now but could be something I can be applying for in a few years time.

My original plan was to work at place x until the end of the year and apply for a position above graduate level given I’ve already had the year experience interning and I’ve had experience working part-time for a year in this field while I was in uni. I wasn't going to apply for the graduate program at place x because it's basically what I doing now but my directors and supervisor really wanted me to. A month ago, I applied for a graduate position at place x as a back-up and was rejected which was a bit of a surprise for me since I thought I did pretty decent in both interviews but I didn’t put in an actual application and was offered the interviews verbally which may have had an impact on the result. At the end of the day, it’s a bit annoying but not the end of the world and I probably didn’t do as well as I thought.  My internship which was only supposed to be 3 months has been extended to 10 months so I know I’m doing a decent job. Additionally, if I am unable to find a job by the time my current internship ends, my previous job has my old position waiting for me which was a casual position (exact same pay as current internship with casual bonus) and only 3/4 days a week but it was still a pretty decent job I enjoyed and I could possibly ask for them to turn it into a full-time graduate position.

For the past 2 weeks, my dad won’t shut up about me finding a full-time job now and keeps going on about how I don’t have a real job and saying I should’ve started working full time in an ongoing position since January (to be honest he's always been on my back about this but the past 2 weeks this has been the only thing he talks about). He keeps on going about how I wasted my life and I need to find a job asap in the private sector because they don’t want me (graduate position) at place x and when I say I don’t like working at those places he keeps going on about life isn’t always about what makes me happy. On top of this, he always mocks and makes snide jokes about my dream job and the other week he said that it was basically impossible and compared me working there to me marrying a British prince. He constantly makes snide comments about all of this and how I won't do well in the future and won't make enough money to send my kids to private school or give them what they want (yea I have no idea why this future kids thing is such a big deal for him) and compares me to everyone we know which is really getting my last nerves. If I was a dropkick and doing nothing with my life I would totally understand, but I worked part-time all throughout uni and paid all my uni fees straight up, as well as doing extra-circulars and other internships during uni so whilst I don’t have my life sorted 100% right now I think I am on the right-ish path and I know I’ll be okay.

I know he means well but at the end of the day it makes me really frustrated and pissed off to hear him go on about it 24/7. My parents sacrificed a lot to give me a good childhood and opportunities so I understand how they're very invested in me starting my post-grad life and making money. I still live at home and I can’t really move out with everything that’s going on. I am putting off applying for anything right now because my contract has been extended until later this year and I don’t want to leave until I finish the internship especially when they went out of their way to extend it for me. I don’t pay rent or any bills but I transfer basically 70% of my pay as a ‘loan’ to my parents so they can put it against the mortgage/credit cards but the money is mine if I need it someday. I don't really know what to do with him and I can't reason with him because he won't listen to anything I say and always goes on about he knows best and he's been alive for 30 years more than me and how I don't know anything about how the real world works.

TLDR: dad being a huge dick that I am not working in a full-time graduate position even though I'm still working full-time in an internship (which basically pays the same). "

I am also planning to learn Dutch since I am planning to live in the Netherlands. The problem is I can't do masters, being an non EU citizen studying here can be pricey.

What else should I learn besides Python to become a good software developer, maybe you could give a  road map? What kind of project ideas could you give me? I am quite frustrated, I want to get my hands dirty in some project, however I lack creativity. 
What is the best way to learn Data Structures and Algorithms? 
Do you think I will be able to get a job as a Software engineer in the Netherlands with just Bachelors?
What kind of frameworks are essential? Which additional skills are required to get an internship as a freshman? Should I make a LinkedIn account even though I am starting with uni in September?

With such a hard work for the next 3 months what do you think I will be able to accomplish? (Sorry I just love setting goals for myself)

Thank you in advance and sorry for so many questions, I am just soo frustrated but extremely motivated!"
gx0jp0,39,2020-06-05,My journey from college dropout to Frontend Web Developer,Dextersgrownupbeard,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/gx0jp0/my_journey_from_college_dropout_to_frontend_web/,"Hi all!  


I was thinking about writing up a text about my journey, as I remember these kinds of posts being quite inspiring to me when I first got into this completely new field to me.  


I was an engineering student unhappy with what I was doing with my career, teaching English online on the side. I realized I couldn't do this for much longer since it made zero sense to me as a whole. A friend introduced me to a bootcamp program that lasted for 6 months. Since it was government funded, I thought it would be high quality. Little did I know, after the 6 months, I still had basically zero knowledge how to create ANYTHING! After this period, we got sent into a 2 week training program at this company, where we were doing a little bit of everything, but not learning anything specific.  


I tried applying for several companies after this ended, but it was to no avail. By this time, I was sure that I learned all there is to the basics of programming, and yet no one wanted to hire me. It gave me tremendous pain. Some companies responded, sending me some tasks that seemed quite difficult for me at the time, since I HATED doing css ( I thought frontend was gonna be CSS all the way at this point, so I was thinking about switching to another language).   


Having realized that I basically wasn't good enough even for a junior dev position, I ""buckled up"". Started working on my own project. I started making a ""brick breaker"" like 2d game in P5.js which is a Javascript library for 2d/3d graphics. I found a very interesting tutor, quite charismatic and passionate about his work.   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j0UDiN7my4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j0UDiN7my4)  This was the first video I watched.   
At the time, I knew that this wouldn't make me hireable since companies rarely need a Javascript graphics dev, but I thought it would help me learn things better. I also made my own Telegram bot during this time ( this was around last summer ). Making the bot taught me how to read the docs better, since sometimes in practice, you won't really find youtube tutorials for everything so easily.  


Fast forward to October, I went into an internship program at a company for 5 months. Met an awesome tutor who taught me the basics of Angular, coupled with SASS and it's quirks. At this time I learned that this career will always make me feel dumb, so my mentor told me I should find something I want to make, and be consistent.  


In November I started learning React, and in December React Native. I was working on my own mobile app for stretching, I didn't use any other API's besides RN since it was quite daunting on it's own.  
But I managed, I made around 12 different screens with navigation, user authentication, I learned about JWT, firebase etc.  


While all this was happening, I was looking around at different offers on all kinds of social media.   
And then, in this large , mostly Indian/Pakistani facebook group, I found a guy looking for a React Native dev.  We chatted for a little bit, he took a look at my portfolio and decided to offer me the job, with the hourly wage I requested, no bargaining. I was shocked. How would this man who doesn't know me just...offer me the job? I was an inexperienced junior, and he was willing to hire me for a freelance job?  


The first month I had little work to do. Basically he sent me guides how to build this React Native app connected to a WordPress backend API.  
One month in and I was called on our website project. I was given this template app, which only had some parts connected, and I had to learn it all.  
The biggest difficulty was learning Redux. I thought, my boss is an idiot, he gave me my own app to handle with Redux? He's setting himself up for disappointment!   
Took me about 7-10 days just to get started with the boiler plate. This really helped me to understand higher order functions A LOT BETTER.  
He was throwing tasks at me left and right, and I was actually DOING THEM.   


As I am writing this, I am avoiding all my current tasks, since they're still daunting as they were the day I started to work here. However, now with the new found experience, I can manage them easier, since I know that failure isn't really an option ( and I am quite a quitter myself ).  


So that's my story, I hope my story will bring some hope and motivation to whoever is reading this:)  


If anyone has any questions, I'd be willing to answer them :)"

gx1p14,2,2020-06-05,"Given my situation, is it a stupid idea to relocate without a job lined up?",OnlySpirit,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/gx1p14/given_my_situation_is_it_a_stupid_idea_to/,"I'm a somewhat recent college graduate (a couple years back). Since I graduated, I've been working the same two underpaid part-time jobs that have nothing to do with my career interests. I've been looking for a full-time job that is closer to my career interests in the college town where I still live for nearly two years now, and have had zero luck despite customizing my resume for each job and perfecting my interview skills, because everyone here is over-educated (lots of people with masters degrees) and highly skilled transplants, and there are very, very few entry-level jobs (pretty much all entry level jobs in this area have been replaced with unpaid internships because there are so many college students here; I interned when I was still in college and that still wasn't enough to get full-time work here, hence my current situation).

I have extended family in a smaller city about 3 hours from here where, if my research and anecdotal experience indicates, the job market is more...hospitable. Both of my cousins who live there are younger than me, never went to college, and got full-time entry-level professional jobs at startups that were willing to train them. I have visited them a couple of times in the past few years and I really like the area - so much, even, that I've settled on wanting to relocate there. I started looking for work there in January, and saw several postings for full-time jobs in my field that wanted only 1-2 years of experience that pay well above what I'm making now, but between the current hiring freeze and not being a local applicant, I've not had any luck yet.

Perhaps the biggest problem I'm facing is that at one of my current jobs - a very small business - I'm being harassed by my boss, who is also the owner of the company. It's gotten so bad that the thought of just going there another day completely nauseates me. He does all the hiring, and obviously there is no HR person or department to report to, and the fact that he's the owner of the company means he ultimately calls all the shots. There's no way I can afford a lawyer, and honestly, this job that is in no way connected to my career interests and only pays a few dollars above minimum with no opportunity for advancement is not even worth seeking legal action to keep. I cannot afford living on just my other part-time job alone, and with the job market in this city, I don't see myself finding full-time work here even in the distant future. Even part-time jobs are hard to come by. 

A few days ago, I considered the prospect of just moving to the city where my cousins live without a job. All my life I've heard that having an unemployment gap is a cardinal sin and employers won't look twice at you for it (I believe it), but I'm not sure what else to do at this point. I've already settled on relocating to that area, but my original plan of securing employment before moving has not panned out. My current situation is becoming increasingly desperate, to the point I feel like I can't wait on a job offer before moving. Part of this is due to logistical concerns as well; my current apartment lease expires at the end of this summer, and if I sign a new one here, I'm faced with owing quite a bit of money for breaking it, money I don't have and which I am very unlikely to get from a new employer. There's also the financial problem of traveling there and back for interviews, which in and of itself might not even be possible if I don't move there before finding a job. Most of the jobs in the city I'm trying to move to are startups and small businesses, and therefore very unlikely to offer any relocation assistance or reimburse travel expenses. But really, I am seriously becoming concerned for my health and safety at work due to my boss's behavior, if even just from a mental health perspective.

I should think the answer here is plain, but at the same time I have this fear about taking the plunge, moving, and still not having a job after a year and then being seen as unemployable because of a big unemployment gap. However, I also write a blog on the side, which I'm planning to continue regardless, and I'm also hoping to find some volunteer work if I do go ahead and move to show that at least I'm doing something with my time while I look for a job. One of my cousins has offered me a place to live temporarily. I'm just worried that if I go ahead and do this, my situation will somehow end up being even worse than it is now in the long term. But staying here, I have no career options, I feel like I'm wasting my life, not to mention extremely anxious and depressed."

With exclusive mixed experience of mine in English teaching and undertaken courses in international relations and organizations, combined with my passion for development studies, I believe I could be the right fit for the Environment and Socio-Economic Internship Program at UNDP. Topping, my experience as a female religious minority, studying in Muslim-majority domain has enhanced my insight and sensitivity to other religions, backgrounds and genders.

Moreover, I have worked part-time as an English teacher for XX Language Academy, a language training institute, where my responsibilities included  solo class management while maintaining a constant communication on my designated ""lesson plans"" with the supervisors , regular assessment on my performance and attending meetings. 

I am to graduate this summer from XX University with a bachelors in political science. One of the countries premium universities in humanities, exposed me to a vast array of courses, as an illustration, international relations, human rights, research methodology and statistics.
In addition I've succeeded to maintain a GPA of 17.6/20 (3.7/4).

Given the vital computer knowledge in this day and age, I have taken courses in computer and Office  basics to a more advanced education in networking infrastructure such as CCNA, aspiring to attain the main certificate in 2020.
Additionally, I have been certified  an IELTS Academic with an overall score of 7.5 in September 2019.

The ephemeral idealistic mind of mine, is in search of new means to accelerate its knowledge and optimistically take a step forward in strategizing the next developing amendment required for human species and its homeland earth,of course prior to Elon Musk colonizing Mars.

Besides projects, what else should I be doing to strengthen my chances of finding a entry level position after I graduate? I've done a lot of leetcode (maybe a little too much lol) and I'm confident I can pass an interview. I'm just wondering if there is anything a new grad with no work experience can do to increase their chances of receiving interviews when applying. Thank you!

I am a new grad with a Computer Engineering degree, which IMO means I'm even more general and less skilled than a general CS degree. I am not interested in a career on the hardware side, but I don't really know what kind of career I want in tech. 

I had an IT internship that did not interest me at all, but that *could* have been because I had 0 background in what my team was doing and unrealistic expectations. 

I was fortunate-ish to receive a great job offer for ""Junior Software Engineer"", but that has since been rescinded due to the virus. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Situation:**

I feel like I was first applying to Software Engineering jobs because it seemed not too narrow a field and creative enough to be interesting. But since my offer was rescinded I'm taking the chance to do *what I wish I'd done in college* and think about what kind of career I want. 

I'm the kind of person who doesn't like having a sea of options in front of me- I'd really like to find something specific, like Database Administration, and say ""That sounds like a great path for me!"" and just focus on learning those skills and applying to those jobs. I realize this may be unrealistic. 

The other options I've been considering have been taking a few classes to eventually get a Masters, or take some certificate programs (though the FAQ says they are usually not useful- [https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/wiki/faq\_certifications](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/wiki/faq_certifications)). **However, I don't want a Master's degree unless I'm certain it will be in the right area for my career.**

&amp;#x200B;

I have been reading the FAQ and some useful websites,

We were a team of about 10 to support about the 500 People in the Company. This includes: Hardware buying, setting up, updating, remote support, phsical (local) support, taking old machines, clearing data of it, **managing the servers**, ...  
So basically were the department, that did everything that required the slightest bit of configuration.  
  
My Internship was in Winter and during the Winter Holidays $Company was closed and everyone at home. Almost no one needed to work and our IT Team was just on call duty. 1 Person each Day (so some people had to work 2 days during that Holiday).

Christmas Eve rolls around and I as an Intern get a call (My first tought: Has the apocalypse started?!).  
&gt; **IT Boss**: Hey we got an issue! We can't reach our Servers! Do you have any idea what might be the issue?  
&gt; **Me**: Not really. Have your tried pinging the Server, SSHing to it through $backupTerminalInCompany (ssh tunnel that has access to internet and intranet), ... (the usual stuff you check)  
&gt; **IT Boss**: Yes and nothing works. We can't even reach the Backup Terminal. And where out of ideas, if you don't have any further Ideas I guess I got to drive to $Company.  
&gt; **Me**: Weird, but I'm actually out of Ideas, Sorry.  
&gt; **IT Boss**: Well it was worth a try. The entire department has been trying for an hour, but didn't reach our servers. Anyways, happy holidays.  
&gt; **Me**: Happy holidays and I hope the fix is an easy one.  
&gt; IT Boss hangs up.  

1 Hour later I get a call from IT Boss telling me what the issue was:  
- Janitor thought: Hey nobody is in company during the Holidays, to conserve energy I can turn off heating.  
- This night is the coldest so far.  
- Server emergency shutdown because ""CPU too cold"".  

I got a good laugh, IT Department got a good laugh and luckily nobody was injured, because as I have found out later: One of the Servers was managing all the traffic lights in $City of $Company. Likely, because the important Traffic Lights have local backup controllers, that run on fixed timers in case connectivity goes down.

For why the backup terminal was unreachable: No IP from the DHCP Server, because that one was also down.

TLDR: Janitor turns off heating in Winter, causes despair in the IT Department, because the Traffic Lights no longer worked properly."

**Additional Information:**
honestly quite disappointed with my results as i was really hoping for ucla (or any other reach school) i switched my first-choice major to chem engineering last minute from chemistry but didnt know they wouldnt consider my second choice major:( . my essays were probably the strongest part of my application, &amp;amp; my lack of stem ecs/ low gpa probably hurt me a lot. i wasnt 100% sure about engineering but applied on a whim which was a bad move. if i were to go back to last year, i’d probably apply as a chem or psychology major! i’ll be attending *UCSD* this fall:)

*Things I learned:*
im no expert on college admissions but here are some things i learned personally:
- it's probably a bad idea to apply for a competitive major like engineering with no stem ecs LOL especially if you dont have any hooks. I didn’t look for serious internships and spent my time in hs exploring many different interests, like language learning. speaking five languages (like me) probably doesn’t help if youre a stem major:(
- gpa is very important. i had a pretty mediocre/below average gpa for an engineering applicant compared to a pretty average SAT score which hurt me a lot considering the UCs emphasize a lot on your gpa.
- pursue what you’re interested in! my ecs were all over the place but in my opinion high school should be exploring the random things that interest you/make you happy :)
- write good essays!!!! express yourself within your writing!

I started to write a function, however, I am unsure whether I am doing it correctly. Any help appreciated. New to Python (and code in general) and I think I more-so need help with understanding how some of these function tutorials online relate to the code that I have and how to enter the functions correctly.

gxcpvz,95,2020-06-05,On the RU Twitter Assault Allegations.,YUMMYVHS,rutgers,https://www.reddit.com/r/rutgers/comments/gxcpvz/on_the_ru_twitter_assault_allegations/,"Let me start off by saying that I support victims of sexual assault and I am by no means trying to dismiss their voices. But before you blame Rutgers and or attack/ 'cancel' those who have been accused I want you to take some things into consideration.

&amp;#x200B;

# 1. What can Rutgers do with hearsay? 

It seems like these days people do anything to attack organizations. I fully agree that Rutgers has made many mistakes in the past and will probably continue to make more mistakes. However, what can Rutgers actually do? Should they suspend a student based on rumors? There are individuals who are attacking the university because they won't suspend a person\[s\] who has allegations (that are from anonymous users and are largely unsubstantiated)  against them.  Having people lose jobs and internship opportunities simply based on allegations is dangerous. There are many competitive pools in this university and I can see how that can be used to take out certain people. Now, if there is evidence that was sent to the university (voice recordings, police reports, DNA, etc...) and Rutgers still has not done anything about it then I would agree that Rutgers should be punished, however, in most of these twitter allegations I have yet to see that to be the case. 

&amp;#x200B;

# 2. Can of Worms

These accounts on twitter are opening a can of worms. If you are encouraging people to make throwaway accounts and to send in anonymous DMs with people's names attached to ***HARMFUL*** allegations, do you think it won't be abused? **I question why these accounts do not privately compile the name's of these individuals on to a list and send it to the administration.** They could even **petition the university to do so. I'm sure if they posted a petition here on the subreddit many people would sign it.** But instead, these accounts don't do that. They post claims next to faces and names. 

&amp;#x200B;

# 3. The accounts themselves. 

Before I start let me link these accounts. 

1. Assaulters at RU  [https://twitter.com/AtRutgersU](https://twitter.com/AtRutgersU) 
2. RU Sexual Assault Allegation Database  [https://mobile.twitter.com/rutgers\_expose](https://mobile.twitter.com/rutgers_expose)  also on reddit /u/rutgersexpose
3. assault at rutgers university  [https://mobile.twitter.com/assaultatrutge1](https://mobile.twitter.com/assaultatrutge1) 

\*\*\*

The first account, **Assaulters At RU**, was active about some 20 hours ago or so posting allegations but[ for whatever reason](https://mobile.twitter.com/rutgers_expose/status/1268726490465816577), they felt the need to give the twitter account for /u/rutgersexpose the spotlight to spearhead the claims of sexual allegations.  [Both accounts say they are not associated with the third account ""assault at rutgers university""](https://mobile.twitter.com/rutgers_expose/status/1268801627902836737) 

&amp;#x200B;

**RU Sexual Assault Allegation Database** AKA /u/rutgersexpose  has resorted to simply posting the information of whoever they receive. No longer is there even a story attached to the names of the individuals accused and their wrongdoings as we saw with earlier posts from both the **RU Sexual Assault Allegation Database** and **Assaulters at RU twitter accounts**.

\*\*Unfortunately, the account for **Assaulters at RU** has gone private so you must follow to see their tweets. But I ask why? If they are so intent on warning the public it should be a public account, no?  Anyway, I digress. 

 /u/rutgersexpose made a post here (you can find my response to it via the [hyperlink](https://www.reddit.com/r/rutgers/comments/gwwb5z/about_the_assault_exposing_twitter_accounts/fszcelo/?context=3)) where they essentially said that they should not be faulted for false allegations because they are trying to help. How so? They say this yet [on Twitter they threaten to doxx someone's mother.](https://mobile.twitter.com/rutgers_expose/status/1268927601793478658) 

&amp;#x200B;

# 4. ""You don't care about the victims!""  &amp; ""These are just allegations.""

&amp;#x200B;

A common criticism I would get when speaking out against these accounts is that I somehow care more about the accused than the potential sexual assault victims. This is far from true. These accounts have been sensationalized. If you think that having SEXUAL ASSAULTER or RAPIST attached to your name as an allegation won't hurt you in college you have another thing coming. Even if it is proven you are innocent these words will change people's interpretation of you and opportunities in these formative years will be squandered. 

When you are encouraging the public to anonymously send messages to you, you have to be careful with that information as **it can be harmful to the falsely accused and actual victims** (imagine a case where someone lies about a person and ruins internship opportunities, friendships, etc... or someone has their story posted on their behalf without permission and that person is attacked by our presumed sexual offender).   

&amp;#x200B;

Everything here has been poorly managed and resulted in a shit show. I feel for any actual victims in this case especially the ones who are unable to prove what happened to them due to lack of evidence. But you need more than words sent anonymously to a page, or a tweet with someone's name posted to these accounts because in reality it can be abused and [in fact it already is.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rutgers/comments/gx6yfq/the_expose_twitter_is_becoming_bullshit/)

I have recently graduated with a Computer Science degree and after a few software engineering internships and projects I don't have much interest in pursuing this as a career path. I wanted to take the summer to really figure out what it is I want to do. I gathered a list of my strengths and weaknesses and becoming a financial / business analyst is something I truly want to pursue. Where I am at a lost is how do I begin this process of becoming qualified for this profession when my background is in Computer Science and Mathematics? I hear the transition isn't very difficult due to the analytical skills both professions entail, but I would love a list of resources, courses, and books please!"
gxdv33,10,2020-06-05,"International Student, struggling to find a paid position in the US..",d0l4n,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/gxdv33/international_student_struggling_to_find_a_paid/,"Hey everyone, first post on this sub.

I'm a (soon to be) Junior year CS student at a pretty decent college; and have been working hard at everything I can for my career.

I've had a strong academic record, done various extracurricular CS-related activities (won a hackathon, done some research, club activities) but I struggle to find internships in the field.

I was told that I would be paid for my research position this summer, but a new email just told me that it's not possible since the NSF requires me to be a permanent resident/citizen in order to be paid for it. It's a real pain, since I was to rely on the stipend in order to pay for my summer class, and my family isn't in the best financial situation either.

The fact that I am not a perm resident/citizen has taken away a lot of my opportunities, I feel. From TA positions to taxes on my prize money, to summer internships, I feel like there is a lot to make up for, just due to me not being born here.

I guess the main question from me would be; how much does citizenship factor into the equation for me being accepted into a position? Is there anything common a recruiter would see from an international candidate that would work against them?

I've been constantly improving myself in every way, but it has been frustrating me enough to finally create this post that I've been wanting to for a while."

I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree on F-1 visa and have a 12 month internship oppurtunity. Since it's part-time, it won't affect pre-OPT period. And it's from a big company( not FAANG though), I feel this would boost my resume's weightage in future.  I don't want to mess up as this has come after sending almost 350+ applications from past 10 months.

My questions are:

1. What are the cons of a 12-month internship when compared to summer internship? I've no classmates or seniors that I know of who have opted for anything like this, all of them did their intersnhips during summer only.
2. Is it wise to choose credits for the internship during the semester as well?
3. They've not mentioned anything about visa sponsorship/ considering for a full time job conversion, should I ask raise my concern about this with the Manager?
4. Meanwhile, I'd be looking for full time jobs as well, would having a 12-month internship affect my OPT period?

Any suggestions/inputs would be highly appreciated.

Thank you and stay safe."

I've been a longtime lurker here on the thread but here I'm finally gonna put out my bg story and my plan for the future and hopefully can inspire others in my position meanwhile advice from already established and successful developers :)

 (TL;DR at the bottom)

&amp;#x200B;

|My Bachelor's Degree|

Graduated with a Bachelor's in Business back in 2015 from a state university and worked at a finance company making $40k/yr. Quit after working for a year cause I hated it and thought it was miserable. Either that or it might have been the fact I was young and stupid worrying about being trapped in an office rather than ""living the life"" like the other 20-somethings going out to bars every weekend and traveling abroad every other week. I went to restaurant work because I had worked as a waiter all throughout college anyway, at the fine dining steakhouse I was promoted to Liquor Sales Manager in 2017 making about $65k/yr.

Everything was great! Met my fiancé, bought a nice townhome here in Florida with low cost of living, and no debt other than mortgage. Then come Covid-19. I was laid off April 21 and have been receiving unemployment benefits ever since. However, they called me back today to let me know to come back to work. Because I'm highly asthmatic, me and my fiancé decided it was time for a career change and not stay in a work environment with high levels of physical interaction with multiple people at a time. I had a professional talk with my General Manager and ended it on REALLY GOOD terms (I'm a hard worker and never complain at work. What else do you want in an employee ya know?).  
 I've always been a huge nerd with all things tech and I absolutely love math. Which then led me to Computer Science. Win-win right? HOPEFULLY!  


|Research|

After doing about 2 months of research (most of it was fear of trying something out completely new and failing), I think I have a pretty good understanding of the industry and the many specializations within.

From my research of the CURRENT job market in Northeast Florida, the software engineering jobs I've come across tend to focus on data warehousing or information technology (J2EE, J2SE, etc.).

Initially, I wanted to pursue that ""hip, young, modern"" tech startup you see all over those ""day in the life of a software engineer"" but that scene doesn't seem really prominent here in the Southeast. And because we have an established living situation, I'm gonna have to cut ""relocation"" as an option, which I know, will hinder me greatly in finding a job.

&amp;#x200B;

|Learning Material / Study / Finances|

I decided to follow the curriculum from [teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com) . No particular reason really, except the fact that they just RECENTLY updated their curriculum and that it really seems like the material listed is of high quality.

Fortunately, we have $16k in emergency savings and my fiancé JUST found a banking job. We won't be making nearly as much, but in the middle of a pandemic that's more than acceptable.

While she works, I will be committing more than 40 hours a week studying and following the curriculum. Hopefully I can make significant process in the coming months. Read on to see why.

&amp;#x200B;

|School...?|

My state university offers a Masters in CompSci with a concentration in either of these 3 fields:

Information Technology - Computer Science Theory - Software Engineering

Now obviously, doing 2 months of research I've come across multiple threads and opinion YT videos on self-taught vs. coding bootcamp vs school.  
 After considering all the above, I've decided to do a hybrid approach.

As I mentioned before, I will be mainly using [teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com) as my resource and hopefully I can get a few projects done. Once winter hits, I will be looking to apple for the Master's in CompSci program. I have yet to determine which concentration. You would think software engineering, but my region's main industry focus seems to revolve around information technology so I'm not quite sure yet. I have to be realistic rather than idealistic.

I know I know. ""You don't need a degree!"" 

Youtubers have said it. Redditors have said it. Even the FAANG companies have said it. Despite MOST (not all) of them having a relevant degree. 

I don't have data for this at all, but for some reason I feel like it'll open up more opportunities for more in the future especially when the economy bounces back up, Which it will, because historical data shows economic success after recessions.

I don't plan to entirely rely on a Master's to get my foot in the door. Instead, I plan to produce a few impactful projects come October. Why October? Read on.

&amp;#x200B;

|Career Fair|

That's right. My university holds a yearly career fair for Undergrads, Grads, AND Alumni (woo!). Although my university is more centered on its business fields of study, tech is everywhere! From what I've seen and heard in the past, these career fairs are usually packed with companies eagerly waiting to get their next cheap labor (sorry I mean productive and academically-outstanding workers with a thirst for knowledge in the field).

I've looked into a lot of material regarding successful interactions at career fairs and I honestly believe I can present myself pleasantly to recruiters. I mean, I've worked 4 years as a sales manager in a fine dining setting and have seen and interacted with any type of person you can think of.

Maybe I can also throw in I'm looking to do my Master's to further express my desire to flourish in this new field? Not sure how that will look yet still thinking more into this step. If I could get even an unpaid internship during these times that would be phenomenal.

&amp;#x200B;

|December 2020|

At this point we'll see where I am with my CS skills, the recruiters at the Career Fair, and my admission status with the University. If I have to make some modifications through the plan then so be it!

I'm excited to be jumping into this new chapter of my life!

&amp;#x200B;

Sooooooo.....any thoughts? :D 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

Changing careers at 26. Gonna self-study for a few months using [teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com) with the intent of studying more than 40 hrs a week. My fiancé was able to get a job in banking and we have a pretty good amount of savings and cost of living is low. THANKFUL!

Come October, visit my University Career Fair and try to get internships. If nothing by December, apply for Master's in CompSci program and we'll see from there."

gxgjhx,1,2020-06-05,I (23/F) am starting a new job in a week and a half and I'm looking for advice to overcome anxiety and confidence-issues in the workplace,meadowperlas,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/gxgjhx/i_23f_am_starting_a_new_job_in_a_week_and_a_half/,"Some background info about me: I'm a grad student in NYC and I'm starting an internship as part of my program. I left in NYC in March due to COVID and will be returning for the first time next week. 

I've spent the past 3 months living with my family (mom, dad, older sister) where there is a lot of emotional and verbal abuse. I have been dealing with this abuse for my entire life and am in therapy through my grad school.

I have had struggles in the workplace before because I am very anxious and afraid of failing/making a mistake because growing up that was not allowed. If I ever made a mistake or didn't do something perfectly my family would hold it over my head for years. 

I struggle to speak up in the classroom too because I am surrounded by peers who know a lot and have accomplished a lot professionally while I only just graduated with a Bachelors. After my virtual classes ended, a professor evaluated me and told me I need to speak up more because it is unprofessional not to participate. 

 I have been rejected from a lot of other internship sites and fellowship programs and I believe a lot of it stems from my confidence issues and ability to ""sell myself"". One interviewer even gave me very helpful feedback and let me know I need to develop my interpersonal skills.

I am on medication for my anxiety, depression and ADHD, but the pandemic has taken a toll on my mental health. I also feel guilty using my therapist at my grad school right now because I know there is a shortage of therapists and that students of color need access to mental health resources more than I do right now. 

TLDR; I'm looking for any advice and resources on navigating anxiety in the workplace and building confidence in a professional environment."
gxht4o,23,2020-06-05,Is this a remote internship scam or am I overreacting?,taraosullly,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/gxht4o/is_this_a_remote_internship_scam_or_am_i/,"So, I started this remote unpaid internship recently which was promised to give a training in digital marketing and requires 20 hours per week - 240 hours overall, so about 3 months. The company seemed legit when I looked it, and they said they are hiring multiple interns right now in order to hire some new employees in the next few months.

The interview process was honestly too easy - they asked me literally 2 basic questions, then told me I had the job. I was obviously excited and figured maybe my resume and cover letter had told them enough of what they needed to know.

Upon starting, I realized that the owner of the business was going to be my intern coordinator. He narrates all the training videos, and apparently manages all the interns - which there appears to be at LEAST 30 of. Thats only counting the team I am on for a project, and there is 4 other teams. He reiterates in all videos to only contact him if absolutely necessary, and to always reference the FAQ and that he doesn't want his time wasted- which is strange, considering he's managing all of us.

Upon further research, there only seems to be about 5-10 actual employees from this company. We also only work with other interns, but we are doing real work for the clients. Also one of our daily tasks is to comment and upvote the manager/owners posts on Quora, among other things that seem to only boost his status. Some of our tasks also include posting comments as if we were him, liking all his pages, etc.

Basically, I feel like myself and so many others are just doing the work for free, and that is how he makes his money. We are also not allowed to say that we are interns on any profiles or to any clients, we must present ourselves as ""marketing specialists"". There is also no feedback on any of the work that we do so far, and we are all at different stages in the internship. Theres some great training videos which are nice to have access to, and also I wanted something on my resume, but this just doesn't feel right for some reason.

Anyone have any advice?

edit: I am going to be a senior in college and have no prior internship experience which is why it’s tough for me to just quit because I am a little desperate for a resume booster, but there’s always fall and spring"

&amp;#x200B;

i fucked up big time - my college is going to suspend me for a year for failing out of classes this semester. i'm a senior. what a fucking joke. and i'm just so fucking exhausted and burnout and numb that i don't even *want* to try to fix this and do the schoolwork and graduate. i don't have the energy. my family will be so mad at me when they find out this happened. i go to one of the top schools in the U.S., and my parents are about a quarter mil in debt for it. i feel so guilty, so anxious, but still so numb to my situation. i want to kill myself because of this, and because of a flood of other issues in my life.

i've been falling deeper and deeper into my depression for the last year. shitty friends made my anxiety, ADHD, and depression so vicious, and i dropped the ball on classes, extracurriculars, internships, and social relationships. this has then been compounded by the anxiety of human life being altered forever because of corona, and the dread that nothing will change in america after these protests. i want to go into politics: work on mitigating and adapting to climate change; making society more economically equitable; expanding democratic participation; addressing the institutional and systemic forces that have made life so shitty for so many people; building up public transit systems and renewable energy and public libraries and national parks and and and. do good in the world. but i need a college degree for that.

fucking up like this is making me so suicidal, actively researching things when i've never let myself in my other darker days. i just don't know how to claw myself out of this mess and graduate.

i'm passionate about things, i find pleasure in things, i know i am loved by people. i'm on medication and finding a therapist, starting to workout more because i know it's good for my brain. but i worry that my mental health will always make me struggle like this, that i'll have good periods but then fall back into The Pit, that blackhole of self-loathing and regret and self-imposed social isolation and 14-hour depression sleeps and being paralyzed by anxiety and fucking up my responsibilities because of it, which makes me fall even deeper.

i'm just so afraid that life will always be like this, and so then i think killing myself now will just make it better. but then on the other hand, i want to live so i can experience the good periods and do good in the world. but then again, living is so much *work.* and i'm so tired. that bojack quote of ""every day it gets a little easier. but you gotta do it every day - that's the hard part. but it does get easier."" gets me through my darkest days, but then again i'll have to work hard every day to feel like a normal person. and that feels so exhausting. i just don't know what to do."

I’m currently a sophomore who is highly motivated to get his first internship in a field of software engineering or related (can bet many of you had this nostalgia moment). Due to pandemic I’ve got a lot of free time and a lot of motivation to expand boundaries of my knowledge, and resume hehe. The thing I’m asking you is — what areas of computer science are very beneficial to know while you’re a college student with (almost) no professional work experience. Currently, I’ve learned OOP in Java, Data Structures, and basics of web development using HTML/CSS/JS and React. My brain asking for more tho, what could you recommend?"

I'm currently a marketing major but starting to second guess that and do have enough credits in that and left to take where I can switch to information systems (my other option) without altering my graduation timeline (have the same number of classes either way):

* Marketing with an Information Systems Minor (graduate Spring 2021)
* Information Systems with a Marketing Minor (graduate Spring 2021)
* Marketing and Information Systems double major (3 extra classes - graduate Summer/Fall 2021)

I also have the option to enter my college's MBA program immediately out of undergrad (would graduate Spring 2022) but from what I've heard, MBAs are best for people who either have experience in the business world or people who have a very clear, defined idea of what they want to do for a living, and I fit neither category, so while an MBA is something that I do want at some point, I'm inclined to believe it's not in my best interest right now.

But even beyond that, I don't know what I want I want to do for the rest of my life. I have volunteer experience so my resume isn't totally blank (I can put a copy up if that'd help), but I've never held a job or even an internship before (didn't have very much work ethic until the last year or so when I realized I needed to get my shit together, and while I've applied to places and interviewed, I've never received an actual job offer), and although I do have an interview in a few weeks (marketing internship for a dental facility) that's no guarantee of anything. That said, I am considered a good student (currently have a 3.85 GPA and would have a 4.00 major GPA in either major).

I have an interest in data, computers, analytics, and information systems (I spend most days generally in front of a computer screen and make charts, formulas, and tables in MS Excel for fun) as well as consumer behaviour, communications, and how people act and respond. Part of the reason I'm second guessing my marketing major is that I've been told that a lot of marketing majors end up going into sales, and while I am not opposed to having sales jobs especially while I am new to the labour force, sales is not something I am interested into making a career - I'm extremely introverted, not at all a ""people person"", and prefer communicating behind a computer screen and also have a bit of a stutter that gets really bad when I'm forced to argue and debate things on-the-spot, although otherwise or with practice, I consider myself a decent speaker. I don't mind having some human interaction (I'm the student in class who always sits in the front row and contributes to class discussion.) I also generally dislike social media for a lot of the same reasons (the only ones I use regularly are messenger and facebook, the latter of which I'm trying to phase out as I only really talk to my friends on messenger) and find networking to be uncomfortable and fairly draining.

I'd like to make at least a decent amount of money working in my job (and to have a job that I don't hate as I've heard too many horror stories of people who have low-paying, brutal, miserable jobs they can't leave), and while maybe this is just naïve idealism on my part, but I also want something that helps people and makes the world a better place. I don't know if I'd be satisfied at a job where my role is to convince people to spend their hard-earned money on some overpriced garbage.

I just wish I knew what would be the best use of my last year as an undergrad and while I am fortunate enough to have some time to make my decision as well as a financial safety net, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't nervous about all of this."
gxmeam,2,2020-06-06,do colleges like if you have multiple spikes?,throwaway2638475,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gxmeam/do_colleges_like_if_you_have_multiple_spikes/,"just some bg info: i’m a rising senior and am currently going through the extreme stress of whether i’ve done enough to even be qualified for the top schools. i have 2 passions/spikes: art (specifically anime art) and computer science, my art one arguably “spikier” than my cs one, but i plan on going into computer science as a major, hopefully at a prestigious school that’s known for their cs program like carnegie mellon or mit or caltech or smth. 

for clarity, my art spike consists of things like having my own online store where i sell merch of my art, doing commissions, being a part of many, MANY fandom zines mostly found on tumblr (still trying to find a formal way to write this on things like my resume), etc etc and i never once thought abt doing these things bcuz they’d look good for colleges, if these even do look good for colleges (i guess if you took a step back, my true passion is art and freelancing but i have no intention of majoring in something like that LOL).

my cs spike is comprised of mostly personal projects, one being an app for the Congressional App Challenge (that i’m hoping to win in my district) and another being a large game project i’m doing with my artist friend (they’re the artist and i’m the programmer), a summer internship at Firaxis, a few other things, and i was also planning on hosting my own after-school program at my old middle school where i would teach them the basics of Java, but COVID prevented that (—sidenote: can i still take credit for this if i had all of the confirmation to start this program but can’t do it anymore because of quarantine?).

i want to know if colleges like a profile like mine, where i have 2 big spikes/passions, and one of them is what i want to pursue in the future. i was thinking maybe it added some variety or personality when compared to the rest of the students who may have only 1 big computer science spike, but i was worried that i may be at a disadvantage because my cs spike might not be as big as theirs, since i invested maybe more than half of my time into drawing as well. 

**tl;dr** do colleges like when you have more than one spike if they are what you’re passionate about?"

I initially applied to the CS department (with a secondary choice of math) but they only admitted me into the math program so I went with it. My GPA (so far) is 3.8 and I have just one more quarter left to graduate. The pace of the math program at UCLA is too intense and did not leave any room to properly apply to jobs and hone my interviewing skills.

I have a lot of difficulty with Leetcode problems, and my coding has atrophied due to only doing math during the last two years. UCLA has given me no actionable skills, and I feel I’m not at all ready for industry. I don’t know if I’m depressed or if the window of opportunity really is closing on a career in CS for me. But I feel like it’s over before it even began, and I’m 25. 

What should be my next steps? People say do projects and grind Leetcode, but I wouldn’t even know where to begin with projects. What technologies should I use? I have a little bit of  front-end knowledge and I can design websites really well (I am artsy), but other than that I don’t know much. 

I did an internship at an automation company for 1.5 years where they had me do various tasks. Some of them involved using bash (piping commands and stuff) and others were more web design related. But it wasn’t anything concrete and it left me more puzzled about this industry... 

Please give me an overview of the various CS career tracks, and help me figure out my next steps. What should I specialize in if I enjoy the creative aspects of the job more so than the problem solving ones? Should I do a masters in CS to get started? Should I sign up for a bootcamp? Any advice is appreciated, I really have no sense of direction now.

I had a 3.5 GPA but it feels like empty numbers. To be blunt my skills and knowledge as a CS major feels like shit. I failed multiple job interviews when I was a student because of the coding portion. 
I also never gotten an internship.


I mean, I know practice makes perfect and I have completed a couple of easy problems on leetcode, but medium feels incredibly difficult. I have to watch guides on YouTube and the only language I'm really comfortable with is Java, but I really only know the basics. For example, my skills with generics are crap.


Right now I just sit at home, attempting leetcode. My great friend gifted me his Cracking the Coding Interview book, but I haven't had much time to read it lately because of life problems but I'll be reading it soon. 


Is there any advice on what I should focus on? My dream has always been to be a software engineer. I genuinely enjoy leetcode, it feels like solving a puzzle when I CAN do it, but right now it's just a rough patch.


Edit: I just want to thank everyone again. I want to reply to everyone individually but I've been busy.

Thank you for taking the time out of your day to read this! Currently, I'm a high schooler getting ready to start my junior year. I’ve been researching a lot about colleges lately, and I’ve realized that my extracurriculars are a little all over the place for me to be (possibly) accepted into my dream schools (some of which include the University of Pennslyvania, Vanderbilt University, and Stanford). I'm writing to ask for any suggestions for how I could improve my extracurriculars to have a better chance of getting accepted. So here's some more information to get a better image of my general profile. I am ranked 7/403 at my high school. My unweighted GPA is a 3.974 and my weighted GPA is a 4.474. I received an 1150 (560M/590RW) on the psat I took in 10th grade (I didn't study bc I knew it would not count for the national scholarship competition, but I AM spending this summer to study and a get 1460+ on the psat and the sat when I retake/take them in my junior year because I haven’t taken the SAT or the ACT yet, but I will be during my junior and senior years). I've been taking the hardest classes available to me, and will complete around 10 honors classes and 7 AP classes before I graduate. 

As for my current extracurriculars, let me provide a run-down if what I’ve done each year so far. Freshman year, I didn’t know which clubs would be the most beneficial, so I joined the ones I was interested in. Those clubs were: HOSA (future health professionals), Speech and Debate, and Black Student Union. Through HOSA, I completed around 60+ service hours while volunteering for various health related organizations (ie. St. Jude, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, etc.). I also was a part of a community emergency response team program where I became a trained and certified CERT member, which prepared me for emergency situations (along with being CPR/AED certified). Apart from the extracurriculars I did at school, I was also in a long-term mathematics program that required daily practice in order to progress through the levels of the program (this especially took a LOT of my time in high school due to the rigor and length of the program). And lastly, I also founded my own non-profit tutoring service for my fellow high school students. Even though I created a website, social media account, and GSuite, my tutoring program tended to thrive through word of mouth, and my online platforms were not too useful for my needs. During the summer after I finished my freshman year, I got hired for the same mathematics company that I was a student for, and balanced time working and continuing to progress through the mathematics program while being a paid employee at the same time (so an internship I guess..). 

Now for sophomore year. I chose to focus more on my academics for my tenth grade year (as the curricula was becoming more challenging), but I made sure to still join clubs and participate in organizations outside of the classroom. I stayed in HOSA, and continued to serve my community by volunteering for around 70 hours at health related organizations. From the summer before my sophomore year and throughout my 10th grade year, I also volunteered weekly at my local library, where I dedicated time cleaning the library, shelving books, reading to children, and assisting guests with their visit (my experience was unfortunately cut short due to coronavirus regulations, sadly). I also became an inducted member for the NHS (National Honor Society) chapter at my high school (my experience with this club was also cut short due to the novel coronavirus). Aside from school clubs, I continued to work on my tutoring service by expanding subject availability. As for the mathematics program I had been working so hard in, I finally completed the program and earned my mathematics diploma! However, I continued to keep the paid job I had been offered, even though I was no longer a student.

You might be wondering, why worry about extracurricular activities if you already have some? Here’s my dilemma. I plan to major in something health/bio-related in undergrad, then go to dental school after that. So, my main concern about my extracurriculars is having something dental or healthcare-related. Aside from my volunteering and involvement with general health related activities, should I go more into depth regarding science and healthcare to show admissions officers what I’m really interested in? For example volunteering regularly at a hospital or dental clinic (once the covid-19 situation settles down, of course), or participating in a science internship or a research project? However, another aspect to consider is whether or not I can find places to participate in (as my city doesn’t really tend to have a plethora of these types of activities). Please let me know what your opinion is. THANK YOU SO SO SO MUCH for taking time out of your day to read and respond, I really appreciate it!! :)"

I’ll get straight to the point. I am a Secondary 4 hoping to get into a polytechnic via EAE. So far, my choices are NP Engineering Science, SP’s Engineering with Business and maybe one other SP engineering course that’s reputable like Computer Engineering. However, I’m having a hard time to decide which polytechnic is better for me. I am aiming to go to university with my diploma. 

\*\*Context\*\*

For NP’s Engineering Science, I know that it is a broad course that will cover most of the engineering disciplines, as well as covering new and relevant skills such as artificial intelligence and Machine Learning. This will I think allow me to be more prepared for university? I also know that there are these IS modules that are supposed to give me opportunities to learn and apply what I’ve learnt from the modules. IS also has other unique programs such as the Certificate in Advanced Engineering Math (to prepare for Univ) and language Enhance programme (interested to pursue Korean lang)

For SP’s Engineering Business course, I like the fact that I will be able to learn Engineering with a business mindset. I feel like as an Engineer with a business/entrepreneurial mindset, I will be able to create ideas and make them realistic and actually make money from them. This actually sounds nice to me. Also, this course states that the engineering modules will not be so in-depth as it is also a business type of course. Is this true? In addition, competing with NP’s IS is SP’s SPOT programme, which is a programme to develop leadership skills, build up portfolio by doing more projects i think. 

So this is the point at which I’d like to clarify some doubts I have.

1. Are the additional programmes like SPOT and IS free? Like are the programmes like CAEM and Language Enhancement programme lessons are free?
2. For those in IS and SPOT, can you give a description/your experience as well as advice to be enrolled in the programmes? 
3. For those in NP ES,
   1. What are some projects that you have done?
   2. Have you ever thought about your future with NP ES, where do you want to go after poly?
   3. What internship opportunities are offered by ES? Are some of them overseas?
4. For those in SP DEB,
   1. I know that this course is about engineering with an entrepreneurial mindset, but have any of you actually engineered a product and tried to sell it and start your own business? 
   2. Is it true that the engineering modules are not in-depth? How much in-depth (aka hard) are they?

gxs6r7,1,2020-06-06,Question about Leetcode Preparation,ni9ne9,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/gxs6r7/question_about_leetcode_preparation/,"Hi everyone,

I'm a sophomore in college studying computer science and I've been practicing on [Coderust](https://www.educative.io/courses/coderust-hacking-the-coding-interview) lately for future internship interviews.

I notice that most of the time, I either a) cannot solve the problem at all or b) if I solve it, it's using a brute force solution that most people would have come up with as long as they knew some DS&amp;A fundamentals.

Is this considered ""normal""? A lot of the ingenious ways of approaching these problems as shown in the solutions is making me doubt my abilities and lose confidence because I feel like I'll never be able to come up with ""tricks"" like this on my own.

For example, I recently did a question where you find the smallest common number in three sorted arrays. My naive solution was to iterate over one array and do binary search on all the other arrays for each iteration.

The solution showed a much more efficient approach with O(n) time complexity using three pointers that... I couldn't really have come up with by myself.

**So my main question:** is preparing for coding interviews and doing Leetcode a matter of understanding DS&amp;A fundamentals deeply and recognizing patterns? I feel like all I'm really doing these days is solving problems to the best of my ability and then learning from someone else's more efficient solutions.

Thanks for reading!"

gxuqg1,0,2020-06-06,Which degree would be worth more?,TheMightyZulf,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/gxuqg1/which_degree_would_be_worth_more/,"Hey, so I'm currently an incoming freshman studying CS this fall at my university, and I discovered that the CS department at my university actually offers both a CS degree and a Software Engineering degree.

The difference? While CS goes over lots of theory and is very math-based, the SE program offers a more practical approach to CS and actually goes over things like building different types of software, project management, etc. The degree plans for both majors are EXACTLY the same however, save for six classes. SE drops a few of the math and theory classes in favor of courses focused in software testing, software project planning, software architecture, and three classes in a specialization that you choose.

In the SE degree, the specialization tracks are:

1. Information Assurance
2. Embedded Systems
3. Computer Imaging
4. AI
5. Human- Computer Interaction
6. Networks

Thats basically the gist of the differences between the degrees. Again, it's not much of a difference because in total there are only six different classes between the two degree plans, but being a builder and someone who likes to create apps and different programs, I'm a bit leaning towards switching to the SE program, which offers a more practical use of CS. I'm also not as adept at math so SE sounds better to me. My university also doesn't allow us to double major in the two as they are way too similar, which would have been a good choice if it were allowed.

My problem is if the traditional CS degree is preferred in the professional world. Would doing the SE degree put me at a disadvantage when applying for internships and jobs? Would I have to explain my degree to employers? Do large companies prefer the more well-known CS degree? Keep in mind that both degrees follow the same exact degree plan albeit with a difference of six classes in total. I'll still be taking the important classes like data structures and algorithms with the SE degree."
gxuwhw,6,2020-06-06,"I applied for a high school NASA internship, got accepted in April, and am now wondering if I should throw in the towel for my sake.",[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/gxuwhw/i_applied_for_a_high_school_nasa_internship_got/," **Yes, I know this is going to come off as the most entitled thing in the world.**

Hello. I'm a highschool sophomore going into junior year. I was in careers class browsing a website that gave a plethora of information on occupations, programs of study, etc. I somehow managed to stumble upon the site for NASA internships, specifically the SEES internship. I figured, ""Why not, this will be a huge opportunity; you'll look good, get paid, all that good stuff!""

The deadline was due the very next day, so I figured ""May as well try."" I ended up filing an application for it, and lo and behold, I got an email in April saying I got accepted. Naturally, I accepted ( who wouldn't? ). So now I am locked in so to speak for doing the internship.

Here's where the problems start.

During distance learning for school due to the pandemic, I quickly realized that I wasn't being at sharp as usual, due to there being no ""physical"" motivation ( not that I had a whole lot of motivation, to begin with ); I am at home. This is the place where I unwind after spending seven hours learning. This didn't bode well, but I stuck to it. After all, if I screwed up it would come back to haunt me in college.

Over the next month up until school ended, my mental health was starting to slowly go down. I just wanted to kick back and relax. Unfortunately, though, I got reminded of the fact that I had an internship to do over the summer after receiving another email stating more information on it. The internship was going to be done virtually now, instead of going down to Texas.

Come this week, I check on the dashboard the instructors had us access, and after seeing other people's introduction to themselves, as well as the things we needed to be doing, I quickly realized that I was out of my league, and considering my antics during the last month of school, I'd likely jeopardize my internship and not live up to the standards that the instructors wanted.

So now I am now wondering if I should call it off, or bite the bullet and stick with it.

**If I DO stick with it**: I get to say I was in a NASA internship ( although that may make me ""overqualified"" for certain things ). I also get experience as a scientist ( I like STEM stuff ). Although this would come at the cost of my mental health ( not to the point of suicide, so don't worry ).

**If I DON'T stick with it:** I deal with the fallout of ""You quit a NASA internship!?"" as well as letting everyone that knew about this down ( only my family and a few teachers know I have this internship, and I did hype it up a little ). I'd also deal with the fact that I basically screwed over the person who didn't get chosen because I looked slightly more ideal ( I probably only got in due to living in Minnesota; the internship had to do with mosquitoes ).

I want your guy's verdict on this."
gxux26,3,2020-06-06,I am facing several crossroads in my learning and I don't know where to go from here,rLoper,learnmachinelearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/gxux26/i_am_facing_several_crossroads_in_my_learning_and/,"Hi! I am almost 1 year into learning Data Science and ML by a self-taught approach and I don't know where to go from here for several reasons, here are some dilemmas that I'm currently having:

(TL;DR is at the end)

1. **Getting more technical -** I did calculus and linear algebra courses, but I feel that my linear algebra understanding is not good enough and that I should also do Calc III (since I only did I and II). I feel like I have an okay understanding, I can program Neural Networks from scratch, but when I tried to read ESL, I got overwhelmed and decided I am not ready for it. I am now in between reading the Linear Algebra textbook by Shilov and also doing the [fast.ai](https://fast.ai) Computational Linear Algebra course and I am also considering starting Calc III. The thing is, I don't want to spend my time on the things I won't end up using in the end. I really want to get into the NLP field in the near future, I want to be on the cutting edge of it, but I don't know what skills am I going to need, especially because almost all of my attention has been focused on dealing with tabular data.
2. **Full-stack Data Scientist -** I've also always wanted to be able to execute the whole pipelines by myself and make an actual product but right now, I am a bit short on both ends of the spectrum. My Hadoop ecosystem knowledge is very limited, SQL is as far as it goes so I might want to allocate some time for that. But the more important (or the thing that is going to consume more time) is making applications. I know that I'd rather make Mobile and Desktop rather than Web apps, but that is as far as it goes. Should I learn the basics of Computer Science and go with C++ (read that somewhere), or maybe Java, Idk really. Mobile apps should be of greater importance as of now but I don't know what it takes to be able to execute the whole pipeline and which programming language is the best to be used in the end. 
3. **An internship -** I'm stepping on the breaks a bit during the second half of June and July (will probably use that time to work on a minor project and read some books, nothing too intensive)  and I am thinking about applying for an internship that would ideally start in august. I haven't been receiving much feedback during my learning so I'm a bit unsure about my skills and I also don't have any experience in the field. I feel like a Data Analyst position would suit me the best or something like that. The bigger concern regarding this ""internship dilemma"" is actually my age and country. I live in Belgium and as far as I've learned so far, the industry is very conservative (all internships expect from you to be in a Masters program and the pay and working environment are not as competitive and exciting as it is in the US and Canada), applies pretty much to all of Europe. The fact that I am 17 doesn't help at all lol. My bets are on cold e-mailing and to start to network but those might not be the best approaches.

**TL;DR**:

1. How much technical do I need to get to read ESL and get into the cutting edge of the NLP field? 
2. What programming language should I choose to learn for mobile app development? 
3. How should I approach getting a some kind of internship as a 17yr old living in Europe?

Background: I'm a  Business Admin student doing Business Analytics for my specicialisation

(Unfortunately, there's only 6 modules + another 3 more making it a total of 9 modules in analytics)

The problem comes mainly in several parts:

1) Realistically I do not know what roles I qualify for. Because I know very little yet. Furthermore, I am obviously not going to be able to compete with Data Science and SoC's Business Analytics major technically because what I learn is going to be so limited.

2) Failure to secure any internships at the moment. I started looking at some of my cohort's LinkedIn profile and I see all the stellar portfolio's: internships. I tried applying but I couldn't get into any, be it generalised roles or even student assistant roles. There are even people getting internships in analyst positions in banks, investment banks, boutique firms etc. 

I really start to question myself what have I actually done in my past 2 years in school. I worked really hard and almost just dedicating my life just to keep my grades somewhere afloat. Unfortunately they are mediocre, but I accept my mediocrity.

3) I just don't know how to position myself. I don't know what can I say about myself. While I picked up some Python myself and went thru some ""programming course"" in the faculty I must say I must be so ashamed to be able to put that in my resume, although I did

Practically, I did nothing with it. Sure, I faded better than my cohort for the module, but it was entire bullshit. I look at the ""machine learning"" project that me and my team it because it looks like something a kid who knew nothing abt data science / analytics did it. 

Not to mention, there are people who went through the rigour of CS1010S, not me. They are much more qualified 
to say they are proficient in Python. Maybe I can only say ""I'm familiar with"" but even that is flattering for me

I subsequently did R, but mostly I did data cleaning and also plotted graphs and build a dashboard. Honestly I was so horrible in building that dashboard and mainly had to depend on my group mates who taught me. But not even that would qualify for an adequate data science project, because it was mainly descriptive.

I know it's probably myself getting more negative and depressed being at home due to COVID-19. But honestly I cannot help but think it is purely me being useless for failing to achieve anything with half of my university life gone, just that COVID-19 provided a nice excuse for staying unemployed.

Right now all I can do is try to be a bit relevant by not wasting my days. Finishing datacamp courses for a cert I can put on my resume. And start doing Kaggle. But to be frank, I don't know where to start, but I'll try. 

To be frank, I do not know how and what am I working towards to. I only know at the end of the day I want to be in an 'analytics' related job. I just don't know I can do, what kind of roles, what should I be doing (especially with this long break)

I know this rant is negative. I'm really sorry. Plus without an avenue or someone to speak to just makes everything a little more stressful. I'm usually awkward and by myself and very private, and maybe I got used to that. But the past month the sudden realisation of being such an epic failure, suddenly made everything worse.

Thank you to any kind stranger, if you finished reading this and I hope all has been fine for you."

I’ll be working with Angular and Spring Boot to complete it, which I think is a great learning experience. However I have 0 experience with these frameworks, as I’ve only had experience in plain JS and Java. I’m so lost on how to even begin coding such a project. I have no clue how any of the code should even look like or what code I should write at all. This is unlike any school project as those are small and the specs are clearly given by the professor.

Anybody with similar experiences to mine? Did you end up actually coding something meaningful, and how much did you learn? I’m feeling a little nervous about all of it."

So here’s some background. My friend, C, is going back to college for an internship next week. Because of corona virus, the likelihood is that we can’t see each other until Thanksgiving. So she understandably wants to see me before then (as I am stuck home furloughed from my summer hospital work.) however, my father has congestive heart failure, making him one of the most vulnerable for the virus. Call the virus whatever you want, but my father is most at risk for the virus and we want to protect him from exposures as much as we can (if you’re going to comment that I’m stupid and that the virus is a hoax, don’t bother. I work in a hospital and know what I am dealing with. I myself am very low risk but could be a carrier to my father.) I have been putting her off for two months because of my dad. Additionally, I know she hasn’t been careful about distancing, going on dates and going to parties or whatever. She got upset with me yesterday because she feels like she is putting more into the friendship than me (because I wasn’t communicating as much at the end of the semester and wasn’t texting often, which is fair) when I was hesitant about hanging out before she left. 

I talked to my parents about it and we agreed we could get drive through and maybe sit six feet apart in a parking lot. We’d get to see each other and be safe about it. I suggested that today and she got upset with me again, saying she shouldn’t have to drive 30 min to get chick fil à and that we should meet at one in her city (which has been notoriously bad about social distancing and has had a lot of protests), which I don’t want to do. I also feel the restaurant closer to my house has a bigger and nicer parking lot with more restrictions. I feel like I’ve compromised a lot to be able to meet with her- because the best she can say if my dad gets if from me is ‘I’m sorry’ and move on with her life. I feel like I can’t be blunt with her because she’s super sensitive and honestly I really want to snap at her. I get she thinks my life is perfect but my dad is super vulnerable. Yeah he’s back at work but he’s shut in his office with a mask on all day. I don’t know what to do and what to say to her. I don’t want to ruin my friendship but she is really pissing me off right now.

TLDR: friend wants to meet up with me even though my dad is compromised. I offered a compromise and she’s now trying to pressure me to drive further to her city, which I don’t want to do."
gxx43x,5,2020-06-06,Question for experienced Kernel devs (USA),thwaway242,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/gxx43x/question_for_experienced_kernel_devs_usa/,"Im currently doing an internship working on low level stuff like the linux kernel, embedded stuff etc. I'm a sophomore and during this summer and last summer I did low level internships (both at F100 companies). Is this really a viable path from 2020 onwards for someone who doesn't have years and years of experience? 

&amp;nbsp;

I kind of feel like I maybe silo'ing myself. Its not that I don't do web dev and mobile app projects, as all of my side projects are web and app based. But during high school I was really into kernel stuff and sent a bunch of driver patches to the linux kernel that got accepted, so now I'm labeled (at least in my friend group as the low level guy). During these past 2 internships I noticed that the demographics are heavily on the older more season/experienced side. Maybe I shouldn't feel this way but it feels pretty isolating as I can't relate to anyone my teams. 

&amp;nbsp;

With that said I think I like doing more high level stuff instead of looking through the rabbit hole of hexadecimal numbers trying to figure out why a cpu crashed or going down the pointer arithmetic rabbit hole. Will these 2 low level internships look bad to employers whose technologies are higher up on the stack? I'm speaking about all companies.

&amp;nbsp;

For older folks, do you suggest I get out while I can? Or Am I just overthinking all of this."

Current rising out of state HS Senior. I’ve always been interested in business, but lately I’ve been seriously considering doing something in Fintech or quantitative business related fields before I get my MBA. I know that something CS related is good to get you the skills to succeed in those careers, and I don’t want to pursue a software development career. The CSB Honors program seems perfect for me because it combines computer science and business, but I was wondering if it is more for CS oriented people who want to get business knowledge or vice versa. I would say I am a more business-oriented person(I’m taking AP CS A in senior year and know financial modeling in python and game theory, but I have a lot more business electives and ECs) who wants a solid foundation in CS. Also, can people in CSB can still get the same careers as people in McCombs and do they have the same access to recruiters in the business school? Finally, I know it’s a dual degree and really rigorous but could I have time to still get a minor in Finance and do internships in the summer?

gxxcq5,1,2020-06-06,I want to fall asleep and never wake up.,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gxxcq5/i_want_to_fall_asleep_and_never_wake_up/,"There is absolutely no reason to believe that my future holds anything different to what I am currently experiencing. I am autistic, asexual, white, male, 27, living in the United Kingdom. I have scoliosis, severely diminished energy levels and become somnolent randomly during the day. If I have a sleep attack, I am forced to drop whatever I'm doing and lay down to sleep wherever I am. I have fallen asleep at parties, at school (special ed for my entire life) and college (which I dropped out from). I will never be able to drive or work as a result, and will be forced to rely on my (divorced) family and the State for the remainder of my pointless existence. I will be on benefits for the rest of my life, and, if I ever lose access to them, will be relegated to homelessness, and then prison.

Moving my body is nearly impossible. There are times where my limbs refuse to move when I try to move them because they are too heavy. I can barely force myself to get up just to go to the toilet. I have permanent bedsores on my shoulders from lying down in bed so much because I just can't move. The absolute worst episode I had of this was back when I was still in college. I went to the canteen and my body was so exhausted I just collapsed and fell backwards. Even before the lockdown, I would often not leave the house for weeks at a time. I will never leave the house again; I hate the sight of the world and other people. I never want to be outside again. I do not want to be a part of the world or society. The thought of being out in public or seen by anyone else fills me with dread. I feel a weight in my stomach and I want to vomit every waking moment.

I can't eat more than one meal a day and sometimes not even that much. I hate my body; it doesn't function right. IBS causing diarrhoea and constipation seemingly randomly, acid reflux, restless legs, exploding head syndrome, muscle weakness. I once had an episode of exploding head syndrome that caused a surge of acute pain going all the way down my sternum; I thought I was having a heart attack until it suddenly subsided. My septum is deviated so I sometimes can't breathe through my nose properly and am forced to breathe through my mouth. Random irritation in my nose and throat can cause uncontrolled fits of sneezing and coughing. I will be relatively okay for a while and then just randomly be unable to prevent myself coughing so heavily I see black spots in front of my eyes, I lose control of my hands and they start to tremble. My breathing will begin to rattle and wheeze randomly.

My muscle co-ordination is spastic, possibly due to autism. My limbs will sometimes involuntarily jerk when I try to move them. For example, if I am trying to grab a cup, my arm will sometimes just jerk towards it and knock it over. I attempted to learn a combat sport (Judo), but was unable to coordinate myself properly and injured my leg.

I am unable to prepare my own meals, wash or fold my own clothes, or clean a house. I will never be able to live independently.

I attempted to work an unpaid internship in an attempt to actually get a career; I only lasted a month. The stress and anxiety was just too powerful I had absolutely no free time. I would be so exhausted by the end of my shift that when I got home (family member provided transport), I would just fall asleep and wake up about an hour before I had to go to this internship again.

I don't want to be trapped in this defective body anymore; if an animal was living like this they would be put to sleep with no objections. The exhaustion is constant and unending. The pit in my stomach is unending. The inability to concentrate or even think is unending. My days consist of drifting in and out of consciousness, occasionally becoming too restless to stay in bed, and then sitting at my computer desk for 45 minutes or so until I become too tired to focus on whatever I was trying to focus on and am forced to go back to bed. My right forearm is permanently scarred from where I would cut as a teenager.

As mentioned earlier, my parents are divorced. My sister is also autistic and my mother is the type of woman that will scream for a manager if she doesn't get her way. I am completely embarrassed to be seen in pubic with her because she always leverages the fact that she's caring for two autistic children to get her own way, whether it's a discount on something or to have a table unfolded at a coffee shop so she can smoke three minutes from closing time. She always heaps praise onto me and says I'm special (I know it's just ""momma talk"", I don't believe a word of it), but treats my sister like a subhuman, always barking orders and getting into screaming matches. My father was a pig and an adulterer - a complete do-nothing who used his cushy busywork job in IT as an excuse to avoid any kind of work in the house or interaction with the family. He would just come home after work and sit on the Xbox or his laptop.

I am unable to relate to others. Because to my autism, I tend to alienate other people. If I try to be honest, I'm considered rude and if I try to be nice they notice I'm just gladmasking. People are just repulsed by me because I sound like a drunken, slurring robot. Every motion I make is awkward and stiff, so much so that people can tell I have autism just by me sitting down because I involuntarily rock back and forth. My childhood after-school was usually spent in the house playing beyblades by myself because my mother was working for a MLM scam and my father was just absent.

I no longer even want to be successful. I will never even attempt to look for work because I'm an unfixable trainwreck. My entire life was a mistake.

My mindset has gotten to the point where I am sincerely unable to feel affection or closeness. The thought of interpersonal contact makes my skin crawl, the thought of spending extended time with another person makes me nauseous. I feel nothing but alternating flashes of barely-controllable rage, and insurmountable hopelessness.

I literally can't do anything; my body won't let me. This condition is unliveable. Can't move properly, can't focus properly, can't stay awake, can't relate to people and am now afraid to try, This isn't living; I can't even imagine what constitutes a decent life, because even the normal people around me seem to be dissatisfied. There's just no point."

I'm a DS intern tasked with some light DE tasks and looking to find a DE role after this internship ends (tired of DS, but that's another story...) 

I'm currently taking the udacity DE nanodegree course, and while it's pretty good, they do most things via jupyter notebooks which isn't really realistic (although I understand why they do things this way).

I'm curious about how you professional engineers go about doing things... there doesn't seem to be much online about this (or I'm bad at searching). 

So, how do you do things at your job? What are some DE best practices? 

Here are some questions I have: 

1. When writing code, do you use an IDE or are most things done in the command line and/or with vim?
2. What do use to test SQL queries? (e.g. IDE plugin, Jupyter, dedicated SQL client, etc)
3. What tools do you use to monitor the health/status of pipelines?
4. How do you store/retrieve credentials to databases/web services?
4. For online services, do you manage clusters/instances via the web interface or all through code?

I'd love any additional input you all have! Thank you"

Other districts pay differently and may vary, so ensure that you’re doing research specific for the state that is in question.

Let’s start with the factors that go into a teacher’s salary.  Some factors that influence this are district funding, local taxes, supply and demand for teachers in the area, geographic location, and cost of living. This is by no means the complete list of factors that go into teacher pay, but just a few listed within the journal article by Kirby, Holmes, Matthews, &amp; Watt (1993) regarding factors influencing teacher salaries.  It’s definitely an older article, but the reality is that the factors influencing pay has not changed much since. 

Here’s the difficult part of teacher salaries that a lot of people who are not teachers struggle to understand.  It ranges depending on two factors that I noticed mainly:

1.  Definition of teacher

2.  Location/district

&amp;#x200B;

\-------- defining ""teacher"" --------------

Let’s first address definition of teacher.  In my personal experience, I noticed the word teacher gets thrown around easily.  There are a lot of different types of teachers though.  Here are some examples that once again, is not all inclusive:

1.  Teacher at a private school without a credential

2.  Teacher at a public school with a credential

3.  Teacher at a public school without a credential, usually referred to as a district intern

4.  Instructional or teacher’s aide at a public or private school without a credential

While there’s no denying that all of them are teachers, and even TA’s/IA’s are teachers, when talking about “teacher salary”, I noticed that all of these get clumped into one category and that influences the conversation about how much teachers are paid a lot. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-------- example ---------

Here’s how you can look up salaries for school districts.  They should be all public.  Look up: “\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ school district salary schedule”.

Let’s use El Segundo Unified School District as an example.

An instructional aide is listed under [a classified salary schedule](https://elsegundousd.edliotest.com/Proposed%20APPENDIX%20A%20-%20Classified%20Positions.pdf), while a teacher is listed under a [certified salary schedule](https://elsegundousd.edliotest.com/Certificated%20Salary%20Schedule%202018-19.pdf). 

1.  Instructional aides make $15.58 an hour at step 1 and a maximum of $18.95 at step 5. With 183 days of teaching and 8 hours a day, this translates to $22,809 and $27,742 at the maximum.

2.  Teachers without a credential can make a starting salary of $45,920 at step 1 and $47,075 at step 3 maximum. 

3.  Teachers with a credential and masters (usually standard for California teachers) makes a starting salary of $58,701 at step 1 and $83,450 at step 12. 

4.  Teachers with a credential and masters + 30 units make a maximum of $101,619 at step 16. 

Now for the scenarios in 3 and 4, you have to factor in stipends and additional pay if applicable.  Let’s say that a person has a masters, credential, and is a department chair, the salary is $88,093.5. This is calculated from adding in the master’s stipend and additional 4.5% department chair position. 

Let’s say that a person is at the highest pay scale in scenario 4 and is also a department chair, they would be making $108,141.  This is calculated from adding in the master’s and doctoral stipend and department chair position stipend.  

&amp;#x200B;

\---------

I want to reiterate that all of the positions are teachers.  They all work to educate our students and are so important in their success.  However, it’s important to understand that when speaking about “teacher salary”, it’s important to understand what type of teacher one is referring to.  One may be a TA making a maximum of $27,742 and another may be a credentialed teacher making $108,141.

I’m not saying that teachers are paid enough, too much, or too little.  I believe that teachers are so valuable in societal development and the higher paid, high quality, and educated our teachers are, the better the situation for our students.  Some districts pay teachers poorly (LAUSD honestly is pretty bad), while other districts pay teachers extremely well, like [Los Alamitos Unified](https://www.losal.org/cms/lib/CA01000497/Centricity/Domain/13/18-19/SS/18-19ReopenerBdApp-2-26-19/18-19%20Certificated%20-%20Reopener.pdf) with a top pay of $125,961 or even [Laguna Beach Unified](https://www.lbusd.org/departments/human-resources/salary-schedules) with a top pay of $136,197 for a teacher with two masters, a doctorate, NBCT, and longevity stipends.  With the lower paying districts, it’s important to understand that there are other districts out there in California with higher pay and you may be working next to a district that has a huge pay jump.  Work where you’re valued if you have that privilege.

&amp;#x200B;

\--------------

What’s the point?

If you can, try to top out the pay scale.  It’s hard to lump teacher pay into one specific category because it varies so much depending on what district you’re working for, your degrees/units, if you have a credential or certifications, etc.  It’s important to do research on what pay is like around you and advocate for a salary that reflects the value that all of you teachers have on the students.  You are important in the lives of students and you deserve to be paid fairly.  I hope this helps those who don’t understand teacher pay, salaries, and how they work learn how to begin to understand how it works.  If you live in a state like AZ, you can’t google average teacher pay and see the number and assume AZ teachers make that much, then say they don’t need higher pay.  Do the research on the local\* district because it changes so much."

so in 2 months I am starting as a software developer in germany. I have learned the programming basics with python and this job is like a paid internship with a degree at the end and they teach you things. It's hard to explain, I am basically a Jr.Developer but with less skill. Whatever, my boss told me that they are working with web applications and in preparation for this I wanted to learn as much as possible so I can start learning from their projects ASAP without being to far behind on actual programmign knowledge. He told me to learn frontend (HTML,CSS, JavaScript), and C# or Java for backend (he said it doesn't matter for the actual job because they use both 50/50 and I could choose on my own). So now I don't really know what to do, should I learn Java which seems to have more use cases outside my job, which I would be very interested in. But I also heard Java is really hard to learn, or at least really complicated. C# seems to be much easier but there are not to many use cases outside of my job which would interest me very much.

So is this true? Is Java harder than C#?  
Any help and every advice is greatly appreciated because I don't know really much about anything!  


Thank you!"

I'm an American and I have a pretty awesome career path teaching abroad but I burnt out hard this year with COVID and other factors. I leave my job July 11 and fly back to the US to see people.

Living in the US is just not an option for me. I can't adjust to the cost of living, the low wages for teachers, the barriers for entry, the need for a car, I could go on but life in America is not for me.

The plan was to move to Mexico with a friend and pursue some interests for a year and ""decompress"" but he just bailed on me.

Basically every one I've met, fallen in love with or formed strong bonds has disappeared over the years just because we're all expats. It's impossible to form bonds like this.

I hate being alone these days but here I am.

The plan is to move to Mexico and do a scuba diving internship to earn some licenses in that and see what happens but an old friend said I could move to Nashville and work bars for the Summer but then I need to find a place to live, leases, paperwork, utilities, get an expensive cell phone and the only reason to do it would be to be around an old friend but I have a sinking feeling he's moved on and doesn't have room for me on the day to day.

I could whine some more but just looking for kind words or advice."

**Personal Info:** Biracial (Mexican and White...but white is Jewish), from California, gay, woman, small private school (switched before junior year from other private school due to excessive bullying), middle class (will need finical aid from some, but not all schools)

**Major:** Political Science (also interested in Philosophy, History, and Journalism/Communications for potential minors)

**Academics:**

GPA: 3.98 UW and 4.4 W

SAT: got cancelled 2x cos covid, but am now shooting for a 1520 in August (got 96 percentile on PSAT 10 w/o studying)

APs not offered at my school (but self-studied, APUSH, and AP US Gov and Politics)

Have done out of school honors projects for non-honors classes to receive honors credit

SAT II: Hopefully will have enough time to take World History, US History, Spanish, and maybe Lit

**Extra Curricular Activities:**

Model UN - Secretary General of an online international conference. I spent about 20 hours a week on this for several months junior year. I will continue it senior year (we plan on hosting 2 conferences next year). I am also going to expand this to a club at my school senior year so more students can participate

Bernie Sanders Campaign volunteer - In both English and Spanish (my second language - I had to pass a test). I was also in the ""advanced texting"" program; I had to pass a test for this as well. I spent 7-10 hrs a week on this for over a year.

Internship at LA city councilmember's office: About 40 hrs a week for a month. My research turned into policy in LA.

Work experience: camp counselor for 40+ hours a week for a month- paid since last summer- volunteer (as Junior Counselor in Training or Counselor in Training) from 5th grade through last summer

I am beginning a Summer fellowship with a congressional campaign. Will work approximately 20 hours a week on this. I am working remotely (cos covid) but there are opportunities to be promoted.

Creator of blog about hockey: in 7th a created an instagram account (over 1500 followers not) to talk about and analyze my favorite team, the Los Angeles Kings and in 11th grade, I turned it into a website where I now write articles covering them. This is purely a passion project as I love hockey and people like to hear what I have to say (they also always assume I'm a guy lol... who says a girl can't be more knowledgable than you about sports)

Co-Founder/Co-President of my school's GSA (Gender Sexuality Alliance): one of 2 surviving clubs at my school. We manly discuss current events through historical contextualization and promote intersectionality. Will be sole president senior year. This is a minimal time commitment, but I feel as if it is important in order to educate the community.

King's College Pre-University Summer Programme in Political Science: accepted into competitive, international pre-college program in London, specializing in international relations (one of the biggest eye-opening experiences of my life)

I plan on volunteering on another political campaign (local) - purposely vague so I do no reveal my identity. I will work several hours a week if possible.

I will begin volunteering with the Trevor Project in August (must be 18 to do so). This has been one of my goals for several years now... so I am glad I will be able to do it for a year before I go to college.

I also do art (painting and drawing), write op-eds and theater (have not been published... yet), and play ukulele, guitar, charango (Peruvian folk instrument), and a little bass for fun.

**Awards/Honors:** National Spanish Exam (NSE) bronze (freshman year) and silver (sophomore year.. scored perfectly on one of the sections). I will graduate with distinction from my school; this involves a lengthy senior thesis. I know I do not have many awards... is that going to hurt me? I never really knew that they were so important, otherwise I would have entered in more competitions and stuff (rip). I have found some, but I will not know if I won before sending in some of my applications.

**Essays/Letters of Recommendation:** I'm a pretty good writer and I have an army of people willing to read and critique my essays. I'm close with many of my teachers because I go to such a small school, so I think my letters of recommendation will be pretty good!

**Schools:**

Columbia (ED), UC Berkeley, Yale, Harvard, Stanford, Brown, Georgetown, Princeton, Reed (EA?), George Washington, Boston University (legacy), Brandeis, NYU, Williams, Barnard, Cornell, UCLA, UCSD, UCSB, Lewis and Clark, Clark, The New School.

**Last Bit:** So, Columbia is my DREAM school and I want to apply there ED as a poli-sci major. So for their supplements, I'm pretty well read (currently reading the *Iliad* and *And the Band Played On* for fun) and I have engaged in many cultural events over the past year (from art exhibits to an opera to international films to concerts ranging from broadway stars to punk rock) and I really hope I can get in there!

Now what?,adamjocon,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/gy5ktz/my_industrys_been_shuttered_due_to_covid_now_what/,"Hey everyone! So I just graduated college with a BFA in Drama from NYU in May. I’ve had to make some really radical changes to my career path because of the pandemic, considering most in New York are predicting theaters won’t be able to open until at least January. New York is the last place I want to be doing theater right now because of that (and the coming advent of virtual theater isn’t really my thing), so I’m looking at other options.

I’ve been working at theme parks and renaissance faires for three years doing various entertainment roles, so working for  theme park live entertainment has always been something I wanted to do, something I’m good at, and something I thought was realistically achievable. I was supposed to start an internship at Disney World in August (my second internship at the park), and my plan was to work in the theme park circuit for a while, secure my Actor’s Equity Membership (it’s much easier to get working at Disney than in New York), and then move back to New York when I’m ready. Unfortunately, it’s looking like my internship may get cancelled. Theme parks have been just as hard hit as theaters but are opening way earlier (Universal opened this week and Disney is opening in July), so regardless I’m moving down to Florida in August to try and start my career there.
 
My DREAM right now would be to get in with Universal Creative and work on this season of Halloween Horror Nights in any capacity. Not even necessarily performing, as I’ve always seen my fallback plan as working production for HHN and eventually becoming a show director there. I’ve been eyeing Universal for job opportunities as they’re already open and seems to have brought back a LOT of their entertainment team, WAY more than Disney is apparently trying to do. Despite that, the parks are not auditioning or hiring right now, and it’s hard to tell when they’ll start; rightfully so, as the full timers should get back to work first.

What can I do during this limbo time? Is there a way to move forward without a job posting? If anyone has experience in this industry I would love to hear your thoughts or advice!"

I have done pretty ok during my undergrad (~3.3 GPA) and during so, have found the desire to pursue a masters degree to further understand the things in this field that I want to eventually make my career (Fluid Dynamics, Propulsion) 

Up until very recently, I had no problem taking on the debt and paying for my own grad school, but the more I look into it, the more I hear it is a bad idea for an engineering student to pay for their own grad school, and that you should, of course, find a company that will pay at least a part of it for you. 

Here is the problem, I am utter shit at networking and internship/job searching I have found out over the past year. And it’s not looking like the job market in general will improve much by the time I graduate. 

I do not have internship experience, and even when I was on a “playing field” with others that didn’t have previous experience, I still couldn’t manage to land any. 

I think I have a decent resume for grad schools and research, as I have over a year of research experience in the subjects that I want to pursue, as well as I will have a published undergrad thesis by the time I graduate, but I understand these hold less weight in the professional world. 

So is it worth it for my to pay for my own grad school to make me a stronger candidate? Any advice at all is appreciated, and thank you for taking the time to read this book :)"

So this year I have finished my high school and since the beginning of pandemic I have been studying a bit of C, then completed Mooc.fi Java Part I (Wasn't hard and I wasn't looking at the solutions) and a complete Python Bootcamp from zero to hero on Udemy, currently studying extensively everyday day linear algebra (Gilbert Strang) and Discrete math (around 8-9h a day) + started algorithms (Algorithms part I) coursera. (Havent done any programming before tho, just started in March) However, I am not the best at math, I want to be but it's hard to comprehend certain things sometimes. 

In September I am starting with my Bachelors Degree in CompSci in the Netherlands. I am currently extremely motivated to work everyday and I think I will have this motivation troughout my 3 years of uni. (Thanks to my supportive girlfriend:) )So the question is If I study this hard, stick to Python, will I be able to get a job as a graduate or maybe even an Internship after first year of uni? I am also planning to learn Dutch since I am planning to live in the Netherlands. The problem is I can't do masters, being an non EU citizen studying here can be pricey.

What else should I learn besides Python to become a good software developer, maybe you could give a  road map? What kind of project ideas could you give me? I am quite frustrated, I want to get my hands dirty in some project, however I lack creativity. 
What is the best way to learn Data Structures and Algorithms? 
Do you think I will be able to get a job as a Software engineer in the Netherlands with just Bachelors?
What kind of frameworks are essential? Which additional skills are required to get an internship as a freshman? Should I make a LinkedIn account even though I am starting with uni in September?

With such a hard work for the next 3 months what do you think I will be able to accomplish? (Sorry I just love setting goals for myself)

I would be chuffed if just one persons understands my story. But I need to get this off my chest and hope that someone understands.  

I M(29) think that I have ADHD. About two weeks ago, I had a doctors appointment and got a referral to a specialist ADHD center. The problem is that the appointment is only in 5 weeks time. In this 5 week period, I am still studying but completing assignments has been literal hell on earth. All I can think about is the possible/probable diagnoses.  I've filled out about 20 online questionnaires and almost all have resulted in positive/high chance/refer to specialist for ADHD.

Looking back at my academic career, it makes so much of sense. I've always considered myself smart enough but just lazy. When I was younger I could hardly sit still, and always wanted to be playing sports outside. I didn't consider myself lacking focus because, if I found a subject really interesting, I could read for hours on end-Animorphs, Harry Potter, Hardy Boys, etc etc)

In terms of school, thinking back, I have NEVER EVER finished an assignment in time. My modus operandi would be to procrastinate until the absolute last, and under the pressure of failing, complete a less than sufficient piece of work.   This lead to me failing one year in high school, and coming extremely close to failing another year. In the end, I managed to successfully complete my International Baccalaureate(IB) at the age of 20. (Barely passing)

Fast forward 9 years, I am still studying and failing and failing to complete a bachelors in a para-medical field(4 years study). Apart from the usual abnormally high debt that I have acquired, I am very lucky that my parents are helping me out financially as much as they can.  I simply hate studying. I cannot focus on assignments, I cannot motivate myself to study for exams, and even if I schedule out whole weeks of time for study only, I work at a 10 percent efficiency rate. Which is absolutely abysmal. Whereas other students, often who are generally lazy somewhat, manage to work a decent rate, I cannot. I can't really put this in words, as to how much I WANT to succeed. I WANT to study, I WANT to finish up assignments but I just can't. I cannot will myself to do things. Often I come across as lazy, not interested and not mindful. 

However during my internships and placements, I absolutely love it. I am the best 'intern', love the job and have the most passion and motivation and happiness when working hands on with patients. So I know and believe that I can do the job, but studying to achieve the diploma is where the issue lies. 

I'm currently in such a hole in the ground and yet I am trying to climb myself out of it. The more I try to climb out, the deeper the hole seems to get. After a relationship ended almost 3 years ago, I developed an alcohol problem for which I've been to therapy. I guess the rejection was too much to handle. As it stands, I am 1 year and 7 months sober as a nun, which I didn't think was possible. So If I have enough willpower to stop drinking alcohol, why can't I have enough willpower to will myself to study efficiently? oh, and I use to love drinking a beer. Love it. I know that I want a good future, where I work in this field, and by completing these assignments, it will bring me closer to the future that I want, but I really have difficulty in actually bringing myself to study. 

It so happens, that I was 'trying' to study for a Pharmacology exam(for the 3rd time) and came across drugs that improve drive and motivation for people with depression disorders, anxiety disorders etc etc. I've sat down and thought, bloody hell, I could use some of those drugs.(jokingly). Thereafter, I tried to read some Paediatric notes for an exam as well and came across children who struggle to complete a task because of inattention or not being able to focus and being hyperactive when told to sit down and listen to instructions aka ADHD. 

Coincidentally, I went to my parents for the weekend and spoke to my mum about my struggles with school. And she said that as a youngster, I simply didn't have focus. Focus, to clean my room, focus to sit down and eat food properly, focus to complete a task given. She said that when talking to me my attention would be elsewhere. Like my eyes and ears are in the room, but my mind is elsewhere. In our house, that lack of focus was pinned down to lack of self-discipline or lack of listening to my parent and the lack of me wanting to be a 'good' kid. 

Almost as if something clicked, I opened up my web browser and typed in Adult ADHD in YouTube. Its as if someone narrated my life back to me. I googled adult symptoms and could tick of the majority of the symptoms. It's almost as if the last 15 years made sense, or that there was a plausible explanation for my lack of success academically. 

I shared this insight(that I think I have ADHD) with my Gf and she was not surprised. I shared this with my mother and after some research, she too thought that I might have it. I shared this with my mentor(someone with years of para-medical experience) and he too was not surprised at my assertion. 

Since contacting my doctor, I've been a bit obsessed with Reddit's ADHD page. The past two weeks, I've been swinging back and forth between thinking and believing I have ADHD and thinking and believing its all a self made excuse. This back and forth has left me sad and feeling powerless at my lot. My mind is always playing out scenarios of failures from the past 15 years and also forecasting failures that are to come which often leads to me not achieving my bachelor diploma. 

Because the diagnosis is not yet done, I do not know if I have ADHD or not. I do not know if medication will help and I do not know what the near future will hold. I am in this buffer period where all I have are thoughts of failure and disgust at myself for not succeeding. I cannot bring myself to study for school at present and it seems that under this stress, the possible ADHD 'symptoms' are getting worse but I don't know if these are mind-games or reality. 

To conclude, I'm not sure why I am writing this. I feel that I have to get this off my chest. I feel as if only Redditors from this page will actually understand. I feel as if I'm partly writing this as a way of procrastinating from working on an assignment for school. This may sound nuts, but I actually HOPE that I have ADHD, so that I have something to blame/excuse my failings. I hope that if I do have ADHD,  medication will help clear my mind, and that I will be more motivated to complete school and finally get working in a field that I am passionate about. I hope that medication might help me to make better decisions in terms of avoiding procrastination. I hope with medication, I have a better chance to work hard to become successful. Its no magic pill, I am well aware, but if it clears my mind to increase the chance of improved concentration, drive and motivation, then I can be hopeful for a more positive future. 

Thank you to everyone who made it to the end of this story. I'm not sure that I feel better but my chest does feel lighter. If people are in the same boat, or recognize my story, please drop off a comment as to how you dealt with the situation. I am always keen on tips. 

Keep fighting the good fight.

gybfce,3,2020-06-07,Is it better pursuing a career in Engineering or Front-End/Coding?,Temporary_Title_3415,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/gybfce/is_it_better_pursuing_a_career_in_engineering_or/,"Greetings, /r/careerguidance,

I am in a dilemma regarding the choice of careers in the title. Thank you in advance for any help and advice!

I am 28 year old with a master's degree in automation engineering (with electronics/electrical engineering and a bit of computer science).   
After graduating, finding a job in the field was a real struggle, and first few were just wiring electrical cabinets for automation. My first real job was a position of an assistant engineer for a small 4 person company, doing PLC programming, making SCADA systems for simple/small plants and wiring cabinets. I lost that job after a year because they no longer needed an extra person due to lack of larger projects.

In the meantime, I have completed a few live/online classes for front-end (HTML, CSS, JS, React), since coding jobs are more or less abundant and a bit better paid. Coding is also interesting to me.   
However, even in that field, it is difficult to land even an internship, let alone a junior position; work experience and a diploma are a mostly requirement.  
Through acquaintances from coding school, I met a freelancer for whom I've done a couple of simple websites (1-2 pages), while he does the designs. But for a really low pay, barely making ends meet with promise of founding a small company in the months to come. This may prove to be a severe waste of time...

Is it worth pursuing either of the careers? What would be at least a sound step to take?

Dropping engineering for web dev/front-end mght result in a serious failure because i lose a diploma that may open doors abroad and all the time and effort will prove to be wasted. On the other hand, the jobs seem scarce.

It feels like being at a dead end.

I really have enjoyed the aspect of internships in which you have to get up to speed on concepts you aren’t familiar with and challenge yourself to make a difference on your team. I want this to continue indefinitely for my career - I enjoy the idea of working several months to up to three years for a company. It’s tough and yet I feel like I learn heavily from it (such as not knowing what Jira was to having used it for months heavily).

Is it possible to make this happen in my career path? I’m currently doing a computer science/IT degree (not normal CS, less theory and more just learning about different technologies ranging from development to networking). My main interests have been in cybersecurity (2 of my internships have been in this space), data science (R, Hadoop) and development (Java, C++, although I can never pass a coding challenge)."

I’ve been kind of thinking about what path to take from this point in my life. I’m about to turn 27, kind of always had high drive but been spending it on hobbies, blinded by the idea of 'follow your heart'. I basically already did all the 'fun stuff' I wanted to do. Last year I figured I'd rather not go for passion = job, but keep hobbies separate and go to the big jobs. This is kind of as I found out that I am actually quite into the high-level corporate stuff, as long as it involves working in cutting edge areas.

It took me a long time to overcome that stigma as my growing up was quite liberal.  Partially that stigma was also, because all the 'normal' jobs I had so far didn't involve any kind of challenge, and basically just sitting out time. Didn't realize how much exciting stuff is out there.

I'd like to move into a career where I can make big cash fast, get lots of responsibility, and generally a job where I don’t have to go to office 40h but only actually work 20h because the job is so boring. I want a challenge.

I am basically thinking between going for something in the area of marketing in tech firms (as I like stuff that operates at the edge of innovation), or investment banking, fund managing,... (as that's where the influence and money is, ideally I'd like to do research for funds.)

I am aware breaking in is not easy. I have a BA in psychology, I already started to work a bit in marketing and copywriting in the past months. Freelance so far, so it's going quite slow. Now thinking of getting a full timejob, or maybe checking out finance...

I ham highly motivated to learn and work. The goal is to work hard for 3-5 years, and make enough cash till 32 to live life by my own terms, and choose projects of high interest, or turn a passion into a business.

Any tips on whats the best route to take? Just applying to loads of jobs? Been thinking about internship, or business school,  but kind of don't want to waste more time not making money, if it's not necessary."

gyl71r,160,2020-06-07,"Cautionary Tale: T-15, Mediocre Background, No Job, No Girlfriend, Mounds of debt",cautionaryMBAtale,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/gyl71r/cautionary_tale_t15_mediocre_background_no_job_no/,"Guys,

I just need to get this off my chest because I don't really have many options to turn to. I'll be upfront: this is my fault. But I really don't want any of you guys/girls to make the same mistakes I did.

I went to b-school at a top 15 school, coming from an operations background. It was a niche industry and I wanted to learn more about what the world had to offer. Before business school I went with a beautiful girlfriend who is super smart, but we knew we were going to do a little bit of long distance. I got sold from admissions that my life was going to change dramatically after school, that we are all the next thing since slice bread, we're all very ambitious and going to make a lot of money, and we could do whatever we wanted.

Well here's the first thing I did wrong: I did not do on campus recruiting. After learning what investment banking actually was in November, I was told over and over again from career services that I could not do an IB internship because it was too late.....then I find out later from people in the industry that I still could have gotten in if I started at that time. **DO NOT TRUST CAREER SERVICES!!!** There have been so many instances on here and from friends where they are completely wrong!!

I was told I could do whatever I wanted and get a job. I decided to go toward an industry which was completely off campus recruiting and my background was not 100% relevant. This dragged out my recruiting process until the end. The highest paying and prestigious firms do not hire MBAs. I didn't realize how weak my background was so at the last second of my first year, I took an M&amp;A related role, at a mediocre firm in tech, with the full intention to recruit for next year. **If you don't go into consulting or investment banking, your background matters!!!!!!** I wish I knew that earlier because I would have just done IB/consulting from the beginning.

The 2nd year I got a return offer, which I was planning to use to re-recruit for IB. I wanted to accept it just to have in my back pocket but our career management says that if you accept a offer and renege, you have to pay a fee....what?!?! okay. Spend all fall doing IB recruiting and ultimately fail because **newsflash: no bank will take the risk on you if you didn't do IB in the summer.** Now I'm stuck with no job and lots of classmates have something lined up. Full time recruiting completely dries up by November and career management tells us that it picks back up in the spring....welp. Now this is not their fault but covid-19 happens and recruiting goes in the shitter. They tell us ""aw shit, man. All we can say is bad timing."" WTF! Now us MBAs are out here competing with everybody else for jobs, we have to completely network via phone calls virtually for jobs. Now graduation is over and they're no longer helpful at all. The only jobs available are ones with no career growth and ones that pay like very poorly for somebody with an advanced degree.

Now with all of this as well, I spent so so so so so so so so much time during my two years making phone calls, trying to secure a good job, going to conferences, networking, interviewing....that I completely neglected my girlfriend. I figured once this all over, we could finally have the life we wanted. Now she's gone. This also completely cut into my social time. While everybody else was out partying and not worrying about shit for 1.5 years, I'm going to conferences and making calls on the weekend and prepping for interviews. These last 2 years have ruined my fucking life.

Now I don't know what to do. I can't find a job. Loans are going to be coming up soon. I don't have any friends anymore. Didn't make any close ones at school. Lost my partner. No support cast. I'm just in a tough spot, in a tough time. And now my career is going to start on the wrong path from the start.

TLDR: It's my fault for not doing more research on my on campus recruiting and the odds of success with my background......Do on campus recruiting. Pick a firm you'd be happy going to full time. Do something where you can finish the recruiting up EARLY. LOCK IT UP!! Pay attention to your significant others. FUCK YOU CAREER SERVICES AND COVID. You could wind up with no job, no career, and no girlfriend...living in your parents basement"

If I shouldn't be getting a cert, what should I be doing? On top of school, I will be instructing 2-3 lab sections of an undergraduate course and researching (obviously). I get paid to go to school and teach so I don't really need an additional job. 

I will more than likely be getting another internship next summer and want to make sure I am a competitive graduate student and can get good internships. I know there are students in our undergraduate program that have not only their sec+ but also their net+.

My school career has been a bit complicated because i attended the same community college previously to earn an associate's in music, wherein i earned a lot of gen ed credits that i would also need for the CS degree. I know it might not be super helpful to just list my classes as you won't fully know the curriculum, but that classes i've taken in relation to computer science are programming 1, linux fundamentals, programming 2, calculus 1, and calculus 2. I'm currently taking a summer course for assembly language and computer organization, and next semester i'll be in data structures and programming 3. Essentially, I will have completed my sophomore year after this upcoming semester.

When is the best time to apply? I've mostly been applying to places through Indeed, and they have mostly been places i feel somewhat under-qualified for. I have very little on my resume as far as impressive projects go, except for a link to my github where i show code tidbits that i have written independently or through school. I just feel sort of in the dark as far as what I should be doing for jobs or resume-building, but all i know is that i want to work and build my skills in both front end and back end development.

any tips for finding a first-ever internship in software development?

I'm 3rd year [B.Tech](https://B.Tech) Student. I had counselling sessions with University of Bristol, University of Sheffield, University of Leeds, University of Warwick, University of Birmingham, University of Liverpool, Trinity College Dublin, University College Cork and University College Dublin. I'm aiming for Sep. 2021 intake for Master's in Advanced Mechanical. 

Majorly, all of this university in UK are offering 1 yr program max. with tuition fee of 23K roughly with no application fee. I felt that they were literally selling the seats of there university. I only found University of Sheffield and University College Dublin program where they have 1 yr course +1 yr professional internship program. 

My question is are this university good for job prospects, I know it depends on candidate but does this universities provide the platform for getting jobs? Also, what's your take on studying master's in UK and Ireland as both countries now have 24 month post study work visa for students. Is considering this universities for master's really worth the amount we pay. 

Your opinions are appreciated.

Thank you!"
gz2cda,1,2020-06-08,"Raise delayed indefinitely due to covid, ask the CEO or find something better?",cscovidthrowaway2020,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/gz2cda/raise_delayed_indefinitely_due_to_covid_ask_the/,"Sorry for the wall of text, but I wanted to give some background leading up to today.

In short, my company has decided to hold off on “merit increases” for an indefinite amount of time (it’s been 3 months now), and I’m considering asking for a raise directly.

Background: I’m 26, got accepted for a job at a power systems company outside Boston that subcontracts for the US military. Graduated with a BS in computer engineering and BA in French (unused in the position). Small company, about 50 people when I started in 2017. This year, we’re on track to do about $24M (up from $19M) and have expanded to about 70 employees.

The core market is power supplies: heavily electrical engineering based. The reason for my hire was to leverage software as a value prop in core, adjacent, and new markets. After all, it's cheaper to update software than hardware. The engineering team is 8 people (up from 7, just hired a new electrical engineer).

**2017**

My first year, I was making $65k. I developed a system that sped up the process of flashing the system’s firmware from 25 minutes manually to 3 minutes automatically – saving the company about $100k annually. I developed two software applications, but the projects went unused. Did some work on firmware for the core products. One app was a desktop application (WPF/C#) to communicate with our core products. The firmware was mainly C, working on an embedded Linux module.

**2018**

First raise, up to $75k (2018). At this time, I began working as a project leader and mentor for students at a local university where we sponsor an engineering project and they work on it for the year. First year, the students make a PoC smart device and, based on my recommendation, we hire the top student.

That year I deployed Jira/BitBucket/Bamboo instances and set up a workflow for project tracking, version control, and CI/CD for existing projects and my new ones. Tasked with new product development, I worked on the smart device the students started and 3 other projects. One was a WPF/C# Desktop app to communicate with smart batteries over SMBus. The other was a port for a demo to do the same using Node/React. Third was taking over (temporarily) the role of test engineer and managing our 9 test fixtures running LabVIEW.

Since then, I’ve been responsible for the development of the smart device. The new hire did the circuit boards, but the rest of the development is almost entirely my own. C for communicating with power metering ICs and controlling GPIOs. Python for SNMP communication to core products. PERN for the web stack (there’s a SBC inside the device). FeathersJS for an API designed from scratch. C/Python for an OLED display driver and rotary encoder knob. Typical IoT stuff with SPI/I2C, etc. Its software is above and beyond the competitive offering. I designed it to ultimately move off the device and be more of a platform for monitoring and management of all our devices.

**2019**

Get barely more than CoL – now at $80k. This year, I mentor 8 students across 2 teams at the local university. First project is test automation of subassemblies of the core product to eliminate our ever-growing debug pile. Cost savings over 4 years: \~$1M. The other project was one I proposed internally in 2018 – leveraging ML (recurrent neural networks) to do some power analysis that could potentially hit HUGE in our core, adjacent, and new markets. CEO/president loves this idea, and we meet every two weeks to discuss its potential and a roadmap for integration into the smart device I’m developing.

This year I also start attending conferences and working with the Sales VP in addition to my normal duties. Meeting with clients directly. Brought in a couple leads myself, not too much business ($100k over 3 years it looks like). Start demoing the new device to customers, getting feedback.

Company needs someone to do some videos for social media and marketing to talk about core products. I have experience on camera, so I offer. Generate scripts and am filmed in 3 different videos now shown on our website and social.

Smart device: I’m the de-facto project lead. Hold weekly scrums and designate responsibility amongst myself, the new hire, and some interns. Meet with my boss for status updates and am the point of contact regarding its progress.

**2020**

Both student projects finish and are successes. ML project results could be published and would beat out a separate team working at MIT doing something similar with the Coast Guard. Proud of the students, and happy to teach them how to get it done. (I took the free Stanford course and taught myself in preparation).

Out of nowhere, am given a product who’s rights we purchased from another company. Has a desktop app (WPF/C#), as well as a cross platform mobile app (Flutter by Google, programming language is Dart). Teach myself Dart, Flutter (in general), and get the apps updated and resubmitted to the app store. Now I’m the sole maintainer of the project and keep it up to date.

Back to the smart device. Upgrade the SBC so that it can support machine learning and hire another developer. He’s just working on a system to calibrate the IC’s. That’s really it. At this point, I have about 95% code coverage on the system and the other two are working on new projects. I bring them in on occasion to discuss my changes and how it’ll affect the PCBs or the calibration system.

**March 2020**

Submit my self-evaluation. Talks about my authorship and responsibility in the project. Good stuff – using sales estimates and other internal stats to bring everything to black-and white dollar amounts.

...

COVID hits

...

**April**

No raises. President/CEO says they’re delayed indefinitely as things are in a fluid state. Turns out our revenue forecast is right on track as of last week. It’s all spec’d in, and our production rate has actually increased.

**May/June**

Need to start designing custom images for the SBC. Learn the Yocto Project and Bitbake to write these images. By far the one of the biggest undertakings I’ve taken as I’ve been self-taught in my work responsibilities since starting. My co-workers generally just do firmware – system controllers and lower-level code.  This month, I’ll also get secure-boot integrated as well as [Mender.io](https://Mender.io) for OTA updates. Also got the whole process integrated into BitBucket/Bamboo. The production launch of the product is scheduled for Q3.

&amp;#x200B;

**To wrap things up**

Started at $65k in 2017 and worked on small firmware updates and a desktop windows application. Last raise was $5k to go from $75k to $80k. Now I’m project lead and virtually the sole developer on our newest product. Also the sole maintainer of companion windows/iOS/Android apps for a new product. Also sysadmin for the VM that runs Jira/BitBucket/Bamboo. Still maintaining the first system I made to automate and save over $100k/yr. Responsible for a new hire that’s responsible for all our layout and PCB design. Also have a small role in sales and responsible for demoing our new product to clients and potential customers. Have been the mentor/teacher for student teams for 3 years in a row – bringing us 1 new hire, a system to save $1M over 4 years, and a proof of concept ML system that could completely change our industry.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m thinking about talking to my President/CEO as we have a good relationship. Our bi-monthly meetings up until covid were always extremely positive. He taught me a lot of his responsibilities as an executive and respected my opinion and insight from my perspective. Our first year he said to me, “If at any time you don’t feel challenged or that you’re not being valued enough at this company, tell me because that means I’ve failed at my job as CEO.”.

My plan was to ask to speak about my position, and then ask him personally about the raises since he’s only ever addressed them to the company over large video conferences. Ask him if there’s a plan for them and ensure that he knows that I love my work (it’s tough and self-guided, but I’ve gotten an unbelievable amount of hands-on experience). If he has an explanation and it makes sense, accept it. If he doesn’t, I’ll be understanding and polite and continue working but begin looking for other jobs.

I did some research, and my salary now is about the starting salary for a developer in my area (I know that doesn’t matter – work does). And with respect to work, I’d be hard pressed to find a single engineer able to match my responsibilities for the same pay rate. I see the raise as a cost saving to the company. It would cost more to onboard 1+ new engineers, and the projects would be at a standstill until they were up-to-speed with my work.

**tldr;** raise delayed indefinitely due to covid. responsibilities and importance to the company has skyrocketed and my salary growth has slowed down to cost of living. Good relationship with the CEO, thinking of asking him directly about the situation and using that as a gauge whether or not I start looking elsewhere.

But left the field, realised it wasn't for me.
Currently: Have been jobless for more than 2 years and trying to study data science and have been applying for data science positions (junior as well as internships). No luck so far. Still applying!! 
One of my friends suggested Cloud Computing and he is working as cloud support engineer. He said his company has position for trainee cloud support engineer with a good pay. For person like me who has been jobless for long time that is really good amount to get as a trainee. 
Googled bit about cloud computing and it seems to be an interesting field.
Now I am confused what field should I select either stick with data science or move to cloud computing?
As far as I have googled both fields have promising future but for now i can't get job in data science while on the other hand just as starting am getting good pay in field of cloud computing though that is not exactly a cloud work mostly of customer support still getting an opportunity and chance to grow in the field after working for some time and doing starter level cloud certification of services like Amazing or Azure.
Can you guys help me in deciding what should I go for? Am really confused now.
Any help is appreciated and Thanks in advance for helping me.

I donate and support the cause, and am politically active to stop this injustice. I'd like your advice so I can do more to help.

I have three interviews and one offer.

1. CGI- They sent me the offer letter today for 65,000 and no bonus. Fully remote work, but I really couldn't care less about the work I do.  

   1. Offer Letter Received. I have not signed yet.
2. Quantitative analyst in PE real estate- Fully remote, and this is what I have the most skill with. See resume below. Pay would be 70,000 + competitive bonus structure. It also complements my current side hustle well.  

   1. Only 1 interview with the recruiter.
3. Pricing Analyst for Vida Capital- Similar to the 2nd position, except I would be buying life insurance instead of real estate. I'm not sure what the pay would be, but it has similar requirements to the 2nd position, so it might pay the same.

My current job is 55,000 with no bonus, but with good benefits, ESPP, good 401k match.

Do ya'll have any advice? Should I wait on the other two? I have to make my decision on whether to stay or go in 2 weeks.

I am leaning towards the CySA+ because it covers 4 more areas of the Approved Baseline Certifications. Here's a little bit about my background. I graduated last year with my B.S. in IT Cybersecurity and a couple weeks ago with my M.S. in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance. My masters program closely aligned with the CISSP material which I am not eligible for because of my lack of experience. One of my masters courses required me to get the CEH certification.  As far a professional experience i have very little. I have a year of help desk experience and a 4 month internship with my undergrad university where I spent two weeks at each IT team which included IT Security.

gz5ck6,1,2020-06-08,Let old HDD stay dynamic disk or make it basic?,xblaster2000,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/gz5ck6/let_old_hdd_stay_dynamic_disk_or_make_it_basic/,"Right now I have an old intern HDD that once was the main drive (incl Windows ofc.) of another pc as an extra HDD in my pc. At the time the HDD was set as dynamic disk instead of basic, idk why. Besides, the 1 TB HDD is partitioned in multiple pieces; there is one part that is 870 GB, one part that is 60 GB and 6 other very small partitions (sum of those would be approx. 2 GB). With my simple, limited thinking, I think that it would be best to undo these partitions and to go back to just one part of 900-something GB. With the Hard disk management of Windows, I fail in due to an error that the 60 GB part wouldnt have sufficient space to merge with the 870 GB partition (even if I want to use less space than 60 GB, idk why). I can't do this either with minitool partition wizard; it just gives an 'invalid configuration file' error.

I didn't do anything of the partitioning whatsoever and I didn't choose for a dynamic disk in the past. At first it doesn't seem like a big problem, but I'm a bit worried that it might go fucked in the future. I will use the HDD as a place to store files and to boot games from. Do you guys know how to undo the partitioning and have it set back to a basic drive? Or should I just use the 60 GB part as well as another 'drive' and just have it for what it is and accept the 2 GB loss of the mini partitions?"

So they clearly want me onboard.

But I'm not sure how to broach the subject with my manager now.

How do I ask without sounding too full of myself while at the same conveying that I deserve it ?

Could you help me with that please ?"

I would love to do this just for the sake of enjoyment but I'm committed to spending time just on activities that will directly contribute to finding a job (e.g. programming, learning, aggressively applying and casting a wide net). I'm wondering if adding article writing to the mix would be worth it if it takes away from the other activities. Will these articles improve my standing with hiring managers?

With all that's happening in the world right now, there's been an influx of posts for resume help/critique. I remember when I was searching for my first internship back in second year university and how stressful is was when developing a resume so I want to help out. I've attached  a template of the resume that I used to use when finding my first internship. This is tailored more towards students/recent graduates. Feel free to copy it or take out any useful points that you may find.

On a note: I understand how stressful times like these are for those of you trying to find employment, I sympathize for all of you and wish you the best of luck. And to those students/recent graduates trying to find their first professional employment, just know that the work you do right now will pay off in the end. For my first internship I sent out at least 100 applications before I got my first interview, and 150+ before I got my first internship. Just keep trying everyday and don't give up. Good luck to all!

I would graduate a year early if it were not for the fact that I have one class that can only be taken in the upcoming spring.

I would like an internship or part time job, however, I have been unsuccessful everywhere I look in my 6 month job search.

I have come to accept that I am simply  less useful than most job seekers, so I am very likely not going to get an amazing job. I realized my expectations were too high.

Most of my competitors are making plenty of personal projects, I can't. I don't take that initiative, I get perfect grades but I'm not a very creative person, I can't look at a computer problem and just automatically say ""I need to spend 50 hours fixing this!"" Some people can, I can't, because I don't want to. That's exhausting for me.

CS is not my passion, it's not something I hate mind you, I enjoy it more than any other field, but I don't get excited over it enough to spend my free time on it.

So, with this in mind: are there any places I could be looking? What industries might need someone like me? I was considering tech support, as they seem to have low enough standards. I mainly just don't want to be a cashier again. I want a job that makes *some* use of the 4 years of work that put into this degree.

Also, I need to clarify. I don't not mind doing hard work or learn new things, I just am not the kind of guy who's smart or creative enough to whip out personal projects. I was under the false impression that if I studied hard, focused on school, and got good grades, I could get a decent job as if it was a right rather than a privilege. I know I was wrong. It was childish of me to assume so."

I had difficulty forming sentences so I even tried to read from my phone for some of the questions and couldn't read out of anxiety. I expected it to go bad since it was my first but that was just brutal. I'm definitely not sleeping tonight. So if you could spare the time, I'd like to ask some questions to avoid future shame.

When there's small time to think before the recording for a question, is it bad to spend most of the recording quiet/thinking?

How often do I have to look at the camera? Is it bad to look at other places, especially when thinking? 

When I don't know/remember the answer to a question, what should I do? Is it okay to stop to think and not come up with an answer? 

When I get anxious enough to have difficulty talking, does it affect their opinion even if in the end I give a correct answer? 

When asked if I have any experience in a certain area, can I talk about a similar area if I'm not experienced in that one? 

Any tip is appreciated, please be gentle, I'm on the verge of an existential crisis, thank you."

Me (23/F) and my sister (27/F) don't always get along well. We had our sister fights and a lot of struggles when growing up. Once she moved out of the house we got along really well. So we know we can get along when we don't see each other too much.

Now, I still live at home and doing an (unpaid) internship. This is the last step of my study and after this, I can look for jobs and places to live alone. I do my internship from home because of the whole COVID situation. My sister has her own beauty salon. She is now renovating her house, so she moved her business to our parents' house where I live as well.

There are often two people working with two clients, so it brings a lot of noise. I know it's her only option and she can't do anything about it, so I understand this is a tough situation. I'm sensitive to a lot of stimuli and I'm usually alone at home so this is a lot.

But the annoying part is, that when she doesn't have a client, she comes to me to talk to me. First, it was okay and didn't bother me so much. We are a couple of weeks later and it's exhausting. But what annoys me the most is that she can't take any of criticism, she is the most stubborn person I know. When I calmly tell her I'm working so I can't talk, she doesn't care and keeps talking. So I just stop responding and do my work. Then she gets mad at me for not responding. When I tell her again I have to work, she storms of in a rage and yells at me 'OKAY I'LL LEAVE YOU ALONE THEN'.

I don't want her to be mad at me all the time, but I also don't want her to keep talking to me. I have tried to explain it multiple times, but she just doesn't get it. She always does her own thing in her own way and doesn't care about what others want.

Any advice on this situation? (moving out is not an option)"

We decided its best for me to leave school ate the end of the year, do some internships for a year to figure out what I want to do as a career, and then go back to school to pursue that. Turns out, I enjoy working in a kindergarten. So I'm starting school in August to become a kindergarten teacher. But I dont think its the right choice. I enjoy it, but I don't think its the right thing for me. I'm way too insecure, shy, quiet and introverted for it. 

But I can't really change anything about that now. 
Anyway, even though I was better now that I wasn't in school anymore, I was still thinking about suicide. And back in February or March this year, I finally told my therapist. I told her I've been thinking about this for years, that I have self harmed at one point (only one and really minor, but still), and that i have even thought about what method to use. 
But she didn't take me seriously. At the time when I told her, I was really stressed. New internships, many appointments and stuff. She said that, to an extent, its normal to have those thoughts when you're stressed.
She also put a picture in my head i can't forget. A horrible picture.

Ever since then I've been lying to her about everything. The trust is gone. If my therapist doesn't take me seriously, then who will?
I thought about seeing another therapist, but I'd need the help if my parents. And then I'd have to tell them why I want to see someone else. And I can't do that. I can't tell them. I dont know how.

I'm rewatching 13 reasons why and realized how truly alone I am. I dont really have friends, only like 3 people im friendly with, one of which I have never even met. But i don't really talk to them much.
I want a friend like Tony, from 13rw. But everyone here where I live are assholes. I've never had a best friend either. Or been in a relationship. People don't like me, im weird, ugly, worthless, stupid and can't do anything right.
I tried talking to people, become friends with them  but i either dont even get a text back or i fuck it up again.

Anyway. What im saying is, I feel hopeless. Nothing is ever going to change. I just want to be normal and liked by people. But I dont know how. 
I've been pretending like everything is fine, that I'm better again. But in reality I've never been this bad.
I've tried to reach out to people to get help, but no one is listening. 

I dont know what to do anymore."

I am currently unemployed and trying to decide if grad school (for CS) is the right move for me. For me, going for a master's later does not seem like a good option. I think it is something that I should do now or not do at all. 

One reason that I am considering going to grad school is because I know that certain upper level positions in the field require a master's degree, and I want to at least be eligible for these positions in the future. Additionally, I would like to have a great school on my resume. My undergraduate degree is from a decent school, but I'd really like to have a top tier school on my resume. For me, I am hoping for the master's degree to pay off financially in the long term.

I understand the costs that come with grad school, both financially and time-wise. I see both options (going to grad school and pursuing an entry level SWE role) as an opportunity to develop my technical skills and network with peers, but I am honestly not sure which one is more likely to benefit me in the long term. 

I'm seeking some advice on other ways I can weigh these options and form a decision. For those of you who have been faced with this choice in the past, how did you make your decision? Does anyone regret pursuing/not pursuing a master's degree in CS? Thanks for any input you guys might have!"

For starters, I realize this is a very dumb situation to get myself in.

I began working for a local startup as an intern in college for $10 per hour. About halfway into my internship, the company began having financial troubles and began missing paychecks. The company promised that a large sum of money would be coming in soon and we would get all of our back pay.

About a year later now, the company is still having financial troubles and has paid us sporadically. I was brought on as a full-time employee in December 2019 with a handshake that I would earn $12.50 per hour and a 10% commission on revenue of all sales. My boss said in the next few weeks, we will have a written contract for you to sign. It is not months later and neither I nor my other coworkers brought on full time at the same time as me have received contracts. I do not want to say the exact amount, but I am owed roughly $5,000 in backpay.

Luckily, I have just received a formal offer from another company and I will be taking it. My goal is to get as much money as possible from my current employer and get out on the best terms possible.

My question is, am I entitled to the compensation I was promised even though I did not have an employment contract? I have documentation of the hours I worked and commissions I earned saved on my computer. I also have emails from my employer requesting my hours and commission.

Thank you all so much!"

gzu959,2,2020-06-09,Which language to prioritize to sharpen my knowledge and skills?,Bucky_Anderson,AskProgramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/gzu959/which_language_to_prioritize_to_sharpen_my/,"TL;DR: I want to sharpen my knowledge and skills in Data Structures and Algorithms via utilizing online sources to practice such as CodeForces, LeetCode, HackerRank etc. I know C and Java, I will definitely need to learn C++ and Python for the courses I will take in the next semester. Which language do you suggest me to prioritize, C++, Python or Java?

Question in TL;DR, below is my background to inform you such that I can get a healthy feedback.

I am a university student who is majoring in Electrical and Electronics Engineering and I am having my double major in Computer Science. I am about to complete my third year. Throughout my education in the university I have taken (excluding the courses that are unrelated to my question)

* Introduction to Programming (Taught by using C progamming language)
* Object-Oriented Programming (Taught by using Java)
* Software Engineering
* Data Structures
* Algorithm Analysis

courses. 

In addition to that, in Software Engineering course I have completed a term project using Java with a team of 4 members (including me). One group member was doing the GUI part and another one was handling the database, I and the other member wrote a web crawler and completed the backend in general. In one of my interships I had completed an embedded systems project using C programming language, where data acquired by one microcontroller (master) and sent to another one  (slave) and processed by it. In my other internship, I was given the task to acquire data coming from an embedded system (handled by another team, I was Android device part) via Bluetooth to an Android device and process it. Thus, in that one I have used Java and AndroidStudio.

So, I have some experience with C and Java. Also, I am planning to take a course where students are expected to complete a project using C++ and Machine Learning course where the homeworks are completed using Python (I have some experience with that, not much though). Lastly, I have solved some question from ProjectEuler and I quite enjoy it, however, I don't think that I am competent enough and I want to work on my problem solving skills, Data Structures and Algorithms knowledge.

It is my first post in Reddit and I am sorry if it is not well structured. Thank you for your answers."

Sure it’s got its problems, but my job puts me in a position that I can be active in making it better, and I find working towards that ideal to be a worthy endeavor. Before this whole pandemic, during 2019, I was planning to make this place my permanent residence. I had been saving up and planning for my dream home on the ideal plot of land close by my family in the beautiful countryside that’s a 15-minute pleasant drive from my work. 

Even though I can find worth in my job, I kind of fell into it. Originally, I went to college for linguistics and was a credit shy of minoring in German. The plan when I graduated was to work until I had enough money to pursue education overseas and either get into teaching English as a second language or go into translation. Out of college, I got an unpaid internship that turned into a paid position that got me head-hunted by a business that has done a lot to raise up the community and that I'm proud to work for. It’s not what I pictured myself doing, however, and at times I hate it. But I get to write sometimes and that has always been important for me. 

2020 has brought with it wild changes, and I’m sure everyone has been reevaluating their priorities. Personally, I find myself brushing up on my German, looking into translation degrees and universities in cities I might like, and just planning out what I still need to do to be in Germany by 2021. Recently, my father who used to build houses for a living started looking into doing so again. He asked me if I still was serious about my house. If so, he could start working on foundations. Now, I’m at a loss. I can very clearly picture myself pursuing both paths.

TLDR; In 2019 I was saving up my money for my dream home in my hometown, but 2020 has made me wonder if I should use my savings for a work visa, plane ticket, and tuition for a German university to pursue my original plans.

Any advice you could give would be appreciated. I'm not sure if this changes things, but I'll be turning 26 this year. 

Note: I originally posted this over in r/needadvice but I think it was taken down because I didn't have enough content karma :'( there have been a few changes and clarifications. I also thank the two people who were able to comment before it was locked. I would love to get a few more opinions, however. One suggested that the best advice they'd ever gotten was to get out of their hometown, even if it's only a year. The other that no one can make this decision for me which I realize."

Whatever, i prefer work in a Tech Startup in some long term project. taking into account that im making this low salary as freelancer (probably because this is not for me sorry, if you are doing 5k+ you deserve it, surely you have a better process than me for this), i decided to go out and see if I can get a job for some months with payments as low as 500 - 600, more than what im doing right now, and without all that suffering.

How i can get a job like this? it is something possible? give me your advice, i already tried to apply to internships but they never reach back to me . . . my profile is not bad, a Backend Engineer with lot of talent, Frontend Development skills, Data Science/Deep Learning knowledge, a good cv/portafolio with personal projects and latest tech skills, but no luck.

PD: If you have a big idea but low budget, surely i can be a good option for you.

PD: If you ask why im selling this low, if you dont noticed it, im depressed/tired and truly dont want to rant anymore(i already do it a lot, i dont have more energy for that) about why all this is like it is, i just want to break in to the market, thanks"

(Part 2)",scribe0619,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/h02a61/my_family_hunts_monster_for_living_and_i_am_the/,"As I promised the \[last time\]([https://www.reddit.com/user/scribe0619/comments/h06k0d/my\_family\_hunts\_monsters\_for\_living\_and\_i\_am\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/user/scribe0619/comments/h06k0d/my_family_hunts_monsters_for_living_and_i_am_the/) ) I wrote to you, I will talk about the time that my cousin, Kim Hyuk (김혁), hunted a nine-tailed fox in Korea.

Hyuk is an outlier, he is from a branch of the family that gave up on hunting for living and assimilated into the general society. He has an engineering degree from the Seoul National University, which is the Korean equivalent of Harvard for all you Americans, and used to pull seven figures in a successful tech startup before he joined the family business. The nine-tail was the first night-thing he hunted, and he has been specializing in hunting the vixens ever since then.

It’s very rare for hunters to specialize in a specific night-thing, as versatility and adaptability are the most important qualities in ensuring the survival of a hunter. Becoming too focused on one quarry will inevitably distract you from other night-things that are just as dangerous and hungry as your target of choice, and that is never a good thing for a hunter. It’s usually those who join the family business with a personal vendetta that end up going down that road, which is precisely the reason they seldom last long.

Hyuk most certainly came to us with a desire for revenge, which was understandable considering the blood chilling accounts of his first hunt that I read from his journal. Unlike others of the type, however, Hyuk is still alive today after seven years of a dangerous and fruitful career. In fact,  he is running the family workshop in Seoul, Korea these days. Anyhow, here’s the bit about Hyuk and the nine-tailed fox.

Grandpa always used to tell me that a nine-tail is one of the dangerous night-things out there.

“The bastards think. Hunting a night-thing that can plan and think better than you is always a chore, and those vixens are really good at that.”

He would always rub the small white scar around his right temple as he said that. I never asked him where he got the scar from, but I still have my guesses.

Out of all shapeshifters, the nine-tailed fox is the most troublesome to deal with. These night-things are nothing like werewolves, and tracking one down is never as easy as just listening in on the local police radio channel on a full moon. Instead of brute strength, the nine-tail relies on cunning and guile, always staying one step ahead of both its prey and hunter. As such, a nine-tail hunt is often an arduous process involving careful planning and long hours spent in stuffy camo suits while pissing into plastic bottles.

There are many conflicting theories about how the nine-tail first came to be. Japanese hunters swear that the evil concubine of Emperor Zhu (1075-1046 B.C) from Shang dynasty (1600-1046 B.C) was the original nine-tail, and some Chinese hunters actually support the theory. Some hunters argue that nine-tails are the reincarnations of wronged widows and virgins who died without having their love requited. Their arguments, however, fail to take account of the fact that the nine-tail is indigenous to East Asia. I am willing to bet my right hand and half my allowances on that there are plenty of wronged widows and sad virgins outside of East Asia.

Regardless of its true origin, the nine-tail is pretty much ubiquitous in East Asia, appearing in Chinese, Korean, and Japanese folklore. They are sometimes portrayed as fertility goddesses that bless the neighborhood with bumper crops, but in most accounts are shapeshifters that feast on human intestines with a special preference for livers pulled freshly out of their still-breathing victims. They are notorious for transforming into attractive young women who use their sexual charms to seduce and kill, and sometimes even go so far as to marry into a human family to bide for the right time to wipe out the entire household in one grisly harvest of blood and organs.

Hyuk was twenty-four when his parents adopted an adorable little girl, and named her Dal-Ki (달기). You see, they always wanted a daughter but ended up with three sons, and adopted Dal-ki when the doctor told Mrs. Kim that she can no longer have children due to health complications. Dal-ki instantly became the apple of the eye to all family members. She was a pretty little thing with wits as sharp as a knife and a smile that made the entire room light up, everyone who saw her instantly fell in love with her.

In retrospect, this should have been a dead give away. You see, us hunters reek of curses. They flow in our blood, seeping out of our pores and orifices. Some of the curses are remnants of ancient ones placed on our bloodlines, some others we actually cast on ourselves to ward against things even more horrible than the mutilation of our very souls. As a result, people outside of our bloodlines are generally wary of being in the same room with us. There is a sense of wrongness that follows us around, being around us makes people feel fear and discomfort, and that is the reason that we seldom adopt from outside of hunter bloodlines.

Hyuk’s family has been out of the family business for four generations at that point, and did not think it strange that a child of non-hunter descent was actually having a good time in their household. They had also forgotten that night-things love hunting the hunters back. They are our predators, and are quite upset about what they perceive as our disruption of the natural order. To their eyes, we are livestock. They remember what it was like to slowly walk into the glades as the embers died down, the hairless apes crying out in terror as the shadows grew longer and the air grew colder, the fire-hardened sticks in their hands shaking as they made their desperate, futile stand against the horrors of the night. So night-things make it a point to kill any defenseless or ill-prepared hunter that they come across. Dal-ki had infiltrated Hyuk’s family with a clear goal in mind, and she made her intentions audaciously clear when the right moment arrived.

Dal-ki’s harvest happened on her eighth birthday. The only reason Hyuk survived the night was because he was deliberately late to the party. He had fallen out of touch with his parents a few years before the incident after a disastrous argument concerning his choice of partner. Like so many Korean parents, Mr. and Mrs. Kim just did not know how to handle their son coming out to them as gay, and had lashed out at Hyuk. Hyuk seldom visited his parents, and was only planning on dropping by shortly that night to give Dal-ki her birthday present.

He walked into a scene of carnage. Nine-tails like to play with their prey, making sure that they squeeze out every drop of delicious agony and pain from the victims' bleeding mouths. Dal-ki had flayed her mother and disemboweled her father. It was very clear from the way the bodies were positioned that they actually had to watch their spouse be torn apart in front of them as they themselves died horrific deaths. Hyuk’s two brothers, who were respectively fifteen and thirteen at the time, lay in tattered scraps across the kitchen floor, with a yellow post-it note stuck to the grotesque pile.

“I saved some for you in case you were hungry. See you later, older brother.”

The Korean workshop only found out what happened five days after the incident, and Uncle Tae-San (대산) went over to the scene to investigate and clean up, not expecting there to be any survivors. Tae-San found Hyuk frozen in place, his clothes soaked through with stinking, rotting blood and his stiffened hand clutching the mutilated remains of his family. Flies swarmed around him, maggots were crawling on his skin, but he simply did not move. He had soiled himself from the crouching position he had settled into, and his pants were leaking excrement. The pungent odor of shit and piss barely added anything to the atmosphere saturated with rot and blood. Tae-San later told me that he was sure that what he was looking at was another night-thing, and almost shot Hyuk on the spot before he realized that the man was weeping. Tears were flowing in a constant stream from his bloodshot eyes, carving two jagged lines of clear skin across a canvas of splattered blood. Those eyes never left the broken corpses even as Tae-San dragged him away from the scene.

It only took Hyuk a couple months to complete his training and get his four-shot, and from the very first day he was dead set on becoming a nine-tail specialist. I have only seen Hyuk’s four-shot once, but that was enough to leave a lasting impression. If there’s anything that nine-tails are scared of, it’s tigers. Hyuk engraved a lunging tiger across the barrel of the hunting rifle that he calls his four-shot, its yawning maw ending at the muzzle in a ferocious roar. He makes sure to spray tiger-piss on the rounds and clean the gun with rendered tiger fat every time he goes hunting, and the gun positively pulsates with the murderous savagery derived from his obsessive ritual installation of the tiger’s presence. The butt of the rifle is lined with tiger bone scrimshaw of the most graphic nature; its depiction of a dozen of tigers indulging in a wanton massacre of all living things is the most disturbing thing to look at because of the sheer hatred and blood lust it emanates. Shooting a nine-tail through its heart with such a thing is similar to hurling a full-grown Siberian tiger at it; there is simply no chance of the night-thing surviving the impact.

With the weapon in hand, it was time for Hyuk to set the trap for his quarry. Nine-tails are careful creatures, they will run at the first sign of danger and baiting one is nearly impossible. That is, unless you have something that a nine-tail wants, unless you just so happened to have something like the warm, sweet liver of a prey that got away.

As ritual scarring or tattoos are relatively common ways of warding against malign influences, it is not uncommon to see hunters mutilating their own body in the process of a hunt. What Hyuk did to himself, however, was on an entirely different level. Hyuk blackmailed a surgeon at gunpoint to get exactly two things done to himself. First, he drew as much blood from his own body as it was medically possible, threatening the doctor to not start the transfusion until the process was complete. It was important that the blood was entirely his own, not a drop of someone else’s mixed into the pool. After that, he had the poor doctor take a sizable chunk of liver out of a body that was already half dead from blood loss. It’s honestly a small miracle that the doctor managed to complete these procedures without killing Hyuk.

The blood and the liver chunk were the ace in the hole, it was something that Hyuk knew that the nine-tail wanted badly. There was, however, no chance that the vixen would willingly walk into what it suspected was a trap. If he was to coax the nine-tail out of hiding, he had to provide it with enough reassurance that it was not in any danger. This is the reason that Hyuk smuggled out the body of a homeless man from the local police station morgue, drained the carcass of every last drop of blood by hanging it upside down with its throat slit, and ran it over repeatedly with his Range Rover. Afterwards, he scooped the bits of shattered bones and flesh into a coffin, doused it generously with his own blood, and placed his liver chunk on it like a cherry on the top of a hot fudge sundae. Mind you, the man should have been in an intensive care unit at this point; he had just taken out half his liver and about three pints of blood. Vengeance, however, is a powerful and dangerous fuel, driving men to work past their physical limit.

I still haven’t figured out exactly how he managed to arrange a funeral for himself and also intern a mangled, stolen corpse into a proper grave, but the Korean family workshop has always been on good terms with the local government. I suspect Tae-San told Hyuk which palms he should grease and which petty bureaucrat to bully, as such heavy-handed diplomacy has always been uncle’s strong suit. Regardless of how he had done it, Hyuk had exactly what he needed: a freshly dug grave, supposedly holding his own dead body.

The nine-tail reacted almost immediately. Nine-tails have preternatural connections to grave sites, and it had smelled the sweet, cloying scent of the blood of its “brother” seeping into the soft, upturned earth. It was a moonless night, dark as pitch, when the nine-tail slunk out of its hiding to desecrate the pseudo-grave. The vixen was positively salivating as it dug into the shallow grave with eager paws, so taken with the sweet morsel just barely out of reach that it barely registered the faint whiff of metallic scent wafting out of the ground as it dug deeper. This was exactly the reason that the nine-tail failed to notice the pressure plate that served as the detonator for the eight claymore mines buried underneath the coffin.

The explosion was deafening, the ensuing storm of ball bearings and metal shards shredding everything within the near vicinity into bloody scraps and smithereens. Had Hyuk wanted to give the nine-tail a quick and painless death, he would have rigged the mines with ritual devices and consecrated silver. That was never his intention to begin with, the claymores were meant to be a distraction, something that would cripple and hurt but not kill. The vixen had made sure that his family died slow, agonizing deaths. Hyuk was a big believer of the old adage, an eye for an eye.

The nine-tail emerged screaming from the inferno, half its face gone and its belly trailing a long line of entrails. As it rolled on the ground to put out the fire that was turning the once lustrous white coat into tattered, burnt scraps, Hyuk pulled the trigger of his four-shot. He deliberately aimed for its legs, shattering bones and cauterizing the wound instantly with scorching silver from the 5.56mm of his hunting rifle. Four legs, four shots. The nine-tail collapsed on the ground, a half-dead pile of burnt meat and splintered bones without any limbs to carry it out of what would surely be its grave.

Hyuk took his time. He knew that a nine-tail’s regenerative capacity was nowhere near the level where it can heal silver wounds, especially after having half its body blown apart by claymore mines. He lit a cigarette, and watched the maggot-like body squirm and scream.

“Older brother, it hurts! Older brother, please help me!”

It was then that the vixen played its best hand, a trick that always worked, a brilliant display of cunning that always bought it the split second she needed to turn the table. The nine-tail shapeshifted its face into Dal-ki’s, a face that Hyuk had cared for and loved. You see, this is the reason that night-things were never able to truly wipe us out from the face of earth. No matter how smart, or how cunning, they just don’t understand how people’s emotions work. Sure, they are good at scaring us, or manipulating us. But they do not understand love, nor the burning rage of a person who lost someone dear to them. The nine-tail simply did not anticipate the burst of fury that followed.

Hyuk had chosen a remote glade up on a mountain to dig the fake grave, a cautionary measure that ensured that no civilian got dragged into his revenge. Korean mountains are nothing to be toyed with, and he had put on a pair of heavy hiking boots to help with the climb. He casually slipped on the steel and silver alloy cleats that he had prepared just for this occasion, and walked over to the writhing fox with a human face. His feet came down hard on its face, tearing skin and caving in skull. The blood that spurted from the vixen’s broken head was acidic and boiling hot, the silver in the cleats working its corrosive influence on shapeshifter physiognomy.

He stomped down until his sister’s face was little more than a pile of sizzling hamburger meats, and put out the cigarette in the blood pooling in the cavities. Only a single, lidless brown eye, filled with pain, rage, and confusion, stared out of the grotesque pile. Hyuk smiled then, a faint creasing around the corners of his mouth barely visible to those who do not know what to look for. He slowly loaded his four-shot with the tiger-piss rounds, and emptied the whole clip into the dying fox’s brain.

The clean up that followed was a bitch and a half, or so uncle Tae-san told me. No one had complained though, they knew this was exactly both Hyuk and the nine-tail deserved. After Tae-san lost his life to a thousand-year old snake in a hunt gone wrong, Hyuk took over the family workshop in Seoul, and has been running the shop ever since. He does not go hunting as often as he used to; as the head of a workshop, he has a lot of things on his plate. After all, it is the head’s responsibility to pick up contracts and maintain a good working relationships with both government officials and other hunter households. Whenever he hears the report of a nine-tail, however, he starts cleaning his horrible four-shot hunting rifle with rendered tiger fat.

So that’s the story about my cousin’s first hunt, how his altercation with a nine-tail led to his introduction to the family business. I apologize if I was too graphic this time around, but this was the only proper way to tell Hyuk’s story. Next time I write to you all, I will tell you a little more about why we only adopt from hunter bloodlines. You see, we actually have more reasons for this practice than just not wanting to see ordinary kids suffer an unhappy childhoods under our care."

A couple years ago I was laid off a very good job due to an injury and lost pretty much everything. My car got repossessed, I lost my apartment, and I was forced to go through bankruptcy to rid the burden of the debt that remained. It was the darkest time of my life so far. 

But, after that all settled and when I had nothing I got this: [my very first gaming PC](https://imgur.com/a/Xseqmfa). A prebuilt MSI GT72VR. 

It may not seem like much to most folks, but to me it was everything. As a kid I wanted nothing more than to game on PC but it was financially impossible for my family and I. So to get this machine during my absolute low point of my life meant the entire world to me.

I played games, I edited videos, and I took it with me to the internship that ultimately led me to the career path I'm on now. It was, and still is, a great computer.

But, now that I'm better financially I have accumulated the parts I needed to build my own PC. It's an incredible feeling but part of me is sad that I'm retiring this machine.

There is also a bright side though. Sadly my family's financial situation hasn't changed and now my 12 year old brother is in the same boat as me. But, I'm not going to make him wait until he's an adult to play games on a PC. Once my new system is built I'm cleaning out this laptop, removing my stickers, and giving it to him along with a fresh mechanical keyboard and gaming mouse. I am beyond excited to see his face.

Thanks to this community for all of the information for your love of computers. I don't post here often, or even at all, but I see you all here and I think this a great community. Thank you for your time.

**EDIT:**

Firstly, thank you for the kind responses. It really means a lot. This community along with channels like Linus Tech Tips and Gamers Nexus really pushed me to build a PC instead of getting a pre-built workstation. You guys are a cool community and I appreciate you.

Secondly, someone questioned why I bought a nearly $2000 laptop after I had pretty much lost everything I owned. That is a legitimate question and I'd like to answer it in the main post as well.

As I said above I was at a pretty low point. While I was VERY fortunate enough to have in-laws that would allow my spouse and I to live with them until we got back on our feet, we didn't take anything with us aside from our clothes and bed. I virtually had nothing I could say I owned myself and that bothered me tremendously.

Before the bankruptcy I had foolishly paid credit for a computer I used to do video editing work. When I filed for bankruptcy, it was effectively taken back and given to my creditor to make some of their money back. As for gaming, I had to sell my PS4 and TV to try and keep up payments on the car I was financing at the time...which in hindsight sucks because I lost the car anyways.

Video editing has always been as much a passion as video gaming for me. Not having access to either of those things really upset me. So once I got a new job slinging pizzas at Round Table, I looked for ways I could get my hands on something I could use for both: a gaming computer. 

Unfortunately I didn't have a desk so I had to go with a laptop. Also unfortunately, the bankruptcy absolutely destroyed my credit. I dropped from a 700 to a 320 credit score. I didn't have many options.

So, I found Xotic PC and at the time they allowed leasing with no credit requirements. Better yet, they offered low monthly payments I could afford even with my pizza job. This is how they lure you in.

Being dumb and desperate at the time, I agreed to pay to lease, and then own, my laptop. Seemed like a good deal at the time...but I ended up paying nearly double the MSRP to actually own it. Very shitty. But, bright side: I do own the laptop now which means I *can* give it to my brother.

TL;DR - I made a very dumb choice to lease an expensive computer and although I could manage to keep up the monthly payments it was a poor financial choice in the long run.

Sorry if that explanation isn't the best, but it's really what happened and I can't offer anything better than the truth. Now that I'm older and have been through more I offer you this advice: be careful when you lease things because it can bite you in the ass."

I am an incoming freshman at UT Austin next year, studying computer science. I am planning out the courses I’d like to take during my time here, and I realized there are a lot of great programs available that I’m interested in. I was wondering if you guys could weigh in on what you thought would be the best choice, assuming I like all options equally.

The first option is a double major in math. I really enjoy math, and I’ve been told that doing math and cs is really common at UT, and is not a super difficult path. I’m not sure exactly how many extra classes the double major would mean but I’ve also heard that I could definitely still graduate in 4 years which is super important to me. 

The second option is a minor in business. UT’s McCombs business school is one of the best in the world, and I imagine that a minor would look great. CS + business minor is also pretty common and shouldn’t be very difficult. I also wanted to mention that McCombs offers a Summer Institute for Business, which would take care of 5 out of the 6 required courses for the minor all in one Summer. The only issue is that I probably wouldn’t be able to an internship that Summer then, which could be a con.

The final option is slightly different from the first two. I was accepted into a program called the Jefferson Scholars Program at UT, which focuses on philosophy, theology, and political discussion. You end up with a certificate in core texts and ideas, and have to take a total of 6 courses total, although some of my core classes UT requires could count for the program. I feel like this could help me stand out in a pool of otherwise stem heavy applicants, and I do really enjoy the topics it covers.

The different options are not mutually exclusive, and while I probably couldn’t do all three unless I did the McCombs Summer Institute, feel free to recommend a mix of multiple programs! Also I’d like to reiterate that this is all based on the assumption that I end up liking all three types of classes equally.

Thanks for your help!"

My end goal is the eventually land a job on a Hedge Fund investment team. 

At the moment, I'm working part time as an office IT. I work three days a week, and have classes on the other two. As much as I love my job, it's not inline with my end goal at all. I was wondering if there were job opportunities to set myself ahead now during college so that I'll be in a better position when I graduate in two years time.

Because of my schedule, I thought about part time positions at a proprietary trading company, but the ones I find are pretty scammy. I also know internships are a thing, but would there be anything that's more long term?

I would love to hear any input from you guys."
h05ncc,5,2020-06-10,Switching roles after signing FT offer with company?,newcsgrad20202020,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/h05ncc/switching_roles_after_signing_ft_offer_with/,"Hi, so I was wondering if I could get some advice on this sub on an issue I was thinking about for a while. 

During my sophomore year, I got my first internship at a fairly large tech company in the Automation / QA team. I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought, so I tried to switch to a dev role. After completing my first internship, I worked for my college as a dev. Later that summer I joined the same company again in a new team that focused on full stack work. This is something that I really enjoyed, and I hoped I would be able to go back to that team for full time.

Fortunately, I received a full time offer. TC-wise, it is decent (it is right at the average for a new grad in the location), but I will need to move to a different city. 

However, because of Covid19, a re-org in the company has occurred, and I was moved to a QA role. Thankfully, the offer hasn't changed, but I truly like being a developer much more than being in the QA team. I really wish I could start my first full time experience as a developer.
However, I understand that Covid19 is hitting the economy hard and it is harder to find jobs these times around. But I have around 6 months before I start. Would it be advisable to start interviewing and get a full time offer for a dev position with other companies, and then renege the old company? Or would it be better to stick with my current offer because of the consequences of reneging? Thanks"
h05ud5,1,2020-06-10,"Debating Malicious Compliance, but don't want alienate GM",Marayla,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/h05ud5/debating_malicious_compliance_but_dont_want/,"Figured this might be a safe sub to post this in, here's a bit of setup before the main issue.
I work in fast food. (They have other names for it within the company to try to appear fancy and justify the prices, but it's fast food.) This is my first actual job (aside from laser engraving/manufacturing commission work my brother and I used to do occasionally) because while I have experience in robotics/programming, an associate's in science (and an in-progress CS major), and graphic design/STEM-related interests and skills, nobody when I moved here was willing to hire a 17-year old for anything other than fast food in my area, much less for anything related to the things I actually have experience in. 
I am now 18, nearly 19, and not tied to this job, but while my coworkers repulse me (will expand on that), I don't particularly want to burn my bridges for good references from management.
My workplace has gone through three managers in my year here, it's currently being run by the general manager to sort things out. My coworkers are all rampant drug users (not legal here), insist on blowing vape clouds near me despite my informing them I have asthma and have no intention of starting a smoking or vaping habit, since it's potentially deadly for me (they insist they'll get me to try it sometime) and insist on loudly using the n-word and other similar profanity loudly near the front counters while I serve customers (none of my coworkers are black or even minorities, to my knowledge). I tell you this to contrast myself against when I say that the GM literally hugged me when I finished my spring semester and came back to work again after finals. She likes me so far, I want to keep it that way.

Essentially my issue boils down to two things, the recent actions of my coworkers and the assistant manager. 
First issue:
My coworker seems to think it was appropriate to call me to the back of the store (I thought it was important) specifically to tell me, unprompted, in front of three other people, ""you have a fat ass, you know that? Oh, but it's a good thing! It's not like I have a crush on you or anything, but you have a fat ass.""  (Incidentally, I'm sturdy-built. I am not fat by any stretch of the word, but I have thicker thighs. She said this to get a reaction, I have a reputation for being very calm and never getting angry.) I mentioned it to a manager and she laughed it off. If I escalate, it will very obviously be me, and I will be a snitch. My coworkers will not take kindly to it. 
Not sure how to deal with that, so I need advice there.

My second issue is that my coworkers tend to underfill shakes, sundaes, and blended desserts. The assistant manager is terrible about this, he only does half scoops for everything and refuses to listen when people tell him full scoops are round as per the training materials. These desserts are six or seven bucks a pop, so they're expensive for the size. I am a trainer, and I had a trainee today in drive through (my specialty position, I am considered the best at it at my location). Someone ordered a triple scoop dish of our signature dessert, I checked it when it was ready to hand out, it had only two scoops. I had been handed underfilled and half-melted desserts to hand out all day, so I did what I did for the others, which was to go to the dessert station, (where the assistant manager and a coworker were standing and talking) topped it up/remade it as necessary, then gave it to my trainee to hand out. All is well, since it took maybe thirty seconds, I thought. When I turned around, however, I came face to face with an angry-looking, much larger-than-me assistant manager literally looming over me, who informs me, and I quote ""you will not do that again. You will hand out whatever they give you."" I informed him politely that the dish was short a scoop, and it needed one more, maybe it was a miscommunication? He kept the glare and said ""I don't care what they give you, you hand it out, none of that changing stuff, got it?""
I've seen others get chewed out by the GM for handing out melted, wrong, or underfilled desserts, and I'm not about to let that be me. I'm a trainer, I'm meant to set an example. Supposedly, he's qualified to be a trainer too, so he should know better. My brother has suggested I do exactly as he says, regardless of the fact that I would be shorting customers and making people angry, just to be maliciously compliant. I'm considering bringing this up to the GM, but once again, I don't want to make waves with coworkers.  I need advice here too.

I'm working on finding an internship, but I want to have the GM as a good reference, since she likes me for being polite, reliable, drug-free, and good at my job. I don't want to piss her off right before I leave.

TL;DR: Coworkers have a ""snitches get stitches"" social mentality, called me a fat ass to get a reaction, which I don't appreciate. Assistant manager wants me to stiff customers on very expensive desserts, stared me down so I didn't argue. I don't want to compromise my morals or piss off my coworkers, but am unsure if I should talk to the main location manager (who happens to be the GM) or if it might hurt my chances of a good reference when I leave for an internship.

Sorry if this is long or gives too much info, I'm a first timer here and I'd like to get some solid informed advice."
h06gvh,0,2020-06-10,The Truth About Greek Life,throwaway3126563,udub,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/h06gvh/the_truth_about_greek_life/,"If you got accepted into the University of Washington, you’re about to embark on the best 4 years of your life educationally... 
BUT if you want the best 4 years of your life in terms of memories, fun, mental support, making connections, having special opportunities, increased academic support, leadership experience, socializing, and lifelong friends, then GO GREEK!

In all honesty, my parents made me Dorm my freshman year and oh man.... the WORST experience ever. RAs tried to make it seem like people would wanna hang out, but it never came true. The dorms were dead quiet, my cluster roommates were awkward &amp; antisocial, and I couldn’t find help with academics that was personalized... to put it straight, the dorms felt like a prison where you go to class, maybe go eat Pizza for dinner, and then go to my room to study. Nothing more, nothing less. Only 5 people showed up to the “Movie Night” my RA threw, and the people that went didn’t even seem like they wanted to be there..

Well... I was sick and tired of it so my parents finally allowed me to go through the “Rush Process”. I rushed during summer, join a house, and now I have lifelong brothers who I will see every year at my Fraternity’s Founders’ Day annual event with Alumni &amp; Undergraduate members. 

As soon as I joined, I started to feel happy and every day was a new adventure at UW. My academics also went from a 3.2 Average to a 3.78 average as a Pre-Med Major! 
I gained Gym Partners, study partners, FREE printing &amp; study materials, Alumni Mentoring, Unlimited Social Events, LinkedIn &amp; Resumé Networking, Financial &amp; Study Habit Lessons, amazing food prepared by a chef everyday, Access to Formal Events with my house as well as Sororities (Boat Formal in Vancouver Canada), a Trip to Cabo with 80+ of my Greek friends, etc...

One of the best parts was gaining the ability to bolster my resume through philanthropy programs throughout the Greek Community, and the ability to hold leadership positions in the house. Since Greek Houses on average have $500,000 to a Million Dollars flowing through them each year, holding ANY leadership position in the house looks amazing to employers. 

In essence, I went from it just being myself against the world, to being me and all 90 of my brothers against the world. The privilege of being Greek has opened my eyes so much to how fortunate I truly am. Being able to wake up in the morning to my House Group Chat making jokes, giving advice, and having fun, was the best way to start my day. 

Being in a Fraternity gave me so many little positives that built up over time and made me succeed. 
Currently, I got my MCAT results back and I scored in the upper 10%, all thanks to my Alumni Brothers who gave me tips and helped me study through the whole process.
My friends who were in the dorms and decided not to rush ended up living stressed out all the time, constantly hating life at UW, and ended up pulling out of STEM overall and switching their majors.
My brothers in Business got all their internships to Amazon, Google, Microsoft, etc, got an upper-hand from an alumni being on the inside. 

My story is just one of MANY positive experiences that UW Greek Members have. 


At the end of the day, the Greek System has an overall GPA that is higher than the rest of the University, and Fraternities &amp; Sororities are cheaper than Dorms, especially when factoring in all that you get from being a lifelong member to these secret societies. 

GO GREEK"

At 3 years old I had an accident trying to climb on the kitchen and busted my head causing me a mild brain injury that would be the root of my undiagnosed ADHD and severe anxiety issues. 
I was raised in a very hostile environment where my mom retaliated all her anger and frustrations beating the crap out of me all the time. My grandma who was the light of my childhood had a seizure when I was 8 years old and ended up crippled in a wheelchair until she died 11 years later. She turned into the biggest and most annoying burden a small family can endure. 
My mom was obsessed with the idea that no matter the cost I had to be in a privileged private school even when I was bullied for being different in so many ways. I was made fun of out of everything. My height (I’m also 5,6), my sudden queer manners, my clumsiness...etc...I even developed severe dermatillomania in my hands due to severe anxiety. it was hell, I had 2 attempts for suicide that were totally ignored by everyone like it didn’t really matter. The only friend close friend that I had only lasted a year and half after his mom passed away in the middle of his first year in the school... 
I was the poorest of my classroom, I had the worst house, my mom drove the cheapest car and even my dogs were ugly as fuck. Neighbors would always made fun of my pets. 
My house, disgusting, always dirty...my mom was a semi hoarder and would always accumulate clothes and books. 
I would never invite anybody out of deep shame. 
My grades in school were ok. 
I was very good in some and horrible in the others. I had to spend extra hours memorizing stuff because I would not understand simple shit sometimes. Every time I had to speak in public I would panic and stutter and people would laugh. 
My scape was video games, I would play so much that because of it, it started affecting my visual impairment and started developing strabismus at 15 years old....
After I graduated, i got out of my hometown and got to a private university paid by my mom. 
I struggled a lot in college. 
I felt stupid and out of place. I was always awkward and lacked social skills. 
I would annoy the fuck out of people and they would ignore me. 
In my time off I focused myself to try hard and be more physically attractive so I would go to the gym and have tons of protein supplements. 
I would also go to play Magic theGathering whenever I could and eventually got good at it but due to my undiagnosed ADHD I would mess up all the time. I would get so angry at losing. 
At 21 I lost my hair. I was balding bad since 18. 
I hated my look. I was always angry because I had to wear a hat to look like my age. I would look almost 10 years older. 
While in college, I started forcing myself in doing internships but I would be so difficult to work with due to my behavior and forgetfulness. 
On my last semesters I would try to work on the side but got fired twice. 
I gave up on my 8th semester and quit college for a year out of deep shame for myself. I felt humiliated constantly. 
To fix my visual impairment I managed to get a surgery in a public hospital after a 3 months wait. 
I “fixed it”...when back to college. Same struggles on other areas. Didn’t give up this time, suffered a lot to get that thesis done. My thesis barely passed...it was basic and shitty. 
I didn’t make any friends and even when i was invited by default to the college graduation party I barely knew anybody and it was awkward as fuck. 
After college. I started internships again (neither of the didn’t last long tbh). I would sugarcoat my resume to death to appeal to employers, I ended up being hired in a couple places but surprise, got fired in the first and the second was horrible an abusive position that nobody else would take and therefore ended up there for a year. I got so depressed I ended taking medication for depression and quit that job. I got hired in an ad agency which fired me after a month. 
I gave up on everything and  sold my MTG cards to buy my ticket to the US...
I tattooed my head in a micropigmentation style so it gave me a younger appearance and it somehow made me feel less shitty about my genetic makeup. 
I ended up as a server in multiple places. I worked as busser, server and even did cleaning labors. 

I would throw up in bathrooms out of panic, anger and shame. I got hospitalized in 2016 for severe depression...
I ended up working in a total of 15 places. In which I got fired in 9 of them. 
I got diagnosed of ADHD at 29. After being fired for like the 12th time for being messy, scattered minded and forgetful. After meds I saw the light. I started getting creative. It was like a miracle. 

Too bad I lost my 20’s and teens in a very miserable way. 

Even when in these 2 years of new life I’ve improved a lot, I still can’t get a job out of my lack of experience and creating a business takes a lot of investment that I haven’t been able to acquire. 
Social media makes me sick and gives me PTSD  every time I get to see the accomplishments of those people that I studied with and all their successful relationships. The amount of mental disorders I’ve gathered through so much abuse are way too much to handle and paying for a friend (therapy) hasn’t solved the issue. 
I now have CPTSD, Rejection sensitivity dysphoria and probably some mild form of autism. 

What is the point of all this suffering? 

I’ve gone against all odds...fought many battles. But in the end...it doesn’t even matter. 

Why do people like me exist? Is not like someone is going to give me a life medal for overcoming the gigantic struggles of my life. 

Nobody wants to date me because I’m so emotionally damaged. I’m in total fear of meeting new people and isolation made everything worse. I’m a couple months away of being possibly homeless and if I get to that  point it’s definitely over. 

Is life even worth all this shit?
I feel like it’s hanging from a thin string and it’s about to break anytime soon. 

I should’ve broken my neck when I was 3."

I started an internship at a research institute this summer joining the group of a famous professor in my field.  

I think the institute is pretty awesome, the environment is pretty cool and people are welcoming and helpful (unlike in my PhD lol where I have nobody to ask for help on most days) but the salary is still abysmally low. I am not sure how long I will last before I just decide to leave this path completely. 

The only thing that keeps me going right now is my love for scientific research and the fact I am getting to work on very cool problems. But even that is being tested and I think I am on the verge of just leaving. I see some of my peers in industrial internships getting 3x of what I am earning and I just can not justify my career path any longer. I mean I can take 80%, even 60% of industry salary cut to work here but like 30% really?? It really feels insulting sometimes. I don’t know how to describe it any better. 

I always kind of knew that the salaries are low in academia but now that it is happening to me, it has hit me hard for the first time. My fellow interns are from Ivy League universities here and top graduate schools in UK. I have no idea how and why all of us are actually working for this amount. 
So have we totally normalized this system and there is no hope for improvement in compensation? I am surprised that academia has even managed to survive this long and able to retain some very smart folks. 

What keeps any of you going if you are continuing in academia? I am just looking for perspectives here as I am just completely disillusioned here totally."

So I got an interview about a month and a half ago and was told I was missing some scripting skills and even some Linux experience. Understood, I knew that going in, although I’m sure I understood my Linux abilities. 

So I checked the site again to see if they had filled the position and were maybe looking for greener people yet. The position is still open, they also have an intern position open. 

I’m torn as to whether to email the recruiter back asking about availability of the open position or even the intern position. My go-to person for professional advice says he wouldn’t recommend it, and my wife thinks I should go for it (she’s very supportive).

h0clqr,1,2020-06-10,Should I intern at a major place this summer?,cookiesandmilk23,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/h0clqr/should_i_intern_at_a_major_place_this_summer/,"I just finished my second year in college and it has definitely been an overwhelming year. I was looking forward to the summer because I had a great internship coming up, but due to coronavirus, the company fell from being one of the most successful in the world to firing people left and right, so there went my internship. Afterward, in the search of something that I could do this summer I was able to land another major internship in a major intergovernmental organization, that is a United Nations observer. It all sounds great, and in theory I should take it but I am debating whether to. 

For one I am thankful because many people were not able to land internships this summer, and I got one with a good place. On the other hand, I would mostly be doing research work for the org. and I know that's something I don't want to do later in life, so I am not sure how beneficial it will be.  But mostly, I feel really drained and worn out. The school year was so tiring, I had more struggles than usually academically, and had to give it my all to be able to pass. I am home, which is not the most ideal stress-free space, and I know this job will be very demanding - a lot of writing, meetings, etc. I am already burned out from the school year and don't have much energy to keep working, but at the same time I feel like I need that resume boost for when I apply to jobs. I go to a recognized school (one of the Ivys), so I already know that is going to help me out, but it is still very competitive, especially when I want to go into a major firm in the future (consulting prob.) So I feel this immense pressure to take the internship. And since the US economy won't be at it's peak, I am also telling myself I need to build my resume to be able to get a good job after college. But at the same time, I hear recruiters aren't really putting much focus on what people did this summer because of the pandemic.

In mid-May, I accepted a summer internship at a company that was right up my alley. Not only was it roughly in the field I want to work in after graduation,  I would participate in meaningful projects that would both exciting and educational. Unfortunately, the internship is not full-time at 30 hours per week and only pays a little more than minimum wage. 

Last week, I heard back from a non-profit I  interviewed with a long time ago offering me a position. This company is in a completely different field than the other one. Although the company certainly doesn't work in my primary field of interest, I was strongly inclined to accept to accept the position. Not only would it give me some extra cash (of which I am in pretty desperate need), it would give me the demonstrated experience in data analysis I've been looking for. The internship focuses on a single project. It's 30 hours per week for only a month and I can work and log hours whenever I please (nights, weekends ect.). I informed them that I had already accepted another position, but would sign on provided they were okay with me working another internship and it were okay that I would be consistently unavailable to work and communicate during the set times I would be working for my other internship. She was fine with both and I ended up signing on. 

I never actually reached out to my other boss at the first company for their approval. I just assumed that since the second internship wouldn't impact my ability to do my first internship, both in terms of my schedule and my general ability to complete my work, that it wouldn't be issue. Likewise, there is no official company policy against working another job and their is no overlap in the work between the two companies. Because of the abbreviated timeline for the second internship, I didn't even feel like I was taking on a second job as much as I was just doing a paid side project on my own time. 

Regardless, did I do something wrong? Should I try to avoid having my first boss find out? Or can I be open about it (e.g. updating LinkedIn ect.) without actually going out of my way tell him about it?"

The title kind of speaks for itself.

I am nineteen years old and have just finished College in the UK, equivalent to finishing High School in the US. My subject I studied in college had nothing to do with computers or coding, but I am exploring my options for degrees at University.

I was looking at doing a Computing and IT degree as I've heard the sector is well paid and could allow remote working and some freedom (although both of these statements could be completely wrong). I am confident with using a computer as I have grown up using them nearly my whole life, but I have no coding or 'back of house' knowledge about them.

With this in mind, do you guys think I could undertake a Computing and IT Degree, or should I look at a different degree entirely?

Is there anything I could do to get myself a foundation level, such as read specifc books or practice on a program? I was thinking of doing an internship in computing (a few months paid employment with a company) to learn a bit, but I don't know if they will take someone with no experience.

(I'm not asking you guys to decide for me, I am just seeking some suggestions as I have zero knowledge in the field.)

Thank you!"

I've been looking for back-end work in Boston, MA but months of concentrated rejection (coupled with nearly a year of slow, diluted rejection) has finally convinced me to divert time away from the job search to try to improve my skills as I think I'm not reaching some standard to find work.

I'm not social enough to market potential and, while I'm fairly confident I can spin-up to any entry-level software position even in a new language, I think I'm just lacking right now. If I'm honest with myself, I'm rather mediocre. I'm not looking for an ego boost; I'd just like to know what to focus on to make myself more marketable. There's only so many hours in a day and I just can't make myself to commit to any course for long because I don't know if what I'm doing will actually help me. Some days I plug away at hackerrank and start reading about more niche parts of a language and other days I try looking for common techstacks to learn (without much success) but I don't stay with either for long enough to feel any benefits.

Recently, I've been trying to brush up on Java Spring Boot but after the tutorials, I'm feeling at loss as how to proceed.

Can anyone tell me what I should be focusing on to find a job at this time? Should I go whole-hog into trying to churn out projects (and advice on how to go about that is always welcome)? Or should I try to get l33t to wow people during the interview?"

It also stated a degree as a requirement or relevant work experience. The recruiter said my profile matches as I have the relevant skills and experience. 

Now I do definitely have a very broad skillset, I’ve done stuff with a lot of different tech stacks but still I’m wondering does this recruiter know I’m a student or did she miss that? Because I checked my profile on Amazon with that email my resume is posted and I had previously applied to an internship job and on my resume it clearly states I’m in school and my recent internship experience. Basically I’m wondering if anyone has had a similar experience and what I should do in this case? They said I can chat with them or get started with an online assessment. Does anyone also know what the initial online assessment is like?

Also the recruiter is legit they have an @amazon.com email

I’m thinking of maybe agreeing to chat with her and that way I am able to find out more and she’ll be able to understand my situation better. If it was not really intended for someone of my experience then at least this way I’d have talked to her and maybe this would help in Landing an internship

1. Fix up your engineering resume, showcase your strongest technical AND soft skills and experience 

2. Find local engineering companies (mostly because everything is run in same place but it can be wherever) 

3. Apply for lots of entry level/high school diploma jobs (administration, customer service, etc) at the companies using your ENGINEERING RESUME 


I’ve been finding that my resume is usually selected and I get an interviews for things I didn’t apply for (or weren’t even listed), so far I’ve been offered two positions for internships! 

I’m not sure why my resume ends up in the right hands this way, but it’s been working! I think an engineering resume just tends to stand out a lot when it’s not in a sea of other engineering resumes

Obviously this means I need to step up a bit and improve what I have to offer, since I'd imagine city jobs are more competitive.

There are three things I figure I could be doing right now:

A. Grind Leetcode to improve my algorithm skills. I've heard this as a go-to for preparing to apply for jobs.

B. Learn more programming languages. Right now I know C++, Java, and a little bit of ARM Assembly. I also know a miniscule amount of C#, but it's small enough that I wouldn't list it as notable. I've started learning SQL as of tonight as I've seen it on a lot of job postings, and if I were to go this route I'd also try to learn C#, Python, and Javascript.

C. Work on personal projects. While I have a few projects under my belt due to school assignments, having more is never a bad thing. The ideas I had were a calculator I could continuously implement more features on (in C++), a slot machine (in C++), or a platforming game in Unity Game Engine.

Of those three, which would improve my chances the most of landing a job in a city? I graduate in December. I had one internship a few years ago but it really just involved recording data and didn't give me any experience in the area of software development."

TBH, I not sure if I would like to work in the CS industry. My GPA is bad as well. I've a couple of Cs and Ds. I've participated in hackathons and have 4 (5 by next year) internship experiences. But, if this is the only way out, I can deal with it I guess. I placed anywhere because I felt that anywhere is better than living with my parents. Savings wise, I probably have around SGD 10k. I am thinking of working for a couple of years and go back to school (probably law). Though GPA is gonna be a problem (sighs).

However, if I really had to choose I would pick between the US or UK. And I know the whole thing about the grass is greener on the other side. I thought it would be easier since I know English. I know how to speak Chinese but I'm not sure if I want to live in another Asian country. Also, I'm trying to get as far away from my parents as possible.

Please help me out and tell me what I can do to migrate. I am also open to other countries if it is more possible. Oh and I am graduating 2021 December. So, I hope to move overseas in early 2022.

So if you are using some of the mentioned services why would you choose them and why not? And are you maybe using other services that may be better then please tell me. 

Thanks a lot."

Anyway, assuming my endgoal is to reach AWS Specialties after Professional but for now just targetting to reach Associate-level AWS, how should my learning progression go &amp; what Prerequisites?

I've read that starting with Harvard's intro to Computer Sciencs CS50 is a good jump in, but what about after?

Do i gun for Cloud Foundational level instantly the moment i get CS50 done, or do i need to learn some preqreuisites like Python,etc?

Also is AWS Associate good enough to pass an initial interview, even for an internship, or should i go grab others too like Linux Essentials, or Red Hat?

I don't know what specialty to go after but that's probably something i can answer down the line.

Please and thanks..."

Student teacher here with a semester's worth of work left until I'm done with my bachelor's degree. During my second year internship (now two years ago), I was told that my classroom management skills were lacking, but I didn't get concrete feedback on how I could fix it.    
    
Last year I got a job as a call-in substitute teacher, and I thought I was doing well, until I learnt this monday I wouldn't be on the primary roster for the coming schoolyear. Among the reasons was that they wanted to give some new, young people the opportunity (read: staff members' gap year kids need a job), and that I could stand to, you guessed it, improve my classroom management skills.    
    
The conversation in general was very weird, and the woman who informed me of my pending unemployment, among other things, brought up that co-teachers/special pedagogical assistent (don't know of an exact translation for this position in English) had sometimes helped me out. What she didn't seem to know or acknowledge was that this person had **offered** their assistence.    
    
I have a suspicion they aren't a fan of my CM-style, as I shy away from yelling and reprimanding, which I have frequently seen the other teachers at this school do.    
    
However, the continued questioning of my CM skills has really shaken me and made me doubt my ability to do this job. I've got one internship left, and I'm at a loss.    
    
Is this one of those things where it'll improve with experience? Is it about the right school environment? Is there something I can/should be doing to improve?    
    
Happy teaching."

Can I use this experience to my advantage in any way when I apply for SWE roles in the future?",quixoticcocoon,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/h1158r/new_cs_grad_taking_a_shortterm_job_in_it_to_save/,"Some background info: I graduated with a Bachelors in CS in December 2019, and the company I had my internship at was initially going to keep me on until I found a job elsewhere -- they wanted to hire me full time, but the money wasn't there. Turns out, there was a lot less money than expected; shortly afterward, the higher ups completely overhauled the company and abruptly laid off all of the application developers and most of the IT department. This left me with roughly a year of experience in web development. I had some initial luck getting a couple interviews for software engineering jobs and I had what seemed like plenty of time to draw from unemployment, so I wasn't too worried about a job offer taking too long. Then COVID-19 wrecked the job market. Most entry-level jobs evaporated (as many people here have mentioned), and I haven't gotten an interview in months. For reference, I'm definitely not an ideal candidate; I went to a very average school that isn't well known, my algo/leetcode knowledge is pretty rough (read: my Data Structures class went in one ear and out the other), my Github profile is sparse at best, and I live at least 100 miles from any city that can even be remotely described as a tech hub (I'm in the rural mid-southern US).

As my unemployment money is close to officially drying up and things aren't looking any brighter, I went ahead and accepted a job doing basic IT work in my hometown. Laying cables, repairing PCs, formatting hard drives, you know the drill. It's definitely not what I'd prefer to be doing, but I need to be saving up money to move out of my parents' house and it's all stuff I know how to do very well. My question: can I leverage this in any way on my resume when applying to software engineering roles in the future, or to a hiring manager will it just look like an employment gap? Of course I'll still be doing the standard interview prep stuff in the meantime: projects, CTCI, Leetcode, etc. I'm hoping that this is just a stepping stone that I will be at no longer than a year, but I'm worried that to a hiring manager that year is going to look like an eternity. Has anyone else taken a similar career trajectory, and if so how did you make the best of your time in IT? Is it possible to make this look relevant on a resume for someone eventually looking to land in SWE, or is it just a temporary bump in the road? Am I possibly just reading into this too much?

Thanks!"

In mid-May, I accepted a summer internship at a company that was right up my alley. Not only was it roughly in the field I want to work in after graduation, I would participate in meaningful projects that would both exciting and educational. Unfortunately, the internship is not full-time at 30 hours per week and only pays a little more than minimum wage.

Last week, I heard back from a non-profit I interviewed with a long time ago offering me a position. This company is in a completely different field than the other one. Although the company certainly doesn't work in my primary field of interest, I was strongly inclined to accept to accept the position. Not only would it give me some extra cash (of which I am in pretty desperate need), it would give me the demonstrated experience in data analysis I've been looking for. The internship focuses on a single project. It's 30 hours per week for only a month and I can work and log hours whenever I please (nights, weekends ect.). I informed them that I had already accepted another position, but would sign on provided they were okay with me working another internship and it were okay that I would be consistently unavailable to work and communicate during the set times I would be working for my other internship. She was fine with both and I ended up signing on.

I never actually reached out to my other boss at the first company for their approval. I just assumed that since the second internship wouldn't impact my ability to do my first internship, both in terms of my schedule and my general ability to complete my work, that it wouldn't be issue. Likewise, there is no official company policy against working another job and their is no overlap in the work between the two companies. Because of the abbreviated timeline for the second internship, I didn't even feel like I was taking on a second job as much as I was just doing a paid side project on my own time.

Regardless, did I do something wrong? Should I try to avoid having my first boss find out? Or can I be open about it (e.g. updating LinkedIn ect.) without actually going out of my way tell him about it?"

I'm a current junior with a 3.5 weighted GPA, as I got a C- in honors English my freshman year due to some family issues. In my sophomore year, my grades improved, however, I still ended with mostly Bs and a few As. That year was also the year I took AP computer science A and got a 4 on the exam. This year, as a junior, my grades improved even more, with mostly As and a few Bs, and my major coursework being AP physics, AP psychology, and Advanced computer science AB (the ap that follows ap comp sci, but was discontinued in 2010 due to lack of interest, my school still teaches it, though). Not sure what my exam scores are yet, but I did well in the classes. Also, I took the sat for the first time (and unexpectedly the only time) cold back in December, and ended up with a 1400.**

**I think where I would truly shine in my application is my recommendations (I have a good relationship with my teachers and my counselor), my essays (I'd like to think I'm a pretty good storyteller), and my extracurriculars. I've found I perform really well in self-directed projects, most notably my science fair project from sophomore year, which won me several awards and a few local newspaper articles: an AI that could distinguish between cancerous and non-cancerous skin cells.**

**When it comes to clubs/activities, I've done MUN for three years, but I never really advanced to any leadership positions, however, this year was my first year in cyber patriot club, and I was elected to be president next year. I did some other activities as well (Colorguard, JV boys lacrosse manager-I'm a girl though, in case that wasn't clear, in-school ap comp sci tutor, etc). I've held a job every summer in high school, and as a rising junior, I was a STEM instructor at a prestigious (aka expensive -\_-) boarding school. During junior year, I was also a paid, private math tutor outside of school. This summer, I had a cybersecurity internship lined up, but with COVID, it got canceled, so I'll probably end up working in retail, however, I'm trying to play to my strengths and work on my own side project creating a videogame, might even try to release it online for free or something.**

**Other details: I'm applying out-of-state and not planning on applying for financial aid. I'm a middle eastern girl and the first in my family to go to undergrad (although my dad has a master's degree, he immigrated to the states and never went to undergrad here). I have a couple of older friends who are currently attending CMU for engineering. I don't know if any of this is helpful, but I'm including it just in case haha.**

**Anyway, that was a lot of background to ask what my chances are. I'm coming in as class of 2021 (or 2025), and Carnegie Mellon is my dream school. I know their school of computer science is super competitive and it's a big longshot, but if I somehow got in, it would be a dream come true. Any advice would be helpful!**"

My first article so lets see how it goes, as English is not my primary language.

An long time ago during my college period i was doing an internship at an local tiny IT shop in a nearby village. Only one real employee (lets call him Bob)   with 3 interns (including me, Ex1Leee) clearly taking advantage of us and letting us doing the dirty work. We daily needed to replace the eBay advertisements of old junk so the advertisement was on top, getting our accounts banned a couple of times.

One incident i clearly remember, a women brought in here HP computer, the older ones with the HDD dock in the front (the old silver ones, I couldn’t find the exact type). Stylish in that time and the HDD dock was functional, it came with the external HDD included.

The problem was that the power button was broken.  Bob told me to wait a few days and tell her we called HP and couldn’t get an replacement part (without calling HP of course, he wasn’t in for the hazzle) We could replace the case for her with an second hand one we had. The customer accepted the offer and we went on.

Bob wanted me to use the old case that we already threw in the bin, to throw away, an case yellow from smoke and full of dents. (I already thought, the customer will totally flip.) But ok, not my call to make. I went on and moved all the parts to the “new” case. Now i was left with one final problem, the HDD from the front dock, we weren’t able to move the proprietary dock from HP. Bob decided to build in the HDD in the case. (without calling the customer) He peeled of the rubbers where he thought the screws would be but couldn’t find any, moving on to pick up an hammer and flat head screwdriver hammering the cracks on the side, finally opening up the HDD case. He placed the HDD and called the customer without even testing the HDD or even the computer at all…

I was really curious about what was going to happen when she picked up the computer. The pick-up counter was right next to our office only separated with frosted glass. As she picked the computer up and she saw the case she went in a total fury, going super Saiyan. She was so mad the glass vibrated. Things only went worse when Bob proudly announced he placed the external hdd internally."

Some background about me is I am going into my 4th year of studies majoring in Statistics. I had a business analyst internship that fell through due to the virus so its very likely that I will be graduating with no experience. I want to really learn the skills and have myself ready so that I can have a job when I graduate assuming this virus situation is over by then (June 2021ish is when I will graduate).

**Roadmap**

So I have read around on this sub and seen the book ""Designing Data-Intensive Applications"" and I have a got a PDF and plan on going through it. I have seen the buzzwords ""Python"", ""SQL"", ""Kafka"", ""Spark"" and etc. So I know python pretty well up to like object oriented programming. I intend to learn data scraping and like numpy, and pandas using this udemy course:[https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-developer-zero-to-mastery/](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-developer-zero-to-mastery/)

For SQL I know very very basic queries so I intend to learn more of it using SQLBolt.

I am hoping someone can point me to what other important fundamental things I need to learn like kafka and spark and etc with some good resources

So far this is what I have and want to go through and I just wanted peoples opinions about it and like if theres anything better.  I have seen in multiple places that say ""learn fundamentals and make a good project and you can easily land a entry level data engineering role"". I just dont want people to confuse that I am under the impression it is easy to land a job hence why I am doing it. I have taken computer science courses and realized I defintely want to go into the software/technology industry and I have been trying to take a crack at webdev but really dont like it and really find data engineering very interesting. 

I would appreciate any input :)"

I’m a senior year Math student, planning to apply this fall for graduate school in physics or CS in the US. At the moment, my CGPA is 0.02 points away from the GPA on which students get a first class honors. Pretty close. 

Given that I have two semesters (in my upcoming final year) left to improve the GPA, I’m confident I can cross the 0.02 bar easily. However, at the time grad school application, my reported GPA would be my current GPA (0.02 away). I’m planning to take a few summer courses to get that to first class GPA but I already have too much in my plate, internship, GRE, and physics GRE. I’m afraid I’ll mess all that up. 

I’m not sure whether it’s worth putting in the effort in summer course to have a first honours GPA at the time of application. How much of a difference will it make in my application? Would the admission officers know that I will have the chance to improve my GPA and be a bit lenient since it’s already pretty close to first honors?"

h7cvml,3,2020-06-11,Weighing a year-long apprenticeship offer against finishing another year of school; pros/cons?,RunningWoods,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/h7cvml/weighing_a_yearlong_apprenticeship_offer_against/,"TL;DR: Gap year opportunity to do frontend dev is on the table! Should I take it?

For context, before all of this 'uncertain times' stuff hit around March, I was already on an unconventional path--medical leave kept me out of uni for two years. In that time I worked remote for an Indie video game studio doing C# stuff and went to a summer-long webdev bootcamp. (So even though I wasn't in the classroom I managed to not totally stagnate.) 

Fast-forward to this year, and I managed to land a summer internship that went remote, but didn't get canceled. It's the American arm of a fairly successful European company. The stars aligned, I clicked with the team really well (which is like only three actual engineers and two managers), and because of the unprecedented global situation they're willing to do something unconventional: since uni might be staggered re-enrollment/go online/get cancelled, and because the company is actually growing right now and they need extra help, they're willing to give me a year-long contract. 

The predicaments being: 

\--Talks are still early, so no salary is on the table yet--it's possible they'll make an offer too low to afford housing in the same city as the office. (I need at least $75k before taxes.) I theoretically find out about salary tomorrow.

\--If I take another year off, I'll be graduating a grand total of three years late, which is like a biiigg oof. (I have a trash GPA tho so grad school timelines aren't really a concern--it's more like, the more I dilly-dally delaying school, the lower my max salary later on is.) Right now I have two years left before diploma.

\--The folks at the company are super nice, but the work isn't super interesting (it's mostly mitigating technical debt. not a ton of cutting-edge stuff happening). 

\--Economic uncertainty! Like, if I delay graduation another year, will that position me to enter a better job market, or a worse one? My gut is that this current downward trend isn't reversing for a while (even though stocks are rising again). So maybe graduating later actually \*is\* good?

\--My boss is super sweet, but also super blunt. To the point that it's stressful (like as a totally green junior I screw up a lot and he does not cushion the criticism lol). He's always fair but the job makes me anxious. I imagine that will get better with time as I learn all the team's conventions better.

Where are my thoughts right now?

I really suck at distance-learning. I \*need\* the structure of an actual campus community. If school goes online in the fall my GPA goes in the toilet ('cause depression gets really bad when you're trapped in your parents' house). Aaand my GPA is already teetering on the edge (just over a 3.1). 

If I take a year to work, and do a good job, then I'm going into junior year of uni with 15 months of frontend engineering experience, 6 months of C# gamedev/API work, and 3 months of bootcamp rapid prototyping (rails stack, so I guess not actually worth that much), plus a whole bunch of years of hobbyist work. If I throw in a whole lotta leetcode then theoretically the depth of my resume will carry a lot of weight when I get around to applying for junior year internships. 

And maybe, if salary negotiation goes right, I can even save up a little cash for when I go back to school.

So from my perspective--at the moment, the offer is pretty tempting. (Work experience + stability during a recession.)

Am I missing anything major? Your thoughts/insights much appreciated :)"

h7d2vl,12,2020-06-11,Let me tell you about my vacation.,JacksmackDave,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/h7d2vl/let_me_tell_you_about_my_vacation/,"Rebecca and I had never cruised before. You know how wives can be... she dropped less and less subtle hints over the years that she really wanted to go, and that I should start saving money for it. She told me I should spring for that family friendly one. The one with the cartoon mouse. But since I was the one paying for it, I decided we should go with a deal I found on a membership warehouse travel website. Looking back I wish I had just paid the up charge and dealt with all the animated characters surrounded by screaming children.

I booked what sounded to me like a fairly nice cruise that was suppose to visit Cuba and Cozumel. But I got an email at the hotel a few hours before we were supposed to board ship. It said something like, due to diplomatic relations between the US and Cuba, your ship has had to change one of it's destinations. They gave us gratuitous apologies, and a $500 refund on our tickets . I had never been so happy to have my vacation ruined.

The ship was the biggest boat I had ever seen, but that's not really saying much. From the outside it looked impressive floating there alone in port. Once I got on board though, I could see it was old. And judging from how it didn't match what I had seen on the commercials, it was not one of their mega ships. You know the ones with laser tag arenas, Broadway shows, and water slides? Rebecca was instantly disappointed.

Some friends had told us to put our phones in airplane mode to avoid international roaming charges. They said that all those ships have wifi, and you can talk over messenger. That way you could avoid the horror story of having a thousand dollar phone bill lurking in your mailbox when you get home.

We got to our coffin, I mean our cabin. There were two tiny single beds with paper thin mattresses on either wall. And a water logged port hole half filled with dirty seawater. It was a nonsmoking room, but you could tell it hadn't always been. Anything plastic had that yellowed nicotine residue you find in ancient casinos.

""Oh, this romantic."" I smiled seductively. ""We can pretend we are being naughty at summer camp.""

""Shut up."" Rebecca struggled her oversize suitcase through the tiny door as I pressed myself against the far wall to give her room. When you have an angry woman on your hands, and she has all the exits blocked, your only options are diplomacy, or distraction.

""Oh hey look! A catalog of all the things we can do on our new itinerary."" The freshly printed brochures sat neatly on the foot of the bed. The plain paper didn't match the other printouts glossy finish. I imagine some poor intern stayed up the night before reprinting all those pages.

We putted around the ship. Bought ourselves a pair of those novelty drinks that come in a pineapple. The paper straws in our drinks turned to mush before we could finish. Rebecca wound up pouring half her drink down her shirt and soaking her pants in the lounge chair. We watched the waves roll by, and I attempted to avoid getting my head bit off.

""So, we are going to southern Mexico instead of Cuba. There goes my cigar smuggling empire."" I flipped through the brochure. ""Let's see... they have a dolphin encounter.""

""No, those places keep dolphins in tiny swimming pools for tourists.""

""OK, glass blowing workshop?""

""No, it's Mexico. It's gonna be way to hot to anywhere near a furnace."" Rebecca said struggling to get the remaining alcohol out of her pineapple.

""Mayan ruins?""

""OH! Chichen Itza? I went there on senior trip. It was amazing!"" Finally after struggling to try and get her to have a good time, I had found a winner.

""Uh... no. That one is near Cosumel, we are headed down near... Belize. This one is called Chac... chucky... Chac-cho-ben. Apparently that means... 'the Place of the Red Corn.'""

The excursion to the ruins cost $150, but we had our discount so I splurged a little bit to make her happy. We tried to have fun, and drank a little bit on the way. Watched a ventriloquist act and what seemed like high school production of some fan fiction of Guys and Dolls. We went to bed, after having the steward put the beds together, and when we woke up, the ship was already making its way into port.

The first thing we noticed was the smell. The water in the brochure had been crystal clear. But what greeted us at the pier looked and smelled like diarrhea. Apparently the seaweed blooms had somehow gone bad, and mountains of rotting plant life washed up on the picturesque beach every day. We held our noses and scurried past the welcome sign and triggered the most elaborate tourist trap I've ever seen.

The little brightly colored shops huddled up in a small shopping plaza past customs at the end of the pier. A row of parrots and flamingos danced to entice children to get their parents to pay to go through the rope bridge aviary that snaked through the trees above us. Some Mayan entertainers danced and did acrobatics around a pole, as a mariachi band played in the swim up bar.

Due to her desperate need of chachkies, Rebecca wandered off to shop a while. With everything to see, I admit I lost track of time. Before I knew it, we were late to meet with the van that was going to drive us out to the ruins. I power walked through the crowds calling for Rebecca, and asking very friendly people who spoke broken English if they had seen her.

I gave upon trying to find her and headed toward our pickup location. I was going to tell them that I had misplaced my wife, when I heard...

""There he is! Sorry, thanks so much for waiting.""

For the first time in recorded existence Rebecca had shown up early to an event. And I was the one that was holding up the show. Clearly she was very excited to go see those piles of rocks in the jungle. Our guide Esmeralda cheerfully greeted me and lead us down a gravel path to a hidden parking lot. We hopped in the nondescript van, where another family sat in the bench seats.

As we exited the tourist trap, we passed several gates in high fences topped with razor wire. Apparently a lot of effort goes into keeping those precious tourists safe. To keep us entertained Esmeralda knelt in the front passenger seat as we drove along the boring jungle roads. She showed us pictures of animals and trees that could be found in the surrounding bush. And taught us enough about the Mayan language to try and sell us some fancy bracelets with our names on them.

I don't know exactly what happened. Suddenly the van was rolling on it's side and the whole world turned dark green. I saw sweet Esmeralda with her laminated pictures tumble half way out the driver side window. A long trail of blood shooting out of the driver’s mouth. I closed my eyes, but I’ll never forget her screams as she realized the van was crushing her… and the she was gone.

We lay there stunned sinking the muck of some pool warm ooze. Several men jumped up on the side of the van. I was able to get a hold of one of the men and tried to fight him off, but I was still buckled into my seat. The man slipped away as Rebecca yanked me back down in her panic.

The young father behind me cradled his wife’s head and begged her to wake up. The young lady’s neck had been twisted at an awkward angle in the crash, and their daughter was screaming.  Rocks beat at the remaining windows and they shattered down in a rain of tempered glass.  Then the strange men poked at us with long metal spears that had needles on the end.  They jabbed the needles deep into our arms and legs.  Immediately I could feel the numbness of some sort of poison taking hold.

The men backed off, and struggled to get free.  I pulled out my phone to call 911, and my fingers went numb as I remembered the phone was in airplane mode.  My tongue got dry, and I fell over into the driver’s lap.  I lost consciousness looking up at his dead eyes and broken jaw.

I awoke. Which I will say did come as a pleasant surprise. I was going to die right there in that van.  I opened my eyes, and blinked at the darkness around me.   Several soft points of light twinkled far above me. My hands were tied to a stone carving of a jaguar above my head. As I sat there I realized I could feel someone pressed up against my back.  The smell of Rebecca's shampoo let me know it was her.

“Becca, you awake?” I asked as I rocked us back and forth.

I listened carefully for any response, but all I heard in the darkness was her gentle breathing and a strange slurping sound coming from the ruins around us. I held my breath there in that dark place. My eyes began to adjust and I thought I could see long white shapes slowly sliding down the bricks.

“Oh FUCK this!” I said as I tried to stand, my legs were all pins and needles and I flopped back and forth on my knees.  I was able to work the rope that hung in the stone carving loose. And Rebecca and I tumbled to the floor as one of those things rared up inches from her face.  I kicked it away but there was another, out my reach and slowly easing up her leg.

Rebecca moaned as slime coating the strange worm glistened off the flesh of her leg.  The end of the thing started pulsating slowly, and I could hear the teeth digging and chewing.  Rebecca lay there in a daze, not responding.  I kicked at the worm things that tried to inch closer to me, one even dropped from the ceiling onto my calf.  The slime off it’s skin started to numb my lower leg.

I knew at that point we were meant to be food for these things.  Those men, could watching from the shadows, saving that young father and his little girl for tomorrow’s meal.  I shook Rebecca as hard as I could, we had to get free, we had to get out of there.  I got no response.

I clawed at the ropes around my wrists as the chewing things crawled closer. I could see them writhe under Rebecca’s shirt.  The numbness in my hands made it impossible to work the knots. And the rope was to strong to break by hand. In my panic only one sickening idea came to mind. I wasn’t going to be able to drag her out of there, and I need to somehow, get out, get help.

I stood up, dangling Rebecca’s hands on stone floor beneath me.  The starlight from the open shaft above us made the outline of her dainty fingers barely visible. With a scream of disgust at what was planning, I raised my heel and brought it down hard on those thin fingers.

Rebecca’s eyes shot open and she started to wail as I brought my heel down again on her hands.  Breaking the delicate bones of her wrists and arms, I pulled at the rope. The worm things crawled up her neck and latched onto her cheek.  That horrible chewing and sucking sound came out of her mouth as it ate through her face.

I stopped my wife’s hands into bloody ruins as she looked up at me and screamed. I got the rope free, and hooked my hands into the stone jaguar’s mouth.  Then I pulled myself up. The white creatures wriggled across the floor where I had stood just a moment before.  And Rebecca's screaming started to waver and fade to sobs, then silence.

I struggled up the shaft, inch my inch.  Pressing my legs against one wall and my back against the other, I climbed in the darkness.  Every muscle of my body quivering from strain I finally found myself at the top of a plant covered hill. I stood there in the middle of the jungle, and spun around.  I didn’t see any signs of civilization. I checked my pocket, and thankfully my phone was still there.

I clicked it on, and swiped airplane mode off.  No signal. The moon was near the horizon, I guessed which way was east, and struggled through darkness of the jungle in search of that long highway where everything had gone wrong."

Turns out the interviewers really only cared about C#. They asked me to rate myself on my C# skills, and I said 2/5, and then fairly expectedly did poorly on the questions regarding the intricacies C#.

My parents asked about the interview and I admitted I did poorly. Big mistake. Now they won't shut up about how I can ""improve"" my interview skills. My dad said I shoulda acted like an Indian and rated myself 5/5, even if I didn't know C# well. My mom said that I should have really emphasized my ability to learn. I basically said something along the lines of ""2/5, used it a bit but never learned it throughly, willing to learn"". Apparently that wasn't good enough and I should have given my entire life story about previous experiences where I had to ""learn things on the job"" and then explain that it ""demonstrated a strong ability to learn"".

\- It seems that there are more JAVA jobs than Javascript jobs for backend developers. (I'm more interested in backend development).

Bank Cons  
\- According to previous interns, I would be expecting lots of overtime.  
\- They pay slightly less than the startup.

Startup Pros  
\- Good, diverse culture. They don't seem to have any overtime problems.   
\- I report directly to the CTO. I will have more responsibility and more control over what I do.

Startup Cons  
\- I lowkey don't believe in the company's products, but I do not think that they would be in any financial trouble in the near future.  
\- Most big corporations (bigN, financial firms etc.) seem to prefer C++, JAVA experience over Javascript experience, which is more popular with startups. (I might be wrong, but it is my observations from browsing hundreds of job ads.)

I'm mainly concerned about which internship would be more beneficial in getting a full-time job once I graduate, and which internship would be better for future job growth. It's been bothering me for quite some times and I appreciate any advice or opinion.  Thank you very much!"

I am a CS undergraduate with one out of four years left to complete my B-Tech course. I don't know if this is the right subreddit for this but basically I can't decide what I would like to do in the future. I am contemplating taking the GRE for further studies in the US, but for some reason, I want to have some kind of experience in France. First, I thought that I must look for masters programs in France but many of my French friends advised against it. So, I figured I must at least try to find an internship there for my last semester. I don't know about other colleges, but in my college, the final semester is meant to be completely devoted to either a project or an internship. I do, as a matter of fact, have quite a bit of internship experience but I have no idea on what reliable information to go by for internships in France. I come to you, thus, searching for any research based internships in AI/ML/Deep Learning or more preferably, Natural Language Processing in France, either late this year or early 2021 for about 5-6 months. Please provide some guidance if you can. Pls DM if you have an opportunity!

Thanks!"

By the time my work term ends I’m projected to save $15K with about $2K of that in a Tangerine TFSA Investment Fund. I am currently in about $40K of student debt (engineering major).

I know very little about personal finance but am starting to adopt a mindset of saving/living frugally and making my money work for me. I have a few questions:

1. Should I take more student loans this year? The federal government doubled the amount of grants offered this year due to COVID.

2. Should I invest more money into my TFSA? If so, roughly how much as a percentage of my savings should I put into it. Obviously this hinges on whether I take more loans this year (which I’m leaning towards).

3. Are there any glaring issues with my approach or better ways for me to invest my money?

Thank you for all the suggestions!"

Wrong to still push for raise?",glassjoe92,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/h7pdgn/was_promised_a_sitdown_to_discuss_a_raise_prior/,"Alright, there's a lot going on here and things have been crazier than ever regarding work. I want more money but there's so many office politics and things at play that I'm not sure I'm right to bring this up again.  
  
I started as an intern and was offered a Social Media job out of college for $35,000. I left on good terms to work abroad for a year. They invite me back to a new position as Content Creator (videography, photography, motion graphics, graphic design, and video editing) and I manage to get a slight pay bump to $40,000. Work diligently for a year and become a vital part of a new department that makes them a lot of money.  
  
They hire a coworker to the same position after my old one leaves (old one, an intern when I'd left to work abroad, was at $43,000 when he quit). New guy is straight from college with no experience or job history and is making $45,000. I find this out around the end of my first year back and am outraged. I've trained this kid and picked up his slack while he learned the ropes.  
  
Outraged that the coworker is making more fresh out of college, I asked for a one-year review in September, tell them what I want to be responsible for, projects I'd like to take on, and find data averaging 3 similar intermediate-level job salaries in my city (niche position) to justify that I want $60,000.  
  
I don't think this is unreasonable because I earn the company much more than that with my work. They also pay another coworker that does nearly the same work (video editor only) and has the same amount of experience as me $70,000. I have the same exact type of projects regularly delegated out to me. Without sounding pompous, I truly believe that I produce higher-quality work more efficiently, I also certainly use a broader skill set and am more self-sufficient as I can do all the parts that she'd normally have to ask for help with externally (graphic design, advanced motion graphics, anything that needs to be done in something like Photoshop or After Effects).  
  
Anyhow, I get a review and am told to wait until December to discuss financial compensation. That ends up happening in early March. They bring me up to $45,000. Not bad, but I told them that I am quite intent on somewhere closer to $60,000. Boss says he, CEO, and I will sit down for a meeting to discuss it.  
  
My coworker quits after only 9 months the following week for a job that pays $65,000 and lets him work remote. He was poached by a previous employee. Anyhow, $45,000 back in the coffers from his salary. I assume his responsibilities (and still am three months later).  
  
Soon after, COVID hits and the meeting between me, my boss, and the CEO is quickly forgotten. It sucks because it was supposed to be the Monday of the first week they closed the office. Nonetheless, I continue to work diligently, doing work meant for two people, and have gotten public compliments from two of my bosses (one is a partner in the company), and the CEO. They and the clients have been over the moon with what I've been doing, so that's nice to hear and it's been said on company-wide check-in calls we were having.  
  
My girlfriend gets into grad school in a city three hours away. I aim to follow her. I give company notice that I'll be moving in August and would like to work remotely and come in once a week to do in-person jobs. They agree since everyone has been doing really well working remotely.  
  
Now, I want to know if it's wrong to bring up my salary again. It was basically forgotten after COVID. I know they just allowed me to work remotely with some travel. That being said, I've gotten tons of compliments and have been doing my work just as well as I would in the office. Moreover, my coworker quit and I have picked up his slack for months now. Any advice would be appreciated."

My background is in statistics, and I recently obtained my first data internship. My knowledge of how to productionalize things is limited.

My company does a lot of data processing in Excel. Since I work for a small nonprofit and we hire a lot of youth, we normally don't push programming languages on them. However, I have R experience. I wrote a wrapper function that can automate a common pre-processing step in one of our workflows. The script takes in a .csv and applies some data cleaning steps, revisions of certain column names, etc.

So my question is, **is there any way to move my R script into production without forcing my colleagues to learn and download R**?

I am (vaguely) aware of web apps like Shiny and container applications like Docker. How difficult would it be to host the script on the company website as an I/O web app?

BACKGROUND: My local computer is Linux. Our db backend is hosted by Azure. We have an agile software development team in charge of the website. I would need to work with them to integrate anything in the website. My main language is R but I am open to Python solutions."
h7qfwh,2,2020-06-12,Startup Internship Concerns,SCG414,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/h7qfwh/startup_internship_concerns/,"So I just started learning iOS development and decided to apply to internships yesterday. I didn't really expect to get an internship with anyone, especially this late in the semester, but I wanted to at least try and get experience with the interview process. So I applied to this really small startup (1-10 people) on AngelList and I just got matched with them today. Here's my problem:

\- This is an unpaid internship

\- Their job description says ""Interns will have responsibility and opportunity to develop the app from the ground up working closely with management""

\- The description also says ""Self-starter, ability to work on your own without management""

\- The company also doesn't have a website yet, which I don't know if I should actually be concerned about since it's a startup 

Under the circumstances that I actually do get an internship with this company, should I accept it? I've read a few stories here where a startup will make an unpaid intern be solely responsible for a task that a paid employee should be doing, without any guidance. What's the likelihood that I could be getting scammed?"

Senior year grades for RD can be important.

h7uhlt,0,2020-06-12,Engineering Student That Has Shit Job With Shit Pay,engineeringstudentth,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/h7uhlt/engineering_student_that_has_shit_job_with_shit/,"TL;DR: Engineering student went to 2 different countries for engineering struggling to find a decent job with decent pay.




For a background I'm an engineering student in Kansas, to make matters worse, this isn't my first rodeo, I've already taken engineering for a long extent in a 3rd world country, didn't finish the degree, moved to the US and tried to transfer over the classes I took and they told me that wouldn't work. So here I am starting all over again and almost halfway done with my electrical engineering degree.

Okay now for the fun part: I haven't worked any jobs in the US so my resume is absolutely fucked for the most part, so when I started working jobs they were a service greeter at a car dealership and random cleaning jobs to make ends meet. Now here's where it becomes better for me, I work as an electronics tech at a random company that fixes airplane power supplies. I was like cool, something finally close to what I actually like. They even have an engineering department which I asked multiple times if I can intern there and I haven't really got a straight forward answer. Actually I'm still ""waiting"" on a response back from the head of engineering and this is more than 2 years over now. 

When I got into the job I was so stupid and put in a low asking pay, so they were ""nice"" and added a $1 on top of that (this is hourly rate btw), so I was like cool, this is nice, I've been there 2 years now got bumped $4 more, however, within my first month of being there I discovered I was being shafted and that I was getting paid less than everyone else for essentially the same job (which I was excelling and even better at) so I was pretty pissed and then figured by review time I'd get the pay which they get (which is considerably lower than the nation's average which I've come to know).


Come review time I get a nice bump after 3 months (actually about 6 months cause their review process is slow) which is $3 then after the 1 year mark (actually 1.5 year mark) I get an extra $1. Now I'm thinking I'm pretty close to what everyone else gets paid (I'm the most senior person in the shop now). No I was wrong after talking to a coworker I realize that even with that bump I'm not even close to what they make. Which is really disappointing.


For the last year I've been applying to other jobs, now having a year experience under my belt and I had no interviews whatsoever, now I am in the same job 2 years+ experience AND still no replies back from any kind of company. I'm really disappointed that my experience and my schooling has not helped me get a better paying job. Or anything different really, to add salt to the wound a coworker of mine is offered a job in another department with twice my pay.

I'm not sure what to do now, and I've exhausted a lot of my options. I want to know what you guys think. I've been thinking it's cause of my name that no one wants to hire me, because it sounds weird or some shit. I'm really lost, cause I think I deserve a better pay and that working hard doesn't actually pay off or do anything."

It moved virtual and got cut down to 9 weeks, and this is the first time they've done internships virtual so there's the normal issues. Things have been pretty slow so far, a lot of environment setup; I've only actually edited about six lines of code, and it was just changing a variable. I've been spending a lot of my time on the companies internal learning platform watching videos on skills that seem useful for the job, but there's only so many tutorial videos I can watch (and some of the speakers are REALLY dull.) 

Today (Friday) I clocked out at 3 (start at 9; most of my team is an hour behind me) since it was pretty clear there was nothing for me to do. Left my room to play some video games, encountered my older sister who's doing her own internship this summer with Boeing (she's industrial engineering; she interned with them irl last summer too) who started giving me shit about clocking out early and being away. I asked her if it would be better to just sit in front of the computer for two hours playing games on my phone not doing anything, and she basically said yes, they expect me to work eight hours a day, and the fact that I haven't been given any work to do is irrelevant; she said interns are expected to ""fill their own time."" For the record I still worked about 35 hours this week (not including lunch), so not a big gap. 

I'd actually love to do some real work, but this is my first internship (and job in general) and with it being remote I don't really know what's expected of me. I feel it would be kind of dishonest to make them pay me for time I spent playing on my phone/watching tv shows/etc. I don't really need the money, since I live at home and don't have any expenses, I just want some real world experience.

Is my sister right? Looking for some general advice.

Tldr: Got yelled at by sister for clocking out early even though I had nothing to do. Do I really need to ""work"" eight hours when I haven't been given any way to actually work for eight hours?"

I am graduating with my BS in CS this December (although I will be done with classes and exams in November).

My main question is: **when should I start applying to jobs so that I have a job come January or February 2021?**

Other questions:

When should I have my resume ready by?

What should I do to prepare for coding challenges and interviews? What should my timeline look for that preparation?

When should I make sure my GitHub is all nice and polished by? What should I do to make sure it is as polished as possible? How many projects should I have on it?

How do I get a CS-related job in this economy as a new college grad? I'm honestly down for either data science or software engineering.

Edit: Also, how many programming languages should I make sure I can code in for an interview? I tend to just stick to Python even though I have experience in others, and while that worked for internship interviews, I am worried it won't fly for a full-time position"
h7wvuh,1,2020-06-12,Help with choosing a monitor,honeysenpai,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/h7wvuh/help_with_choosing_a_monitor/,"I’m looking to build a PC in the next year, but am going to get a monitor now as an external for my summer internship (coding so want lots of screen space) and finishing school. So I would prefer a monitor that would translate well to a pc build that handles light gaming (League, Valorant) as well as productivity. 

Are there any recommendations on what kind of specs I should be looking for? I definitely think I want 27” for more screen space and with that probably 1440p. However I’m not sure if I should even be looking at super low refresh rates or anything past 75hz."

h7xq3g,1,2020-06-12,Would it be shitty of me to quit my job?,awkWardNerdweed,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/h7xq3g/would_it_be_shitty_of_me_to_quit_my_job/,"So I work a seasonal job at a state park and this is my 2nd season at this particular park (started this season on May 16). I told my boss I would need to be part time because I was hoping to get an internship, and he said he was fine with it. I told him I was for sure okay with working weekends, and would add a couple weekdays if I got the internship. 

Well I got the internship (yay!) and am working 20 hrs a week there. When I told him about the internship, he said ""well we'll see if this works out."" I was confused because he already knew I would most likely only be working weekends when he hired me, so it was a weird sudden change. My coworker mentioned he told her he was thinking about letting me go to hire someone full time. He had not mentioned this to me at all...

Additionally, this all happened right after I participated in some BLM protests in my city. I noticed my boss unfriended me immediately after I posted pictures of the protest (which i realize it was stupid of me to have my boss on fb to begin with). He's a park ranger, so technically a law enforcement officer, so I imagine he's not thrilled about me going out and protesting the police. I couldn't help but notice that his sudden desire to fire me and hire someone full time (after previously being ok with me being part time) came a couple days after I attended those protests... but maybe I'm just being paranoid and cynical. 

Regardless, I hate this job, I'm already getting exhausted from working 4 days a week at the internship and the other 3 at the park. The internship is paid, so I can make enough to cover rent and such, I would just not have much extra to add to savings. But I do have a couple thousand saved in case of emergency. I just would feel bad about the fact I told my boss I could definitely do weekends, and then deciding to quit even though I don't really have a good reason to, other than ""I don't like working here."" I just feel like I made a commitment to stay for the summer and I should keep that commitment, but also I don't feel valued here and actively hate every second of being here. 

What would be the right decision in this situation? Should I suffer through a few months to keep my commitment to this job and make some extra money, or should I quit to save my sanity and make do with less money?"

Here is the fifteenth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?That's completely up to what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.

All the best,

h7yoaj,0,2020-06-12,[IWantOut] 26M Full Stack Developer Brasil -&gt; England/Ireland/Canada,azarathian94,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/h7yoaj/iwantout_26m_full_stack_developer_brasil/,"
      So this is my situation. I was born in Brazil but was raised in the United States from the ages of 6 all the way until I was 17. After that we lost our visa and had to move back or stay in the country illegally, since we didn't want to break any laws we chose to move back. It's been 8 years since I've been living in Brazil and... I hate it... I just do, and I'm not the only one. I've meet other people in Brazil that have also lived in first world countries like Canada, Portugal, England, etc that also had to come back for one reason or another and they don't like it here either. There's multiple reasons for this. But it's basically because the country's government is corrupt, everything costs a fortune and it's extremely dangerous place to live in general.

       I just graduated college as a Computer Science Major and started working for a Brazilian company as a Full Stack Developer making websites for the government. I've been working at this company for a year and a half. The first year as an intern and currently 6 months as a full time employee. I want to move to Canada, Ireland, England or any other fully English speaking country as a skilled worker in Web Development. I also wish to become a citizen of that country as soon as possible. 

       Since I lived in the USA at such a young age I'm fluent in the English language and English is my dominant language. I think, read, and write better in English than I do in Portuguese for example. Which is why I didn't mention moving to Portugal even though I speak Portuguese. 

       My hope is to be out of this country in the next 4 to 5 years. I plan to get a home office job getting paid in Euros, Pounds or Dollars to try to save up money faster than it would be if I'd be paid in Brazilian Real. Even if I get a job that only pays me 2 thousand dollars per month I'd still be making more money than almost anyone else I know. Which would help in the financial department. 

      But, other than investing in my career trying to make my resume appealing and saving up money, I don't know what to do...  I don't even know how I'd get a home office job outside of my country, what I would do after I have the money, what companies would accept foreign workers... etc...  etc.... 

      If you have any advice for me, it would be much appreciated. Websites I could look into, general advice for anyone that just recently moved to these countries, anything would be helpful. Thank you."

Hi everyone — 

Unfortunately I was laid off from my company due to the impact of COVID-19, along with almost 30% of the company. Scary times, but I am motivated to keep pushing forward. 

I took a “Customer Support” job after a few months of being unemployed. This is more of a glorified call center job where customers are calling in and my job is to help them with their issues. I am answering phone calls and doing tickets in a 24/7 support role. I don’t see much growth from this... but I need to pay the bills. 

My company I was working at was a SaaS based company that sold a low-code web development tool and also a live streaming tool. When I was initially hired, my title was “IT Support Specialist” and I did everything from providing internal support to the employees and being the “IT” guy. After about 5 months of learning the IT processes - they approached me and asked if I wanted to be a part of their Customer Software Support team, which would entail helping customers with their questions about the product. Since the IT was sort of slow, I figured I would take the opportunity. 

I had a training period where I learned the ins-and-outs of their SaaS product and master it. Master it enough to answer customer tickets, be on live chat support, hop on phone calls with the sales team. I REALLY enjoyed this. I enjoyed working with customers and representing the brand, helping different companies achieve their goals with their products. I also liked being pulled into calls with the Sales/Customer Success team as a “technical contact” to explain or demo the product. I wrote technical documentation for the software. Maintained relationships with customers on projects. 

I was able to collaborate with Engineering team and Development team when certain bugs came up on the software and pick up some basic HTML and CSS tricks along the way. I learned that the software was hosted on AWS and I really wanted to get AWS certifications to see if I can branch out and maybe help on the backend side.... but this all came to an end when I was laid off. 

My resume is very Desktop Support / IT Support heavy due to all the internships and part time stuff I did while I was in college. Once I got my degree in Computer Information Systems - I started at that SaaS company and began to realize that my love for IT Support wasn’t there anymore. 

I am trying to find a new role and getting contacted by recruiters, but they are for Help Desk positions. I am trying to break away from Help Desk and hopefully stay in the SaaS space. I was thinking about getting the AWS Cloud Practitioner and Azure Cloud Fundamentals certifications (I have a lot of downtime to study for these) to sort of beef up my resume. I am totally motivated to learn a programming language. 

Here is a mock resume to get an idea of my experience: https://imgur.com/gallery/oDUYFRg

Does anyone have any advice? I can PM you my LinkedIn. 

Any help is appreciated... I’m going through a rough time right now."

h80kyf,1,2020-06-13,Is my [22F] boyfriend [22M] okay?,ThrowRA2008001,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/h80kyf/is_my_22f_boyfriend_22m_okay/,"We’ve been together about a year now and I really love him. 

For the past several months, he’s been waking up randomly in the middle of the night with nightmares. He said that he always has these dreams where he’s chained or drowning and similar things. In general, he hasn’t slept a full night without waking up a single time for any reason in a very *very* long time. 

Past that, he never wants to talk about it. We both just graduated college, and when we met, he was incredibly ambitious, but it caused a lot of stress for him as well. He achieved most of his goals but I don’t think that’s done anything to calm him down. 

Not really. Personally, I’ve noticed that this all started in September after he had some sort of “what now” crisis.

He spent all of his freshman through junior year recruiting for internships and that kind of thing. Once he got a full time job offer, he had what I can only describe as a panic attack about how he had nothing left to do. That’s around when all this started.

He says he’s fine, but clearly he’s not right?

I’m just worried for him since his job that he’s starting in July is supposed to be extremely stressful with incredibly bad hours."
h80obv,1,2020-06-13,My mom essentially told me that I'll always be disabled,sonofdofus,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/h80obv/my_mom_essentially_told_me_that_ill_always_be/,"For years she has been emotionally abusive, whether that be from her bipolar disorder or alcoholism she has said some of the worst things imaginable. I really hoped she changed, my Dad got a new job and they moved about 8 months ago. I tell myself that she's dealing with mental disorder and it's difficult but I just can't convince myself of that anymore. She has cost the family thousands of dollars in repairs, wrecked two cars, has 3 DUIs, been separated from her kids by social services, and been put in a psych ward multiple times.

She lives in a new town, does absolutely nothing all day, and wonders why she barely has any friends. Constantly complaining to my Dad that he only cares about his job. She stopped drinking but all she does is sleep every day. She does take Bipolar medicine by the way, she acts like she doesn't so I don't know which kind. But these last few days mark the final straw...

Two nights ago, I find myself in the kitchen for a late night snack. Hearing yelling, I step closer to my parents bedroom and I hear drunken angry slurs coming from her. From what I'm aware of she hasn't drank since her last DUI about a year and a half ago. And she promised me she wouldn't drink again. Low and behold, I start hearing the drunk, my mom, start hitting my father in bed. I debated whether or not to burst in for a few seconds because I know I'll just end up making it worse but I still barged in nonetheless. After threatening to call the police for domestic violence, she said she'd call them herself. The slurred speech from that phone call alone would be great evidence against her anyways. But, my Dad has a prominent role in the community and could be fired simply from her badmouthing him alone. So despite, multiple people being able to accuse her we still can't call the police. So she locked herself in the bedroom and luckily didn't call the police.

Moving onto today, I get back home from my internship where I work alongside my Dad and decide to take a 20 min power nap. Soon after, I wake up to my mom screaming at my younger sister (17), I honestly expect it at this point because they both barely know how to control themselves. However, there was a lot more door slamming than usual so I finally got up. Upon entering the living room, I find her arguing with my Dad while he's in the recliner, get even more pissed, and proceed to try to choke him. Emphasis on try, but the point is she's still trying to attack him so I intervened. I pulled her back, and now she's threatening me for getting involved and hitting a woman. In the time since then she has stolen every set of car keys, shoes, and the tripod I'm supposed to use for work tommorow (there may be more but who knows at this point). She also ripped up a $500 check of mine, I had cashed it weeks ago, but still. Told me I'm a bastard child and that's why I have blonde hair when everyone else in my family has brown, it's widely know in my family she cheated on him once before. All the while, humming to herself as if this is just a blissful trip through a meadow for her. There's a whole lot more but let me finally get to what I referenced in the title.

I have volkmann's contracture and compartment syndrome in my right arm, and being a communications major typing has become more of an issue as I go into more writing-based classes. Recently my Dad has been trying to look into getting it fixed through surgery and now have an appointment with a prominent expert on the condition to see if surgery is possible on Monday. Well after stealing my car keys my Mom gave them back saying we can use it to get to my appointment. After handing them to me, she says ""it's not like it's going to do anything, you're wasting your time"" and that it's ""a waste of money"". 

Look I wasn't super optimistic in the first place, even the first doctor we visited said I was a rare case being 20 yrs old with the condition. And that only twenty doctors countrywide could even remotely deal with my disability. But to hear it from my own mother just broke me.

Tommorow morning she plans on going to work with us just to simply embarrass us in front of everyone, honestly I hope she does so I can just call her out and my Dad can be rid of this woman without backlash from the community. I'm 20 yrs old and I am sick and tired of this woman being hell-bent on destroying whatever makes others happy. My mother is a Monster."

I saw firsthand over the course of 4 years how much my sister needed my parents’ mere presence, despite just living 1 hr 30 mins away from us (she graduated from TAMU last month). Obviously cost plays a huge role as well, but, at least for my first 4 years, I would like to stay relatively close to my parents and my younger sister. 


-Demographics:

• Male

• Hispanic, white

• middle class-my younger sister and I are still dependent of my dad, while my mom stays at home to take care of us. 

• competitive public school with (as of 5th semester) 1,009 classmates. The area we reside in may be classified as upper middle class white suburban, with a noticeable hispanic presence. 

• 1st generation immigrant-born in mexico, moved here when I was 9. I would be the second in our family to attend college in the US. 



-Intended Major

• Political Science (I intend to attend law school)
(Likely a minor in economics)


-Academics

• GPA: (as of the end of 6th semester) 3.65 unweighted, 4.55 (out of 6.0) weighted 

• Rank: Won’t know until September, but I’m assuming somewhere between 19-16% 

Also worth noting that, since the initial release of class rank at the end of freshman year, I’ve risen over 250 spots. 

• Freshman Year: (counting only advanced classes)
-PreAP (Honors): Geometry, English I, World Geography 

• Sophomore Year:
-AP’s: Spanish IV, European History, World History 
-PreAP: English II

• Junior Year:
-AP’s: APUSH, English III, Human Geography, Psychology, Statistics, Spanish V

• Senior Year: 
-AP’s: English IV, Government, Economics, Environmental Science
-Dual Credit (through the local community college): College Algebra (only second semester though)

—13 AP Classes, 1 Dual Credit, 4 PreAP classes 



-Standardized Testing

• SAT: 1400, will take again on August and September, *possibly October but doubtful.

I will also take the ACT in September, aiming for a 29-32

Planning on taking either the US History Subject Test or the Spanish Speaking and Writing Subject Test in October, aiming for a near, if not perfect score, in either of those. 



-Extracurricular Activities/Awards (because there’s not many lol)

• Member of Interact Club (community service club) for all 4 years, lettered.

• Member of Journalism National Honor Society as a Junior and Senior, lettered 

• Member of the school’s academic Journalism Team as a sophomore and senior

• AP Ambassador as a sophomore 

• Member of the school’s academic social studies team as a junior and senior

• Staff writer for the school newspaper as a Junior

• Section Editor for the newspaper as a senior

• National Honor Society member since Junior Year

• AP Scholar 

• Won a bronze medal (lol) as a junior for my performance in the social studies academic team, and a silver for Journalism as a Sophomore.

• Held a job from Fall 2019-now at Kroger as a bag boy. I’m choosing not to apply for internships or jobs over the summer because of corona and heavily studying for the SAT and ACT, but I will seek an internship with my township magazine or newspaper once the school year begins.

• Member of Model UN as a Senior, plan on lettering 

• Member of Rho Kappa (Social Studies NHS) as a Junior and Senior, lettered 

• Member of Spanish Club as a Senior, plan on lettering 

• Gold Award for the 2019 National Spanish Exam 

• Have personally volunteered to tutor kids in my area (most have ended up being children of my mom’s friends, lol) mostly in math and reading, over the past two years.

• If it’s of any worth, I’ve also been writing a book that I’m nearly done with. In serious terms, I’ve worked on this personal project of mine over the last 3 years, but in all honesty this has been something on my mind since I was roughly 11. I would love to be published, but I’m unsure and honestly fearful of others taking advantage of me or my situation. Who knows, maybe this coming year. As for the plot, I like to think it mixes elements of vigilantism, family issues, and racial and economic tension/inequality, to be as vague as possible.



-As for letters of recommendation, I plan on asking my teacher from AP World/Euro, who also happens to be my social studies coach. I’m pretty close with him as I was one of the only sophomores to take his Euro class, and we’ve had a good relationship since. He’s one of the most recognized high school history teachers in the country, too.

Then there’s also my amazing journalism and newspaper teacher (also my academic coach), who I’ve grown to be very close with.

Possibly also is my English teacher from sophomore year. She very much respected me and loved me as I was really the only student of hers that year that took the class seriously, never talked, and always got 100s on essays. I also served as an office aid for her (class helper) this past semesters. If I’m being honest, the main reason I would include her is because she’s a UT alumni, if that could help me at all.



-As far as schools go,

(In no order)

• UT Austin

• Texas ATM 

• Baylor University 

• Rice University

• Trinity University


As for reach (not that some of the others aren’t) out of state schools, I plan on possibly applying to 

• University of Michigan

• Boston College

• Vanderbilt

What else do I need to learn to get hired and how?,celestialDuality,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/h815f7/help_i_dont_know_how_to_do_anything_other_than/,"I graduated with my bachelor's in CS about 2 years ago and am currently working an entry-level job mostly unrelated to my degree. What's been causing me to put off leaving is the fact that while I'm competent at the act/principles of programming itself given any language and enough time to learn it, I've never been properly educated on the other stuff you'd need to know in order to competently code in a professional environment.

I have no experience with version control, for instance. I don't know how to operate GitHub, don't understand how that fits into the overall workflow of coding with other people, etc. My code's always functional and robust but style and layout-wise I don't know if it's just gonna make my coworkers hate me. 

I have no meaningful portfolio anywhere. My latest project was a 10,000-line script coded in a proprietary language and its functionality would be completely undemonstrable to anyone working outside my current company, so it's not like I could show that to anyone.

And on top of it all I'm sure there's at least another hundred things I'd have to learn on top of that that I'm not even aware of right now.

So for those of you that have gone through this too, how did you land your job? What would you say is the best way to approach my situation? Is it an internship? YouTube tutorials? Writing personal projects expressly to build a portfolio? I just need some direction toward finally putting my degree to good use, feeling a bit overwhelmed with how much more stuff it seems I need to learn and am hoping for a proper course of action.

I was wondering if anyone had some advice on how to do well in EE 461L ( Software Design Lab). I have heard from others that it is largely a group project-based course and  deals heavily with front- end development.

&amp;#x200B;

Just for background info, I'm a rising junior and have satisfied the pre-reqs for this course, but the majority people I have largely asked regarding their experiences have been seniors.  Unfortunately, my internship this summer focus heavily on C/C++ , client-server protocols, and a little bit of Kubernetes and AWS so I don't know if I should wait another semester to take EE 461L after taking an online course on edX or Coursera on JS or Node.js.

I feel that I might just be dead weight in my hypothetical group since I have only been exposed to a little bit of HTML and CSS in high school, but have no technical experience whatsoever dealing with Javascript or Node.js, or any other front-end development technologies.  I don't want to be the guy that contributes to nothing in a potential group setting, as this will just make me feel terrible and anxious on how my hypothetical group members perceive my working habits.

What should I do?

Thank you so much!"

I am a student at a high ranking Indian Institute and have not yet given the GRE, TOEFL or IELTS(Coronavirus and associated social distancing is hindering all of this), but I am planning on giving it asap.

**Objective:** I am aiming to get a funded(with scholarship/studentship) position at Cambridge, UCL, Oxford, Edinburgh, Manchester.

I will try to provide as complete a background as possible

**My Background:**

1. 8.0/10.0 CGPA in an Indian Institute(well known, wont name it here because I’m anonymous). I graduate in 2021 so I still have 2 semesters to pick this up higher.(The official cutoff is 7.3/10.0 for Indians).
2. I have 3 co-authored papers(a couple more coming up soon) in very reputed international journals, 1 first author is currently submitted(this one also has a preprint, 2 more coming up soon) also in similarly reputed journals.
3. My co-authored research has been cited 10 times in the last 1 year, the preprint has also been mentioned in some institutional news outlets and recently also by the Government of India's twitter handle.
4. I have attended 10-15 conferences, with travel and accomodation bursaries, among these was a super prestigious International Union conference(with over 5000 participants) and on 2 occasions(last two) I have presented posters winning best poster in both, the first time among roughly 50 participants, and the next time in India's largest science conference among \~1000 participants.
5. I have recommendations from senior professors and PIs in Cambridge and have a couple more recommendations from very well known professors in India(in my institute and it’s sisters).
6. I have done computation and experiment and have had internships in Cambridge and in India(again within the Indian Institutes) on several niche topics in chemistry and materials science. By virtue of which I have first hand experience in several analytical, synthetic and computational tools that might come in handy in conducting research.
7. My thesis is likely to get a distinction or similar grade in the institute.
8. Extra Curriculars: I founded and chaired the Entrepreneurship Cell, Innovation Cell and Ranking committees of our institute. Furthermore I was elected to the student body recently and have been members in Drama, Music and Literature clubs in the past. I also work out a lot(on halt because of the lockdown) and am an avid swimmer.

**Regarding my GPA:** Our institute is notoriously hard to score well in, even though my transcripts are riddled with B,B+,C(and even Ds in math courses in which more than half the batch got an F), I literally tried y best in these courses while maintaining my research and writing papers, as well as taking care of extra curriculars. But I am worried if this will be noticed by the admissions committee at these universities.

As the COVID-19 pandemic rages my head is filling up with these questions and it would be nice to have a realistic, to-the-point understanding of what my chances are.

**My request:** Give me your 2 cents, as realistically as you can, based on your observations or experience in the past about ***my chances in getting admission and my competitiveness in scholarship/studentships***! **My target program is a PhD in Chemistry** I swear I can take it!

Any and every advice is welcome and will be heeded to(if possible)"

I have received two internship placement offers (6 months), and I have a hard time deciding which offer to accept. It's been bugging me for a while and I need some opinions from professionals to help me decide. Thank you in advance!

The first offer is from one of the biggest Chinese bank. Its tech stack is mainly in JAVA, Bootstrap/Angular.  
The second offer is from an expanding cryptocurrency startup (30 - 50 people, with offices in multiple countries). Its tech stack is mainly in Nodejs, TypeScript.

Bank Pros  
\- Possibility of a return offer  
\- It is a recognizable name. I might have an easier time to find full-time jobs.  
\- It seems that there are more JAVA jobs than Javascript jobs for backend developers. (I'm more interested in backend development).

Bank Cons  
\- According to previous interns, I would be expecting lots of overtime.  
\- They pay slightly less than the startup.

Startup Pros  
\- Good, diverse culture. They don't seem to have any overtime problems.  
\- I report directly to the CTO. I will have more responsibility and more control over what I do.

Startup Cons  
\- I lowkey don't believe in the company's products, but I do not think that they would be in any financial trouble in the near future.  
\- Most big corporations (bigN, financial firms etc.) seem to prefer C++, JAVA experience over Javascript experience, which is more popular with startups. (I might be wrong, but it is my observations from browsing hundreds of job ads.)

I'm mainly concerned about which internship would be more beneficial in getting a full-time job once I graduate, and which internship would be better for future job growth. It's been bothering me for quite some times and I appreciate any advice or opinion. Thank you very much!"

Context: I'm a 20 Year Old Computer Science student. My goal is to work in a company that has easy access to a (free/subsidized) gym and food. I'd like to work in  machine learning and tech.

My apologies if this post is very long. I would really appreciate some insight though. 

Everyone I meet seems to be very impressed by my resume, particularly the fact that I have a commercialised patent. It involved creating a machine learning model to detect Parkinson's disease using voice samples. We beat every other research done on that area, with far fewer resources used (which is why the company paid us for the rights to using the algorithm). 

However, I struggle to get CS  and internships while others seem to get it. I've asked my friends to share their resume, so that I can understand where I'm deficient, but I can't seem to figure it out. Objectively speaking what I've done is technically harder than what they did. But they seem to get work, while I don't (at companies). 

I don't seem to have problems getting research jobs. I was able to, with very little effort, able to convince a professor to allow me to assist him with his work in climate change modeling. But outside the sheltered walls of college, it seems as though I lack the ability to even swing an interview. 

I'm going to rework my resume to be less technical and more impact based. In compliance with the rules, I've posted my resume in the thread. 

Doing some reading, it seems as though DS and Visualization projects seem to be the trend. The thing I'm working on has been linked below. It doesn't seem like it's meaningful (it's just visualization of some Algorithms and DS). I'll constantly add to it. Feedback on that will be appreciated. But it feels to be too easy to truly be a great project that can swing me a job. So my question is , what does it mean to have a great CS project? What do I do to make this thing that I'm working on appealing to others. Am I just wasting my time with it?

I’m no longer seeing it worth it to drive an hour plus for 13/hr to do something I’m not happy with. This feeling is especially amplified after the work from home period has ended due to COVID restrictions being lifted and I have been asked to return to the office.

The training material for certifications (Network+ and such) is reserved for full time staff only and temp staff are exempt from company policies such as employees getting every other Friday off during the summer months.

Long-term, I definitely don’t want to continue providing mind-numbing support to tech-ignorant clients and set up computers forever or wait god knows how long until I’m converted to full time and put up with bad intern policies in the meantime.

It's kind of hitting me that I may be making a bad first impression by having not responded to these emails yet--especially, the one from a week and a half ago.

Ideally, I would like to get an entry level Data Engineer job, if not that, then a Backend Engineer job or a Data Analyst.

I have decent experience with SQL and Python from my internship (though my python still needs some work), some rudimentary unix and git knowledge too.

I am currently doing the Data Engineer track on Datacamp. It seems pretty easy so far, thought its pretty good for learning different technologies (surface level at least).

After the Data Engineering track, I plan to do: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-python-mega-course/.
The python project course and some projects on my own to improve on my python skills.

I read that backend engineering has a lot of overlap with data engineering, so its good to know some.
Django:https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/.

For Data Engineering theory and cloud practice, I plan on doing:
https://www.udemy.com/course/data-engineering-on-google-cloud-platform/ and https://www.udemy.com/course/sql-nosql-big-data-hadoop/.



My Questions are:
1)
Is this enough to land an entry level data engineering job?

2)The datacamp tracks delves into Scala and Spark a bit too.
Are there any others resources that I should look into? How important is knowing Scala, considering now Pyspark is almost as good as Scala Spark.

3)Should I spend more time learning Java or Scala? I'm worried I may be pigeonholing myself if I spent a lot of time on Scala, considering its not really used outside of DE and Java is among the most used language out there.

4) Is the web development course worth doing? I noticed an increasing amount of data engineers need to have a decent knowledge of this to present their final solutions to the business and for the business or the DS team to use.

5) Queuing and Streaming  systems such as Kafka and Spark Streaming. Not sure what the best way to learn this.
I guess:https://www.udemy.com/course/apache-kafka-for-beginners/

6) For SQL, can some recommend a more advanced course?
I know joins, aggregates, create and insert, subqueries. 
Not so good with window functions and DB theory

7) Am I missing any other resources . Any other tips/resources would be very appreciated.

Here's the deal, I am a recent graduate with a finance degree and some experience under my belt. ( Private Wealth Management intern, Financial consulting/ planning Intern, and I was recently working part-time as a Mergers and Acquisitions Analyst (Buy-side).

I was working at that part time job on my last year of university and was laid off due to Covid last week.

BUT, I recently was invited to a job interview coming up as a financial analyst at a non-profit. This is great because its the job I want!!

To give a bit more background, a 3rd party recruiter actually set the interview up, which is awesome. But she sort of threw me off with what she said. She had mentioned that the non-profit company wanted to meet me and have a zoom interview, although I was light on experience. ""Light on experience,"" is what really through me off. I thought I had some good experience, but apparently not.

How do I rock this interview thats coming up with that perception of me?"

h8p8pj,9,2020-06-14,Lenovo SR590 &amp; drives compatibility - intern needs help,Oldruid,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/h8p8pj/lenovo_sr590_drives_compatibility_intern_needs/,"Hi I'm intern at company and I was asked to propose how to improve a server (Lenovo SR590). Current server setup:

Lenovo ThinkSystem SR590 Server

  VMware server (ESXi 6.5 host), VMs will use Windows Server 2016

  2x Intel Xeon 4216 (16 cores per CPU)

  2x Lenovo (Seagate?) Exos 7E2000 Enterprise 2.5"" HDD 2TB 512N SAS | ST2000NX0433

  2x RAM 32GB Micron ECC REGISTERED DDR4 2Rx4 2933MHz PC4-23400 RDIMM | MTA36ASF4G72PZ-2G9

&amp;#x200B;

Here screenshot of parts from XCC:

[https://i.ibb.co/Nj7tQdD/IMG-20200609-132024.jpg](https://i.ibb.co/Nj7tQdD/IMG-20200609-132024.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

They want:

\- Windows 2016 licensed for every core

\- WSUS

\- RAID 5

&amp;#x200B;

I worked most of the time with PCs and not servers so I want to make sure that I won't do something stupid and I'd like to ask you to clear some stuff up for me:

1. What is this Thinksystem Lenovo drive (it came with the server)? I tracked part number (ST2000NX0433) and found Seagate drive that seems to have same specs. Is Lenovo making their own server drives or is this branding or something else?
2. Speaking of drives when I go to lenovo page I see these: [https://lenovopress.com/lp1048-thinksystem-sr590-server-xeon-sp-gen2#drives-for-internal-storage](https://lenovopress.com/lp1048-thinksystem-sr590-server-xeon-sp-gen2#drives-for-internal-storage) I have question about this list:

a) Can I only use in this server (SR590) drives, that are listed in the link above or can I use any drive I want?

&amp;#x200B;

Now they want this server to work as VMware server for robot simulation before it will be deployed in factory and this is what I want to add to the server with budget of 16 000 $. This is what I came up with:

NEW HARDWARE

RAM 1x 32GB Micron ECC REGISTERED DDR4 2Rx4 2933MHz PC4-23400 RDIMM | MTA36ASF4G72PZ-2G9

6 x 32 GB	6 \* 266	$	=	1596	$

Total RAM (including what is already in the server)	256 GB

Seagate Exos 7E2000 Enterprise 2.5"" HDD 2TB 512N SAS | ST2000NX0433

6 x 2.5	6 \* 225	$	=	1350	$

Total HDD (including what is already in the server) 16 TB

&amp;#x200B;

NEW SOFTWARE

Esxi (HyperV 6.5)

ESXi Essential + 3ys	1 \* 700	$	=	700	$

Windows Server 2016 Datacenter (for 2 Xeon 4216)

32 cores	2 \* 6 155	$		12310	$

&amp;#x200B;

    TOTAL		=	15956	$  BUDGET		=	16000	$  

Does this look solid for you? I'm not sure about HDD it looks mediocre at best. Should I buy less storage space but use SSD instead? And should I use thinksystem lenovo drive or can I use something different?"

So I'm a Full Stack JavaScript Development student and in my education you need apply to companies to get a 6 month internship which will hopefully lead to a job offer from said company. I've only managed to get a positive response from two different startups. 

The first one has the tech stack I want: react, node &amp; python. However, they're a younger company so their developers sit in Romania, and I sit in Scandinavia, meaning that I fear that I'd probably not get the proper couching and help that I need from them. 

The second company is also a startup, but they've been around for a little bit longer and they seem to be more structured and I'd also get to actually sit at the office, which is something which is important to me. However, their tech stack isn't anything I am used to. I would have to learn C# + .NET, + Razor + RavenDB, and I don't even seem to be finding appropriate help online for that tech stack(does JS have a friendlier community?)  

What would you have done in my situation? Stick with the languages I like but at a worse company or try to learn something completely different and seemingly extra hard for a better company?"
h8vfqz,5,2020-06-14,New job opportunity for more money but love current job,reddygirlgone,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/h8vfqz/new_job_opportunity_for_more_money_but_love/,I am currently working and I absolutely love it. Love the people and my team and my manager and what I do. I have been working there for 1.3 years and am an engineer i even with a masters degree and a lot of internship experience. I am doing a ton of work and do that work really well and my manager definitely knows I do a lot. He assigns me big and important projects which I love but I also stay late to work which I don’t mind since I’m young and want to learn and do as much as possible. I know I am getting underpaid and I talked to my manager about this and he talked to hr and it didn’t go anywhere. I was bored on LinkedIn and applied to be a senior engineer at a similar company just to keep up interview practice as a long shot. During the interview process they bumped me down to an engineer ii and I thought there’s no way I’m going to take this job even though everyone I met with was really nice and the job would be everything that I’m currently doing which I really like. I just was offered the job and the salary is $20k more than what I’m making now which is around a 30% raise. My current company is currently not doing well profit wise because of covid and is on a hiring and promotion freeze. I have talked to my manager previously about being promoted since we have a good relationship and he seems like he would promote me soon but can’t make promises since we’re on a freeze and doesn’t think it’ll happen until at least 2021. I don’t know how I can say no to a 20k raise that would take me a while to get up to at my current company. But I love working there and my friends and team and the responsibilities. Should I just take this new position since it may be better in the long run?  Is it bad I’m leaving after only 1.3 years? Can I try to leverage this new job offer at my current company? What if I hate the new company since I wasn’t even able to tour the facility or meet anyone in person because of covid?

Was focused on Germany in the past, though I've been considering Ireland or The Netherlands and am open to other options. What are the steps I'll need to take to get out in my situation?

I have always loved accounting and have been an entrepreneurial individual. I also very much enjoy coding and building predictive models. I am proficient with R and advanced excel as well.

I'm just worried because most of these internships' application deadline is in the fall, so I won't have any credentials when I have to apply. 

I was planning on attending for the fall, but my school recently announced that everything will be online after thanksgiving, so I didn't feel like paying full tuition for zoom university. What are you guys' take on taking a gap semester in general? (My school generally doesn't do spring semester starts) Would companies raise eyebrows over this? Would it be worth it if I were to do my own projects and learn CS/Math topics during this time? I'm already old for my grade, so I'd be a little hesitant if this ends up costing my freshman summer opportunities.

I'm tired of people judging others for majoring in something ""useless"" or ""easy"" or ""low-paying"" while being completely ignorant of what others go through. So, to all the people who have majors that correlate to well-paying, specific entry-level jobs post-college and constantly berate others for trying to live THEIR lives, pay close attention.

1. Not everyone wants to do what you do. Do you ever think about that? We don't all want to be software engineers or nurses or business analysts etc. People have different interests and enjoy having the freedom to pursue those interests. If people want to study anthro, let them do it. If they want to study music, let them! Don't be an asshole. You would be surprised by all of the opportunities you don't know exist that people in the ""useless"" majors have that you could never dream of.
2. Not everyone has the aptitude for it. Yeah, I'm tired of hearing people tell others ""wHY diDN't yoU JuST do ENGinEEriNG?"" as if they know the person they are telling this to better than they know themselves. Stuff like that requires a higher level of understanding of math and science that not everyone can ""just do."" Just because it's easy for you or you are driven to succeed in it doesn't mean everyone else can. Forcing people into engineering or comp sci (for example) when they aren't good at math or coding only for them to get a 2.2 GPA and learn nothing and not get any internships because of their horrendous academic performance isn't going to do anyone any good.
3. Going off of the last point, just because someone isn't cut out for a certain major doesn't make them stupid. We are all different and we are all naturally good at different things. For example, I hate public speaking and being in front of people. I would be an awful performing arts/theatre major. Does that make me stupid? Of course not. I am not a big fan of working with kids all day. I know for a fact I would not be able to handle majoring in elementary education. Does not being able to handle the elementary ed curriculum make me a failure? No, it doesn't. Everyone has their own limitations and it's nothing to be ashamed of. I would like you to consider how well you would do if you were suddenly placed in a major like that.
4. Just because you think your major is ""hard"" that doesn't automatically mean everyone else's majors are ""easy."" I get it, especially as a science major myself. We tend to think that we are on more difficult path because of the coursework. However, that doesn't mean ours is harder, it just means it's hard in a different way. For instance, philosophy majors have to become really good at critical thought, which is an excellent skill to have and something most of us are severely lacking. Education majors have to become very knowledgeable in a subject area and be able to teach it to kids/teens/etc, which is something I think would be incredibly difficult. Classics majors, depending on the school, develop a high level of understanding of Greek and Latin and learn to write well in these languages, which is an amazing ability because writing in English is already hard enough. I encourage you all to check out the curriculums of these so-called ""easy"" majors.
5. Not everyone is motivated by money. Yes, money is good, I agree. However, there are people out there that want to pursue something they are passionate about and couldn't care less how much it paid. It is far better to study something you want to study and take a lower paying job and being happy with it than it is to study something just because ""it's going to get me money"" and then be miserable for the next 40 years of your life.
6. You don't have to go into the field that you majored in. I know this is gonna be a hard pill for all you specific entry level job majors to swallow, but it's true. You can take the skills you learned in any major and apply them broadly. If you know how to market yourself and you take advantage of the opportunities that are presented to you or the one's that you seek out, then you will be fine. Do you honestly think people don't have a plan? Yes, I am sure some don't, but the majority do have some sort of direction they are looking towards going and they have a college degree to help them out.

In conclusion, stop judging people for choosing what THEY want to do with THEIR college experience. All majors are respectable and offer something unique to the world. No major is useless and no major is easy and some people want more out of life than money. I can already see what the comments section is going to look like now: ""bUt maJOrInG in EnLIsH/tHEaTRe/mUSIc/PoliSCI/BioLOGy/whateverelsepeoplethinkisuselesswithoutgoingtogradschool Is NoT SMArt BecAUSe YoU wONt MaKE moNEy &amp; tHEn YoU WOnt gET a JoB in THat FielD.""

h94288,1,2020-06-14,I have developed feelings for my best friend and I'm not sure what to do,MookieManhattan,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/h94288/i_have_developed_feelings_for_my_best_friend_and/,"Me and my best friend met when I was investigating the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (which I will call the LDS church for the remainder of this post) last spring. I was baptized into the church last year and we've been hanging out on a weekly basis since probably mid July 2019 and we have become BFFs. He has told me he identifies as straight and knows that I am a panromantic demisexual. We greatly treasure each other's company and would often go to lunch and dinner together, just the two of us, and just hang out and discuss our feelings and what is going on in our lives. As of my writing this post, I genuinely can't imagine my life without a friend like him in it.

Fast forward to mid-March of 2020, when the whole coronavirus thing hit the US...

This hampered social interactions quite a bit and, as a result, I haven't been able to see him or hang out with him regularly (or at all) anymore. Almost as soon as the shutdown hit, we began texting each other daily to cope with the distancing, and I think that keeping in touch has helped us both cope with this pandemic much more easily. He recently started a 10-week managerial internship at a store chain in the area and I'm currently searching for a job, but we both make time to talk to each other at least once a day. Maybe its the loneliness of social-distancing, but I've found I've had more time than I'd like to spend with and analyze my thoughts, and I've begun to realize, more and more vividly since the age of social-distancing hit the globe, that I have feelings for him (my best friend) that go quite a ways deeper than friendship.

I think I knew about these feelings around December of 2019, but I tried my best to ignore them and brush them aside for the good of the friendship. While he has told me he is straight, he also told me he has never really had a girlfriend before; and while that is not by any means an indication of hidden proclivities, certain aspects of his body language when I'm around have led me to suspect he might potentially possess similar feelings on a subconscious level. Mind you, I know full well that I am by no means an expert on body language nor am I a mind reader, so this could all be (and likely is) wishful thinking on my part. That is why I am extremely hesitant to take the gamble that those feelings ""might"" be there and risk the worst-case scenario of losing my best friend because of it. Given the religious views he grew up with (as well as the fact that his father is the LDS church's Stake President for the region I reside in), I am uncertain if my revealing these deeply tender feelings would go over well.

Unfortunately, the overall loneliness of this period has made me loosen up with what I say to him without my realizing it... ...I've begun gushing out my innermost emotions and wearing my heart on my sleeve in the text messages I exchange with him, and—refreshingly—I've noticed that he tends to do the same with me at times (though, usually to a less grandiose extent compared to what I write). I am, understandably, worried that I am beginning to lose my already-tenuous control of the internal filter I've put on these feelings since December 2019, as the essence of these feelings is beginning to seep further and further out into my correspondences with him, no matter how hard I try to keep them sequestered within myself (though, please note that these feelings are not outrightly declared in any sort of romantic proclamation – I would never let myself do that). It has taken just about every ounce of my strength to restrain myself from blurting out a text message that says ""I think I have feelings for you that go deeper than friendship."" But the fear of the devastation that a rejection to (and potential distancing from me) such a proclamation would bring—given the fact that he's my first best friend, the first friend who would make time in his busy schedule to hang out with me every week, the first friend who genuinely cared and valued catching up with me as much as I cared and valued catching up with him, the first friend who would share the same depth of emotional vulnerability as I tended to share with him—has caused me to keep my feelings hidden for what may very well be an eternity.

With all sincerity I can possibly muster, to whomever reads this post: I don't want to ruin my friendship with him—maintaining the firm foundation of the friendship we have built with one another is my paramount concern. However, I also don't want to miss my (potential) chance with him in the (potential-yet-slim-chance) event that he feels the same way (or similarly) about me. He is, legitimately, the first person I've ever felt these kinds of feelings for; it is as though an emotional flower has budded in my soul and...it feels wonderfully warm inside me. I'm just so confused about what I should do, because of both the foreignness of these emotions to me and the complex religious landscape I find myself navigating when contemplating how I might approach an answer to this perplexing question. It's eating away at me to keep everything bottled up like this...but I am terrified I might lose this friendship which I hold so dear if I come right out and reveal how I feel to him. He is my life preserver during this pandemic and one of the most important people to me in my life.

To conclude, I'm at a loss and I've tied myself up in knots about this for weeks now. (You can probably tell that from how much I've written.) I'd really appreciate any advice the community here can provide me about this. Thank you!

TL;DR: I have developed feelings for my best friend. I like him a ton and want to tell him how I feel, but I'm scared that will ruin the friendship we have. Given the religion he grew up with, there are aspects of his beliefs that I think might play a significant factor in the calculus of how he might respond. I've never had someone that I feel these kinds of things for before and I don't want to miss my chance. Any and all advice would be much appreciated. Many thanks for your time and attention!

----

P.S. For the record (in case anyone is wondering after reading this), I didn't know the full extent of the homophobia (for lack of a better term) promulgated in LDS beliefs until shortly before I was baptized and I almost didn't go through with my baptism because of it. I, inevitably, decided to take a step forward in faith, because even though I vehemently disagreed with the Family Proclamation and the LDS church's treatment of LGBTQIA+ issues, I believed that my diversity would help the people in this community to learn, grow, understand, and inevitably accept people like me and the unique view of the world I've been blessed with. All humans should realize at some point in their life that sexuality is a spectrum, not a discrete set of boxes you place people into; no one is 100% gay and no one is 100% straight—everyone is a little bit of both, and I think that that is a part of God's plan for us. My firm and steadfast belief is that marriage should be based upon the existence of a pure, unbreakable connection of love between two persons and not the equipment one is born with. I believe that any pure love—no matter how it is expressed, or whom it is expressed for—should be allowed to be sanctified in the temple. No mortal individual purported to be a ""prophet of God"" is ever going to change my belief that the most important truth about love is this: love is love.

h94fkv,1,2020-06-14,"How to transition from scripting to programming, or, making a career out of coding alone, instead of just using code?",Soreloser1,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/h94fkv/how_to_transition_from_scripting_to_programming/,"Hey all, I was answering another thread here and got on a rant regarding my own insecurities. Reframed my question in the last paragraph. 

I know that the trope revolving around natural ability, is only partially true, and that, those I consider to be ""real"" programmers, may have a predisposition, but, it's hard work and determination, that took them to great heights. 

I guess I just feel like my abilities are stuck at a level where, they are only useful, as long as I have a job that isn't heavily involved with archetyping the system. As in, my scripting abilities are only good enough to automate abilities at the entry level, and not something that could be rolled out in such a way that I could truly have a career from coding alone.

I'm still on the fence myself when it comes to this, ""questioning of my character as befitting to program"" dilemma. I find it quite demoralizing to think about why I've mainly chosen the IT field...as I have yet to transition beyond entry-level, which leaves me feeling useless at times, like my only ability is following a monkey script made by real professionals, as I mindlessly fulfill a cog that grants access to systems (built by professionals) used by people with actual talent. Maybe throw in some asinine PC errors that, while I'm thankful exists so that I may be employed, only serves as a reminder that my only contribution is throwing bandaids on the real talent. 

So I (barely) graduated college with a BS in CS, and with one cert (A+). Left school feeling this love/hate affair for programming, which still haunts me to this day. I think I have ""the mind"" for it, but I still doubt myself as a legit ""programmer"", as I've yet to become this, full-stack building, huge GitHub pushing, crawls-through-assembly-code-for-fun professional that I imagine. I know that's overly dramatic, but I do tend to wrap up so much of my ego in being the ""tech guy"", that I rag hard on myself for not knowing the ins-and-outs of it all. With the added stress from the amount of diversity that comes with how technology can be applied...it's so overwhelming. I see people with tons of certifications/GitHub repos out the wazoo and just think to myself, ""how do they reach those heights?"" 

I currently work as an ""IT Analyst"", although I consider most of my tasks to be glorified data entry. There's no programming at all required for my position, but, my interest in automation has helped myself (and others) out a lot. I have written a slew of Javascript bookmarklets, AutoHotKey macros, and Powershell functions that save time. 

One example: we use the AD360 web interface to grant access to users, by filling in certain fields, pulled from a ticketing system (Lotus Notes has Person Docs containing HomeDirectory, Logon Script, Description, Active Directory groups, etc). My coworkers showed me how it's done; they copy and paste from/to each field, with the AD groups requiring a clunky search bar that forces you to add each group individually! So I wrote a couple JS bookmarklets for AD360 &amp; wrapped everything else in AutoHotKey for using the ticketing app, and made a macro that could, parse the entire ticket, filling out each page, and closing the request in a few clicks (2 minutes vs 10)! 

Now I'm starting to get into some back-end programming that honestly, I never thought I could accomplish. Only comprehending the basics of the APIs in fetching data, so I'm trying to stay proud of myself, as no one else in my company has done any of this, but it's hard to feel worthy. My magnum opus is writing a Powershell script that can access or modify all 3 of our systems (Active Directory, Forefront Identity Manager, and Lotus Notes) at once! (Get-aduser for AD, import-module LithnetRMA for FIM, and a comobject Lotus.notessession for anyone interested.)

I just try to see how much I can accomplish with my current level of skill and incrementally improve, but I'm still struggling with some huge leaps. And I try not to be bothered with perfection (unless it motivates me to improve). But I'm left with the overwhelming feeling of, I'm just a sort of a ""super-user"" who excels at some data entry tasks. I would be fine with this if my internships had the same expectations as real jobs. I can spend all day refining my scripts, but ask me to respond to a couple emails, and I'm frozen. I feel like my ""limited"" talents only reinforce my strengths, not as an asset, but more as a coping mechanism for my weaknesses. Like in high school AP US, where I would get Fs on all the tests, but As on all the papers. Average, but not well rounded.

I feel so lost, even though people tell me I'm talented at something. I guess my question is, am I good enough to transition into some DevOps and be able to find some mentorship that would actually helps me grow in ability, instead of just teaching me the basic propritaries pertaining to a set of data entry tools?"

I have an internship for the summer so 5 of  my friends and I are leasing a house from a large college property management company. We moved in on Sunday and this was the first weekend we have all been up together.

We are surrounded by other college students as the management company owns almost all of the properties around with a large parking lot in the middle of all of the apartments and houses. They own almost every property except for one single family home caddy corner from us on the parking lot. I believe that this family has been calling noise complaints on my house any chance that they get.

The first incident was on Friday night and two police officers showed up to our house in order to tell us to keep it down. There is a [noise ordinance](https://www.ci.durham.nh.us/municipalcode/article-02-noise-use-districts) in the town of Durham that says that unreasonable noise past 10pm is in violation of town code. We were probably in violation that night but we turned it down and called it a night after the officers gave us a warning. They were very clear that they had no problem writing us a ticket in the future and one cop was hostile towards me and my housemates despite us being respectful.

The second incident was at 1pm on Saturday afternoon when my housemates and I had a few guests over and were playing music on our lawn. The cops once again showed up and said they were responding to a noise complaint. This time however we were not in violation of the noise ordinance and he said they only thing he could do was charge us with disorderly conduct. I asked him if it looked like anyone was acting disorderly and he said not at this time. I gave him my cell number and ID and asked him to leave if as we were not breaking any laws.

The third incident happened at 11pm on Saturday night. We once again had friends over on our porch but were very aware of the ordinance at this point. We had the speaker volume at less than 25% and the noise was much more reasonable than compared to Friday night. A police officer drove through our large parking lot to see if he could hear our music. He then showed back up with another officer in another cruiser. They both got out and spoke to me and told me to send everyone who didn't live there home. I asked them why were violating the ordinance if the music was that low and we were considerably quieter than the previous night. They said that they could write me a ticket because they could hear the music from the property management's parking lot. I said that this parking lot was not the road and they had no reason to be there in the first place. They agreed that I was not being unreasonably loud and did not want to write me a ticket but the other officer said that I would absolutely be receiving a ticket at some point this year.

I feel like my neighbor is abusing the police and excessively calling them because she has a problem with us having fun. We were very reasonable and respectful to the police but I feel like they don't have a right to be patrolling our private parking lot and use that as a reason for the noise complaint. What can I do to stop being harassed by my nosy neighbor?

Edit: I also feel as though this specific piece of the ordinance is unconstitutional

&gt;4.  Evidence of a specific complaint or complainant is not necessary to establish a violation of this ordinance.

h99sxs,2,2020-06-15,what part-time jobs should I get as a CIS major?,JuicyTurkyLegs,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/h99sxs/what_parttime_jobs_should_i_get_as_a_cis_major/,"So I'm currently a cis major (Computer information systems) and I would like to know what kind of part-time jobs I should look for  


Just a quick backstory;  
I used to be in software engineering, but after failing calc 1 twice, I was told that I was going to be kicked out of the major. One advisor told me that if I still wanted to learn to program, then I should take their CIS major since that major had a programming concentration.  


The programming concentration would replace 5 class with calc 1, calc 2, intro to programming, programming methodology, and object-oriented programming  


Before I made the switch, I asked my intro to computer sci professor if it was still possible to get a job as a software developer/engineer even if I have a cis degree, He told i can, but what really matters is my Github or any projects I do.  I wanted to make sure that I could still have an alternative if the main cis stuff does not work out   


So I finally passed calc 1, and I don't get into the cis stuff until the spring of 2021, with the majority of the IT stuff being in the fall of 2021   
Since at the moment, I'm just finishing the common core stuff I currently have no knowledge of this type of work.   


I am aware that CIS, or any information systems major is rather questionable. I've seen some people say its poo if it is to business-focused, while others have had success in finding good-paying careers

I want to be able to have at least some form of experience, that way, finding internships no later than by the end of next year will be easier.  

Based on what I have seen with a quick google search, the jobs that I can get with the degree offer respectable salaries. I just want to be able to make good use of the degree once  I'm out of college, and not have to work a crappy 10-15$ an hour job. 

So again, keep in mind I currently have no knowledge of this stuff, what kind of part-time jobs do any of you guys recommend I get right now? (yes I'm also aware of COVID 19)"

I'm looking into possible chemE or just broad engineering-related internships, anything to get some hands on experience but I'm wondering if it's too late and places will probably not be looking for any interns anymore as its mid-June already.

Also, how could I go around looking for internships? People say to use Linkedin, but I'm not quite sure how to use it to find and reach out to people. Does anyone have tips or advice for looking for and applying for internships this summer in general?

I am a British Citizen who moved to India due to some family issues. Right now my college degree is on hold due to COVID 19, and I am working at a startup as a software developer intern.  I really want to shift back to Uk, so I have decided to start my job hunt in India.

I have found out that highest response is usually from cold-emailing recruiters on LinkedIn but they usually ask for a degree which is on hold and require to work ASAP.  When is the right time to apply, after I get my degree or right now.  And once I receive my degree, I would not have much time because the current company I am working in will make me sign a 1 year service agreement.

But Covid 19 does not make my situation of getting a job any easy. So I am kind of confused , should I start applying or not."

I am currently a freshman studying CS in UIUC. Unfortunately I was unable to get an internship this summer. I decided to better my skills by learning the whole MERN stack and actually building a pretty good project in it. The project will be done by this month. I am confused on what to do now? . Should I just keep taking up personal projects or do something else. Next summer will I have huge disadvantage over others who had internships this summer."

I recently applied for internships and got contacted by a company for my first internship. It is not confirmed yet as they said they are going to call me to 'discuss about the internship'. I am pretty excited because this is my first ever internship. I have applied for front-end development using VueJs and interacting with PHP Laravel. I have some bit of experience on Vuejs as I built one toy project with Vuejs before, but I am nowhere close to being an expert. Which is why I am starting to panic and lately have been feeling under-confident because I have been out-of-touch with Vue for quite some time as I started to learn Angular. 

what could be a general advice given my current state? What are the things I should start doing during my time at the internship? If someone can guide me through this I'd be grateful. Thank you."

1. I am planning on applying soon, and would love advice on how did you all choose your college/University. I'm in Germany (as a foreigner,but i speak german), and frankly all the universities look great, all have great names and ranks, and aside from prestige I have no idea at all how to filter between them (I am talking only about the public ones, which cost all the same, so the university's costs isn't an issue,).

2. I have decided to go down the path of Computer science due to a strong interest in technology and computers. I've also learned and programmed in java for about 3 months and it was quite fun, but nevertheless I am completely terrified to make the wrong choice and regret it the rest of my life. I have other proffesions which peek my interest and managed to narrow it down to about 4. However I have no time due to familiy reasons to take an extra year to ""find myself"" or do internships. Thus i've been perplexed over this dilema for a long time. How did any of you manage to pick the bachelor that fits you or the one you are content with?

I'm approaching you, after endless googling. Because my family is unable to help me, and my friends have already made these mistakes.

h9ele1,2,2020-06-15,A letter I can't send,petit_dej,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/h9ele1/a_letter_i_cant_send/,"This was originally a text to my uncle but I can't send it for various reasons. It's not an attack against him. I just been carrying some issues for a very long time. I just want to stop crying....


Hey, I know you don't wanna hear from me but I need to get some things off my chest that I've been carrying for a long time. And I acknowledge/appreciate the financial help you've provided along the way while still asking you to be accountable or at least acknowledge this other stuff. 

There are some things that you've done/said to me that have left lasting effects. That's not to place blame solely on those things for my issues, but they've played their part. 

It goes beyond the weed smoking, since I was around 10 when Terry was asking about my breasts and smacking my behind. I needed help, so I told you, thinking you'd do something about it. You brushed it off, just told me to say ""Stop"". It was one of the first times in my life that I felt like I needed real help from a male figure and I walked away feeling even more unprotected than before. I felt like I didn't matter to you. There was other sexual abuse I needed to tell someone about, but I didn't. Because I felt like I'd get the same reaction.

When Angeline was murdered on my 11th birthday, I had never experienced that type of grief before and it was crushing me. When I told you about it and your immediate reaction was ""Hm. Why are you hangin out with a 23 year old anyway?"", along with other dismissive statements. I know you didn't know her, but to dismiss my feelings and my grief over her, further cemented the idea that there was something wrong with me to cause you to be so callous and cold. 

When everyone was sitting in Momo's living room laughing &amp; calling my mom fat, I stood up for her. I said ""y'all need to stop making fun of my mama"" and for that you pinned me up against the wall by the stairs. I don't know if you realized it, but you were hurting my arms. Not only that, but that's just not discipline. Point, Blank. It was wrong. If y'all felt like I was being disrespectful, a whooping or something would have sufficed. But to pin a little girl up against the wall, hurting her, knowing how big you were... it's just wrong and the experience stayed with me. 
It taught me that not only do I not matter, but there is something in me so bad that it makes the adults in my life think this type of thing is okay.

And when it came to me smoking weed in high school , I can understand the anger, disappointment, Etc. But to completely disown me? To be met with disdain when I simply tell you that I love you and I miss you? You will never understand how deep of a wound that has left in my psyche. It's clearly not just about the weed. 

Not even a congratulations when I graduated. Nothing. You showed me how you felt about me time and time again and racked my brain trying to figure out what was wrong with me. It seemed like nothing was ever good enough. Even the last Christmas I saw you and I tried to talk to you. It was like talking to a stranger. I was so excited to tell you about the internship with Planned Parenthood and the other things in the works. But your whole body language and speech let me know that you didn't care too much. I was crushed yet again... I realized that nothing I will ever do will matter to you.
The indifference brought back feelings of invisibility and insignificance that I haven't felt in a long time.

And for all these things, I forgive you. I won't carry all this anger and pain anymore. I've come to realize it doesn't serve me. It's  time for me to let go. Because now I know who I am and what I am no matter what ANYONE says."

So of course I made a plan to finish my bachelors: filed fafsa, signed up for classes, stayed in touch with school etc. Unfortunately as the summer continues, I’ve got a lot of factors leaning me against going back to school.

Well, I really am enjoying the internship, and would be happy to move to a full time role if possible at the end. But I am worried they might react poorly and stop my internship (if it stops for any reason I have to do a lot of pay back).

h9fu78,1,2020-06-15,"Next-step after one year contract, which technologies should I learn?",al95eng,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/h9fu78/nextstep_after_one_year_contract_which/,"I am a software engineer, currently on a 12-month contract, which will expire in the middle of September. It mainly involves producing design documentation for control rooms on a motorway project, and development of various tools to support this, primarily in .NET and a little bit of Python. I have also done a small amount of SQL scripting.

I have a BE BSc in Electronics Engineering and Physics, so not quite the same field. I used Python a fair bit in Physics classes. During one of my engineering internships, I did a small amount of C/C++ development for microcontrollers, but I'm not as comfortable with that as I am with higher-level stuff.

I have written some simple tools to help with requirements traceability in designs, but the bulk of my development work was in the front-end for the company's new asset management system (backed by a content repository). This includes unit tests, UI improvements (including some custom controls I have written), and some (""nice to have"") new features that are not critical. This particular application was started by a more experienced developer, who also wrote the back-end. It is a WinForms app. Would this disadvantage me because it is a very old technology? I have been actively learning WPF over the last few months and started developing some small projects.

Apart from expanding my knowledge in .NET and SQL Server, I have been dabbling in JavaScript and Electron js. I thought I should diversify my knowledge, as most advertised positions ask for many different technologies (some of them actually rather obscure). I picked JS and Electron not because of its popularity, but because I am genuinely interested in it, I like the idea of building something that will run on different platforms. I prefer building desktop applications. 

Overall, I would call myself a .NET dev primarily, as it's the platform I have the most experience with, and by far the most comfortable. However, I do use most of my spare time to learn other technologies.

Any other technologies I should focus on in the near future?

What should my next steps be? Should I start applying for new positions now? Should I ask if my contract is going to be renewed at some point? If so, when?"

* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:**  
500GBP as it is for temporary use (c. 2 months). 
* **Are you open to refurbs/used?**  
Yes.
* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?**  
Care most about performance. Just being able to run large workbooks on excel, and good for videoconferencing. Beyond that, non-factors.
* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**  
Ideally thin and light. But obviously, not a real factor for me.
* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.**

PLEASE help!,VapesfromBible,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/h9inhz/laid_off_confused_early_in_my_career_trying_to/,"Laid off from a SaaS Support job. Feeling down and don’t know where my career is going to go from here...

Hi everyone — 

Unfortunately I was laid off from my company due to the impact of COVID-19, along with almost 30% of the company. Scary times, but I am motivated to keep pushing forward. 

I took a “Customer Support” job after a few months of being unemployed. This is more of a glorified call center job where customers are calling in and my job is to help them with their issues. I am answering phone calls and doing tickets in a 24/7 support role. I don’t see much growth from this... but I need to pay the bills. 

My company I was working at was a SaaS based company that sold a low-code web development tool and also a live streaming tool. When I was initially hired, my title was “IT Support Specialist” and I did everything from providing internal support to the employees and being the “IT” guy. After about 5 months of learning the IT processes - they approached me and asked if I wanted to be a part of their Customer Software Support team, which would entail helping customers with their questions about the product. Since the IT was sort of slow, I figured I would take the opportunity. 

I had a training period where I learned the ins-and-outs of their SaaS product and master it. Master it enough to answer customer tickets, be on live chat support, hop on phone calls with the sales team. I REALLY enjoyed this. I enjoyed working with customers and representing the brand, helping different companies achieve their goals with their products. I also liked being pulled into calls with the Sales/Customer Success team as a “technical contact” to explain or demo the product. I wrote technical documentation for the software. Maintained relationships with customers on projects. 

I was able to collaborate with Engineering team and Development team when certain bugs came up on the software and pick up some basic HTML and CSS tricks along the way. I learned that the software was hosted on AWS and I really wanted to get AWS certifications to see if I can branch out and maybe help on the backend side.... but this all came to an end when I was laid off. 

My resume is very Desktop Support / IT Support heavy due to all the internships and part time stuff I did while I was in college. Once I got my degree in Computer Information Systems - I started at that SaaS company and began to realize that my love for IT Support wasn’t there anymore. 

I am trying to find a new role and getting contacted by recruiters, but they are for Help Desk positions. I am trying to break away from Help Desk and hopefully stay in the SaaS space. I was thinking about getting the AWS Cloud Practitioner and Azure Cloud Fundamentals certifications (I have a lot of downtime to study for these) to sort of beef up my resume. I am totally motivated to learn a programming language. There’s potentially some opportunity to do some QA testing with Java &amp; Selenium in my current company. I feel like this may be a good way to start playing around / exposure to code. My passion isn’t in resetting people’s passwords anymore. 

Here is a mock resume to get an idea of my experience: https://imgur.com/gallery/oDUYFRg

h9k3vw,3,2020-06-15,A possibly useful strategy for people struggling with procrastination,oree94,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/h9k3vw/a_possibly_useful_strategy_for_people_struggling/,"Hi! This is my first post in this sub. Hope this kind of post is allowed.

I've hit a new low in my senior year of college (second attempt at college). I've basically avoided doing any tasks because I was stressing over dissertation paper and ended up not even writing or planning or doing anything. Also basically didn't do any of the course work from all the courses. I may be facing being expelled. 

I'm a chronic procrastinator and even simple chores take a lot of willpower to do. I've started taking concerta last week, bit it's not helping much yet.


This week is the final week in the semester and I have a pile of messages and emails I've been ignoring, not to mention the term papers I haven't started. 

I'm writing this in the hopes that this strategy I'm taking may also help someone with similar problems that I have. For me, it always begins with small tasks that need little effort that I procrastinate to start and then that snowballs into this massive stress that eats me away and paralyzes me even more. So what I do when I finally start to assess the damage (It's sad that this is an established pattern, but that's another story) is to just start writing down my fears and anxieties, because for me, making my fears visible instead of just in my head makes them easier to deal with. Here's what I typed out after finally sitting down in front of my computer. Hope it's not too stream-of-consciousness for people to read. 

""Fear paralyzes me. Fear is a giant lump of pressure on my chest. To deal with this lump, it needs to be taken apart and examined piece by piece. What are my fears and expectations? What are the worst outcome and best outcome? When I know what to expect, and accept the consequences to come, I can then take actions to move forward. The woods are dark and scary, but the only way out is through. 

What are the negative consequences to expect, from worst to least bad? And what are the actions that I can take to deal with those consequences?

 1. Be expelled -- a. See if it's reversible on the grounds of mental health issues. -- b. Start looking for jobs that do not require a college degree. And maybe enroll in an online university when I can afford it.

 2. The prof is mad at me. I explain my situation, I still get F in Academic Writing -- Apologize to the professor for being a serial bad student and explain your situation, but remember to apologize properly. Take the class next year but from a different prof.

 3. Get F in VB -- Take it again next semester

 4. Get F in Greek Philosophy -- Take it again next semester

 5. Get F in Chinese Contemporary Literature -- Take it again next semester

 6. Get F in Internship -- Take it again next semester

 7. Dissertation Professor won't take me back -- Apologize to her nontheless and send thanks for being invested and giving me advice. Ask the thesis writing prof to give a referral.

 8. Have to write course papers and get D -- Do it. It's better than F. 

What are the actions I need to take, in order of urgency?

 1. Check emails

 2. Research if I'm being expelled

 3. Have a talk with mom and update her on my situations.

 4. Check each course chat room and T.A.s messages, explain your situation, see if you can still submit the term papers and midterm papers.

 5. Write the papers and submit them, hope for the best.""

Obviously the best scenario would have been making this list before I hit a record-breaking rock bottom, but hey, it's better than just holding my breath and waiting for death to come like I usually do. 

Of course, this can be applied to anything other than academic stuff. You can also do this for other things you're putting off doing. For example, dishes. What is stopping you from doing the dishes? Write down the anxieties and other negative feelings and causes of those feelings. And write down the specific actions to deal with those feelings. You can also think up the positive outcome of doing the dishes and weigh them against the negative expectations of doing them. This way, the task will seem much less daunting. 

I hope this is somehow helpful and I wish all you struggling with procrastination out there the best."

I feel like this may be a good way to start playing around / exposure to code. My passion isn’t in resetting people’s passwords anymore. 

Here is a mock resume to get an idea of my experience: https://imgur.com/gallery/oDUYFRg

Does anyone have any advice? I can PM you my LinkedIn. 

Any help is appreciated... I’m going through a rough time right now. Lucky to have a job - but confused about my future."

Today, I got an email from the background check people asking for an additional employer. The thing is, other than my internship experience I don’t have any work experience. For now, I let them know that and to let me know I can I do anything, but I’m still worried.

Should I be worried about this? Is this a sign that the background check is going bad/well?"
h9l3yy,22,2020-06-15,An academic journeyman's guide to Graduate School Admissions,vajra_,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/h9l3yy/an_academic_journeymans_guide_to_graduate_school/,"**Note 1** (disclaimer)- *This is from my experiences that I garnered through my own graduate school admissions process as well as by interacting with professors, admission committee members and other grad students.*

**Note 2** \- *This primarily concerns (US)* ***PhD*** *admissions for* ***STEM*** *in* ***top 20*** *schools. It also holds true for highly competitive sub-fields for STEM (for e.g. AI, CV and NLP in CS). I'd write sometime later for the MS admissions but they are kind of a different ballgame altogether - and since many top schools unfortunately consider them as cash cow programs (for STEM) - they usually have different standards for admissions.*

**Note 3** \- *(if ranking matters for you)  I got into 4 top-25 grad school programs (* [http://csrankings.org/](http://csrankings.org/) *) having applied in a very competitive STEM sub-field. I chose the lowest ranking school as it was the best fit for me.*

*\** *If you are somebody with 6+ years of industry research experience (like DeepMind, etc.), or have first authored 5+ research papers in tier 1 conferences/journals, or have won a 'Best Paper' Award in the said conferences, etc, please stop reading. You WILL get into a top 20 school irrespective of other factors- I don't know if you need a PhD though.*

&amp;#x200B;

1. **GRE** ***-*** Doesn't really matter - especially for good programs. The admissions committee may use it to filter the candidates into bins but that's about it. Its the least important factor for the admissions. Some programs actually don't even ask for the GRE.
2. **SoP -** Doesn't really matter. That doesn't mean that you can write a horrible SoP - there's a small chance the committee will read your SoP in order to understand an anomaly in your grades/education or your research choices. But, that's about it.
3. **GPA -** Again, this is used to filter candidates. Unless you have extremely low GPA i.e. &lt; 3.0, you don't really have to worry. And even if you do have a really low GPA (2.0 - 3.0), your application won't be discarded if it's strong otherwise. Having said that, there are some infamous program committees which will discard your application for some GPA cutoff - usually happens in stupidly competitive programs like AI and Computer Vision.Grades in relevant courses do matter more than the overall GPA. If you have good math and science/engineering grades, it'll matter not if you have a comparably poor overall GPA. Some professor do actually gauge a prospective student's abilities through these grades. International students and students from lesser known schools suffer here since the committee or the professor may not understand the complexity or importance of the course you've taken in reference to better known US school course grades.
4. **LoRs -** LoRs matter. Initially. Good LoRs from respected researchers can turn the tide in your favor. Even if you have below average scores or are below cutoff for points ***1 to 3,*** the committee will forward your application seeing good LoRs. Try and get an LoR of professors of the university that you are applying to (or of proffs who at least have some sort of connection in the said school). Point **8** will elaborate on this point. Personal, 1st person LoRs which elaborate on your research prowess and *not* the success of your old research projects are good.
5. **Research Experience and Publications -** Unfortunately, matters quite a bit but is a poor metric for grad admissions. Not every applicant has/had equitable access to research opportunities in their lives. This doesn't make them less viable for grad school. Many undergrads actually use this point to game the system. Getting unpaid research 'internships' at reputed schools and labs via friends/contacts (I've seen rich East Asian students do this a *lot*) and just being free labor to be added onto research papers and projects. Some students get lucky and get spectacular advising from a professor or at a research internship. Its just privilege, street smartness and dumb luck - many hardworking and intelligent students miss out on these opportunities for no fault of theirs.I would suggest reaching out to professors at your school or nearby in-person to get started on any research you can get. Emailing professors to famous schools usually goes unanswered due to the spam created by the 'game the system' students. Just hope for the best and reach out to do as much research as you can. Get started as soon as you can. Seek help and ask questions.On a more to the point aspect of the problem - Usually, 2-4 tier 1 conference papers as 1st or 2nd author will book you a slot.
6. **Less competitive sub-field -** On my PhD weekends/trips, I met lots of admitted students who actually got in by aiming for a less competitive sub-field. I don't really advocate this but if you, like them, care more about getting into a specific school than a certain lab/professor and are willing to try your luck changing your research field and advisor when you have been admitted, go for it. It depends upon school to school, so you can reach out to present PhDs and look at lab memberships and published papers to figure out which sub fields are least competed for and thus, in perennial need of grad students.I personally dislike this as you are taking away the opportunity from a person who actually wants to work in that specific field.
7. **Research Overlap with labs/professors -** Seeking out labs/profs, especially new ones, with unique (usually less researched) problems, that you have *provable interest* in, may get you into grad school. A major part of it is to reach out to the said lab or professor and let them know of you existence and willingness to work with them. It is hard to do so amongst the noise created by the *spamsters* (students who spam proffs a lot, despite having no/little interest in the said research). One way would be to publish in a similar topic, which brings us back to point 5 and is usually not possible for all students given lack of equitable access to research opportunities and guidance. On the other hand, you can try and reach out to lab members/proff a year or two before you start applying and ask for a research opportunity (I don't think you'd be turned down given you show enough motivation and background knowledge). Targeting specific (less competitive/less known) proffs/labs while applying may also work in your favor - it just depends if your application reaches the said professor.
8. **CONTACTS/CONNECTIVITY - This is the most important** aspect of your grad school ambitions. Even if you have a sub-par outlook from points 1-7, and even if the admissions committee throws out your application at the very first glance, if the professor wants you in the lab, you will be there. This is one of the major advantages that students doing their undergrads at *better known* institutions and the financially blessed students have. Along with better access to research opportunities and guidance, they have a better chance for building connectivity through personal interaction. Many students do significantly leverage this advantage for grad school admissions.   
Does your research advisor know or has worked with a professor at a school you want to go for grad school? Do you know a post doc or senior PhDs at a lab you want to work at? Are there any undergrad alumni at the lab you want to work at? Everything counts and will work in your favor. It sounds pretty unfair and not very *merit-oriented* but that's how it works and have no doubt, it is immensely misused. This special kind of *nepotism* is sadly rampant in academia. It has gone bad to the point that some professors actually prefer grad students from a particular country/region who speak a certain language over a better candidate.

&amp;#x200B;

***Inequitable access to research opportunities -***  *The funny thing about figuring out if someone is a good candidate for grad school is by providing them research opportunities in their undergrad. Unfortunately, this doesn't happen for everybody.*

Graduate School Admission process is very flawed and quite stacked against many young researchers who are international, lack connectivity, have been lacking in research opportunities or come from unusual academic circumstances. Many viable PhD candidates (and I've seen this personally) get filtered out of the process and many undeserving ones (who lack any passion for research/game the process) seep through. But, at the end of the day, a PhD is not an end but rather just another means to an end."

I’m searching for a job, but nothing is really turning up in my field. I’ve lost the drive to apply for things anymore.... I feel like there isn’t a point, I’m not going to get a job in the pandemic, and everyone else has better credentials than me.

I didn’t do any internships or win any great awards, my position as an instructor for a field course obviously fell through, and I’m depressed. I sit on my phone all day. My writing (prose) has become awful after writing scientific papers for the last four years. My vocabulary is gone and all the interest that my writing used to have is gone with it. My cover letters blow and I know it.

I’m discouraged because my partner finished last year and immediately got an excellent job, and there just aren’t opportunities like that right now. He wants to move in together but I have no source of income, and I feel like my life has been put on hold. I’ve never had a “real” job and am only familiar with being a student. Entering the real world seems daunting and I feel unqualified to work in industry.

I see all these positions for computer scientists and others and all are skills that I don’t have, and I feel like my field (geology) was a mistake.

I guess I wanted to complain a bit. It sucks to feel like this and I wish I had more motivation to apply for things but I just.... don’t care. How are other recent grads doing?"
h9mrbo,2,2020-06-15,Do I have a chance of getting into Harvard Law School for LL.M. program?,muchilucki,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/h9mrbo/do_i_have_a_chance_of_getting_into_harvard_law/,"Hi, I’m a fresh graduate from Indonesia’s best law school. It seems a bit too late for me to prepare for my master degree as I’m only thinking about it recently so I think I missed lots of opportunities to explore and to achieve more during my undergraduate study. Though it’s already too late, I wanna do my best to get into the best law school for my LL.M. in the US. In this post, I wanna ask your opinions about what law school that suits me and what should I do for the next 2 years to get into the best law school I could get into. 

These are the things I had done during my study:
-I had been honored as most oustanding student with the highest GPA at law faculty for 2 consecutive years, and graduated with highest GPA as well. The problem is I failed one class so I didn’t make it as valedictorian although the valedictorian’s GPA was lower than mine. 
-I was involved in a legal research held by one of organization at campus.
-I joined a local project held by AIESEC as a volunteer to teach underprivileged children. 
-I was involved in Street Law project held by Legal Clinic at law faculty to give marginalized communities better understanding about their legal rights’ by socializing it to them. This project was including a student exchange to University of Malaya (the best uni in Malaysia) where I learnt and was involved in their community outreach program in Malaysia.
-an internship at one of 1st tier law firm in Indonesia which is in an association with an international scale law firm.

I know I should have done more during my undergraduate study and I really regret for not doing it. In my defense, I wasn’t interested in the legal field for some personal reasons so I didn’t really know what to do during my study. As for now, I’m already in the legal field totally so I want to strive for the best in what I do, including going to the best law school I could afford. I talked to my brother yesterday (who is also a corporate lawyer) but he didn’t think that I had a chance at Harvard Law School. 

Realistically, do I still have a chance of getting into Harvard Law School for LL.M. program? If not, then which law school that would suit me best?

Also, I would appreciate it so much if you could give me advices on what should I do in the next 2 years while working as trainee associate at a law firm to prepare for my LL.M program in the US.

Thank you in advance!"

I got a programming job at a mid-size company, and the office has a relaxed culture that does not feel corporate at all. To most people this would seem like a good thing, but having not had much experience interacting in a casual-professional job setting, I almost want to quit as I generally can't get comfortable in these types of places.

From what I've observed, the people interact with ease, and I feel like a robot. I've even gotten into a slight benzo addiction to cope, but that's a whole different thing. My previous internship had the similar relaxed environment where it was weird to not be relaxed and I dreaded it. 

I see two apparent options which are 1) push through and hope by experience and time I can become relaxed, or 2) quit and work a more robotic job where social interaction doesn't matter. Option 2 seems absurd to me even though I feel totally stressed out every day of this job."

This is my first internship and I had been told to study up on Vue.JS and Go lang, and had been told that I would be provided mentorship throughout my internship. I've noticed that most of my team are interns (other than one senior dev) and mentorship isn't really provided. It's mostly working on my own and figuring things out as I go. Every week I'm given a task and I usually have to figure out how to do everything on my own, when I thought I'd have people to reach out to if I needed help. The senior dev on my team rarely responds to my messages, and when I contact the CEO, he just refers me to other interns who aren't much help either. 

While I do love a good challenge, the issue is that they expect a lot and don't provide much help in return. I feel like I am not getting much out of the internship, since most of what I do is searching up my parts of the project on YouTube and StackOverflow. Is this normal for software internships, or is it because I am interning at a small startup company? It seems that they haven't really lived up to their promises."

For those who don't know, in terms of academics, it's essentially a Computer Science degree with some business courses. I've been  applying everywhere, but a couple issues arise: Internships nowadays, don't pay. literally, I saw a company on Indeed put ""pay = $0.00/hr,"" for a project management internship. No, just No. Entry level positions on the other hand require you to be a Navy SEAL who served 12 terms in Iraq, be an astronaut, as well as have 25+ years experience in quantum computing analyzing higgs boson particles using neural networks in morse-code backwards with pen and paper. After that, maybe, just maybe they'll decide to make the decision to decide if they want to make THAT decision to decide if they want to hire you. I don't know what to do. I'm interested in AI and ML and learned that becoming a data analyst is a gateway into that but these requirements are the same as above, in addition to needing a master's.

Background : I graduated with a degree unrelated to CS and eventually wanted to become a software engineer. I had heard about Salesforce during my previous internships and figured out it would be a great way to break into IT and software engineering.

After a while as a Salesforce implementation consultant, I eventually managed to land a gig as Salesforce developer. Thing is, it's horrible. The dev experience is just bad: I'm spending most of my time going around the limits and all the standard stuff provided by the platform that don't fit my use cases. Javascript development is awful, deployment is awful even though it's gotten better...

As Apex (Salesforce proprietary language) is a stripped-down version of Java with some proprietary libraries, I thought I could leverage my current experience to get a job as a Java developer.

So I'm trying to map out the stuff I need to learn :

* Core Java
* Algorithms and Data Structures
* Spring Framework/Spring Boot : Spring Core, MVC, REST API
* Strong OOP fundamentals
* Strong SQL fundamentals
* Design Patterns
* Maven
* Git (yeah, no native version control in Salesforce, WTF)
* a Frontend framework (nice to have)

With a couple of projects to show as a portfolio, would I stand a chance ? I've been working in IT for 3 years, including 1 year as a Salesforce developer."
h9pdp1,2,2020-06-15,[Career] Please help me find a career path (EE Major),Carrot-Comfortable,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/h9pdp1/career_please_help_me_find_a_career_path_ee_major/,"I recently graduated college and got my first ""engineering job"". It's at a government facility, which is important to say because during the interview process, I was given almost no information under the guise that they couldn't tell me until I got security clearance. Based on the facility, I assumed it would be a very hands-on, experiment-focused job- that almost couldn't be further from the truth.

Instead, I've found that it's almost entirely paperwork and documentation creation, with incredibly strict guidelines that we have to use and ridiculously tight verbiage that we can use in documentation.   Now, documentation might not sound that bad, but when you realize that most of these manuals are around 200 pages each, it definitely changes your perspective. 

Besides documentation, we're tasked with going through technical drawings dating back to the 60s, most of which reference half a dozen other drawings, and make sure that there aren't any mistakes in them or the manuals that guide users on them.

Now, to be fair, I should say that there is some lab work to be done. This mostly comes in the form of having to test certain procedures if any of the equipment is upgraded or retrofitted, or if a user finds an issue with our documentation and we need to see the device/wiring to correct the mistake and guide them. However, I've been told that the engineers rarely use the lab, with the more senior ones never going in at all. Even my mentor, who said he tries to get in there as much as he can, says he probably spends only 25% of his time in there, and hasn't spent a day in the last 4 years not working on documentation. 

&amp;#x200B;

I get that this may be a good fit for some people, but I've always told myself I didn't want to become another desk/office drone (no offense, it just feels that way to be), and this is like my worst work-related nightmare. Along with this, I've had basically zero supervisor direction, despite me having only started three weeks ago and have no clue that I'm supposed to be working on.

&amp;#x200B;

My only other engineering position was an internship I did two years ago at an engineering consultation firm, which had me working on floorplans and schematics for lighting and electrical systems for building constructions and renovations. That was also a desk job, with the occasional site visit to get information on the existing systems. They also had a very interesting work environment (read: getting drunk and going to strip clubs with vendors), which I really wasn't comfortable with.

&amp;#x200B;

Besides those two jobs, I've worked at a Help Desk as my time as a student, and held a full time position there for a little under a year after graduating, before leaving due to very high tensions between me and my manager and a generally hostile work environment. I actually enjoyed this job a lot, but I knew it couldn't be a career- at least not where I was. It was a bit slow at time, but the lack of direct supervision in my office (it was just me and the other student workers) meant we could goof off or do other activities when there was nothing else to do.

&amp;#x200B;

In my spare time, I really really love trying to repair broken electronics or creating new ones for projects I think of. I don't get to do it too much due to limited funds, but that's what I always thought being an electrical engineer really was. Besides that, I've been getting a lot into server/homelab stuff recently, getting comfortable with Linux GUI/CLI, setting up a Plex server and associated services, and pihole. I've been wanting to dabble in networking, probably following a free CCNA course, and have a few rackmount switches and routers at my disposal to learn with. I know that this end of things would have me doing more ""desk-job"" type stuff, but at least it would save me from the endless paperwork I currently have waiting for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry I know this was a super long post, so here's a summary if you don't wanna read it all.

TL;DR: Had an engineering internship- it was all desk work with a very unnerving work culture that I didn't fit in with. Had a job at a Help Desk during college that I enjoyed, but had to leave due to differences between me and my manager. Currently have a job that seems like it's going to be paperwork upon paperwork upon paperwork, which I really don't wanna do. Please read the paragraph above this one for my interests/hobbies."
h9ppn3,106,2020-06-15,Graduate school is not worth it,[deleted],UCDavis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/h9ppn3/graduate_school_is_not_worth_it/,"I'm a phd student and I want to let undergrads know that as a graduate student I don't think a phd or masters is worth it.

I was also an undergrad at UC Davis. My major was involved NPB and computer classes, so I was thinking of both graduate school and dental school in my senior year. An internship opportunity that led to published papers tipped me towards graduate school. I really enjoyed the research and learned a lot.

Once I got into grad school, I realized how it isn't really worth it and I've been slightly disenchanted with everything. I'm three years in now and I've seen my friends graduate from dental schools after three-four years. One of the reasons I didn't pursue the medical fields was the cost of these type of schools. With my PhD, I have been TAing to pay tuition. However, my family is all in the medical field and despite their +200,000 loans they make great money and have prospects to pay it off.

With a PhD, it seems slightly endless. The amount of support you get as a student is minimal. I was told to lead my project all on my own and to come up with my own ideas from the get go. This is normal for a PhD, but I don't think undergrad courses or internships prepare you much for independent nature. It is hard to make friends and find your place in graduate school since most of your peers might be +10 years older than you and married. As a younger student you might not feel like you belong. Additionally, the thing is you have come up with ideas, but if they don't work then you have nothing to show for you work and you might spend +10 years trying to prove something in your field. You feel like a student, but at the same time you don't have a teacher/professor really guiding you or teaching you. You are meant to figure it out and lead your own project and teach yourself. If you don't do well, then you risk never graduating with your degree.

This is a huge difference from professional schools, were you take classes and maybe have some internships or clinical. Mainly you have professors teach you material and you are only responsible for learning it in order to get your degree. Also the group of students in your cohort might be closer to your age.

Finally, the financial prospects of graduate school versus professional schools is minimal. I thought perhaps avoiding the +200,000 dollar loans would be better, but also the amount of money you are paid in the medical field exceeds what you make with a PhD. You might not even find a job with a PhD and the prospects of tenure are so low. A PhD is also very isolating. At times I go home from my lab without speaking to anyone else.

I understand that everyone should do what they love in life. I did love research when I was at my internship. I also understand that you shouldn't chase money, but let's be honest most people attend school to increase their income potentials or else you could learn everything online. Additionally, I have liked other fields in academia like art/humanities but I never pursued them due to the limited job prospects. I pursue these things as a hobby. So I think undergrads should know their real outlook of a PhD compared to professional schools. Don't be discouraged by taking loans and also if you can handle the blood of medical fields then please pursue it. The outcome is much more promising than a PhD and if I could turn back time I wouldn't have pursued a PhD. I just want people to know all aspects. I think I jumped in too fast from undergrad."
h9qajg,1,2020-06-15,Help With an Overbearing Parent,Th0waway435692,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/h9qajg/help_with_an_overbearing_parent/,"Some backstory: I'm 18 years old and from New York City. I came back home here to the city from college in March when the outbreak started. My father is the only other person here at the moment. Since he is about 70 years old, he's considered to be the ""at-risk"" population.

A couple of weeks ago, a couple of my friends and I decided it would be nice to play some music outside in a nearby park. We agreed we would always keep at least 5-6ft apart and would all always wear a mask. We also would not be sharing instruments or touching anything other than our own belongings. I thought this would be safe and reasonable since it was outside and we would all be wearing masks. It's also compliant with the guidelines set by the governor. Although our city, New York City, used to be a hotspot, it has become much safer and the cases are going down.

I've been incredibly diligent and responsible about being safe ever since the outbreak started here. Since my father is in the ""at-risk"" population, I have only gone outside to do grocery shopping once every 2 weeks and only to the park for quick walks. I haven't met with any of my friends or interacted with anyone. I always wear a mask as soon as I step outside, and I don't take it off. When I come back home, I go straight to the sink and wash my hands very thoroughly.

Here's where the overbearing part comes in. Although I planned the outside music playing 2 weeks ago, my father just said to me now (1 day before we are supposed to play) he's going to call his doctor to see if it is safe for us to play music outside. He says it's because he doesn't want to catch the virus and end up in the hospital.

I completely understand him not wanting to get the virus. No one does. What I don't understand, however, is why he would just decide this now. When I first told him about the idea to play outside 2 weeks ago, he said it was a good idea and was okay with it. At least a couple times a week, he goes outside to talk with a couple friends in the park and has been doing this regularly. This seems hypocritical to me.

In all likeliness, he's going to ask me to cancel playing music outside. How do I tell my friends, now that it's one day before we're supposed to play?

My father has always been pretty overbearing. He was the kind of parent who would email all my teachers very regularly through high school to see how my academic performance was. I believe he does these sort of things because he cares very deeply about me and worries a lot.

He  wouldn't let me play video games or watch any television until high school. Up until then, I could play 20 minutes of computer games a day on his computer.

He constantly questions my life choices and how I'm preparing for the future. He wants me to ""not waste the summer"" and to figure out a plan before tomorrow about what I'm going to do. He wants me to take online classes through the summer. I had a really difficult time transitioning to online classes for my regular college classes and I don't think I could do it. I already have a remote internship at a small magazine and am working on my 2nd language skills every day. It's not good enough for him.

I'm already stressed enough about the future without him constantly on my case.

A couple of my close relatives also just died recently, so I'm trying to get through that as well. He doesn't seem to understand how that's affected me.

Whenever I see my friends interact with their parents in such a friendly way, I think about how different that is from how I interact with my father. Can anyone else relate to this experience?

My question is; how do I deal with this and respond without hurting his feelings? Whenever I kindly and respectfully asked him not to email my teachers or to be so overbearing, he would go to the other extreme and say things like ""ok I won't ever talk to you again"" or ""ok I won't ever ask you about school again"".

Thank you for taking the time to read. Any advice is greatly appreciated. If you have any clarifying questions, please ask."
h9rs5g,7,2020-06-15,170 SWE importance,ORMStime,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/h9rs5g/170_swe_importance/,"Hello I'm a rising sophomore looking for a 4th class to add to 61c+ugba10+ee16b

already took: 61ab, ee16a(this summer), cs70, econ2

I had a good time in econ2 and I like self-studying business so ugba10 should be okay. I'm about to start ee16a next week so idk how hard that'll be. cs70 was super hard but I loved the content(I had Sahai and Babak). I don't know much about hardware so 61c might be hard

I'm trying to choose between cs170, cs188, or data100 for fall 2020. currently leaning towards data100 since I've heard its the easiest of the bunch and very practical for internships

I want to try and get a FAANG SWE or data science (or basically any) internship so I can try out new roles since I've only started coding since freshman year of Berkeley. I have a system engineer internship at a small company in Japan rn. mostly researching and implementing software, front end, and a bit of back end web dev using a CMS like drupal.

I keep hearing how important cs170 is for interviews so I'm afraid by taking data100 instead of cs170 I'll have a harder time trying to get a FAANG internship.

is cs170 really that important? Can data100 help me more for FAANG data sci internships?

I don't feel like I could handle 170 on top of the 2 other techs so I don't know what to do.

Would it be better to take:

 data100, cs170, ugba10, and ee16b 

instead of 

cs61c data100 ugba10, and ee16b ?

How useful is cs61c compared to data100? Is CS170 harder than 61c? or are they about the same difficulty?

Please give me some advice! Thank you!"

Dear University of Maryland community,                                                       

As  a nation, we are at a crucible moment in our history. We face a  pandemic that has caused widespread illness and death, and an economic  crisis with the highest unemployment rate in a generation. The toll of  both has been borne disproportionately by communities of color in  America, as well as the most disadvantaged among us.           

Recently, we have seen the largest and most sustained mass protests in  half a century against anti-black racism. The demands for justice have  prompted other institutions, including higher education, to confront  systemic racism embedded in organizational culture and policies.          

At the time of our nation's greatest peril, President Lincoln said that  ""a house divided cannot stand."" He believed that America cannot be a  free and equal democracy and, at the same time, tolerate inequality and  injustice. I am heartened to see the large number of peaceful and  racially diverse demonstrators for equity and justice. I believe there  is more that unites us than what divides us -- that in the face of  injustice and suffering, there is underlying solidarity, compassion, and  hope.         

Seeing all the young people in these protests calls to mind John Dewey's  observation that democracy must be reborn in every generation, and  education lies at the heart of this rebirth. I am confident that our  University community will meet the crucible moment. This is an  opportunity for transformation. Our Vice President for Diversity and  Inclusion, Georgina Dodge, will lead a campus-wide effort of senior  administrators, faculty, staff and students to increase shared  understandings, spur changes in policy, and promote actions to combat  institutionalized racism.           Mindful of the disparate impacts of COVID-19, our planning for a phased  and safe reopening of the physical campus takes into account  considerations of equity and inclusion.       

**Framework and plans for phased re-opening of the campus in fall 2020**

Over the past several weeks, the University has been engaged in an  extensive and collaborative effort to develop a framework and plans for  the phased reopening in fall semester 2020. This planning has been  coordinated with state and county officials and guided by  recommendations of the University System of Maryland (USM). The  University leadership is also consulting with the University Senate  leadership in this planning process.         

Seven work-groups, and numerous subcommittees, have worked tirelessly on  these plans. In all, over 200 faculty, staff, administrators, and  outside experts have been involved in this planning process.         

Four core principles inform the work of these groups:

* Prioritize the health and safety of every member of the University community.
* Protect and support the educational and research missions to maintain academic excellence.
* Make decisions grounded in our values of equity and inclusion.
* Provide  timely and transparent communication to, and obtain feedback from,  internal and external stakeholders about the proposed plans.

I will briefly  highlight the work group plans, and additional information will continue  to be added to [**umd.edu/virusinfo**](https://maestro.listserv.umd.edu/trk/click?ref=zvb24p867_2-2304x31f74x013820&amp;).  Risk management of COVID-19 is an evolving process. The disease is  evolving. Scientific and clinical knowledge of the disease is evolving.  The risks cannot be eliminated, but they can be reduced. We are putting  into place the personnel, organizational structures, and plans to manage  as responsibly as possible these risks as we gradually re-open the  campus. The University's response will evolve until a vaccine or  treatment is available.       

**Health and safety: a multifaceted and integrated plan for COVID-19 surveillance, testing, and early warning**

The University 's plan has five components to safely reopen and operate  the campus, with early identification of infectious cases as the key to  limit outbreaks.                                                             

(1) ***Daily self-monitoring and reporting of temperature and any onset of symptoms***  by all faculty, staff, and students who are on campus. Temperature  gauges will be provided and the reporting can be done electronically, or  by filling out a form, with safeguards for personal data privacy. If  there is fever and/or symptoms, diagnostic testing for SARS-COV2, the  virus that causes the COVID-19 disease, will be required. If the test is  positive, consultation with a health care provider and isolation will  be required.                                                             

(2) ***Population surveillance testing to ascertain the baseline infection rate on campus.***  At this time, our goal is to make this testing available to all faculty  and staff who wish to be tested, and to consider requiring it of all  students on campus. The CDC guidance is to test only when there are  symptoms. However, as some public health experts have pointed out, this  guidance does not take into account the fact that a large percentage of  infected persons are asymptomatic.           

Our University Health Center conducted a pilot test project last week  that involved about 250 volunteer faculty and staff and student  athletes. Nurse externs administered a nasal swab that is quick and  painless. The swab specimens were sent to a lab at the UMB Medical  School for PCR (polymerase chain reaction) testing, and the results came  back 24 hours later. 

(3) ***Contract tracing.***  Any positive diagnostic test result will be communicated immediately to  the state health authorities, who will then activate a contact tracing  team to identify potential secondary cases to limit spread of infection.  UMD will supplement, as needed, the state-administered tracing. We have  also established early contract tracing on our own campus.          

(4) ***Environmental monitoring.***  UMD faculty experts are developing opportunities for early detection of  impending illnesses by monitoring wastewater, air and high-touch  surfaces in campus buildings. This early warning system can identify  areas of concern to help prevent additional outbreaks.                                                              

(5) ***Behavioral changes.***  There will be a campus-wide health information campaign to promote  critical healthy behaviors: wear face covering at all times when in  proximity to others; stay 6 feet apart from others; frequent  handwashing; and stay home and rest, if sick.       

**Learning and teaching**

Provost Mary Ann Rankin is working to support faculty in creating new  and engaging curricula -- blended, online, and in-person -- together  with co-curricular opportunities in order to maximize student learning  and development. Members of our faculty have submitted more than 150  proposals to develop courses.          

Work continues to determine exactly which courses will be offered  in-person, online or in a blended format and what the room assignments  and daily schedule will be.  We expect that some portion of upper and  lower division undergraduate courses will be taught in-person with  priority given to classes that particularly need in-person instruction  to be maximally effective such as labs, performance courses, senior  capstone projects, clinical instruction and internships.  Because 6 feet  of physical distancing limits the number of students that can be  accommodated in a classroom, it is likely that most courses with 50 or  more students will be at least partially online, while low-enrollment  classes such as graduate and upper-division seminars will be good  candidates for in-person instruction.           

Faculty are also in workshops on personalizing and enriching the  learning experience of students, regardless of the modality of course  delivery. These changes, born of necessity, could end up transforming  learning and teaching at UMD long after the pandemic is over.         

Additional information should be available online by mid-July. Summer  Session I and II instruction is being delivered remotely. We will begin  the fall semester on August 31, 2020 as scheduled. Faculty are also  preparing contingency plans to move entirely to online instruction after  Thanksgiving break, should there be a resurgence of the pandemic in  late fall.        

**Research**

Under the leadership of Laurie Locascio, VP for Research for both UMD  and UMB, our large research enterprise that employs thousands of  research support staff, will re-open in several phases. Currently in  Phase 1 (“limited presence”), only about 25% of all researchers are back  in their campus labs. In Phase 2 (“intermediate presence”), proposed to  start in September 2020, about 50% of the researchers will return. In  Phase 3 (“full resumption”), proposed to start in January 2021, 75% of  the researchers will be back on campus.        

**Student life: housing, dining, co-curricular activities, mental health and wellness**

A residential experience is an important component of the collegiate  experience. VP for Student Affairs Patty Perillo and her team worked  closely with public health experts and with Prince George's County and  College Park officials on the housing plan.          

There are 8,900 bed spaces in University residence halls. To de-densify,  triples and quad units are converted to doubles, and floor lounges are  made into single or double rooms to minimize the opportunities for  larger gatherings. The approved plan is to offer University housing to  more than 75% of all the students who applied for housing, including all  first year students. This plan also sets aside residential spaces for  isolation and quarantining, if needed. Extensive procedures are also  being implemented for the safety and health of Resident Life staff,  housekeeping staff, and facilities staff who work in the residence  halls.          

Dining halls will open with reduced seating capacity, carry-out options,  and physical distancing. Stamp Student Union, Eppley Recreation Center,  and other community gathering places will reopen with appropriate  health and safety measures in place. Co-curricular programming will  emphasize outdoor and virtual activities. Once the fall semester begins,  the University Health Center and the Counseling Center will be open for  both in person medical assistance and counseling, as well as online  options for support.       

**Intercollegiate Athletics**

The Athletics Department has a comprehensive plan to safely return to  training, practice, competition, and work that complies with public  health guidelines as well as NCAA and Big Ten Conference requirements.          

Last week, football student-athletes were tested for COVID-19. They will  undergo a complete physical examination and undertake daily monitoring  of temperature and symptoms. Only individual training is permitted, on a  voluntary basis, with physical distancing. Pending guidance from health  officials, the extent of permissible training activities will be  expanded gradually.         Whether athletic teams can resume competition this fall, and under what  conditions, is unknown at this time, pending decisions by the NCAA and  the athletic conferences.       

 **Human Resources**

To de-densify the campus and ensure physical distancing, the gradual  return to campus of faculty and staff will be phased over several  months. Remote work, alternating days for in-person staffing, and  staggered arrivals/departures will be part of the gradual re-opening.                                                             Requirements for returning to work on campus can be found in a video at: [**return.umd.edu**](https://maestro.listserv.umd.edu/trk/click?ref=zvb24p867_2-2304x326c1x013820&amp;).  Please note that the video contains a ""UMD COVID-19 Community  Responsibility Pledge."" In the spirit of solidarity, it is imperative  that we share the responsibility for the safety and health of other  members of our community.          

A similar pledge and COVID-19 training will be prepared and given to students when they arrive on campus.       

**Fiscal Planning**

The University is working with USM, and USM is working with the State,  on the enormous budget impacts of COVID-19. At this time, the State's  Department of Budget and Management has not yet released its proposed  budget. We anticipate that there will be budget reductions, but we do  not yet know their magnitude. We expect that furloughs or temporary  salary reductions will have to be implemented, and we will share  additional details as soon as we receive the proposed state budget.        

 In conclusion, to the scores of faculty, staff, and students who have  worked tirelessly in helping develop the framework and plans for the  safe and gradual re-opening of the University, starting in fall 2020, I  want to say THANK YOU!  Because of your work, I am confident that we  will re-open the campus safely, and that our State's flagship university  will emerge from this trying time as an even stronger institution.                                                              

Please submit questions to [communityfeedback@umd.edu](mailto:ommunityfeedback@umd.edu) and your question will be directed to the appropriate campus unit.         

May you all stay safe and be well."

Firstly, sorry for the long post and I am sorry for any mistakes, english is not my main language. (But do feel free to correct me) 

I (22M) am a college student about to graduate and usually did good (not the absolute best grades but good enough to get and maintain a scholarship)

Throughout college I've had my share of plans and experiences. I live in a 3rd world country so it was not unusual for my family to struggle making ends meet. But my dad is that kind of person who can be struggling but never wants to show or admit it.

Since I was a child he wanted me to make friends that ""belongs to our status"" however, it was common for any new group of friends that he approved to be constantly making expensive plans that I simply couldn't afford, so I never really felt like I belong into any group.

I still have my friends, but we very rarely text (partly my fault) but in the end it's obvious that we don't have many common interests or things to talk about.

I had a job as an intern in a insurance company but I really hated it. I did give it some effort (not much really) because I felt I would be ungrateful for me not to appreciate the chance I was given. I proposed a couple of improvements and was given the opportunity to move upward in the company. 

I felt cornered. They offered the job to me and my boss was happy and said that she wanted me to know everyone in upper corporate. 
Thing is I had already planned to leave as soon as my contract finished.
Then I made the mistake to tell my parents, told them that I hated the company and the job. I have personally seen what they did to their customers. And was furious, because they mostly got away with it. So I really didn't want to do a career path there.

Long story short, I was naive and ungrateful. All companies are the same and I am wasting such a great opportunity.

Then just as I was doing the paperwork to get promoted, covid hits and my country was one of the first down here in South America to go into isolation.

I saw the chance and took it. I told my parents that I was not going to be promoted anymore because of the crisis. And they told me that I should work double to prove that I am a necessary asset.

Actually the only thing that helped me move forward was my gf, she has been an extremely great support on this and probably the only reason I am not really feeling depressed in itself.

Right now I am lying at home , telling them that I am still an intern working from home and they believe me because I am using  my savings to give them some monthly money and close my room doors while I am ""working""

In reality I quit two weeks ago, and I kind of left on the worst possible terms so it is really not a possibility to ask for my job back. 

Thing is, I thought I would be productive on all this extra time, but I really can't find the motivation. 

I have been feeling extra down lately, but I don't think I am depressed, because It is kind of normal of me to do the bare minimum of effort for people not to suspect that I am lazy.
(Enough to get the grades necessary for the scholarship, for people at work to think I am actually giving a sh*t, and so on with many other aspects of my life)

I really really want to change this,  to do all the productive things I planned on doing. To take care of my body again. (Over the last years I have gained around 40 kg and I want to go back to the time were I cared) 

But being productive is becoming way too hard. I no longer know what to do, I feel like if I continue like this I am going to fail every plan I had for my life and future.

So guys if anyone have had a similar experience, I would greatly appreciate any advice to see how is it that you get motivation for your everyday life.

TLDR: I would really appreciate any special advice of how you guys get yourself motivated to go on and be productive and care for the day."

But, there *is* some new information. I took some time to take away all the bureaucratic fluff and give as concise of a summary as possible as to what we know so far as to how students and staff will be affected in Fall 2020. 

# Monitoring/Testing 

&gt; All students/faculty/staff will be required to take and report their temperatures daily electronically. Thermometers will be provided. 

&gt; Immediate testing will be done for anyone showing symptoms of the virus. 

&gt; If testing returns positive, isolation is mandatory, as will be consultation with medical professionals. In addition, contact tracing will be conducted by state health officials to determine other individuals at risk. 

&gt; Baseline testing for all students/staff/faculty will be available at the beginning of the semester. 

&gt; There is a possibility that all students will required to be tested at the beginning of the semester. 

&gt; UMD is working on ways to monitor the environment on campus (air, wastewater, common areas) for signs of illnesses as an advance warning system. 

&gt; Face coverings will be ~~required~~ **heavily recommended** when in proximity of others (read: when in public). 

&gt; Social distancing of 6 feet will be heavily encouraged. 

&gt; Other safety measures (handwashing, staying home when sick) will be heavily promoted. 

# Impact on Classes

&gt; Courses with 50 or less students will be prioritized for In-Person instruction. 

&gt; Larger classes will primarily be conducted online. 

&gt; Courses which require in-person instruction will be given priority, such as labs, performance, internships, clinical studies, and senior capstone projects. 

&gt; Exact lists for which courses will be Online vs In-Person are in development. 

&gt; Summer Session I and II are being delivered remotely. 

&gt; Classes may move fully online after Thanksgiving break, if there’s another spike in cases. 

&gt; More information will be available mid-July. 

# Research

&gt; Phased reopening plan. 

&gt; Currently only 25% of researchers are on campus. 

&gt; Planned to raise to 50% at the start of Fall 2020 and 75% at the start of Spring 2021. 

# Housing 

&gt; Triples and Quads will be converted to Doubles. 

&gt; Floor Lounges will be converted to singles/doubles. 

&gt; ~75% of students who applied for housing on-campus will actually receive it. 

&gt; Priority will be given to incoming freshman. 

&gt; Some housing will be reserved for quarantining. 

&gt; Safety procedures will be implemented for ResLife staff within Residential areas. 

# Dining Halls

&gt; Reopening with reduced seating. 

&gt; Carry out options. 

&gt; Social distancing requirements. 

# Recreation

&gt; Stamp, Eppley, others will reopen with precautions in place. 

&gt; Co-Curricular planning will be relegated to outdoor and virtual activities where possible. 

&gt; Health and Counseling Centers will be open both in-person and with online options. 

# Athletics

&gt; Football team tested, currently only doing individual training.

h9vrib,3,2020-06-15,Scrapy Splash Help,fakyu2,learnpython,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/h9vrib/scrapy_splash_help/,"Hi, I have been learning webscraping lately and started out with scrapy. Lately I volunteered at my internship to scrape some leads to have my foot in the door, but ended up having my foot in my mouth.

Let's say it's a Sales Navigator page at popular website named similar to ""Linkin Park"". They definitely use JS so I need to use Scrapy-Splash or Scrapy-Selenium and run a full browser, and also they don't allow any bots whatsoever. But I don't need bots as I'm logging in using my credentials.

Here's a couple of questions if anybody could please help me out with it.

1. Can I turn robots.txt in my settings. py file to false, since I'm logging in as a user?
2. For logging in first I tried the Extract CSRF and post data using Formrequests.from\_response method.

&amp;#8203;

         def parse_login(self, response):
        
             csrf_token = response.xpath('//form//@value').get()
             yield FormRequests.from_response(response, formdata={'csrf_token': csrf_token, 'user':'username', 'pass':'password'}, callback=self.parse_after_login)

But I structured it around to work with Splash as I don't want to detected as a bot, it also grabs the headers required for the subsequent requests. Yet it still doesn't work.

2b) Is it because I'm missing Headers in correct order. How do I check if my headers are correct? My USER-AGENT is the latest chrome browser in settings py so I don't need to worry about that.

h9wqgb,819,2020-06-16,I‘m extremely discouraged and I need to vent.,Estragonia,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/h9wqgb/im_extremely_discouraged_and_i_need_to_vent/,"Tl,dr: Beginner worked hard in her new job to understand the project and framework she worked on but is forced to join a new team with a more complicated project and a new framework; feels like her entire work in the last few months was for nothing.

I only started to learn JavaScript on Udemy about 6 months ago so I‘m still fairly new to programming. I was extremely lucky to find an apprenticeship in a company which will start in September. Until then I‘m already at the company as an intern, so I can get a headstart, get to know the project etc. I was hired for the internship in March when suddenly the entire world changed due to Covid and I spent the first 8 weeks of my internship working from home. 

It was a challenge. I cried a lot especially during the first two weeks because I felt so overwhelmed. When I got hired, I did stress that I needed structure and somebody to tell me „learn this, then learn that.“ because I was so new to the field. Well, that didn’t pay off. 

My supervisor said his plan was to let me work on tickets on the project and whenever I bump into things I don’t know, I should google and learn and figure things out and close my knowledge gaps.

Idk but I feel like this is not a great approach for a beginner, especially since we were not only working with JavaScript but with PHP/Symfony and VueJS, also Sass and a lot of other stuff. There were no gaps that I could fill because I lacked basic knowledge in these frameworks and languages.

After two weeks of constant crying at home alone in front of my computer, I finally talked to my supervisor and we agreed that 2 days a week I can just completely focus on learning the languages and frameworks with tutorials without feeling pressure of having to work on tickets.

Things started to get better then. I still struggle a lot with PHP and Symfony but I can’t really express what exactly my problem with it is. VueJS on the other hand worked great for me and I started to really feel like I could finally solve problems and contribute to the project. I‘m not an expert by far but I understand the structure and feel comfortable with it.

Last week, it got announced that our project was basically dead and our team would be split and everyone would join a new team. 

That was a shock. I learned that my new team does not work with Vue but with React, so in the last week I spent a lot of time reading up on React and watching tutorials, even started a little project on my own to understand the basic concepts.

Yesterday I was able to look at the new project for the first time and my first impulse was to cry again. So many new concepts I had never seen, really complicated code, a structure I could not understand etc. 


I feel so exhausted. In the last 3 months I spent every single day coding and/or learning how to code. Every weekend, every night so I could finally achieve some small successes and stay motivated.
Now I feel like I have to start over completely and put in so much work again until I finally feel like I can contribute.

It sucks so much and I‘m crying again because I feel that all my work was for absolutely nothing. First this Covid shit which made my start so hard, a supervisor who is just such a genius that he doesn’t understand a beginner‘s problem and is unable to explain coding concepts to me and now this shit. 

I‘m tired and I‘m frustrated as hell. I feel like I wanna give up.

I actually do enjoy coding. Building little web apps in my free time is really cool and fun. The monstrous projects at work however are scary and overwhelming af. I wanna get to the point where I understand what I‘m doing but sometimes I feel so lost because there is SO MUCH TO KNOW. I feel like for every new concept I learn, 5 others pop up that I need to read up on and the pile is getting bigger and bigger.

And so far nobody has even put real pressure on me at work. It’s all internal because I hate being the new girl who doesn’t know shit. I hate being the only girl at work who is a developer but also being the most junior. I feel responsible for representing my gender in this field and be at least as good as the others. I hate feeling like a drag when I ask for advice because everyone has deadlines and no real time to teach me. 

I will join the new team tomorrow and I‘m scared. The code is scary, my new team leader apparently isn’t as nice as my old one, I‘m scared of the expectations my new team has for me and that I cannot meet them.

I don’t know what to do to get my head out of this dark place. I‘ve been reading a lot about imposter syndrome but I feel like it doesn’t really apply since I‘m literally a beginner and there is not much to look back on and reassure myself that I actually know what I‘m doing. I don’t.

I did learn a lot in these past three months. But it doesn’t feel like it was enough and most of it was a framework which I won’t need anymore.

Thank you for reading, if you made it this far. I just needed to vent and let it all out. I‘m really desperate and don’t know what to do. I try to push through but it‘s hard. Really really fucking hard.

Edit: So, this kind of blew up.:D Again, I want to thank everyone for commenting and sharing their thoughts. I can't believe how positive the responses were and will try to reply to at least some of you (As some of you have already guessed, I have a tendency to perfectionism, so I do feel the urge to reply to every single comment, just to show my gratefulness that someone actually took time out of their day to give me advice and help me feel a little better). If I don't respond, please know that I read your comment and truly appreciate you and your advice. 

Some things I should maybe clarify:
When I started applying in January, I was specifically looking for an apprenticeship. I'm from Germany, so I'm not 100% sure if the apprenticeships here are the same as elsewhere. It's basically an alternative to going to college, although less focused on theory and science. You basically go to work for two weeks and have one week of school where you have time to study for a period of 3 years. You have a degree afterwards but it's seen as worth less than a bachelor's degree. Apprenticeships are targeted towards total beginners and very young people (usually between 16 and 22) although I believe most do know at least some basics of programming. I knew that being 28, female and having almost no experience in progamming would make me an outsider in the application process, so believe me when I say, I sent applications to Every. Single. Opening. I could find. I won't earn a lot for the next 2-3 years during the apprenticeship, but at least I will have some sort of income while I develop my skills and earn a degree. The internship got offered to me to give me a headstart before going to school, so I can eventually shorten my apprenticeship and become a proper developer earlier.

So, yes, I am very fucking lucky indeed and I believe that's part of why I put so much pressure on myself. I wanna perform well and I don't want to disappoint. My employer/supervisor saw something in me when he hired me over the other candidates (who were all younger and had finished at least 1 or 2 semesters of CS in uni). 

My supervisor will still be my supervisor for the rest of my apprenticeship but he won't be my team leader any more. I saw the new team leader with some of my new team members in the hallway today and thought it would be a good idea to proactivly introduce myself as I have been very timid and shy in my old team and didn't want to make the same mistake. It was honestly super awkward and he didn't seem too happy to have a beginner join his team. Granted, he didn't choose me and was kind of steam rolled last week by the decision that me and another guy from my old team would join his, so maybe it was just that. I hope.

What I really seem to crave is empathy. Just a pat on the back from a colleague, telling me they know what I go through would really help. I hope there will be at least one person who I can talk to when I need venting or emotional support. I will be sitting next to my new teamleader, so he'll be the first person I'll direct my questions at and I just pray to God that he's patient with me. 
I'll know more tomorrow at 9.

I did dive deeper into the new project today and it made somewhat more sense but is still not less intimidating. A lot of backend logic is implemented which at this point is probably my greatest weakness. But as you guys said, it's a good opportunity to learn more and actually maybe work on this weakness instead of just grabbing easy frontend styling tickets all the time.

I will try and update tomorrow and let you know how it went.

———————-

Update: I had my first day yesterday and it went alright. I was really nervous to meet the new boss and one of the first things he said when he came in was that in his opinion there couldn’t be a worse time for them to have us join the team.

That made me feel welcome as you can imagine.

He then showed us the project which is even more massive than I had anticipated. But I tried to  write down as much as I could and asked questions and really tried to pay attention which I think left a good impression.

At one point he helped my set up the project on my computer and I had to deploy a script which I for the life of my couldn’t do because I was in the wrong directory, made typos all the time etc. All while he was sitting next to me, looking at my screen. I just took a deep breath and said „Hey, I‘m sorry, I‘m usually better at using the console, I‘m just nervous right now.“

I don’t know what he thought about me saying that but addressing it really helped me and I was a lot calmer afterwards.

He then assigned tickets to us and I was actually pretty happy with mine because it took a lot of time for me to figure it out but it was doable and I got to get to know the project and styled components in React.

We also went for lunch with the team which went great. There are a few people my age who I believe I clicked with. I could be myself, make jokes etc and I believe they liked it. Even the scary boss laughed a couple of times.

I‘m on my way to work right now and am so much calmer than yesterday.

It probably really was my anxiety getting to me and making me imagine all these horrible scenarios and letting me suffer in advance for no good reason. I will keep this in mind and try to remember this situation for next time. Thanks again for reading, writing and generally being awesome people, you‘ve helped me so much!"

Not good enough to do what I do.,distortedSineWave,embedded,https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/h9y5c6/not_interested_in_what_am_doing_not_good_enough/,"I know these kind of questions are posted here often but here is another career question for you guys.

I'm a Electronics and Telecommunication Engineer. I completed by Bachelor's last summer and got a job an IT company where I've been working on a mundane application support project. Life is chill there is not much work to be done at any given point of time and there is absolutely no growth, career wise.

I've been thinking about making the switch to an embedded systems job but there are only two kinds of vacancies available. 

1. 5-10 years experience, should know embedded Linux, Embedded C/C++, one or more RTOS, Multiple uC/uP (mostly ARM/RISCV, rarely AVR/PIC), sometimes DSP/Matlab etc.
2. For freshers/zero experience, should know Arduino/Raspberry Pi, must know basics of PCB design less to no pay, internship for 6 months.

Now I know that most companies in this field cannot really afford to train newbie engineers but I'm not sure if the Arduino/RPi internships are going to do anything to help me get into embedded either.

Personally I have worked on various microcontrollers (LPC2148, LPC1768, STM32F407) using embedded C. But i have never used a RTOS (except in Lab courses during college). I also know basic VHDL and I've worked on Xilinx Spartan 3 and Spartan 6 FPGAs. But I feel I'm very far from the skills required in this industry. I have identified the following areas that I need to learn.

1. Embedded C++ (this seems to be growing in popularity)
2. Linux and Embedded Linux (I know only a few basic linux commands)
3. Using RTOS
4. Firmware Development

What would be the best way to learn this stuff by myself? Can you guys suggest any courses for this? How do I transition to an embedded job if there is experience needed in most places? I believe I learn best from hands on experience but I have no idea how to get this experience."

h9ypsq,1,2020-06-16,NUS BIZ Module Planning (seeking advice),Sufficient_Nobody,nus,https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/h9ypsq/nus_biz_module_planning_seeking_advice/,"Hi there, hope everyone is well! 

I'm a Biz student going into 3rd year this coming August and would like if anyone could advise &amp; share some knowledge. 

I'm in the midst of planning how many classes I'll be taking each sem for my last 2 years, and I'm becoming quite worried because it seems like I'll be overloading most semesters until Y4S2. My degree plan is to Double spec in Marketing &amp; Econs, with a minor in CNM. I have completed all my GE mods, and the only core mod I have left is BSP3701. 

Unfortunately, I failed one core module last sem (FIN2704 lol) which I am going to re-take this Special Term along with a minor mod (still trying to appeal to get a slot). Furthermore, my SEP uni for Y3S2 (initially got Y3S1 but they pushed back) only allows me to take 4 mods, I held on to this option because I was worried that it would be more competitive to get a slot if I withdrew and reapplied. 

**As of now, my future module schedule would look like this:** 

* ***Special Term 2*** \- FIN2704, 2x 2K CNM mod **(8MCs)** ; hopefully I'm able to get the NM mod
* ***Y3.1*** \- BSP3701, 4x 3K Econs, 1x 3K Marketing **(24MCs)**
* ***Y3.2 (SEP)*** \- 4x 3K Marketing **(16MCs)**
* ***Y4.1*** \- 2x 2K CNM mods, 1x 3K CNM mod, 3x Honors mods **(24MCs)**
* ***Y4.2*** \- 2x 3K Econs, FSP **(16MCs) --&gt; 20MCs if I can't do my 2kNM mod in Special Term**

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If I'm not able to secure my NM mod for Special Term, then I would need to do it in Y4.2

I'm not really sure how the Honors module thing works, like whether I am able to split the MCs up like that, or whether I have to take everything at once? If there are any current Year 4s/recent graduates, how did you guys plan your 4th year? And is it hard to be doing 24MCs in the final year?

I've tried not to overload in the past as I know myself to get really stressed out with a lot of classes to handle (I already get stressed with doing 5 mods), on top of that I'm part of Exco in my CCA. I've heard that overloading isn't really that hard, but maybe it might be challenging if I'm overloading mostly 3k mods? 

To me, it looks like I'm kind of at roads end and there's nothing else I really can do other than to just go through with taking 24MCs in Year 4. I've tried emailing my SEP school to ask whether I can take 5 modules, but they told me they weren't able to do that. Furthermore, I would like to probably do more Special Terms but the next 2 summers would be internship periods, so I don't think I can do that. 

I think the best thing to happen right now is if my SEP gets cancelled again (touchwood!) so then I could go ahead and overload in Y3.2. But that would be so sad for me because I am really looking forward to SEP!

I would also consider perhaps a Winter school, but the expenses are really out of my budget, but if anyone has any advice on this I'm open to hearing about it! 

That's about it, I hope I didn't leave anything out. Hopefully, someone has advice on some possibilities/avenues I can try out. I'm just worried about how the workload will affect me mentally for the next 2 years, and I want to try to find some solutions for it. 

Thanks for reading! I hope everyone is finding ways to engage themselves, but Phase 2 is near so hopefully that's some good news! 

TL;DR: Want to avoid overloading classes in Y4 Honors year, any advice on how to do this?"
h9zu8g,10,2020-06-16,Am I in over my head?,SoulsBloodSausage,ElectricalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricalEngineering/comments/h9zu8g/am_i_in_over_my_head/,"I’ll preface this by saying that I’m actually a Computer Engineering student. Unfortunately, too late I discovered both that I thoroughly enjoy hardware/EE stuff and that my Uni’s CE program is completely lame. It’s not even accredited and the whole “CS and EE” thing feels half baked when EE is a complete afterthought. I love programming and don’t completely regret it, but I do wish the program was more 50/50 on CS and EE rather than the 80/20 it seems to be. 

Aside from 2 circuits courses and 2 signals and systems (continuous/discrete), I have literally not taken any more EE classes (that’s all that’s required). I remember the basics of KVL/KCL/Ohm’s law and vaguely remember how to interpret the CTFT/DTFT/Z transform, but that’s basically the extent of my EE knowledge. 

Anyways, I’ve been pretty lucky and got an internship recently. The work sounds like it’ll awesome, but I was given a practice exam to test my knowledge. The content seemed to be entirely on RF topics. I was being asked things that I honestly would never be able to solve with the current breadth of my knowledge (I can’t remember exactly but they included questions like how to extend the range of an RF antenna, how the sun’s rays affect RF signals). I did poorly, which my company mentor said he expected and we could work together on, but it still makes me feel terrible. My question is, do EE students understand and remember this stuff that well? My courses in EE felt so mechanical like “solve this RLC circuit” that I can probably still do so but I can’t for the life of me explain or even remember why a resistor acts the way it does, the physics behind a MOSFET, how noise might affect an RF circuit. Basically any “how” or “why” question is foreign to me. Do you think I’m in over my head?

TLDR: new internship feels like I need to know a great deal of EE topics but my CE program greatly prioritizes CS over EE. How screwed am I?"

I want to ask you guys whether I should go to the UK or US  cause I got accepted at both place. So for the UK, I got in Newcastle University with 50% scholarship with Bs Honors in Business Management. The amount I pay is 20000$. For the US school, I got into Oberlin College Econ maj with financial aid ,and i pay 30000$.
One is in around top 20 UK, the other one is top 30 US LAC. Newcastle is a better city and maybe better job placement, but at the same time Oberlin is really strong at music and I love love piano, the internship opportunities in US are plenty as well.
I do code as well so I plan to work in data industry, maybe business analyst.
But just as you can see, both uk and us are not doing very okay at this time and I want to ask u guys opinion about which school to join."

During my final recovery phase i joined an startup but it wasn't much of major's work most of it was dealing with clients and selling servers to them but i did it only to get back on my foot because bed rest for a long time affects your brain badly.

I left the company due to some Salary issues and was interested in doing something in IT so i revised my big data learnings and started Machine learning and data science so that i could grab a decent package job but during this corona happened and wherever i apply they say i don't have the relevant experience so i applied for intern positions at big companies like Microsoft and Amazon but they didn't shortlist me so i am stuck.

I would have let it go or started a small job but my family business has suffered heavily during corona so i need to get a decent paying job to take care of all the family chores and emis. 

Any help would be welcomed."
ha23it,3,2020-06-16,Pursuing indie game development straight out of college - bad idea?,wienour,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ha23it/pursuing_indie_game_development_straight_out_of/,"So I'm about to graduate from UC San Diego with a B.S. in computer science with a pretty decent internship under my belt. I need a few summer classes to be completely done (and those start in August) so I wanted to pursue a full project during the time that I have during the summer. I decided I want to pursue an indie game. If it matters, the idea is a 2D coop game with pixel graphics, think Risk of Rain 1 or Stardew Valley.

However, in the past couple weeks thinking about how to design the game and how to code it, I've realized that this is going to take a while and that this is not just a summer-long endeavor. Perhaps I *could* come up with an enticing prototype that could be enough to fund the game from a publisher or a crowdfunding source or something, but even that's generous. It's going to take a while, especially with a team of only 2 or 3 people (it's a 2D game if that helps at all).

The big problem is that if I wanted to pursue indie game development full time, it means I'm going to be putting my career on hold. I could work for 6 months trying to get a good polished prototype I could show off, but if it ends up failing I'm set back quite a bit in my career if I decide to go back to applying to jobs.

So, a couple questions:

* How stupid of an idea is it to hold off job searching in order to create a game? Let's say I fail after 6 months (about 3 months after I'm officially done with school) of developing a game and decide to quit. Is this career gap detrimental, even if it's only a few months? What if it was a 6 month gap? 1 year? Is the excuse of ""I was pursuing indie game development"" good enough for companies?

* Is my desire to go full indie game dev without real work experience in game dev a stupid idea? I'm experienced with everything related to game development, but I don't have *work* experience.

* Is it realistic to pursue indie game development part time while holding a full-time job? I suppose this depends on the person though.

I'm not going to try to convince anyone that my idea is good or that I'll be successful. I'm quite confident in my own abilities and judgment of game design/ideas, but obviously people like me are a dime a dozen. I think it's safe to assume the worst case scenario."

I have recently got an internship for a Bioinformatician place. It starts in a month. My background is largely Computer Science. However I study Human Computer Interaction, therefore Ive studied some cellular biology at University Level. I am a Second Year University student, I believe I have a good understanding of Algorithms and Machine Learning which will help me however I am looking for tips to prepare for walking into a lab (an environment il be very new too) and being able to impress &amp; understand the other scientists. For example besides staying up to date with recent events perhaps people could suggest some essential papers/studies that everyone in Bioinformatics should know or book recommendations. 

My knowledge of genetics is quite limited (Ive researched bioinformatics algorithms however would like to improve my topical knowledge) so Im looking for a good and relevant place to start.

Any tips are welcome thankyou."

ha2jf6,2,2020-06-16,Switching career to SWE,TheCodeBlooded,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/ha2jf6/switching_career_to_swe/,"Hi everyone. I have an engineering background (embedded systems) currently working in London. I had initially planned to pursue higher studies but I am now I am a bit skeptical about it looking at the career prospects and growth opportunities. 

Talking to my friends/connections in SWE, I have developed an interest for it seems an exciting field and I like working in a dynamic environment.

I recently started diving into the data structures and algorithms concepts. I have been grinding LC for the past 2 months and after about 100 or so problems, I have started getting the hold of it. That said, I am trying to prepare myself for engineering roles in product-based companies. Obviously, I do not have any internship/work experience in the said field. Nor do I have any SWE/development projects on my CV yet. 

I only have experience with embedded C,  C++ (GUI programming), and Python for automation and simulation data analysis. I am planning to dedicate the next 6 months to do some portfolio projects and prepare for coding interviews. I am still thinking about whether to take a self-taught route or consider going to immersive Bootcamp to have a track.

What I would like to know is whether the FAANG/ Big-Ns or even any medium-tier company would even consider me for an entry-level role or an internship in SWE. I have heard stories about people making a career switch even at a very later stage in their careers. 

So how does it work? Am I being too unrealistic, given that the current situation is already so bad even for the experienced ones? How do I break into it? Not only I have to build an amazing portfolio but also stand out. I am aware it might take a lot longer than just 6 months or even a year, but I think I really want to pursue it.

Thanks in advance.

TL;DR - I am 25 year old non-CS grad with unrelated 3-year work exp. in embedded systems looking to switch to SWE."

I took the first job offer I had just because the benefits were really good (4 weeks PTO, flexible schedule, and 100% employer paid health and dental) and I thought I needed to have a job lined up after I graduated. So I started the Monday after I graduated...

I’ve been at this job for six months now as an executive assistant to the CEO, and I’m getting paid $15/hr, or about $31k/year. The work I do is very mindless and I definitely didn’t need to go to school to do it. I wouldn’t say I hate the work I do, but I don’t like it. On the bright side, the management is great and the benefits are amazing. 

I did an internship last summer, and my boss recently reached out to me about a new job that she thinks I would be good at. She said “I have a job for you if you want it!” Lol. It would be $42-45k/year and I would be a resource development manager who manages memberships and sponsorships of the company. It seems a lot more exciting and I like that I’d be paid more. Plus, I liked the environment of this workplace better than my current workplace. 

Sounds like a no brainer right? 

Well, I’m planning on moving in with my long distance boyfriend in about 6-7 months when his lease is up. 

What would you do if you were in my situation? Should I stay at my current job and wait it out another 6 months before I move? Should I take this new job and then leave another job after 6 months? Or should I take this new job and wait it out at least a year and put off moving in with my boyfriend?

I’m very torn. Also, because I’ve only been working at my current job for 6 months and I feel like I owe them to stay here at least a year. They’re great people and I don’t want to leave them hanging- although i do mindless things, they’re important things that need to get done. 

Thanks for helping!"
ha51e4,2,2020-06-16,How to get over intense coding anxiety?,csthrowaway839817927,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ha51e4/how_to_get_over_intense_coding_anxiety/,"This year I got a job programming at a company I'm really excited about where there'll be high expectations on my performance.

I used to love to code. I turned to it for relaxation (crack open a beer and start coding in the evenings, that type of thing). I loved doing it all the way through college. When I started doing internships though, coding began to lose its relaxation element.  I used to love reading about new concepts in CS and now I'm just overwhelmed. Every mistake I make, anytime I don't get a concept immediately, anytime I mess something simple up, I get intensely nervous and close all my editors (which, as you all know, is not a practical mindset for coding). I get a lump in my throat when I sit down to work. I fidget and can't decide how to begin. Plainly, I'm nervous all the time \*and\* I lost the thing that I used to turn to for relaxation, which compounds the whole situation.

I was hoping this would just go away but it's been nearly six months and it hasn't, so I wanted to ask for advice. If any of you have been in a similar situation, how'd you get over it?

ha6lhd,644,2020-06-16,Young Interns: Don't burn yourselves out,peregrin5,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/ha6lhd/young_interns_dont_burn_yourselves_out/,"I'm an older student who is career switching, and so unfortunately, I have to start all the way at the bottom among a lot of other younger students, and this has reminded me of the way I used to be when I was young. I'm doing an internship now at 30+ with a previous career under my belt, and the other intern is probably 19 or 20, still in the middle of college before starting his first career.

This internship is pretty far away for both of us and we have the option to work remote, but before I could stop him, he volunteered to be in the office every day (a 3 hour drive daily--15 hours a week of just driving \[and our travel fees aren't compensated\])  and come in at 7 am daily (which means he will have to wake up at least by 5 am or so daily. And then asked if he could do overtime every week.

No doubt he was trying to impress our employer with his ability to burn out his life-force for this job. I don't blame him really. It's probably his very first job and he feels like he's in a precarious position. Maybe he's hoping they'll hire him full time after this. The thing I want to say to him and to all of you younger engineers out there: don't burn yourselves out for this job.

Most companies will let you, and are glad to find an employee who will sacrifice their entire life to work for them for the lowest pay they can give you, but they aren't looking out for you. They're looking out for themselves. This is a very quick path to burnout and hating the field you chose to study. And it also sets a dangerous precedence. If by chance he does get hired there long term, they will likely expect him to work at that same pace but with even more added responsibilities.

It's not worth it.

When I was his age, I did the exact same thing, and learned a lot of lessons. You need to be the ones to advocate for yourselves. You need to set limits on what is your work life and what is your personal life, and how much of your free time you're willing to spend commuting, or doing extra work for your company. You may think you can devote 110% of your life force to working, but you can't. You WILL burn out. There is a reason most people who have been in the industry for a long time learn how to separate their home life and work life, and seem to have sane hours of work and even perks like working at home.

Don't burn yourself out."
hab1lm,3,2020-06-16,Should I (19F) quit my start-up internship?,annetenna,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/hab1lm/should_i_19f_quit_my_startup_internship/,"This internship has showed me that I might want to reconsider continuing my education in Computer Science.

I'm a software developer intern, and right now I'm working with and learning React Native and AWS. The thing is, I've quickly realized that this lifestyle may not be for me. I hate sitting at a computer 8 hours a day, doing nothing but coding, looking things up, troubleshooting, etc. Since this is a start-up company, there are only 3 other people who work in my ""department"", and my mentor is a nice guy but he's clearly very busy with his own work and only really has time to answer specific questions. The other two interns are extremely unfriendly and don't even respond to me when I say good morning.

I understand this is just the standard office job. I understand that being at a start-up is nicer than a corporate environment. However, I just can't help but feel so unfulfilled when I leave work, feeling like I'm already giving my life away to do things I don't want to do. My commute is two hours total (1 hour each way), so I work an 8-6 day, and by the time I get home I'm too burnt out to put valuable time into my side hobbies.

I'm a rising sophomore, so I feel like I'm fairly early enough in my career that if I were to quit, it wouldn't be detrimental to my future (I am also fortunate enough to live at home with my parents for free).

I suppose I need to ask this because I don't know the distinction between 1) being unable to grow up and just swallow my unhappiness and stick it out for the sake of my career, or 2) making decisions that will make me happier and exploring different options to figure out what I actually want in the future."

My last company I had a salary of 80k + around 5k in annual bonus's. The real benefit here was the true unlimited PTO policy. I probably took 4ish weeks a year. 

I am negotiating with the contracting company (they want to hire, if we can come to an agreement) for $75/hr. My agent thinks he can get them to pay that, but if they are also hiring someone with 10ish years experience for the same rate, they probably won't budge. However my previous work experience + tools all match what they are looking for even though its only \~3 years. Agent wants me to consider $60-65 hr.

Does this still make sense at $60-65 an hour? I would be a W2 employee through an agency but also wondering if I should go full independent (1099) as I can do my benefits through my wife (very stable job and good benefits) to get a better rate. I realize my tax rate will change then, but the rate might offset that. Wife and I have no debt, good savings, and early in our careers.

Any thoughts? I am thinking if I like the work, I am also getting double paid for a month since if I accept the job, I can start in the next week or two. Also gaining some experience in the medical industry that may open my career options down the road. However, contracting will always raise my unemployment risk. So I am asking for some input from you guys on if this sounds like a decent deal, or if I should keep looking for a salaried position. All opinions welcome :D"
habeqz,4,2020-06-16,Female non-traditional college student seeking for challenges in STEM majors,princesamango,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/habeqz/female_nontraditional_college_student_seeking_for/,"I'm a 26 year old female who spent too much time going down a path that I thought was meant for me, but now finding excitement in other paths. I'm no longer interested in social work and love all the challenges I can take on if I become a STEM major.

I'm not the greatest at math especially since it's been a decade or longer that I've done any. I still need to take a pre-algebra class at my community college to get to the higher levels of math. Yet, I'm okay with this after getting a bit of advice from my husband to just do my baby steps through the math classes. There are a lot of topics in different sciences that I can't help but get excited about when I see them in different colleges or I get really excited about the different jobs that are available across the US. I really want to do this and I know I can if I stay motivated.

**My interests lie in**:

* Biosystems engineering; I found out about this today and it sounded way cooler than environmental engineering! I want to research this one more because I love to learn about alternative energy and also dive into aquaculture and learning how to utilize natural resources that don't result harming the environment.

&amp;#x200B;

* Biotechnology; I researched this one last night and it seems fascinating. Though, I looked at more of the marine side of this one where you collect samples from the ocean and use for pharmaceuticals and other products. This sounds really fun to me!

&amp;#x200B;

* Marine sciences; Even though I don't know how to swim or dive (ironic cause I live in California), marine science has always had my interest since four years ago when I tried to volunteer at an aquarium but had an anxiety attack and needed to quit. But I have an interest in marine biology and oceanography. I'm even considering volunteering or interning at the aquarium again to get some knowledge.

&amp;#x200B;

* Plant pathology/botany; I haven't done too much research into plant pathology and again I'm picking something that I haven't done before. I've done any kind of landscaping or gardening, but I like the idea of working with plants and how they're affected in the ecosystem.

&amp;#x200B;

* Geology; Now, for geology, I didn't do too well when I first took the class like three or four years ago but there were a couple of things that interested me in the field. I loved the idea of going to Hawaii or Iceland to research volcanoes. I also loved the idea of studying earthquakes here in California. Didn't care much about going into oil or mining to make the big bucks cause that's not where my interests lied.

&amp;#x200B;

* Agriculture/Agronomy; Okay, I'm a city girl through and through so I know nothing about farming but the idea of working with crops or learning about sustainable farming sounds interesting to me. I think I might even look into soil science. It also seems to tie into plant sciences which I like.

&amp;#x200B;

* Programming; Honestly, I would love to do programming as a minor and not a major. Just because I've seen jobs that want candidates to have some programming under their belts. Plus it doesn't hurt to have a backup plan if all else fails.

&amp;#x200B;

I have more interests, but those are the few I wanted to highlight. For the most part, I'm more interested in the research side of things which I'm fine with. I can either be in an office or out on the field or maybe even both which I won't complain about. I just don't know how to gain experiences or at least explore these interests to see what stands out to me the most. What volunteering opportunities or internships should I look out for? Should I reach out to professionals in the fields I find most interesting?"

I didn't feel like exhausting myself trying to find a job if I felt I was unlikely to be chosen among more experienced candidates. I'm considering just focusing on school, and even doing summer classes to either reduce my course load per semester or even graduate a semester early.

I know that internships are always very useful to put on your CV, but if I finish my degree without internships, and start applying to jobs as a CS graduate, will I be reducing my job prospects?

(Also, I might consider doing a Masters in CS or Masters in Softwate Engineering after my degree, if that makes a difference)"

I am fortunate enough to be accepted into Kellogg and Booth's part time MBA program. I currently work in T2 consulting and plan on pivoting to big-tech (bizops, strategy, product mgmt etc) or MBB 

I've spoken to current students from both programs and this is where I'm at so far:
- Kellogg markets themselves more during the application stage whereas Booth highly relies on their brand. 
- Slightly friendlier people at Kellogg. I didn't get the warm feeling from Booth
- Kellogg seems to have a much more personalized CMC resources available 
- Kellogg requires full employment throughout the program and Booth does not 
- At Booth, I can pursue an internship and not be worried about employment requirements (off campus recruiting as on campus for internships is not allowed at either programs)
- I got into Kellogg's accelerated program and can skip a few classes 
- Booth seems to be more rigorous and honestly speaking, I'm not going back to school to for the academic challenge 
- Booth seems to have a better overall reputation all around


Is an internship an absolute necessity for big-tech jobs after graduation? 

Which program would be a better suited for me?

hadwdr,1,2020-06-16,[HIRING] Sr. Firmware Developer,fluxergy-dev,jobbit,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobbit/comments/hadwdr/hiring_sr_firmware_developer/,"**Company:** [Fluxergy](https://www.fluxergy.com/careers)

**Type:** Full Time

**Description:** Fluxergy is a point-of-care IVD diagnostics company.  We have developed a PCR-based diagnostic device, and are now expanding into additional modalities. The addition of LFA, ELISA, cytometry, and chemistry based testing are all planned, with LFA testing being the next target (it's in development now and not far off!).  We're really excited as these additions will make us unique in the IVD space, and present some interesting challenges engineering wise.

The software team is small, so you'll have lots of impact in the work you do. I would be your direct manager in this role, though we'd work more like colleagues as I am also the principal embedded systems engineer. We do pseudo-Agile-lite-lite, which is vaguely like Agile but less shitty. Minimize meetings, maximize focus time is my mantra (eg: we don't have a standup meeting, we all just enter stuff in a chat thread).  Don't focus on deadlines, focus on productivity.

We are looking for a senior firmware engineer to join the team and help us in the intetgration of these additional testing modes.  Additionally, we are looking for a senior algorithms engineer/senior applied mathematician to join the team to do mostly CV work, but also other mathy stuff when needed.  We're open to mid-career engineers as well if the fit is good.  We don't have the bandwidth for new-grads or interns.

**Location:** Orange County, CA

**Remote:** This is not a remote job. We are open to you working from home \~2-3 days a month.  For the duration of the crisis, if you do not feel comfortable coming in, you can work remote.  However if you need to pysically interact with the device hardware or run assays, you will have to come into the office.  We are all wearing masks and we have put into place limits on the number of people who can congregate within communal rooms in the office.  We have also stepped up cleaning intervals for the office, among other precautionary methods.  As soon as we get our EUA clearance from the FDA we will begin testing everyone in the office in regular intervals. Until then we encourage people to take advantage of testing through their insurance, which is free.

**Visa Sponsorship:** Yes, for exceptional candidates.  We have done H1B, TN, etc.

**Technologies:** Our tech stack is Linux/C11/C++11.   For the firmware role, Yocto/OpenEmbedded knowledge would be a huge plus. Additionally, you better like GLIBC because there's a lot of it!  OpenSSH knowledge is also a plus (or even better, WolfSSL). We mostly utilize analytical methods for our analysis pipeline, with only one small module having any machine learning whatsoever.  CV stuff happens in OpenCV.  Generally the pipeline for CV stuff is to prototype in Python, then convert to C++. We are prepping for an ISO13485 certification, so you'd be involved in that as well.  Previous knowledge of regulatory frameworks is a big plus.

**Contact:** Contact me via Reddit PM and we can go from there.

On my own. With no mentorship, guidance, or help. For minimum wage internship pay for 3 months.

This is insanity, right?

Part of me thinks I would learn real quick, learning by fire, but part of me thinks this is not only incredibly irresponsible on the company's part (why would you want a junior bootcamp dev to develop your entire website *on their own*?) but also feels exploitative.

It would be experience nonetheless and I could still throw it on my resume though, and keep applying for jobs during that time.

The other potential offer I have is a similar situation, except it's literally just one guy (a developer though - but how good, I have no idea).

Both have the potential for disaster and developing terrible habits, but again could be a wicked learning opportunity.

Any opinions?"

GPA: 3.93 (A/A+ in all Gies ICT required coursework)
Involvement on campus: VP of Hall Council, Illinois Leadership Certificate, SWB, Design Innovation 

My resume is pretty heavy in terms of “technical involvement” since I did a lot of “CS related” activities in the past like this internship at Google the summer of my freshman year, involved with EOH working on this app until the event got cancelled and organized this conference senior year where I got IBM (and other known companies) to sponsor the event. 

I’d say my essays were pretty decent, especially considering the fact that I used the additional essay to talk about something unique (won’t go into detail here).

 Pretty sure all 3 of the essays were very close to the word limit (399 / exactly 400 words/ and ~480 words for the additional essay) which I’m scared is also a concern to the AOs.

Idk why but I still feel like I’ll get rejected even though information systems is a better fit for me but still think they’ll think I’ll want to do CS because it seems that way? By all means I do NOT want to transfer into CS but to rather incorporate it (by pursuing a CS minor) with my pursuits in consulting and product management which is something I talked about in my essay

If anyone who’s gone through the ICT or in business, will I get in with these stats? Thanks"

I've decided to just change my name on my resume to a white one, and see if that helps.

I know once I get a job, I can just say I prefer my real name, but on my resume how would I change the name? Do I just change the first name and keep the last name or change both? Internships in Canada usually require a letter from the university saying I am eligible, but this letter will have my legal name on it. In this case it would be easier to get away with just the first name changed.

He asked me about my familiarity with these frameworks. I responded with I don’t know them yet, but I’m willing to learn them, especially RShiny because I will use this in the future for STA 141B and other upper div Stats classes. Despite that, he was overall decently impressed with my current engagements in my field such as my apprenticeship at Facebook and my Statistics/Computer Science content for the Bit Project, but because I’m not familiar with the frameworks, I wasn’t able to advance on towards the actual technical screen.

Is CS170 easier than (&amp;lt;) 61c? or are they about the same difficulty?

I keep hearing how important cs170 is for interviews so I'm afraid by taking cs61c instead of cs170 I'll have a harder time trying to get a FAANG internship. I would take 61c and 186 sp2021

Another thing is I’m taking ee16a this summer so im afraid i would forget too much if i take 16b later.

hamjz3,7,2020-06-17,Advice Needed: Berkeley Haas vs Oxford,armaboi,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/hamjz3/advice_needed_berkeley_haas_vs_oxford/,"Hi everyone! I’m lucky enough to have been admitted to UC Berkeley Haas and Oxford Said mba programs and wanted to hear other opinions from you all on the pros/cons of each school. I plan to move into an IB associate role (in a technology group if possible since that is my background and interest) post mba through an internship. I’m open to working in the US or London without any preference so that does not impact my mba program decision regarding where I would work afterward. 

The comparison of the schools as I see them now:

Haas
Pros
* Better shot at landing internship and job
* Focus on tech
* Opportunity for in semester internships
* Alumni network (strong in us west coast which is a pro and con in itself since it is likely not as global as oxford’s)
Cons
* 2 years
* Double the cost (2 years and cost of living in California)
* Less brand recognition long term


Oxford
Pros
* Oxford brand? (maybe this matters long term outside of the hr and employers circle that actually know Haas is a higher ranked program?) 
* 1 year 
* Half the cost
* Oxford experience (UK learning system, diversity of cohort, campus)
* International experience

Cons
* Worried about possibility of entering IB from Oxford possibly even in London
* Not much time for multiple internships
* If for any reason I am forced to look for a job in the US it may prove difficult
* Lower ranked (important to recruiters but not sure by exactly how much)


One thing that sits in the back of my mind is that while the Oxford Said program is not as highly ranked, Oxford is still Oxford. By this I mean that in the long term, when networking, doing something entrepreneurial, and anything else outside of the mba bubble, the Oxford brand recognition may be more valuable. Let’s be honest, the vast majority of people do not actually know that Haas is a strong mba program unless they are either a recruiter or in the mba process themselves. 

Please let me know what you think about the pros/cons and whether you agree or disagree. Would love to hear from all of you including those  who have relevant experience with these programs and what you would do.
Thanks for the help!"

My manager said he wanted to bring me up a level and would start the paperwork in April or May (which comes with a pretty significant raise, he said). Long story short, It hasn't been brought up since. Like most people, I want more money. Obviously times are weird with Corona Virus, but the company is doing fine.

hanly3,2,2020-06-17,Should I quit my unpaid internship if I am demotivated and already have a full time job for future?,pg10000,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/hanly3/should_i_quit_my_unpaid_internship_if_i_am/,"Hi,

I recently graduated from university and thankfully have a graduate offer from a company, which I got last month. My job is supposed to start pretty late, in September. Since I have so much time, I decided that maybe I should be more productive and do an internship in free time. before my job starts I had applied to another company some months ago for a full time role. They told me that they can have me on as an unpaid intern first for couple months(they also have some other unpaid interns) and if they like my work, they'll eventually give me a full time role. 

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to accept their offer for unpaid internship since I couldn't find any paid internship. Also, since I have a friend working in this company who also worked as an Intern in this company first and is now working full time. So I started this internship about 2 1/2 weeks ago and so far it has been okay but I am really starting to lose motivation. Like, the internship is good, my manager is a little intense but helpful and the rest of my team is really nice. But since I am unpaid, I have not been able to get myself motivated. Also, the work that I am doing in my internship is somewhat different from what the Job description was supposed to be(which is not ideal but still acceptable).

&amp;#x200B;

Now I understand that given the virus situation, I am in a very good position (I'm in Hong Kong and the situation hasn't been as bad as Europe/US thankfully) and a lot of other recent graduates are still without a job. But I can't help but feel that if I already have a job, why am I working so hard for (I know it sounds arrogant). My initial thinking was that, besides killing time, I'll also learn something and will have something to put in my CV. But I really dread going to work each morning since my manager gives me work that has been really hard sometimes that I don't necessarily enjoy doing.

&amp;#x200B;

My initial thinking was that I'll work for around 2 months till end of July or early August and then give GRE in late August(since I plan on going for masters in about 2 years). But ever since I've started, I've thought about quitting almost every day. I'm now thinking to end my internship as soon as possible. I haven't signed an official contract so the end date is not fixed. But I think the general feeling of HR is that I'll probably work till I get a full time offer (which would be at least 3 months and I am not planning to stick around for that long). I would have considered working longer if the internship was paid or if I didn't have a job in the future already.

&amp;#x200B;

So if anyone could give me advice or guidance on what to do, that would be great. Should I just keep on working, even though my heart's not in it or should I just quit? And if I should quit, is there like a kind, less mean way of doing that? I apologise for the long post and if this post is not suitable for this subreddit since I don't really use reddit much.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL**;**DR:** Started an internship but don't feel like continuing it since it is unpaid and the work is not exactly what I thought it would be, so losing motivation to work. Also, I have a job already, so even less motivated to work."

I know basics of databases(used postgresql), also did a few school projects with raw HTML, CSS, JS, did not use bootstrap or anything like that yet.
This year I also had to do a project in Android Studio(was so happy when my calculator worked on my mums phone, and it felt like a real app instead of just using the virtual phone).

Last year I also “worked” for a month it was a internship kind of thing I guess, we had to do a month of it to pass. I learned how projects are actually put together and worked with Git for the first time. I did not do much useful work since I was a noob(still am), but I feel like it was a success anyway. I used react native.

In 3 months I will start university, if I am accepted but the odds are looking good. In my first year of university I would like to start working and earn some money to become independent.

What should I focus on?  Can I put some of my smaller projects on the resume? For example I feel like I know C++  well but I never did a huge project in it, just loads of small programs for myself and school. What else to put on it? I have about 3 months of free time now, like 24/7 time."

My current team didn't seem like they were expecting interns as they didn't have a project for me to work on and the manager didn't know anything about me. 

The team I am on now from my understanding is DevOps. I have no idea how to use any technologies: k8s, docker, red hat etc. I now feel like i am really behind and I am not sure if I will be able to contribute anything to the team I am on.

I was fortunate enough to have a super interesting internship in a government office abroad (Mexico) during Fall 2019. Then, I got this super neat internship in an Embassy in China (January 2020). Of course, the pandemic struck and my internship was canceled after only 1 month. Therefore, little me had no job, no school/study plan, and I lost my dream internship! When I got back home, I was back on *hustle mode:* I sent a bunch of emails and made calls to pretty much anybody in my network (and beyond). I had sacrificed one year to gain experience - I had to do something! Exactly seven days into my quarantine, I received a positive answer from my 1000 leads: I had an interview with UN Women in Mexico. Two days later, I had the interview. The day after, I was in. I flew back to Mexico 3 weeks after my return from China, thinking I was the luckiest bastard on Earth. COVID-19 was not a concern for me as it didn't have the «pandemic status» yet. 

My luck ran out pretty quickly - COVID-19 reached Mexico. I lost my contract for a second time and got evacuated after only five weeks 😂. Back in Canada, I was able to support my team in Mexico with remote working for another month, but it was still a huge bummer. Finally, I got a 4 months contract with the Foreign Ministry (remote working) from May to September. No fancy travel nor adventurous internship, but still a little experience! Hopefully, the admission committees will love that story, haha!

So, back in January - when COVID-19 was not a thing - I applied to a Master's program in Cultural Diplomacy in Italy. I got in. As the months went by, the crisis got bigger, and my plans weaker (see above). Even if that program is my first choice, I've decided to have a back-up plan in case Italy was still struggling with the virus. So, I applied to an LLM in international law in Canada. I got in yesterday as well. Both programs are 1-year professional masters with a mandatory internship. I «could» do both without staying at school for another 4 years. The program in Italy is 7000 Euros + the rent/travel costs - it's likely going to be a hybrid format (part in-class/part-online). The program in Canada is 3000 CAD$ - while it has been confirmed that the first semester is going to be online, I have no clue for the second semester. 

**So, GradSchool community, Italian/European friends, HELP ME OUT! Do you think I should risk it and go to Italy, knowing there might be a \*second wave\*? Should I play it safe; do this LLM in Canada, and apply in Italy next year? How's the reopening in Europe/Italy - what's the mood/optimism of the people?**

Thank you all!!

Note: I don't think I am gonna be able to accept/tolerate another slap in the face because of COVID-19, I've had my share lol."

So I told myself I would learn something to make myself more marketable. Companies in my area, with my limited experience, seem like they ask less leetcode and more about specific tech you know that they use. Essentially my question boils down to this, would it be better to learn more web development stuff or ios app development? I already know HTML, CSS, some Javascript and have built things with them, but i also see things like Node.js, MySQL, and React. I've been wanting to get into mobile apps for a while and have a few cool ideas that I would like to come to fruition. I know Java, python, and C as well. 

It just seems as if everything is mostly web, which is fine since I like web stuff, but I also want to learn mobile app development. My main concern is not utilizing my free time wisely before its time to really apply for internships. Which path would allow me to be more marketable or am I just overthinking this?

Few months internship and then Masters at one of the few unis I'm accepted at in the US (I'm not from US, so masters is a foot-in-the-door kind of thing).

But now with Covid, me going to US is as good as cancelled, for two years at least. And I HAVE TO convert this internship into a full time offer. And although there's a rare precedence for undergrads, I'm sure I'm as good as the other interns. I'm acing the presentations, participating in hackathons, networking despite of remote work. 
My work front was going pretty well too, my mentor was pretty happy with me and I was still hopeful. I was working extra hours everyday, the work I could accomplish has probably set pretty high expectations for my mentor.

And I'm not sure if it was burnout or if all the negativity in the air caught up to me or it was good old procrastination, I could barely get out of bed to work for almost a week. 

And now I have a crazy amount of backlog. And my brain is saturated. And my project submission deadline is approaching (which is absolutely not flexible). And I'm already working 13 hours a day. The stress is further shutting my brain. And the internship has a no-leave policy. And I don't know how to tell my mentor that I'm so worked up. And coding those tiny nitty gritties takes time. Plus I'm stressing out about future prospects. What if I don't get a convert here? I haven't applied anywhere else and have had to cancel my admits as well.

hayemb,2,2020-06-17,Any advice for somewhat new grad? Feeling stupid and discouraged,marrcs101,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/hayemb/any_advice_for_somewhat_new_grad_feeling_stupid/,"So, during covid-19 I got let go from my second job. The company was not doing well due to the pandemic and when I found out that I was being let go, they told me that I was not meeting expectations as well. They communicated their concerns in the past, I improved significantly and even finished a project for them all by myself and I was being told I did a really good job on it. Last time I spoke to my managers, they had no concerns.

At my first job, I got good performance review but ended up being laid off due to the fact that a local family company I was working at started losing clients and doing bad financially. They provided me with good references and told me it was not due to performance.

I am in the finance field and I always did so well at school. I graduated with a 3.7 GPA. I always got good grades and worked so hard. English is my second language and I had to learn it quick when I moved to USA as a teen. I did well in my internships and jobs during college.

Just getting very discouraged because even though I was a good student, i can't help but feel depressed and stupid because I got laid off from my first two jobs post college. I keep calling myself stupid and I hate myself. As an immigrant, I want to try so hard to make a life in USA and be able to help my family and prove them that moving to USA was worth it. I just want to be able to support myself. Because of how stupid I feel, I am afraid to apply to other finance related jobs. I also realized that I lost passion for it. 

I am trying so hard to be positive, I am going to the gym and even hit some of the fitness goals during quarantine. I am helping out with household chores as much as I can while unemployed. I keep comparing myself to my classmates, who are getting promoted or at least able to keep their jobs. I feel so guilty and keep putting the blame on myself. I guess this is more of a rant. Am I a lost case?


Thank you for reading it."

I am a newer coder. And currently my internship would like me to explore automation testing, and integration testing.   


I have been playing with Puppeteer a little bit. Can do basic page rendering, click on buttons and basically create a script that registers a user on our app.  They would like me to begin testing with assertions, and I don't see that Puppeteer does that alone. That I would need to add Jest? Or another Javascript testing framework?    


I am curious how to start this as I can't quite find anything or I may be searching incorrectly. I'd like to begin tests that provide feedback like Jest etc.. Currently looking over Chai through Codeacademy Thanks! And sorry if this is in the wrong spot!"

hb0bto,7,2020-06-17,[Advice Needed] Should I take the Fall semester off?,napoleonicmusic,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/hb0bto/advice_needed_should_i_take_the_fall_semester_off/,"I go to Colorado School of Mines and just found out that the only class I have in the fall that is not online is my Field Session for Computer Science. 

This is pretty frustrating to me as I really don't see the value in paying tuition for a semester comprised of pretty much all online classes. I'm in Greek Life and I'm also assuming fraternities are going to have very strict rules over the semester, so I'm guessing social life will not be very exciting.

I am going into my Junior year, and I was already a semester ahead so doing this would just have me graduating with my class normally.

Basically, I am going into a semester with online classes that are not engaging, provide little life structure, and are difficult to stay motivated with, with a social life that is very sub par.

My idea is to possibly live at home and try and get an internship over the fall with a local company, so I am keeping my school momentum going in someway by still applying and learning Computer Science concepts. Additionally I would take the time to work on music.

One worry I have is that this 'Hybrid' class schedule will continue for the next few semesters, meaning I would be put in the same position in the Spring.

Does anyone have any advice? I'm really stuck on this one."

To give you my background, I finished my undergrad BBA in Marketing in May 2019 and have been searching for a job since. I had an internship lined up for June 2019 as a marketing intern at a corporate financial services company. I was hoping that would turn into a FT job but they didn't have any openings, and definitely nothing entry-level. They still don't. Too much organizational change.

I then was searching for a job continuously for the next few months but no luck. End of 2019, I reached out to my old manager at the financial services company I interned at and they were able to bring me on as a temporary worker. I'm still here now and thankful that I even have some kind of employment. However, I've been **a c t i v e l y** searching and applying to numerous other jobs for months now, because having secure and full-time employment is important to me. I already got kicked off my parent's dental insurance as soon as I completed undergrad and now I just feel like a burden on my family. I don't know if my resume is the problem, my minimal experience, or the fact that I'm a minority with like no connections. Sometimes I feel like my name is a problem to the typical demographic of recruiters, but the more probable reason is not getting picked up by applicant tracking systems.

It's just so hard seeing other people thrive, especially some of the people who are a year younger than me and have now graduated and are working FT at these huge companies. I feel like I'm so behind and I know a lot of people have it worse than me but I can't help but complain. I've applied to hundreds of jobs that I've found on LinkedIn, Indeed, email notifications for companies whose alerts I've signed up for. My very first internship in college (even that one was such a hard internship to get even though it was nothing special/not at a big company) was HR and so I've been looking into HR jobs too like recruitment coordinator but I never hear back from those either. I deeply regret my choice in a marketing career sometimes because I don't even know if I'll ever get a proper job. With the pandemic situation, it's derailed stuff even more so it's just so confusing. I'm sorry if I've ranted here but honestly, any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks so much for your time."

As a finance major and a self-taught developer, I understand that I am at a disadvantage compared to my computer science peers in regards to competing for internship spots.

Therefore, I've focused on working as hard as possible to make myself attractive to recruiters. I've had over 120+ commits in the past 3 months to Github with projects ranging from open source video/music editing software to full-scale web applications hosted on the cloud. I've won 4 hackathons and did my best to network with the judges. Currently, I'm spending my time grinding Leetcode, with over 200 questions under my belt and consistently getting 3/4 questions during the weekly contests.

However, I've submitted about 200-300 applications since the start of January and have not received a single interview. It's extremely demoralizing having computer science friends who are less skilled at coding ask me for help on a HackerRank that they've received from companies I got rejected from. I've accepted that I would not be able to obtain a 2020 summer internship but I'm worried about not being able to get a good internship for the 2021 summer.

I've already applied to a couple of quant firms recruiting for 2021 internships and got automatically rejected within 3 days of applying (funny as you'd assume they'd be partial towards finance majors). I don't know what to do. My mental health is hanging by a thread because I've worked so hard to obtain the skills I have right now but I'm not getting any chances to prove it.

hb7k3p,1,2020-06-18,Tech Support agent wanting to move towards Cloud Solutions Architecture (AWS probably?) What's the best path into this from where I stand?,ShaolinShade,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/hb7k3p/tech_support_agent_wanting_to_move_towards_cloud/,"(Long post because lots of potentially relevant context, sorry. TLDR at the bottom) 

I'm currently a tier 2 tech support agent at a company contracted with major telecom in Houston. No certifications or even a full degree, came out here for a paid tier 1 help desk internship after studying IT for a few years in college (I was offered full time work at the end of the internship and took it since I was broke and in debt, planned on going back to college once I had saved up enough to comfortably return, but that never really happened and I'm not sure how worth it it would be at this point to spend the likely 2ish years required to finish my BS in IT (I now have 7 years of experience in tech support). My experience is all basic tech support and help desk with some variety - mostly windows troubleshooting, but dabbled a bit with linux, AD, server maintenance, iOS and android, networking, hardware and software maintenance in all it's helpdesky forms. 

7 years of tech support experience (with long tenures at most companies) has proved decently valuable, I've come *this* close to landing a few positions in the 50k/year range but am currently settled in a mid 30k tier 2 call center position. But my resume definitely feels weak and I'm wanting to build the most effective strategy for advancing it forward. The lack of degree hurt more at first but doesn't seem to be as worthwhile of an investment as certifications at this point, from what I can tell.

From the research I've done on what I could specialize in, I think I've decided that I want to pursue Cloud Solutions Architecture. Cloud seems to be a strong choice moving forward as far as demand trends, and it also seems to be the type of career that often offers WFH and/or downtime, both of which are important advantages to me, quarantine has made me realize how well this works for me. I'm also very creative leaning for someone in tech and it seems like there's a good bit of creative potential with how cloud solutions architects design, setup, and orchestrate infrastructures for their clients.

It also seems like AWS is likely the best certification choice, given their flexibility, relative ease of use, market dominance and likelihood of staying relevant. All of my searches have shown the most results for AWS positions in the areas I've been looking at, with Azure trailing not far behind. GCP is trailing much farther behind on the current job listings count, but pay average looks great comparatively and the platform has some interesting advantages and will likely continue to grow. I think I'd rather bank on the current higher demand system though, since one of the biggest motivating factors of this career progression for me is giving myself financial and locational flexibility as soon as possible. 

(Context: I've been living in Houston for 7 years now and I hate our overstaying, oppressive summers more each year. Climate change is turning this place into a hellhole and I want to make myself valuable enough to be able to relocate up north as quickly as possible (don't really have any roots tying me here). Seattle seems like it could be a good fit - it's home to both Amazon and Microsoft, a sort of PNW silicon valley type situation going on up there. Also just seems like the kind of place I would like to live, as a lover of rain, the outdoors, progressive cutting edge cities, and keeping to myself lol (I visited there recently and liked what I saw) 

This is where two parts of my career strategy come together - one of the biggest downsides of getting a big city tech job is dealing with horrible rent and/or horrible traffic, depending on how much of each you can put up with. Cloud seems to have a way around this with the WFH / remote potential that could allow me to move somewhere like Seattle; where there's major tech demand, and I can get the big city pay but do it remotely from the more affordable outskirts. Best of both worlds potentially, and those odds are hopefully improving as a silver lining to the cloud of covid-19. 

Anything worth having doesn't come easy though, and I know I'm not going to be in the running for these types of setups anytime soon. I'm pretty sure I'm not likely to be able to just move directly into cloud architecture out of tech support experience, even with a professional AWS cloud architect cert (assuming I'm able to get it). It seems like there's a small mountain of knowledge to gain and experience to acquire in-between where I am and where I want to be. 

With all that background context out of the way I think it's time for an attempt at a **TLDR** - What do you think the best / quickest path into Cloud Solutions Architecture from where I am now, as someone with only 7 years of tech support experience (""some college"", and an eagle scout award for what fuck all those are worth lol)? The sense I've gotten looking into it is that server / systems administration experience could maybe be a good stepping stone to get me into cloud solutions architecture (cloud is remote server work more or less, from what I can tell) once I've got a few years and certs. AWS has it's own pro level cert that's more in line with systems administration though (Sys ops), so I wonder if that's more the move to make for that path or if there's another way to where I'm headed. 

My tentative, under-construction, most likely misguided plan:

1. Obtain Windows Server 2016 certification (seems like I have enough varied tech support experience for the basic CompTIA+ certs and such to not be too valuable for me at this point) 

2. Use experience and cert to gain entry level sys admin role

3. Gain AWS Associate Solutions Architect certification

4. Start looking for more AWS/server oriented work, work on AWS Professional Architect certification 

5. Become cloud solutions architect 

In case it wasn't obvious, I don't know a lot about what I'm planning on getting myself into here yet, so I feel like I'm sort of jerry rigging what information I can find into something that looks like a viable career strategy. Any and all input is very appreciated!"

hb87s8,7,2020-06-18,Anderson (No $) vs. Stern (No $) Vs. Deferral,MBA420fundingsecured,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/hb87s8/anderson_no_vs_stern_no_vs_deferral/,"Hi everyone, I am looking for feedback (or maybe confirmation bias) while I try to sort my thoughts on some difficult decisions.


My situation: Canadian admit for UCLA Anderson and NYU Stern with no scholarships for either schools. Currently working internationally at a pharmaceutical at a BD/PM role. Circumstances dictate that I MUST return to Canada this summer. 


My post-mba career goal so far: Recruit for management consulting (I’m not MBB or bust and also acknowledge the realities of a Canadian recruiting for US offices) with a goal of exiting into the pharmaceutical/healthcare industry in a strategy role. My secondary target is recruiting for tech in a PMM role. 


# Anderson vs. NYU:


**Program-thus far:**

+ +Anderson: Anderson’s pre-MBA/orientation content has been, for lack of a better word, excellent. From making sure to pair me with fellow Canadians of similar ethnicities, to a well-organized slack channel and prompt email updates and reminders, Anderson’s program has given me the impression that it is well resourced and on top of its game. 

+ +Anderson: Because I had applied to Stern during the extension period, I can’t make direct comparisons. However, from what I have seen so far, I have the impression that Anderson’s office is more involved. Stern also has odd/questionable quirks like the July 7 tuition payment deadline (I think it's one of the earliest?).

* Recent emails from both programs show that they are aiming for a hybrid (~30 people classes)/online situation for the fall term in accordance with safety guidelines.  

**CoL:**

+ I expect similar living costs in LA and NYC so this is a wash.


**Career progression:**

+ +Anderson: my impression is that being on the west coast and based on the strength of the program and network, Anderson offers a strong path towards directly recruiting into Pharmaceuticals and is also strong in tech, and local consulting &amp; IB placements.

+ +Stern: Being located in NYU is a major advantage in terms of proximity and access. Employment report shows stronger placement in consulting &amp; IB and the program punches above its weight in finance. I have to say that this recent post: https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/h7rsnd/postmba_career_salary_trend/ was eye-opening in the 10 year difference in salary progression.  I always felt that consulting had a career progression that made sense (consulting to pharma) but I am greatly tempted to recruit for IB and Stern is well positioned for that (though I understand that it’s mostly an either/or situation)
 

**Summary:**

I like what I have seen from Anderson so far while traditionally, Stern might provide stronger opportunities in 2/3 post-MBA industries (IB, Consulting).


# Deferral?

**Reasons for deferral** (deferral is possible on a case-by-case basis in at least one of the two schools, I might be a weak case with there being basically no potential visa issues for Canadians): 

1. Safety concerns - second wave infection health risks and potentially another closure of the schools. For example, Beijing had a sudden outbreak of 100+ cases and just went on partial lockdown. It is hard to imagine this not happening in LA and NYC as well. As the class of 2020 can attest to, being in school while a shutdown happens is not optimal. I can also expect anything between 25-50% of the program to be online. Right now, I still have the flexibility of maneuvering around the pandemic and once I commit to matriculating in 2020, I will be there for the long haul.
2. Decreased networking opportunities with my cohort (considering internationals make up 1/3 of the student body). I consider building a network with fellow students to be a major value add of the program. 
3. Adverse effects on recruitment/internships (virtual recruitment not being the same experience, black mark on the class of 2022). For how important the first job out of an MBA is for career progression, there is a higher risk of getting off on the wrong foot with the pandemic and an imminent recession. 

**Reasons against deferral:**

1. I will be in Canada for the year in between. I believe momentum is important and I feel like my life will be on standby waiting for 2021 (my heart says no to deferral, my brain says yes to deferral). 
2. I have given notice to my job and at the moment, it seems that if I end up successfully deferring, my options would be to study for a CFA exam in December and find a pre-MBA internship in Canada the summer. 
3. There’s no telling what might happen in the future and there is the risk that the effects of a recession would carry over from 2020 through to 2021 and 2022.

I'm in a little bit of a struggle and need advice from my fellow entrepreneurs. What would you do?

I have spent 2 summers, some months spread out and for a semester off. In addition, I have worked some in my time off from there. In my time there I went from learning how to write a genetic algorithm in C to publishing a work in progress research paper to a good conference this year, and I’m the first author.
But the thing is, the only reason I got the internship is because my friends mom is the head of the lab. Obviously I haven’t done poorly and they say I’ve done really well over the years. But basically the only reason I have been able to do these things was because they let me do it. They could have easily done it themselves, except that they didn’t necessarily have time to. So everything I’ve done there was done by me. I was supervised and instructed on how to do things, but I did basically all the learning, work and research myself.
But I still don’t feel like I’ve done anything that impressive. I feel like if anyone was put in my position they could’ve done it if they put in the time. But also a work in progress paper isn’t that incredible. So I don’t know."

It's not even just achievements. If I see others having a productive day, I just feel sad. Like an hour ago, I saw a post from my teacher congratulating a student going into med school. That's great news. Should I care? I mean, I guess some might feel proud that an alumni is going to med school (undergrad). Since only 1 or 2 students get an offer every year.

For me, I get affected, like real bad. I feel pathetic. I was planning on studying a law degree overseas. I applied, got in, very happy moment for me. That was in 2017. It's 2020 now. Stuck in a local school, doing computer science. I tried, I really did try to like CS. But whenever I see others doing what they like, I just crumble. My grades are bad, my parents are abusive. I probably complain too much and people think I'm noisy because of it. I just want to do what I want to do. Is it too much to ask for?

When I tell people I want to do law, they said don't be ridiculous. 2 reasons. 1, they say I should do ""easy"" degrees and I cannot handle it. 2, They say CS is ""future proof"". Whatever that means. Look, it's torture to me. I did 2 internships and I still feel miserable. How much experience do you have to make these judgements?

How do I get deal with this? I still want to go to law school. But it's impossible locally because I'm from a small country. And, I'm dead poor. Or do something else I like though I don't know what. I'm doing my 4th internship, in 3 different fields. Maybe I'm just stubborn. I'm in seriously need of help and advice.

EDIT:

TLDR: Feel sad when I see people that have their sh\*t together. Dislike my course (CS) and want to do law. Very poor and only option is overseas law school. Need advice on how to cope. "

The pay for both intern positions are pretty much the same and both are remote. 

Also this is one of my last co-ops so I'm also thinking about fulltime goals as well. Wish pays a lot for newgrad, it might go IPO,  has an office in toronto where my family is, and I think it's easier to get hired fulltime if ur already an intern( idk, maybe?) so I think I'd rather work at Wish fulltime over Amazon. 

That said Amazon is the bigger name and will help my resume stand out to other FAANG companies and if I end up getting an AWS team (which might be likely because I have prev infra experience + its the vancouver office) that would be the ideal co-op for infra. The downside is tho, I have no idea where I'll actually end up  and if it'll be relevant to my career goals at all.

&amp;#x200B;

what should i do? i am putting a lot of pressure on myself and it has not been very healthy for me. is this how its supposed to be? i feel like everyone else is a much better programmer than me and everyone else is doing so much better than me that i feel i will never be able to find a job ever. 

any advice?"

At the end of my first year, I was so confused about picking my major. I was torn between Mechatronics Engineering and Computer Science. I always loved programming, building web sites and softwares but in the same time, since my high school, I love physics, mechanics and maths. I do well in all the previously mentioned fields and I get good grades in it and I was really puzzled and could not choose the major that best suits me. At the end, I chose Mechatronics. The reasons behind my choice is that Mechatronics nearly combines every thing I love to study: physics, electronics, mechanics, maths in addition to programming. I also said to my self that computer science is something that I can grasp by self learning as it has courses and tutorials everywhere on the internet. The problem is that since my major declaration up till my current semester (that is nearly 2 years of study), I have a feel of regret that I should have chosen computer science. I feel that because I encounter some courses that I do not like such as manufacturing courses. Also, I see a difficulty in obtaining an internship or even a job after graduation while my CS friends already have found internships. I see that it is too late if I want to switch majors as I would have to take a lot of courses that I missed in CS. I need some help regarding what to do. Is that natural?

There isn't any job that i'm really qualified for at this point and on top of that, I feel like I'm exhausted by programming anyway and I don't honestly know if I can do it for the rest of my life. It doesn't help that the software industry is incredibly saturated and trying to land a job or even so much as an internship is nearly impossible. I wish I could go back in time and tell myself everything that majoring in CS would entail, and to either take extracurricular activities and projects much more seriously or find a more enjoyable major."
hbrq8m,5,2020-06-18,Need advice on either development or cyber security,arctictothpast,DevelEire,https://www.reddit.com/r/DevelEire/comments/hbrq8m/need_advice_on_either_development_or_cyber/,"Hello develeire, your the only real reddit I can ask this of as Ireland’s market is completely different to the USA’s and most of the Eu. I am about to graduate from my computer science coarse in cyber security. I had originally  transitioned from standard computer science into cyber security because of the fact that 90% of the jobs I would be going for after I had graduated averaged between 100-200 applicants, on linked in alone. Even if as some folks pointed out that half of these where non Eu applicants who aren’t even qualified to apply (as none of the positions advertised relocation or non Eu immigration aid), that’s minimum 50 I’m scrapping with for the job, the majority of whom having similar if not superior qualifications like having an internship or professional work experience.

I had however heard that the vast majority of folks in cyber security who graduate basically get scooped up before they even finish their degree, and since its a growing field and related subjects got me into computer science in the first place (I was involved in reverse engineering a game with the goal of making a private server out of it and one of the obstacles was dealing with its anti Cheat software which effectively worked as a drm), I went into that.

Turns out even pre covid that 90% of cyber security jobs are usually industry vet focused (Understandable as IT security is extremely knowledge reliant) , and I’m lucky if I find even one position advertised  for entry level folks in Ireland (typically associate security analyst), not even penetration testing which was my primary interest. (Security analysts are blue team while pentesters are red team). As well as folks from my coarse who had graduated and gotten work, they all were out trying to get work for between 3-6 months which is apparently terrible for even devs in Ireland. These were skilled and competent people with high grades and one of them even snagged an internship yet they still in their own words struggled on.

Do you guys think I should just stick to cyber security and try to get my skills as absolutely strong as possible or do yous think I would be better off trying my luck against the insane number of folks applying to positions, I’m primarily focused on getting the job first as I don’t want to end up in the horrible trap of chronic unemployment where it gets even harder and harder to pull out of."

previous post got removed by automod so I'll try to indirectly reference the companies this time. Some background, I'm a 3rd year in university and both these offers are for internships. Any advice at all would be greatly appreciated :) 

Company A: The ""A"" in FANG that does 1 day shipping

Company B: Lakers sponsor, also sells stuff online.

I got an offer for B toronto as well as A vancouver.  The thing is, I really want to work in prod eng/infra for fulltime. My dilemma is this: get a confirmed infra team at B or throw my dice at A for their A web services team (or any other infra team)? The pay for both intern positions are pretty much the same and both are remote.

Also this is one of my last co-ops before I graduate so I'm also thinking about fulltime goals as well. B pays a lot for newgrad, it might go IPO, has an office in toronto where my family is, and I think it's easier to get hired fulltime if ur already an intern so I think I'd rather work at B fulltime over A.

That said A is the bigger name and will help me stand out to other FAANG companies and if I end up getting an A web services team (which might be likely because I have prev infra experience + its the Vancouver office) that would be the ideal co-op for infra. The downside is tho, I have no idea where I'll actually end up and if it'll be relevant to my career goals at all.

What do you guys think? Should I be considering something else as well?

I wanted to start a career but I have heard more about credit checks obviously. I don't have any late payments, no bankruptcy, no accounts in collections. I don't have any of these problems in my credit report. Last Fall, I took a semester off and my student loans went into repayment mode. I started to pay them back until I went back to school next semester in January 2020. When I went back, my student loans got off of repayment mode and went back into deferment. Once this has happened, my credit score went down  from 675 to 585. I don't know how this happened. When my student loans was on a repayment mode, I put my student loans on a repayment plan which was $0 a month. This is a plan that was given by Great Lakes (my student loans provider). Later on last month in May, my credit score jumped back up to 675. I also don't know how this happened. I checked Credit Karma to see all of my credit score changes when this all happened. I may have some questions:

1. Do all accounting jobs look at your credit score/credit history?




2. How will the employers look at this situation if they do a credit check on me?"

I'm hoping to get some advice about what I should do in my current situation. 

I just started as an ME R&amp;D intern at a huge company that develops personal computers and printers. My project for the next 12 weeks is to design what is essentially a lap-desk. In the process of doing so, I'm going to be practicing a lot of the ""design thinking"" methodologies, gaining lots of CAD experience, and learning the entire manufacturing process of my design.

While these are all really good learning opportunities that will undoubtedly improve my skills as an engineer, for some reason, I just don't feel like it is very engaging or interesting. I completely acknowledge that I am an intern and we don't always get to work on huge projects, but many of my fellow interns at this company are working on things like ""printer head research"" or ""computer hardware enclosures"" or secret projects, but I'm just here designing some furniture.

 I talked to a few of my friends and peers from school, and they believe that my project is good for a few reasons: 1, since I'm in R&amp;D, it's hard to assign an intern to work on something brand new in a truly meaningful way (especially with remote work) and 2, it doesn't matter what my project is, but rather what I learn and what skills I gain from the project. 

I guess what I'm trying to ask is if this project is really worth my time and whether or not I should request a new project?

I might've missed some points in my summary, so my apologies if something doesn't quite make sense. Any tips or help would be appreciated, thanks!"
hbstk4,0,2020-06-18,Consider taking a Gap Year- Here's Why,jeffalltheway,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/hbstk4/consider_taking_a_gap_year_heres_why/,"Hey University Class of 2024, consider taking a gap year. Here's why:


- Chances are good that, even if campuses open up, they're going to move online once there's a spike in cases (look at what's going on as a result of people getting together in ralies). Do you want to waste money on an expensive tuition (75-80k for private unis) when you can literally learn the content online for free (Youtube/MIT OCW) or at the max a few hundred dollars through online courses?


- There are tons of productive things you can do during a gap year. If you're a prospective CS major, you can choose to work on side projects, preparing for coding interviews, learning how to code in certain programming languages, and more. If you're into finance, you can take online finance courses. Business? you can create an online brand and start marketing. There are tons of ways to spend the time productively-- you just need to get creative. The truth is, there are tons of skills that students in college need to learn on their own. If you master them during the gap year, college life will be much easier (CS classes teach you the theory, but they don't teach you unit testing or software engineering in the real-world)


- Does it seriously make sense to pay full price tuition if all large classes are going to be held online, you have to wear a face mask at all times, and you have to stay 6 feet apart from each other at all times? It's quite likely that there will be fear of outbreaks, testing, and many other complications that will detract from campus life.


- Most importantly- You're an incoming freshman. Freshman year is supposed to be YOUR year to find your great group of friends and fully enjoy campus life. When you're a sophomore or junior, you'll be buried with work and applying to internships. Freshman year is the time to relax, to party, to have the time of your life away from home (don't get carried away though, lol). Does it really make sense to keep from all of those things by only going to campus 2 out of 4 quarters (cough Stanford) or being required to wear masks all the time?


- While it is true that CoVid has caused a lot of uncertainty, it doesn't take a genius to figure out that taking a Gap Year can actually be a very advantageous move. You get more time to gain real world experience, minimize the risk of any health-related problems spreading to your family, spend the 75-80 grand on a year that isn't as messed up as Fall 2020-Spring 2021, and get to fully enjoy an amazing first year. All you need to do is wait a year. Many of you have worked extremely hard to get here, and you deserve a year to develop yourself.

Best of luck to you in making this decision. I urge you, especially if you're committed to a super expensive school that prides itself on campus life (cough Yale cough), to take a Gap Year."

Ideally around 1000$ but I'd be open to up to 1200$ (USD)
* **Are you open to refurbs/used?**  
Yeah!
* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**  
Very important, my school has a very large campus with some classes being \~1 mile apart so I'm going to be carrying it a lot. I prefer something that isn't going to break my back 
* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.**  
N/A
* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.**  
I play League of Legends, Minecraft, and Star Wars the Old Republic, Valorant and Overwatch 
* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**  
I want to be able to play all of these games at medium settings and get 60 FPS
* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?**  
I need it to be quiet because I plan on using it to study, and I don't want it to be super ""gamer"" looking if that makes sense. I really do think all the RGB keyboards and what not look cool, but I plan on using this while I intern in a hospital setting so I really want to look professional, and more sleek design would be preferred. 

One of my friends suggested an Acer Aspire 7 (linked below), but I've heard that their build quality is questionable and ideally this would last me all four years of school so I'm not completely sold on that.

(More details in post body),undead-inside,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/hc0iam/i_started_an_internship_in_february_with_no_clear/,"Basically as I said. The internship has been entirely online, involving software testing and a little bit of marketing. I started on the 21st of February this year, so in two days I will have completed four months of my internship. At that time, I was told that I would start, and we would see some time down the line about the end date.

Important to note - it is an unpaid internship.

From the 22nd of June, regular classes will start for my 7th semester, albeit online. In addition, I have to start working on my final year project. This is seriously cutting down the time I have available, so I want to request the person in charge of the internship to end it. The person is someone I got in touch with through a relative, so it's not as cut and dry as just handing in a letter. I have also not been hearing from the person for days at a time, and usually get a reply only after 2-3 emails.

What is the best way I can go about addressing the issue of finalizing the end date for the internship, and directly asking to end it without appearing rude? I don't want to lose out on this potential contact for the future.

Thank you, everyone."

Hi all. I've been seeing a ton of talk about major choices and STEM and generally a ton of anxiety. I started out as, and still consider myself as, a die-hard Liberal Arts kid. Now I'm learning to adapt and pick up skills in the STEM world.

**BACKGROUND**

I came in as a Classics major, added History, then added Linguistics and Anthropology, dropping Classics. That's all freshman year (and it's \*very\* common to do this). Spent the summer between freshman/sophomore years doing research in History/Anthro abroad, and it was fun but not the absolute dream I thought it would be. I had heard about some opportunities in Computational Linguistics through an on-campus Linguistics conference, and now I'm aiming to work in Natural Language Processing. Dropped my other majors and just doing Linguistics and Computer Science, but truthfully don't need a major in CS to do what I'm doing. Luck guided me much of the way, but now I'm doing a technical internship in something I--a Liberal Arts kid--love.

**TIPS**

I bring this up because there's a distinction to make: no, you should not at all be ditching your major because you're worried about employment. However, you should make future-conscious decisions when scheduling classes, picking minors, and the like. Here's a few STEM-y things to try as an LA kid:

1. *Computational \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_:* Almost every humanities/social science department have a few ""computational"" researchers now. There's computational linguistics (my home), computational biology, computational sociology, and so on. These fields keep the spotlight on your favorite Liberal Arts subject, while teaching you skills that are both useful for studying what you love and useful for getting summer internships. Ask a professor to research in their lab, or about other opportunities to try computational \*insert your major here\*.
2. *Build Around Your Major:* Like I said before, you do not have to compromise on your major. However, you can absolutely add a second major or even a minor/certificate that both adds to your understanding of the field and yields some technical knowledge. Are you a total History buff? Try a GIS (Geographic Information Systems) certificate. An Applied Statistics minor can be incredibly useful to almost any major. Most importantly, you should try to frame yourself as a tech-fluent person.
3. *Identify Potential Jobs and Useful Skills*: Take the time to learn about what other students in your major go on to do. A lot of Anthropology students go into UI/UX, which is an absolutely huge field now. A lot of Sociology and Political Science majors go into local government, where the valued skill sets are very different from industry. As you're getting through your first few years of college, it's good to see a couple of different paths forward for yourself. Check out the job listings, and think of ways you might ""fill"" the bullet points in the ""Desirable Skills/Traits"" section.

**CLOSING THOUGHTS:**

College is hard. You have to make it on your own for the first time ever really. You are ultimately responsible to yourself. This can sound terrifying, but it's also empowering. You really do have the opportunity to study what you love, all the while working towards market value for yourself. You can do it.

**TLDR:**  Don't listen to people telling you to put down your dreams. Bet on yourself, then work hard and smart."

Take a look! They are, technically, open source. Maybe give a Google Intern a PR?

\-Be a content creator (yeah yeah like streaming and making yt videos)

\-Be able to work on school assignments

\-Potentially use it for work or an internship i plan to do next summer

\-Be able to OC and upgrade in the future

I still don't want to bump the price much more than it already is, however i do have a few conflicts: I am not sure whether to keep the cpu or change to a 6 core and save money but lose a bit of per-thread performance. And I'm still uneasy about the motherboard potentially not being compatible with my CPU. As for the internet, I plan on getting my own internet plan and share with my brother and also use ethernet. So if you notice any caveats with my setup please do let me know."

Unfortunately, although I tried each year, I was not able to land a single internship during any of my summers as an undergrad. Now, I've nearly graduated, passed the FE exam, nearly getting my EIT license and I don't know where to begin searching, or even how to make myself marketable to anyone. 

The biggest problems I am facing are that:

1. The jobs i'm finding on sites like indeed require experience, which I do not have.
2. The jobs I'm finding which I would actually like to do and see myself excelling in (related to my area of focus) are few and far between. 

Any advice for someone like me, who doesn't have experience (or doesn't feel particularly comfortable even beginning a full-time job as a newbie...I can't be the only one who is nervous about starting a new, technical job when I don't know what it's like) that helped you find a job in this current market? COVID-19 really took a lot of my opportunities off my table.

TL;DR to anyone who is in a similar boat as me, how long did it take you to find a job after you graduated, and what did you do to get the job (what websites did you search on, who did you talk to, etc)

hc668c,4,2020-06-19,Don't buy PC case fans from Corsair,CakeAT12,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/hc668c/dont_buy_pc_case_fans_from_corsair/,"I self-built my own PC (about a £3500 rig) 2 years ago now. I have been extremely pleased with the results... with 1 exception. In the 2 years I have had this PC 3 of my 6 case fans (all from corsair; 2 ML120s and a SP120 RGB) have busted their bearings. The warranty on them is for 3 years, along with the crystal 570x rgb case they came with. I have replaced the 2 ML120 fans and now that 1 of the SP120s has gone, i'm thinking of completely replacing all the fans for a set of Noctuas. 

What I don't understand is, how a company as prestigious as corsair, can be so proficient at making anything as complex as a PSU to peripherals or CPU coolers, but a simple £15 case fan is the thing that they fuck up?!?!

It just infuriates me that it's the simple shit they cut corners on. I have an A-Level in DT and know my way around a workshop, and I reckon I could create a better bearing design in my fucking sleep than what those chimpanzees with typewriters are producing over at corsair. How can you be outstanding at manufacturing the best power supplies in the world, but you can't even make a bearing that doesn't die after 2 years of use? 

It's literally like the Fallout 76 scenario. Except with corsair they have their best engineers working on making the important shit (sure it's important) and then they just have their subdivision company of interns make the case fans without any supervision, vetting or testing. If you're gonna leave the less important products to be manufactured by those less experienced, don't expect to be able to sell it for the same premium price ups as your other shit.

It's not even like the fans have been pushed that hard, as I capped them at 2300rpm (any louder and the noise becomes noticeable enough to keep my parents awake), and most of the time they are somewhere between idle (300rpm) and when i'm gaming (1600rpm). They only ever really get higher than 1600rpm if I'm stress testing my CPU or if I'm trying to record gameplay at 1440p.

And if a corsair representative happens to see this; don't slide into my dm's or the comments section with some shit like ""I'm sorry you are unhappy with our product, how might we resolve this issue for you?"" because shit like that just pisses me off even more. You know damn well why I'm unhappy with your shitty outsourced manufacturers and 2nd class customer sevice, and you know damn well exactly what you could do to attain retribution for your fuck up. So no corsair, go fuck yourself. If I want to conduct business with you in future, it will be on my terms, as I see fit. Not because you guys are offering a 50% discount (which would still be net profit for them) just to entice me to buy a replacement or another 1 of their products as an ""apology gift"". This isn't some shitty High School drama relationship where the girl gets a pearl necklace bought for her and all is forgiven. 

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah... long story short, corsair's case fans blow... or rather they don't.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

FUUUUUCCKKKKK

&amp;#x200B;

Oh I almost forgot to mention how infuriating it is to fix this issue. The side panels on my case are just tempered glass panels secured by a thumbscrew at each corner. They're not captive and the panels aren't hinged. I already broke and replaced 1 of these panels. It's worth the risk for it to look nice but not when you have to open the case every time you boot up your PC, to smack a fan to re-align its bearing, then close the case back up, only to then find the static has shorted the rear-port IO so now your keyboard and mouse are both unresponsive, so now you gotta hold down the power button and reboot the PC just to get the peripherals responding again (this doesn't take too long tbf coz ssd gang).

Fuck you corsair

&amp;#x200B;

TL,DR; 3 of my 6 case fans (from corsair) have busted their bearings within the 2 years I have owned my PC for, and the warranty on my left nut sack is longer than that."

I'm about to graduate and get my masters degree next week and I have a tough decision to make. I've been working full time job for the last year in one of the biggest IT consulting companies out there as a big data intern, however my academic background is also more about analytics and statistics (i'm graduating in ""Computer Science and Econometrics""). 

My main repsopnsibilites in current position are: building a star schema data warehouse (using SQL and Spark), bugfixes in existing tables, adding new source tables etc. I have never done any Kafka related stuff nor some extreamly-advanced pipelines using Spark Streaming or other tools. Most of them were quite complicated SQL queries (with over 1k lines of code). Within next 3 months the client I'm working for is going to be migrating from Hive to Snowflake and Wherscape, do you think knowing those would be benefitial to add to my resume? I would also learn some Amazon Athena and S3.

In my free time I often do kaagle competitions (just to test my skills and have some portfolio projects), prepare some ML models, try to do some predictive analysis. I really dont want to let those skills ""fade"" and develop in analytics as well. 

All the technologies/languages I have worked with are: SQL, Python (more analytical python, so libraries like: numpy, seaborn, scikit-learn, pandas etc.), R (although I hate it), Scala (basic scala to understand Spark better), Spark (also pySpark), Hive (Hive-QL), Apache Ariflow (althow I know how to trigger a job and read logs, not really how to write complicated scheduling scripts), Jenkins, Git, Jira. 

Now, I really have a tough decision to make.  Should I stay in my current job as data engineer (with promotion to regular engineer, not an intern anymore) or look into more data science field. What do you guys think would be more lucrative within the next 5-10 years? Is there any way I could lets say, within a year or two, easily change fields from data engineering to data science? I guess I would be pretty good at data preparation and cleaning in that time. Is knowlege of those technologies mentioned above superficial in case I wanted to change? Should I learn anything specific? Also, if I decide to stay in the current position, I can take certification exams in SQL and Spark. Would it be benefitial in data science? What would be the best path to take? 

Kind regards,"
hc6tul,0,2020-06-19,"What roles/positions in the tech industry combine both technical skills/knowledge and customer interaction, as well as interaction with colleagues across different departments?",BEEFWHISTLE604,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/hc6tul/what_rolespositions_in_the_tech_industry_combine/,"2.5 years ago I graduated from University with a degree in Computer Science and Mathematics. At the time, I knew that I didn't want to be a developer because (a) my programming skills are inferior to my peers and (b) I consider myself an extrovert and I didn't want to work a job that had minimal human interaction. I consider myself a people-person and I've always had a knack for forming relationships. I was fortunate enough to find a job in a tech company pretty quickly despite never doing any internships or coops. The position was for sales administration, and although it was entry-level, it was a great gateway into the tech world for me. My original goal/plan was to eventually move on from sales administration to being a sales associate for the company, but as time went on, I realized that the overall sales roles, at least for this particular company, were lacking any sort of technical orientation.

Fast-forward to August 2019, I end up moving from sales to QA within the same company, which is currently where I'm at today. I've been very happy up until recently because I get to be involved in the development process, I get to have a say in how certain parts of the company's product should look/work, and I also get to occasionally write automated tests. I'm so thankful that I got the opportunity to learn all these different technologies and processes, but I know that I do not want to pursue QA for my career. I enjoy human interaction and I enjoy presenting, and it seems that typically in QA those things aren't as common. Having said that, lately I've taken an initiative to do presentations of our next release to our sales and customer success team in an effort to educate them on new features so that they are not figuring them out at the same time as customers. In other words, I'm trying bridge the gap between the development team, and the customer-facing team. These presentations aren't frequent enough for me though, and I want more of it. 

So ultimately, I don't see myself as a developer, but I also don't see myself as a full-on sales associate. I see myself as being somewhere in the middle. As I mentioned, this is the very first company I've ever worked for, and I haven't been in the industry for too long, and so I'm wondering what kind of positions there are that can combine what I want most: technological skills/knowledge, frequent interaction with both customers and my colleagues across different departments. What kind of roles/positions are there that can potentially fulfill my desires?"

Any advice would be greatly appreciated as I feel like I am going to be stuck doing deskside support for my whole life if I don't progress soon. Thanks!"

hc7ut4,3,2020-06-19,Internship MSP Question.,techfreak11,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/hc7ut4/internship_msp_question/,"I have this situation where I'm trying to decide what to do.

I landed an internship with a small MSP of 3 employees. They have a couple of clients as well as they provide technical support to a xerox leasing company.

So far I have been handling all of the xerox printers tickets which involve all xerox models and all technical problems you can think of, except hardware.

I've been doing some tickets here and there from their clients on the MSP side as well but I still have a lot to learn there.

The problem I have is that we agreed that for the first 3 months there was going to be no pay just straight learning... internship wise.

It's going to be already 4 months and I had a meeting with the owner today and it was clear that I wanted to continue but also to be part of the team and he started talking about the situation with COVID and how most of his clients were having trouble paying and so on so forth. He then mentioned that eventually, he will start transitioning me to be part of the team and get compensation...  He did not give a timeframe.  I'm not going to be there 43 HOURS a week for free for 6 months.

Everyone is telling me to leave.. and I feel the same way."

I'm about to graduate and get my masters degree next week and I have a tough decision to make. I've been working full time job for the last year in one of the biggest IT consulting companies out there as a big data intern, however my academic background is also more about analytics and statistics (i'm graduating in ""Computer Science and Econometrics"").

My main repsopnsibilites in current position are: building a star schema data warehouse (using SQL and Spark), bugfixes in existing tables, adding new source tables etc. I have never done any Kafka related stuff nor some extreamly-advanced pipelines using Spark Streaming or other tools. Most of them were quite complicated SQL queries (with over 1k lines of code). Within next 3 months the client I'm working for is going to be migrating from Hive to Snowflake and Wherscape, do you think knowing those would be benefitial to add to my resume? I would also learn some Amazon Athena and S3.

In my free time I often do kaagle competitions (just to test my skills and have some portfolio projects), prepare some ML models, try to do some predictive analysis. I really dont want to let those skills ""fade"" and develop in analytics as well.

All the technologies/languages I have worked with are: SQL, Python (more analytical python, so libraries like: numpy, seaborn, scikit-learn, pandas etc.), R (although I hate it), Scala (basic scala to understand Spark better), Spark (also pySpark), Hive (Hive-QL), Apache Ariflow (althow I know how to trigger a job and read logs, not really how to write complicated scheduling scripts), Jenkins, Git, Jira.

Now, I really have a tough decision to make. Should I stay in my current job as data engineer (with promotion to regular engineer, not an intern anymore) or look into more data science field. What do you guys think would be more lucrative within the next 5-10 years? Is there any way I could lets say, within a year or two, easily change fields from data engineering to data science? I guess I would be pretty good at data preparation and cleaning in that time. Is knowlege of those technologies mentioned above superficial in case I wanted to change? Should I learn anything specific? Also, if I decide to stay in the current position, I can take certification exams in SQL and Spark. Would it be benefitial in data science? What would be the best path to take?

Kind regards"

hca87g,3,2020-06-19,Unsure of how to continue relationship w/ former bosses,DoorHingeDeliveries,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/hca87g/unsure_of_how_to_continue_relationship_w_former/,"This last semester (Spring, 2020) I was an intern with a lobbying group which I will leave unnamed. During my time there, I had a wonderful relationship with my superiors (I will call H, my direct boss, and S, another superior). I was told on multiple occassions by H that I ""exceeded their expectations"", and was promised plenty of praise in letters of recc if they were ever needed. H even went out of their way to flaunt their reccomendation abilities, which I was excited by and appreciative of. In late May I was told that, with all of the remote work, my services would no longer be required. I wasn't offended; I understood, took it gracefully, and **would have continued on my merry way.**

&amp;#x200B;

*HOWEVER--* before H let me off, given the cordiality and the amicability of the send off, I was offered the opportunity for their company to publish op-eds/articles on their behalf. Obviously, I wouldn't be paid for them, and while I would have more freedom than before on what I wrote I was still expected to stay on the line of their message/mission/outlook/whatever you get the picture. It was sort of a nice bonus because I love writing and it'd give me something productive to do during all of this. I was excited of course, and let them know that I would more likely than not take them up on that offer once or twice. I'm a freshman in college, and given the kind of field I want to go into, being published--in whatever way--is a nice little blip to put on the 'ol resume.

&amp;#x200B;

This was all in late May. June 1st rolls around, I shoot S--the one who published the few op-eds I did while under their employ--an email clarifying that they were still willing. S doesn't reply for a week. I shoot H a text asking the same thing, and they responds within the day saying ""Yes!!"" I am happy for a bit, but S--again the person who would revise my works and eventually put them up--still isn't getting back to me. Eventually, by June 9th, I opt to call H. They pick up; I tell them S hasn't had a chance to get back to me. H tells me that they'll let S know I've been trying to get into contact with them, but essentially politely tells me to buzz off (says twice during the call off-handedly that S's phone number can be found in their email signature). By June 11th, S still hasn't gotten back to the first email, or a phone call I gave him on the 10th.

&amp;#x200B;

I say ""screw it,"" and decide to write an op-ed. I spend a few hours on it--something I had no issue writing and enjoyed--and send it over. 3 hours later, S gets back to me via email, saying shortly: "" Thanks DoorHingeDeliveries, I’ll read over when I get the chance. Hope you’ve been doing well."" This was on the 11th. I sent him a follow-up email on Wednesday trying to egg something out of him, and he has yet to reply.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, I get it, you're a busy man. I'm hardly your first priority, not that I ever was before. But why is it so improper to just say you're swamped? Or have you decided that you DON'T want to publish me? Because either way, it's okay. It truly is. But the issue is, I'm running around with my head in my hands in suspense because *you haven't given me a clear answer*. If nothing else, I wanted to ASK if you guys would help publish me, but you OFFERED before the call ended. I really like them, I had a great time with them and when summer's up, I want to meet them for lunch in the fall. But I digress..

&amp;#x200B;

So, Reddit, tell me--is my relationship with my former bosses irreperably fucked? Are they just busy? I'd just like to know what you guys take from this. :/"

Today in this highlight, I'm going to be talking about Utah State University as requested by some on A2C.  Here are some great things about Utah State:

* Despite being an incredibly large public state school, they crunch out a lot of research.  More than 75% of seniors have participated in internships or field experience.
* There are fourteen Carnegie professors currently teaching.
* Home to 10 ski resorts!
* Lots of opportunities to study abroad despite having a student body over 24K.
* Practices rolling admission meaning there's a lot of openness as to when you can apply.  You can decide to apply after all the major college decisions are done or super early.
* You can determine your chances of getting in using their ""Admissions Index,"" as seen here.  The school could likely be a safety for many on A2C, making it a reliable place to apply.
* You can decide between multiple campuses, which gives you flexibility of locations!
* They give insane merit aid!  For a good amount of students, they give full tuition scholarships, and they offer a ton of other scholarships like 90% coverage of tuition for 2 years, etc. all based on your unweighted GPA and test scores.
* Around 47% of courses have 20 or fewer students.
* There's a lot of special majors offered, such as Agronomy, American Sign Language teaching, Law and Constitutional Studies, etc.
* This is more on Utah as a state than the school itself, but if you're into stargazing, Utah has some of the best stargazing sighting in the nation!  It's highly worth checking out, at least for a visit in the near time future.

Hope this helped!  Best of luck to rising seniors!  Hope you get into your first choice.

Have a nice day!"

I've gotten good references from both places, and I have a Top Secret clearance.  I've been sending out resumes, but I've started to develop a few questions:

Is NYC a diverse place for tech companies? I feel like almost all the places I've applied to are FinTech, or crazy big/competitive companies. My concern is that since it's so, so expensive most places just base themselves elsewhere.

Is a clearance useful outside of a handful of places?

Is remote an option?

Is Freelancing an option? Do people freelance as backend developers?

Obviously covid is going to chill the job market a lot, but any advice on how to improve my standing/my odds would be appreciated."

I immediately brought it to my supervising professor, who read the title and date before deciding it was to be shredded. However, I'd like a few more opinions on the matter. You can read the full transcription below.

**The Burrowing Man**

Jonathon C. Banks III , Joelle  Issa-Edwards

*February 1996*

Abstract:

Doctors from the Renaissance Hospital, Somerville have discovered a possible new species currently thought to best fit into the homo genus. If this classification is correct, it is the only parasitic primate known to man. Conversely, it cannot yet be ruled out that these unique characteristics are but extraordinary mutations, more than any ever previously recorded.

Introduction:

A patient was admitted to the Renaissance Hospital at 10:06 PM, December 22, 1995 on an emergency basis during premature labor. The patient showed severe anemia and needed intravenous therapy immediately. The patient was at the start of her third trimester when the complications arose, two days after she visited for an ultrasound, which showed a healthy pregnancy. The patient at the time of admittance could not be administered anesthesia with the high risk associated with someone in her condition. Signs of immense discomfort were apparent, such as moaning, swatting motions, and shivering. Her core temperature was critically low, indicating possible hypothermia. Her spouse noted that they haven't been outside or otherwise exposed to freezing elements. This suggested infection. A stool sample was taken, which showed heavy hemorrhaging. She underwent another ultrasound immediately after to see what has changed in the pregnancy. In spite of logic, it revealed what looked like twins. One was latched to the other, which drew the question of a delayed conjoined phenomenon, but its development would have to be rapid to align with the healthy ultrasound from days prior. 

Upon crowning, the infant appeared to have receded back up the birth canal. At 12:17 AM, the patient went into cardiac arrest due to tremendous blood loss. She was pronounced dead after all possible methods of revival failed. Amid delivery of the first child, it was determined stillborn. The child was subsequently drawn back into the canal after almost entirely out. As Doctor Issa-Edwards pulled for the child, a paw-like hand clenched to its ankle followed. She unclasped the hand as a nurse attempted to help deliver it, but she lost her grip, which she would describe as ""slippery as a soap bar."" The hand drew back fully into the birth canal. Doctor Issa-Edwards opted for a cesarean section for the second delivery. Opening the uterus revealed what was initially thought to be a severely deformed child. Immediately noticeable was an elongated head with a snout-like nose at the tip. Its mouth was beneath, which was toothy and circular. The eyes were disproportionately small and dark, despite its apparent albinism. It was thought to have extreme kyphosis due to its atypical shoulder structure. Upon its extraction, it looked impossibly big to be able to fit inside of a uterus.

Method:

Under observation, the subject measured 92 cm in length and weighed 45 lbs. The sex was determined as male. X-rays showed peculiar bone density. Its extremities consisted mostly of fibrous tissue and its spine showed far more cartilage than typically found in humans. Its pores secreted a fluid consisting largely of water, protein, glycoproteins, lipids, potassium chloride, and epithelial cells, covering its skin in a mucousy layer. The subject refused formula and quickly showed undernourishment and distress. Upon autopsy of the patient the subject was extracted from, she was discovered to have had several bite marks similar to those made by various parasitic worms and fish. The stillborn showed one significant mark, as well. With no umbilical cord and the inert nature of the subject, it was decided that the patient did not give birth to it. It was also noted that the bite marks matched the subject's mouth perfectly. It was gathered that the mouth acted as a suction with 12 rows of sharp teeth roughly 3 mm in length and 1 mm in diameter. The mouth was absent of molars. This revealed that it didn't chew, and further, that its diet consisted of blood from live hosts. There was no evidence under observation to signify the subject was at all human until a DNA test revealed a striking resemblance to our own. It had 23 pairs of chromosomes with a shape much like humans. An MRI showed similar brain composition, but its function was notably different, particularly in the prefrontal cortex, which functioned at a significantly reduced level.

To further examine the subject's feeding habits, it was transferred to the M. Sheffield Memorial Laboratory of Biology at the Herbert Medical School. The constant for our method was for its potential host to be a mammal. Our first variable was size. The subject was put inside of a secure room at two separate times, once with a female rat, the second with a female domestic pig. The creature displayed agitation with the rat when its vocal communication was first recorded. Its voice was similar in timbre to the scream of a baboon. After 48 hours with the rat, it was decided that it was not recognized by the subject as nourishment. During the test with the pig, the subject initially showed inactivity. Once the pig fell asleep, the subject opened the pig's vulva with its hands and inserted itself headfirst, followed by its barreled shoulders. It then used its hands to climb further inside, and ultimately, completely in. The pig didn't wake during the process, possibly due to the potassium chloride secretions acting as a numbing agent, but severe hemorrhaging began the following morning. The subject was extracted through its point of entry. The uterus of a healthy and large enough animal seemed to be the ideal host for the subject, but the size for its sustainability was another question, which could shed light on its geographic origin. An 8 month pregnant horse was used as the next potential host for the subject. Its route of entry was the same as previously recorded. No forced extraction was necessary due to hemorrhaging or other complications. An ultrasound was to be performed each month until the suspected delivery of the foal. On the 10th month of pregnancy, an emaciated fetus was extracted by the horse naturally, with no other complications than miscarriage. Ultrasound imaging displayed the subject perfectly replacing the foal in pregnancy. The mare, though, showed signs of malnourishment. The subject was surgically extracted after 2.5 months in the womb.

Conclusions:

On February 19, one day after the conclusion of the feeding experiment, the subject went missing from the facility. Efforts to relocate it have thus far have come up short, but theories of its suspected escape have been cause for constant speculation. The leading theory is that due to its undetectable mode of entry, the subject used someone working at the facility for a vehicle until it was outside. This mode would have to be transient due to its size and high potential for a human host to sustain internal organ rupture. As previously stated, more tests are required to determine whether this is indeed a new species, or if its peculiarities are the result of remarkable mutation. Along with a concentrated effort to locate the subject, physicals of large mammals should be more frequent, especially if they are displaying signs of stress or malnutrition."

&amp;#x200B;

I'm about to graduate with my Master's in Computer Engineering this summer and with the current situation, how should I go about finding a job? I have been interning at a government lab for 2 years and it's been good experience and money but there are hiring freezes and I might not get what looked like a more or less guaranteed position there. Where should I apply? How should I even look for a job. I'm not entirely sure what I want to do. At my internship I mostly did frontend/backend development using things like Java, Angular, Spring MVC, Jenkins etc and it was cool since I haven't really done things like that before. My emphasis on my Master's degree was Computer Vision/Image processing where I did things like face and activity recognition only 2 classes and 2 semester of independent study where where worked on activity recognition project which was also pretty interesting. I, however, am not sure what I want to do. Never done computer vision type of work in work environment so I'm afraid to just get a job in it but am willing to give it ago since I find it intersting.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all how do I look for a job when I have no particular preference to what company I want to work at. I feel like there are so many option and so many hiring freezes right now that I'm a bit confused and not sure how to start. Thanks in advance for any help."

I'm having trouble deciding whether or not I should continue on the MEng course, or swap to the BEng equivalent. (4 years total)

In the additional  MEng year I do a 6 month placement and a semester of courses - however these courses don't seem particularly interesting or relevant for me (they're EE topics I don't care for). I'm also currently doing a summer internship, so I'll be graduating with some experience anyway if I were to go BEng. 

In the 4th year the MEng programme forces you to take a engineering studies course, which is useful, but means I can't study a relevant robotics/AI course if I were on BEng. 

I guess this boils down to, what do employers value more - relevant studies or degree type?"

My thoughts after 7 year in engineering  … 

I loved computer since I was a child and I always dreamed about the day that I will graduate because I will know everything about what I love and I will innovate and be the best one in the world because that is my passion and what I love … 
here I am 20 years of studying and working hard to achieve what I want I found out that I know near to nothing … let me explain …
the education system teachs you no skill and lots of thing that might be useful it will widen your thoughts and your scale for things but lets face it life do that too even without education … today u graduate with any major and u are full of debt even if its from your parent … if u do not realize that then do not read … 
if you are a lawyer u spent years of studying and memorizing laws to go first day for your training and hear the lawyer tell you throw your books out there are so many ways to skin the cat … 
as a doctor u will see that all the books you have read can not teach you how to close a small cut probably … 
as an engineer with any field you will realize you have learned no skill that could feed you or pay your debt … 
you need to start in internship with more debt (if you could find a company to hire you … my next post ) and have to learn from the beginning to learn something …
so why are we still having the same educational system? What is the point? If at the end of the day for work I need to learn everything from zero? 
All the courses I have learn in school could be casual discussion or via you tube videos u can learn it yourself so why bother and study in the first place??? 
kokki you need to have specialization in your field or any field … 
yeah great at what cost ? And why do not I learn a special thing from the beginning ? 
Because u need to learn the basic first okay ? 
Aha really ? What about the teach me the basic I need in my specialization not in everything ? I will talk personally now … 
as a computer engineer I have a slight idea about few fields such as programming networking and Cybersecurity also hardware and software … 
do you know what job could I get? The ANSWER IS NONE … 
because in each field there is so many field and with our communication and inventions there are things that is new everyday u could spend your whole life without learning them all … 
I accept that but I spent all my learning time to realize that I have learned almost nothing ? I dare any graduate Engr to be able to set up a network … or to build an app or a program or or or or … why do not we learn what matters in school ??? 
why we spent our youth killing our passion and our creativity in such a useless  way …. honestly the only thing I learn so far was PATIENCE  … and to follow the book (which mean discipline) well guess what teach me a way to get a job or to have a skill will be more useful and better .  
Academia is only useful for academia not for the world and I guess we really need to find solution for that … because such a system will destroying more than it is building …

Got one acceptance into another degree altogether and one into an MS program, but it isn't a 100% match.(Electrical Engineering)

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted a program with more Machine Learning Concentration. But this is still a good school,(Penn State Harrisburg).

&amp;#x200B;

Last whatever fuck(Corona and working from home messed it up), I was rejected by a lot of competitive schools including Georgia Tech, Wisconsin-Madison, Purdue, University of Toronto.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I can deffer till fall 2021, but my only question to myself if I should apply again. The things that changed in this time:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Finished my degree work and should be a graduate rather than a senior.
2. Worked on a final year project, but no research paper from it cause of funding issues.
3. A little better understanding of the work I wanted to do in machine learning. ( I want to either do ML but as a Electronics Engineer that is more interested in specific applications and image processing rather than concentrating on developing packages and extreme coding). Still no further clarity
4. A little better understanding of the research process in general
5. A paper publication where I am the third author

&amp;#x200B;

Things I would like to change but might not be able to:

1. More coursera courses(I have a habit of abandoning them and don't trust myself to change that in a quarantine)
2. Better GRE scores(Math in 76th Percentile). (But with Corona, it will be hard to know what will happen for sure)
3. Productive Internships(With Corona being a cunt, I really don't have an idea of what comes next. People with internships are being asked to not come in. Will be harder to get something new. People who had interviews were asked to come in later cause of stuff)
4. Assuming that I can start something in a few months, I don't think I can do enough to put on my resume and LoR from it.
5. The Stress of begging for LoRs, re-researching my Universities, potential mentors, contacting them, working on an SoP while doing internship work is hard. (It sucked last year too)

&amp;#x200B;

The other thing I don't know is what to do if I defer here and change my mind next year? The stress of waiting till May and June to be rejected is not fun in the slightest.

This is my last summer as a student with plans to graduate in December. I got an internship in a manufacturing plant this summer to see what I could learn. I learned that I want to be in Dallas (the city of my last 9 month co-op) because I liked the environment and the people I've met (made some really good friendships down there) but the issue is that my major (materials engineering) is pretty specific and all the places I have a decent shot at don't take my major. I even tried the other cities around it like Fort Worth and Austin but it's all tech. The last place I worked at isn't hiring and covid hit them hard so I don't see an option that way.

Here is the sixteenth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?That's completely up to what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.

All the best,

hcscw7,4,2020-06-20,Feeling unsupported as an intern,smallgrayfox,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/hcscw7/feeling_unsupported_as_an_intern/,"Hey everyone,

This will be a long-ish post but I'll include a TL;DR below.

**TL;DR: Undergrad hired as a software developer intern last month, at a startup, to effectively work on a research project.  Struggling with specific technical skills (which all prior interns have learned on the job), understanding their code, and generally finding a direction for my project, which I've received too little guidance on in my opinion.  Boss is hands-off and very slow to respond to my messages or requests for calls.  Feeling very unproductive, like I shouldn't be here, and worried about getting fired.  Need help in reaching out for support.**

Long version:

I was hired recently as an intern for a very small research-intensive software company, based in California.  We use a lot of advanced software engineering tools (i.e. GPU programming), which I had no prior experience with and they were aware of this.  I am a STEM (but non-CS / software engineering) major.  Our team is very small, and we're all working at home for the foreseeable future.

Starting out was nice and I definitely enjoyed the first few weeks as I worked on a fairly straightforward set of tasks/bugs.  After I finished these, my boss (whom is currently the most involved in my tasks) introduced me to the longer-term project I would be working on, continuing the work from the previous intern.  For the next week or two, I spent a lot of time reading about the current methods in this area, and then I started to read some of the code the past intern had written for this project.

The actual project was worked on by the previous intern to me, and she had quite a few really good results, but a large portion of what she worked on (like, around half of what she spent her year long term working on) was left unreleased.  My boss wants me to focus on improving the code she wrote that was released, and alongside this he also wants me to do a lot of what she did again but from scratch. He even went so far as to tell me to not worry about reading through the unreleased code that she wrote, as no one really knows what it does (and I'm assuming it was unreleased because the project didn't work out).  This was kinda strange to me as it seems like it's throwing away 6 months of her work.  On top of this, I went through the timeline of her contributions that were actually released, and she worked WAY more productively than I have so far.  Even when she was 6 weeks in, she had so much more done than I have currently.  I can't help but ask myself everyday, ""if she couldn't make progress on the larger goals despite working on them for over 6 months, how could I expect to, given how I'm progressing so much slower?""

Combined with this, as I've alluded to above, I've been really slow to learn the more technical skills that are required to really do anything with the project. I've learned some of the basics of GPU programming, but reading their code has been very challenging and I can only understand the *most basic* portions of their GPU code.  I am completely new to GPU programming, as the past interns have all been, but it is essential for my project and so I must learn it faster.  I think it would really help me out if I could call my boss and walk me through the more advanced parts of their code (he and the previous intern are the only authors of this section of the codebase), but I've been asking for this for a few weeks now and it hasn't happened yet.  Which leads me to my next struggle....

My boss seems really busy and thus is slow to reply to my messages.  I often message him with high level ideas I have / questions about the project, clarifications about specific things, requests to call, etc.   (All of these questions are things I've already looked into as best as I can, and couldn't find answers). And most of the time I have to wait like 2-3 days for a reply.  He's a really nice person, and really helpful when we do call, but actually trying to get on calls with him has been difficult.  When I encounter a problem I can't solve, I try to reach out but my messages to him and even my messages to team-wide communication streams often go unanswered.  Also, there's no one else on the team who is familiar enough with this section of the codebase to help me out, other than him.

So, most days I find myself running into things I don't understand, spend most of the day banging my head against a wall, then take a break, and work on some of the lighter work I've been assigned.  Each week I've been feeling worse and worse, and I have this sinking feeling that I'm going to get fired as I'm truly so much less productive than everyone else on the team (and there are other new hires on the team too, not just me).  I don't think the fear of being fired is unfounded as employees have been let go in the past for reasons of technical ability.

Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with a situation like this?  I'm trying to do my best with what I have but I really am struggling with the more technical parts of this.  I can't help but feel like it would be a bit easier working in the office, because to get a question answered, you usually can walk up to someone and ask for a bit of their time -- but working remotely makes it so much harder to get help.  I genuinely really enjoy this kind of work and find it interesting -- I am trying not to take this opportunity for granted as I know how it has become ridiculously difficult for undergraduates to find internships/work because of COVID-19.  I am really starting to doubt whether I'm qualified for tackling such a difficult project (and this is made worse by my slow progression with learning key technical skills).  Any advice or words of support are really appreciated; I hope everyone is taking care during this strange time!"
hct4se,1,2020-06-20,Is Cybersecurity boot camp worth it or should I just teach myself and get certified?,AisforAlex-,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/hct4se/is_cybersecurity_boot_camp_worth_it_or_should_i/,"I could use some guidance right now. I’m trying to get my life back on track.
I’m a 21 year old high school dropout. 
I’m currently pursuing my hiset and after I get my diploma I want to get into IT. College is not for me. 
I’ve always had a thing for computers and wanted to get into IT when I was younger but had no drive and now more than ever I would love to get into it. Especially now since the pandemic is coming to a close and I don’t want to go back to retail ever again.
The school near me is offering a 16 week Cybersecurity boot camp. 
It will not grant me any certifications necessarily but the woman I spoke to from the college that’s offering it told me it’s good to have on my resume that I went to a 16 week training course and I would have a better chance at getting hired and that they offer career advancements and can get me in connection with many internships and jobs looking for entry level IT techs. 
I’ve also read from people who’ve self taught themselves and got certified on their own. 
It wouldn’t be impossible to teach myself but I would rather have someone do it for me and educate myself at home as well but I was curious if anyone here has done the boot camp route and if it’s worth the money and time

EDIT: I appreciate everyone’s input and I’ve decided to teach myself. Good luck to everyone!"

During my studies, I realized that there was strong relationship between CS and Mathematics. After being asked to perform some statistical analyses and implement NLP solutions in my internships, I spoke with friends who pursued math as a minor/major and some faculty and decided to try and minor in mathematics.

Unfortunately, I did not perform well in the mathematics courses. I suspect I just lack strength in some very fundamental mathematical concepts. Fortunately, I pulled through in my core CS courses. In the future, I would like to be involved in Data Science roles which I understand will require a significant understanding of statistical analysis, calculus, &amp; other core math concepts.

I'd appreciate your ideas on the following:

1) How can I diagnose my mathematical weaknesses?

2) Once I know what to work on, would you all recommend I just utilize online teaching resources like Khan Academy or try to get into a graduate program in statistics?

3) How do I know when to give up, leave the statistical analysis &amp; ML work to the smart kids, and just do some regular dev work?

I’m just not sure if the stuff I mentioned below means I should move on or give these “friends” another chance.

I am an international student from Canada who managed to get an offer at a top tech company this summer and am currently interning there. I noticed that some people from high school who are/were my “friends” who used to make fun of me are trying to bond again. For reference, when I chose UCLA, I told these people I withdrew my Waterloo application (since I was upset after being rejected). They then said I did this since I knew I wouldn’t get in. 

They’re not interning at companies as “prestigious” as me even though they go to a really big target school and seem to be trying to become friendlier with me again to try and get referrals for networking later on. I don’t know to feel about that. I felt like some of these people were decent friends (not close friends) in high school and since they go to a target it might help to reciprocate being friends with them again. What would y’all do?

Also, I understand this might seem a bit naive in terms of my relationships with strangers, I noticed when I put on dating apps I am a software engineering intern at “top tech company”,I get a lot more attention then when I left off my job information. Do people just assume I have a lot more money since I work at these companies or is it because it seems like it’s a prestigious career? How do you handle it? I don’t wanna be used by people who aren’t interested in me for free drinks/food/events."

I just finished my FYP during CB (congrats future grads you won't experience havoc). Haven't officially graduated but I'd like to give some tips to incoming freshmen (or troubled existing folks) who are supposedly worrying before sch starts yet during my time we practically didn't care haha. Students who study at NAFA always have a bad perception of the sch but ever wondered why they end up not doing well and suffer after graduation? I'm here to give tips to help prevent that and as well try to not shit on the sch hahaha

Sauce: studied in diploma in design (Landscape and Architecture). Graduated with a GPA above 3.5, got 1 scholarship and 2  job offers directly after FYP (considered tier 1 companies in my industry). Currently waiting for NUS because I haven't submitted my final results LOL (I might update how it went)

Edit: I GOT IN!

—-

Acronyms:

*SOAD* (School of Art and Design): The department where 3D Design, Fine Arts, Design and Media plus Fashion Studies are ""co-related"". Every student from each department will mix for 1 semester to do foundation study. Being in this department opens flexibility of course transfer

*FYP*: Final Year Project. This will be spammed once you hit year 3

&amp;#x200B;

—-

**1. Do not skim your foundation study (year 1 sem 1)**

Why most people's GPA continues to tumble down is because they lost the motivation at the start. They got horrified after getting their first results. Foundation year is a common study for all SOAD courses and despite it not being the actual semester study of your course until sem 2, one should not forgo the classes. 4 months with randos and this is the time to start doing group work and networking with them. Foundation year consists of basic design theory, introduction to visual arts (art history), drawing fundamentals, creative thinking (free obtainable As) and general studies (the one that sucks ass). Class may seem like pri/sec sch art classes but take them seriously. Students with good art/foundation skills usually survive until the end. Though this was the only semester I scored a bit below 3.5. I like art but do not have that stong art ability and my level of skill is at semi-realistic sketching of humans. If your basic skills are worse than mine, 3 tips to remember:

&amp;#x200B;

* Practice to get the techniques right
* Check especially to get an opinion from your classmates and lecturers
* Redo your work if it's underwhelming

&amp;#x200B;

Do all of this before submission and you will get a score above 3. If you do try hard enough, you may get a 4. Also, don't ever be stingy on art materials at the start, it can make or break your grades/motivation

&amp;#x200B;

—-

**2. Attend all classes**

The rule is simple, it's 3 strikes until deduction without MC. The amount of deduction if you're curious is 1 grade down and can do worse if you continue missing classes. Disappearance is common and so don't try any funny tricks at the lecturers. Even if group work is a pain, don't skip class to sabotage your group. YOU may just end up being the carry of your group. I do not skip any of my classes unless I physically can't do work (does not apply to the lack of sleep) or am unwell. Do attend on time as well because you'll be a headache to whoever is repeating their instructions

&amp;#x200B;

—-

**3. Maintain motivation and proper diet for consistent output**

I can't emphasize this enough. Studying at NAFA can suck your soul till you bleed and all the negative influences in and out of sch can affect your lifestyle/working attitude. It is highly important to prioritise your mental health. I managed to talk someone out of suicide over a breakup. Being socially active is important but you can also be well distracted from work. To be honest, you don't need friends to keep you motivated, you need to tweak your mindset yourself. I stopped my habit of gaming once sch started and I completely forgot how to game once the holidays came. I spent my foundation year doing work with my 1 friend from sec sch who studied Fine Arts. We weren't into socialising so it was beneficial for us muggers. Find someone who wants to succeed and work with them or find that in yourself so that you can motivate others.

Secondly, getting a proper diet at a sch without a canteen is tricky. Food is expensive around NAFA (exception of the sandwich machine). I mostly spent my 1st year eating cup noodles and packed sandwiches + hot milo before realising how lethargic I was despite getting enough sleep. I was also drinking coffee almost a cup daily until it didn't keep me awake. I don't suggest starving yourselves in a bid to save money or weight even. Even if you don't sleep well, keep the other parts of your body functional. Distance to the food stalls may also be a problem when rushing before the next class. There's so much food so what's the best under a $5/10 budget that's nearby sch?

&amp;#x200B;

***$5 budget***

* Hong Sen Curry Rice (SMU) (say you're from SMU for discount HAHAHA)
* Mr Bean (SMU)
* Cheers (Hotel M)
* 7 Eleven (Sunshine Plaza/Ibis hotel) (Mac and cheese is so good + brownies/drinks discount)
* Takashimaya food hall (Orchard) (a bit far but if you have a 1hr30mins+ break then a million buses will get there in 10mins, Japanese food is cheap, never tried the food court)
* Don Don Donki (Sommerset 313)
* Fortune Centre ($2.50 bee hoon is the cheapest)
* Albert Food Centre (Famous Yong tau foo)
* McDonald's (Peace centre/plaza sing)
* That salted egg stall (Sim Lim Square) (Don't remember the name but common for students to eat there, freaking good)

&amp;#x200B;

***In between $5-10***

* Tea Party (SMU) (My fave, $5.20 for pasta with free ice lemon tea
* Subway (SMU/Sim Lim Square)
* Tori-Q (Plaza Sing/Sommerset 313)
* 18 Chefs (Bugis junction/Cathay) (student meal)
* Genki Sushi (Bugis Plus)
* Japanese Curry Express (Fortune Centre) (short opening time, might be full)
* Big fish small fish (Bugis junction)

&amp;#x200B;

There's hot water in the sch so if you want to store cup noodles in the locker for instant meals, feel free to do so

&amp;#x200B;

**4. Don't be stingy on art materials**

You won't want to use watercolour for an acrylic painting. I've spent cash on a box of Copic markers, model materials, camera, a new desktop pc and not to mention bunch stuff I used for a while. I'm not rich but I'd say all of this was for a great investment and it turned out excellent. My parents are always there to support me but I covered about 80% of the stuff I bought. Without the materials to do work, you're doomed. Borrowing something from someone frequently isn't wise because there will be a day when that person can't share. So, unless you're not frugal, buy what you need and not what you want for 3 years and then reward yourself afterwards

&amp;#x200B;

***Tips to save money:***

* Plan for what to buy to prevent overspending
* Buy at Artfriend (student discount). Online shops (Taobao, shoppee etc.) will have cheaper alternatives. Avoid extremely cheap unbranded goods due to quality problems
* Split the product with other people
* Take modelling materials from your studio or workshop
* Buy tools/materials from Malaysia. Mr. DIY has cheap modelling tools and Artfriend exists in JB
* More for Fine Arts students. If you go on OIP to China, art materials are godly cheap. Bring big luggage and buy tons. Can Taobao to hotel/hostel
* Use sch workshop facilities instead of external vendors. Laser cutting (80cents/min) and 3D printing has the best rate

&amp;#x200B;

**5. Try to participate in sch activities even if you're an introvert**

I'm an introvert but guess I can say that NAFA got me out of my comfort zone (even though I'm forever at home). Sch activities (as a whole cohort) at NAFA are rare as they are about 2x annually (Open House + Orientation) and they involve interaction with the public/freshmen. Gone through both and their prep camps and I just want to say how fun it was to mingle with people. The experience is not like your poly camps plus it's practically free + get shirts. Try to keep your score above 2.5 to participate in these events. Other events that are given by your lecturers for your specific course of study should also be taken up. [CCAs are freshly available](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/flkte3/nafalasallenafas_cca_options/fkzokau/?context=3) and points will be given. Not to mention, the overseas trip is once in a lifetime opportunity. It costs about $2k but you can get a subsidy for it. Words can't describe how wild the sch handles overseas trips hahaha. All of these can be written in your graduation catalogue/portfolio. Since there's also not a lot of things to do at NAFA, I strongly suggest doing as much as possible while trying not to destroy your schedule

&amp;#x200B;

**6. Work with the correct people or guide the people who want to be correct**

NAFA isn't the sch where the brightest minds come to study. It's a talent sch. Don't have high expectations for the people here as you may judge your classmates due to most of them being an international student, from ITE or even JC. Don't look at them that way and instead, see their abilities because that is what brought them here. Should you have luck, you'll get to work with the right people. My course has a majority of students with skills that are stuck at the borderline or worse and doing group work is a pain. We often don't get to choose who to work with and this context will be similar in the workforce. My grades dropped a bit (y2s1) due to 1 chaotic mess where I worked with 3 boys (men who couldn't do work) and had 1 guy drop out in the middle due to personal problems. I always carried my group as I was seen as the most capable but I do push my groupmates to work harder and most of the time when the collaboration goes well, it is because they took in the correct advice. DO NOT stir drama and ask your lecturers to swap your groupmates. You will be allowed to give feedback at the end so do tolerate the group work for a moment. Guide these people and do not give up on them, carry the work if there is no choice

&amp;#x200B;

**7. Strive to be a perfectionist**

Talent shows that your idea is good, better if you didn't ask your lecturer to do your work hahaha. Striving to be perfect at your work is pretty crucial especially for future employers/getting awards besides flexing the work towards your classmates and lecturers. Being in SOAD, all of our work requires the production of something which could be a model/presentation board etc for submission. This stuff can be put into your portfolio. [Click here for design portfolio samples](https://issuu.com/search?q=design%20portfolio). Another important thing is if fortunate enough, top tier companies may hire you for internships if your grades + portfolio + interview is good. I'm not sure if the other courses have external examiners but if they examine your FYP and the work is good, they may give a job offer after FYP which was my situation. Of course, to succeed, a lot of sacrifices have to be made and it may be hard to keep your sanity intact

&amp;#x200B;

***Tips to do well:***

* Always ask/Consult for feedback and write them down, even the ones for your classmates as it still can be a relevant reminder for future works
* Make a library of resources for yourself. Pinterest is your best friend. Download all the notes/slides/references from ilearn/Canvas into your pc/drive as they will disappear after the sem. Can be photos/books/PSD/CAD files etc
* Fully master industry software/techniques to not forget and hasten workflow. I self-studied new software to have an upper advantage
* Know how to organise yourself, your things and your time to accomplish work perfectly
* Do not bootlick the lecturers pls

&amp;#x200B;

**8. Enjoy your time at NAFA**

Honestly, [my time at NAFA is a 5/10](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ed54x5/n_levels_nafa/fbgdsp2/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) but it was unique studying at a costly art sch. Some memorable ones: went to China for 3 weeks and drank alcohol almost daily, made friends with another avid photographer to go for shoots, awkwardly dancing with everybody in the public during open house. I don't regret not going to poly because I was passionate about architecture (the sch deadass has none but I learned to like landscape architecture). If I didn't come to NAFA, I would've been studying mechanical engineering at TP with those sad O level grades. The emotional breakdowns, dramas and stuff I encountered are pretty epic tales in my lifetime. I'm proud that I can prove that I have managed to succeed based on my talents instead of academics. I'm very grateful to have been a student of NAFA

hd3gir,2,2020-06-21,22 Yo brother died 7 mos go &amp; I went psychotic.,olivia-davies,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/hd3gir/22_yo_brother_died_7_mos_go_i_went_psychotic/,"Yeah, it was bad. My bro who was one of the most incredible people just fuckin up n died on thanksgiving. Fentanyl. The summer before he died, I was listening to Saba song and I had a panic attack thinking about my little dying. Some might call that premonition but honestly I was constantly afraid of him dying. I'm a social worker. I'm 26 yo but since we had a somewhat rough upbringing and Ive had some intense jobs I knew my little bro was high risk, even though I didnt know he was on drugs or to what extent... 

My mom was consistently loving and caring despite battling severe depression and abuse from my father and our cult. I understood why my mom couldnt get out of bed for days and why she told me she wanted to hang herself in our closet.. My dad and cult upbringing trained me to be helpful and pleasing above all else. I saw my moms weaknesses and I took over most of the duties. I made sure my brothers rationed the food, I interruoted the most violent confrontations and sometimes even managed to deescalate it. 

My brother and I were SO close. Some might think it was weird but to be honest we had been through too much together to give a fuck. We were poor a lot of the time and that meant putting our matresses in the apartment kitchen and bunkering down without internet. My mom, my brother and I found solstace in each other after my mom escaped my dad and the cult. We were all free to explore new things together and even the smallest freedoms made life worth living. On the hottest days, we would sit in the park and read a book out loud together until there wasnt enough light to read. My brother was the man that taught me how men were supposed to treat women. He was a fuckin knight and he treated EVERYONE with that respect. It was his biggest fault (no confrontation was missed if justice was at stake) but it also made him so pure. 

Last year, he had a psychotic episode and stole my dads car and drove it into the ground and got into a 22 mile car chase with ICE. He said his radio told him to... Remarkably, he escaped ICE and layed low until I came to pick him up. I spent a few days with him and persuaded him to go to a long term mental health program. My connections helped me get him into an amazing place, he loved it and got to be right on the oceanside. He made wonderful art and music while he was there.. During that time I didnt see him.. 

I moved away to Las Vegas to take car of my ex bf mom who got mad cow disease. It makes me mad that I spent that time away from him especially when I knew he was struggling.. 

My ex was undiagnosed schizophrenic for the firdt 4 years of our relationship.. He would fly into rages tell sometimes where he would scream racial slurs, sexist slurs, violent things etc. He would break my windows with his head.. Things wers hard..  

I got sick while I was with him. So sick I couldnt walk or stand.  My brother took 24 tabs of acid a few weeks before dying and told me that my bf was making me sick. I got defensive but we stayed cool. Ibtold my bro the dr put me on synthetic opiates for my sickness and he begged me to get off of them.. Told me to sip lean instead, ha. 

When he died I couldnt take any more opiates so I quit then cold turkey. The hospital wouldnt treat me without insurance they just offered me potassium lol. 

So, I stayed awake for 8 days. Wide awake. Running, sweating, vomiting, and meditating. By thd 8th day I felt AMAZING. Too amazing... It was my first manic episode with psychotic features. I started doing crazy math things haha and I thought I was going to somehow cure the abuse in my family like a goddamn savior. I randomly told everyone in my fam that my dad sexually abused me.. Which aside from him groping me and making me strip for belt spanking at questionable ages.. I cant tell exactly if he abused me to the extent that I think he did.. I have some flashbacks that are confusing and they correlate to a spot on my stomach that feels like knives when its touched. 

I was laying down on my back on the floor deep breathing when my mom came in and put her hands and head on me to comfort me. My response? I attacked her by grabbing her hair and arms so hard she said I was throwing her around like I was a 3pp on man... As I'm grabbing her arms hard, I start screaming about my dad raping me. Yeah. Idk what to even say about it. Then to make things worse inwas so delusional I didnt even recognize how violent I was. I thought i was justified because my mom didnt believe me? But my mom and I hadnt even talked about it... I also thought my mom was like possessed hahaha. Yeah it was bad. 

So MONTHS later, I'm clean from opiates and ive kicked out my ex and outed all my past abusers... i realize ive  been COMPLETELY insane and I make amends with family friends etc.. 

Now I'm just here doing life, trying so fucking hard to scrape up money for my car registration but crying in between pizza deliveries and working a dead end social work job. I cant afford medical insurance or therapy and I feel like no one in my family will trust me again until I get help. Shit- I dont trust me! I need help and its all anyone tells me... *get therapy*.. I found therapy and now its an intern who isnt even able to give diagnosis"
hd3p8g,3,2020-06-21,Should I quit my cardiology fellowship?,dizzygirl_,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/hd3p8g/should_i_quit_my_cardiology_fellowship/,"Hi! I’m new here but I am currently at a crossroads.

I’m a doctor who just started her second year of cardiology fellowship training. Normally, we finish training after three years and decide thereafter if we want to train further for a subspecialty. I have finished four years of medical school, a year of internship, and three years of Internal Medicine training and passed its certifying exams. Technically, I could have started my practice after that but it has been a lifelong dream to be a cardiologist.

My first year as a cardiology fellow has been a dream. I’ve learned a lot and felt secure about my job. I had fairly decent pay, a lot of learning opportunities, and a relaxed work environment. Honestly, I wouldn’t dream of even quitting.

However since the pandemic started, things have started to turn for the worse. It started last March when one of my bosses (who actually runs the hospital), filed a disciplinary case against me, accusing me of fraud after trying to assist another consultant who wanted to be admitted at that time. It is actually a giant mess right now because those two bosses are in the middle of a mess that that boss has created. Right in the heart of that case is an index covid patient who allegedly started the local transmission in our hospital.

That case basically changed my entire worldview. It was basically upsetting to see someone I respected create a huge problem for me that could have entirely been avoided if she wanted to. Up until now, three months after the complaint was filed and all the incident reports submitted, there is still no resolution to that case. I had a lawyer check the complaint letter and told me that I could actually sue them should they decide to terminate my fellowship just because of that stupid case.

Other than that, lots of my co-workers have been disenfranchised and demotivated at work (and initially very angry) since we felt that we weren’t really being heard. There have been rumors of donated PPEs being charged to patients, all in the middle of an actual shortage of PPEs or a plethora of substandard PPEs. People are also being given jobs that aren’t in their job description, some also being unnecessarily exposed to cases.

Given the changes that we have to adapt to, I should also note that cardiology training at the time of this pandemic has all but halted. Cases have been cut to less than half. We compromise by doing a lot of web conferences. But to be honest, there is only so much that theoretical training can cover. We need to see patients.

I could have reluctantly reluctantly gone on with the training but the final nail in the coffin has arrived: our allowance has been cut off in half. Fellowship training actually is a phase where getting a “salary” is a grim topic to discuss. Some trainees really don’t get their allowance. But when we entered the program, we were promised allowances that would allow us to pay for utilities. I’m basically dependent on that allowance and very rarely relied on my parents for financial support. Our salary basically comes from financial grants from pharmaceutical companies who now have been quite reluctant to shell out funds for cardiology fellowship training.

All of these combined are making me seriously consider quitting the program. I keep thinking that the half salary that’s being given to me is not worth all of the stress that I’m encountering right now.

I am currently contemplating that should I quit, I would instead temporarily take a job that pays more (usually that of a hospitalist who attends to covid patients) and eventually apply to a cardiology fellowship program (there are approximately 15 in our country). And since I really really wanted to become a cardiologist, I might actually be willing to l start all over again as a first year cardiology fellow in another institution. Although, again, salary might be an issue if a transfer.

What do you think?"

hd6xrh,232,2020-06-21,Can I learn and make arduino projects exclusively from youtube?,smokeflame,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/hd6xrh/can_i_learn_and_make_arduino_projects_exclusively/,"Hello there! 

I am currently in the first year at Computer Engineering (3 more exams and I'm done with the first year :D). Since I want to pursue a career in hardware engineering (doing circuit design, using math, physics knowledge, also a little hardware programming), I would like to start learning some basics this summer or during the following year. I would also want to get an internship in the summer after the 2nd year of college, so it would be nice and very helpful to learn some things right now to have an advantage over other students who apply.

Since hardware engineering si about circuits, microcontrollers (maybe) and a little programming, I thought that learning how to set up and program arduino microcontrollers would be a good headstart. (I also heard that arduino is the simplest thing you can do regarding microcontrollers). But here is the big question: can I learn it from 0 by watching youtube videos? I don't have anyone that could teach me these things, so I must do it on my own. (Of course, I will start learning in 3rd year at college about microcontrollers, but I want to have the basics before that). Does any of you guys have any piece of advice for me?

Thank you!"

The thing about first year is that i only learned engineering courses and had a single c++ course all year. The job i got was a web dev student job and i applied for it for fun in my spare time not knowing i would actually land it. I do have programming experience and a 4.3 gpa but i have no experience in web dev and i feel really overwhelmed. The amount of languages that i have to learn is insane, javascript, typescipt, angular, scss, linux, and much more. I even need to know  loopback and the list goes on. The website source code itself has like hundreds of files and i dont even know where everything is. I really feel like quitting because of how stressed i feel but my parents want me to stay since they're like its a great opportunity. And if you're wondering why i applied for a web dev job if i dont have experience in it, the reason i did was because i found it on a website for getting student jobs and the job title itself was just ""Software developer"" with no description or anything but an email to send your resume to.

So i was wondering if you guys could please give me some advice, and if you had an experience similar to mine can you let me know how you overcame it? Thanks in advance."

I just had an interview for my first ever internship on data science. It went better than I expected, nothing is confirmed yet but some of the questions I couldn't answer are bugging me. So I thought of posting them here. Okay, here we go.

1. What to do when there's an imbalance in the dataset? For example, a large no. of samples are from a specific target class while others, not so much. Should we reduce the dataset size so that the target class samples are more or less balanced? or some other approach.
2. What to do when we have already trained our model based on a set of features but later on we want to include an additional feature to our model? Do we re-build our whole model again or is there something else that we can do?
3. What should we do when we have trained a model where one feature had a certain set of categorical values (like 0 for Male, 1 for Female),  then later on the test data we find that there are other values as well (i.e, not-disclosed) ?
4. Do we need to standardize our data all the time? If not then when?
5. What do we do when our test data contains missing values, and we have to predict for the entries with missing values as well, we cannot just remove all the rows with null values.

&amp;#x200B;

That's all. Would be great if someone explains and answers these questions. I thought that these questions and the answers would help me as well as all the others in this community. Thank you."

Over the past couple of years, I've been suffering from depression because of my mother. She is very controlling but also emotionally abusive. For example, she loves reminding me she should have had a miscarriage and when my dog was still alive she would threaten to hurt her if I didn't wear my hair a certain way or something.  


Things are only getting worse, but somehow at the same time, I'm getting better. I used to cut myself and I've attempted suicide twice in the past as a weird way of reacting (coping? idk) to her. I don't do that anymore, instead, I focus on my studies an trying to find a job. I have a motto ""Work Hard Leave Ofelia"" (Ofelia is her name). So I think I'm reacting to her better than I was in the past, but I'm still not in the best headspace, I think.    


For reasons I won't go into, it's becoming more and more clear to me that I need to get away from her, but I don't know how to. I only have one more year (maybe 3 semesters) before I graduate college and although most of it is paid for by scholarships, she still covers about 9k a year. I'm applying to software development jobs and internships all the time, but I'm not having any luck. I'm actually considering looking for a warehouse job or something.   


I don't have any friends or family that I can stay with. Does anyone have any advice on what I can do? I would prefer to finish my studies, but I think its more important that I leave her soon. Chicago has great public transport (really gets you everywhere in the city) so I don't need a car + car insurance. I just need enough for the basics (rent, food, utilities, etc.) and maybe 9k to continue studying.   


If anyone knows of any resources like homeless shelters for youths or job programs I'd love it if you shared. Or any advice at all really."

hdc64u,25505,2020-06-21,TIFU by yawning too hard and ending up in the ER,VanManRTManVan,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/hdc64u/tifu_by_yawning_too_hard_and_ending_up_in_the_er/,"So this incident was actually this past Friday, when I settled in after a long week to watch a movie with my parents.  A couple of minutes in, let loose a big yawn because I was a little worn out after a long week at my internship.  Suddenly I felt my jaw kind of “click” into place, which happens sometimes but I can almost always just close it back normally.  I should point out that one time about two years ago I did the same thing and had a big yawn and couldn’t close my mouth for about 2 minutes, but eventually that sorted itself out.

So after this past incident I assumed that this time the same would happen, that my jaw would just go back into place and let me close my mouth after a few minutes.  In the meantime, I was frantically googling how to fix my jaw.  After about a half hour of unsuccessful googling (pretty much every result for “jaw dislocation” was “go to the hospital”) and trying to hide what was going on from my parents I decided to give up fixing it myself and go see a professional.  I obviously couldn’t talk so I had to text my dad, who was sitting in the same room, to tell him what was going on.  After a few minutes of trying unsuccessful techniques he came up with, my mom forced us to go to the ER.

Now at this point both of the joints on the sides of my face are in a lot of pain, but the worst part is really the saliva, because I can’t swallow or spit, so it’s just pooling up in mouth with nowhere to go.  I’ve got a towel with me but by this point it’s almost completely covered in spit (and I accidentally placed it in my lap so it looks like I had pissed myself too).  As I get to the ER my dad goes away to park the car, leaving me to have to explain myself to the the workers there by typing in the Notes app until my dad got there to fill in the gaps in my story.  I should also point out that we decided to go to the smaller, older hospital about 5 minutes from our house rather than the than the enormous, brand new one 15 minutes away on the other side of town.

As I get placed into a bed, a large, strong-looking doctor comes in tries to do the typical jaw reduction technique on me, to no avail.  He tells the nurses to start me on a muscle relaxant, only to find that the most effective one (I’m not sure what it was, I was put on so many drugs that other night I’ve lost track of names) was not in stock at this hospital so they gave me a larger dose of a less potent drug.  A few minutes after being giving the relaxants he tried again to fix my jaw, to no avail.  They added more painkiller and muscle relaxant to my IV and he tried again to reposition my jaw.  This time as he was pushing, in part due to the drugs but also due to me gagging I started throwing up on the doctor.  Around midnight they decided to give my a CT scan to make sure that all I had was a jaw dislocation and not any sort of fracture, and on the way back the CT scan room the nurse had me to stop off in a bathroom to puke my guts out.  The doctor tried one more time to reposition my jaw before giving up.  He claimed it was the first time in his 15 years that he couldn’t fix a dislocated jaw manually.

At this point the only remaining option was to send me to a larger hospital in the city (this small one didn’t have the proper staff available) about 25 minutes away, where they be able to put me to sleep and finally get my jaw back in place.  Somewhere around 3am I made it to the bigger hospital where multiple doctors tried the same technique as the first guy, all without success.  Finally they gave me a pretty huge dose (I’m a pretty big guy) of anesthetic to finally put me under and fix my jaw.  My dad, who had stayed by my side and awake this whole time (meanwhile I had been drifting in and out of consciousness throughout the night), described them finally getting my mouth to close as similar to the scene in King Kong where he defeats the T-Rex and proceeds to play with dinosaur’s jaw.  I have to give my dad so much credit here for staying awake until we got home 7am, driving me to and from the hospital (even though I offered to drive home in spite of all of the drugs I was on), staying by my side during this whole ordeal, on Father’s Day weekend no less!  Also as icing on top of the cake, when I finally got home and tried to lay down, my mom made me put on different clothes, and at which point I proceeded to vomit into my balled up pants.  I spent the rest of the day in a daze but am feeling good now.  Sadly soft foods only for the next few weeks.

tl;dr yawned too big while watching a movie, dislocated my jaw in doing so, then spent the next 8 hours in the ER on all kinds of drugs and throwing up everywhere

Also, Happy Father’s Day to all the dads out there, I know I certainly appreciate mine a heck of a lot right now for being willing to spend the first part of his Father’s Day weekend in the hospital with me.

Edit: thanks for the support everyone, as I said I’m doing well now and insurance should cover the majority of the expenses, all in all just glad that this was only one crappy night and nothing further.

I started with HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript before I got my internship and dove into Angular. 

Anyway, I feel like I have studied so much Angular to the point where I have a big metaphorical toolbox of Angular tools at my disposal. I know all about each tool but I haven’t the slightest clue when to use them sometimes. I’ll sit at a problem for hours and it seems my programming logic is at a big low. 

Any advice of how to get better at knowing what to do next or how to increase my programming logic (if that’s even the right issue here)? I’d love to know what you experienced folk have done to get passed this hurdle. How do I plan and think ahead of time and know what to do?

P.S. I watch a lot of tutorials and understand what they do in each step. But how do you know what to do next? It looks like they pull it right out of their butt lol. 

I know that was a lot of questions. Let me know what you think you beautiful coding people!!"

Id love some advice. I'm a college student, i major in computer science and i go to some basic college in nyc. I've done a lot of research since early high school about careers and majors and even now i still don't know what i truly want. I chose to major in computer science because i enjoy the critical thinking aspect of it. Its also just a great major for many reasons.

Ive always kind of liked the idea of prestige and i really feel like that's influenced what i want for myself and my future. Im aware its such a stupid thing to care about but thats how i feel. For example, the idea of becoming a quant sounds appealing to me. But i don't even REALLY understand what it is they do. All i know is that i personally respect them because of the difficulty of getting that job in the first place, especially if its at an impressive company. They also make great money. I'm sure there job is stressful and maybe boring but i cant convince myself that i'm not interested. I truly think prestige is impacting what i want for myself and i kind of wish i'd stop thinking this way because i probably wont be happy when im older when i realize im living an ordinary life with an ordinary job

Currently, i work as a computer tech at various companies like Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and have developed an interest in trading. Now i truly think studying the markets and trading is an interesting subject. I enjoy reading about it in my free time. So ive been talking to the traders on the floors i work on and ask them questions. Some of them have offered me their contact information and i feel like these connections might be useful if i decide to get an internship here. But i can probably gain the same satisfaction reading about markets and trading on my own time than i would being an actual trader with restrictions set by the banks. Not to mention that i probably dont even have a chance of getting a job there anyway. But still, id love to work at a prestigious company like that.

Finally, i have the opportunity to work as an electrician with union local 3 in nyc, ive already been accepted as an apprenticeship but have stalled my entry for a while to at least finish my degree and decide what i really want to do. They have tons of great benefits, 401k, annuity, pension, all that stuff. Ive already worked two summers on their job sites in the city and enjoy the work a lot. But i cant decide if i want to do that or find a career in computer science or what? Please, Id love some guidance"

Turning 27 in few months, having IT specialist education (more hardware focus, but i know bit about most IT fields)... And i just dont know what else to do anymore to try to get a job on the field (or even outside of it). Or heck, even interviews. 

Now, obviously i aint looking for my first job ever, but i do have few downsides that make it more difficult for me. First off is that i have 4-5 year gap between graduation (well, original anyways, it got delayed by same reason employment did) and employment- caused by taking care of relative. Please lets just leave it at that.

Second downside is that i dont have a drivers license and i probably never will (i had one but let it expire and wont renew). Because minor health issue thats otherwise not a problem. Might not seem like a big thing, but just about every IT field job i could find an opening wants it. Even if its sitting behind a desk and providing support via app/phone/email

Third downside is that only work ive gotten after that gap (during which i was IT head for few months for small voluenteer organisation- could only do it because it took max few hours a week) i mentioned before has been as telemarketer or hotel receptionist. 

Fourth- i tense up probably bit too much at interviews (if by some fluke i even get there) and test day. I have tried to calm down, but to no avail. often ending up sabotaging myself with minor but obviously stupid mistake that i cant forget. Yet, when i have gotten past the first 2 days, ive always been described as hard and correct worker (temp jobs at school time, internships).

Fifth and last one. I live in small, but IT-tech filled country (meaning very heavy competition and as last point proved, im not exactly able to sell myself well at first glance). wouldnt mind working in another country and i have tried getting work elsewhere, but you guessed it, lack of experience and job seeking skills comes to bite me in backside.

hdjyhu,13,2020-06-21,Struggles with finding an internship,GalacticLabyrinth88,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/hdjyhu/struggles_with_finding_an_internship/,"Greetings! I just discovered/am new to this subreddit, so excuse me for the abrupt introduction.

There's no real easy way for me to say this, but I'm about to start my final (fifth) year of college, and don't have what many might consider a real internship yet.

I am currently an art school student on a dual-degree pathway-- majoring in Illustration and Literature, and minoring in Psychology, and although I have spent the past several years applying for internships on my school job board, on Indeed, and other websites, I've found very little success, and at this point in my life, my lack of success has made me both worried and frustrated for my future (especially with the coronavirus making things so uncertain). I currently have a 3.9+ GPA, have participated in a few clubs and contributed to a few publications, but I'm missing actual experience outside of the classroom.

The summer after my sophomore year, I managed to snag an amazing cartoon/illustration related internship for a health and wellness company on my school job board, which was paid, and the interview was a success. I was so happy that I had gotten the internship opportunity for the first couple of weeks I began working for this company, but after being given some assignments to do drawings with, things took a turn for the worst. I won't get into the details of what happened, but in short I was ghosted for several weeks after I asked my boss for the payment she promised me, and I had to call my college's career services department to get my money, after realizing that I stupidly hadn't signed a contract with the company. There was still evidence through their emails and their ad on the school job board that they would pay by the hour, and this was enough to get the company to pay me (and they only began replying to my emails *after* I called my university, coming up with bullshit excuses).

Since the catastrophic failure that was my internship sophomore year, I've been forced to take retail jobs over the summer of my junior year and during my time in my senior year just to make money, and now I feel unfulfilled and demoralized because I keep making the mistake of comparing my struggles with the success of some of my college friends (many of whom have graduated and got one or two internships, and make it look so easy, even though they've struggled as well). At this point in my life, I don't feel like I'm going to go anywhere in the future unless I go to grad school or somehow become self-employed/self-published.

Ever since I was little, I always had a skill and passion for drawing and writing, and in high school, after working myself to the bone with honors and AP classes, I gave up my previous ambitions of studying biology in college because I grew to increasingly hate math and chemistry, and saw that many biology students have *horrible* job prospects without specialization. Instead, I grew to love my English and artsy classes more and more (as I did better in those). I even got encouragement from my science teachers to do art/writing like my life depended on it, and I took a massive risk going to art school despite knowing how insecure my job prospects would be in the future, and knowing I had shattered by family's expectations of me (they would not stop asking about how I would make money as an artist, but I convinced them after months of arguing to let me go to art school). Since I started school too my interests have branched out into philosophy, political science, ethics, various religions and belief systems, history, sociology, economics, general stuff about the Universe, etc-- which I read about all the time.

In spite of my initial motivations for going to art school, seeing as I am one year away from graduation, I have found to my disappointment that the majority of jobs posted online when I search up art related jobs are graphic design or social media based. I can obviously do graphic design since I do some of it for fun on my free time (and have the Adobe skills), but it's not my main focus. And as for social media, I only very recently created a LinkedIn, and Instagram to promote my work, as well as a Behance (and I've been social media averse for a very long time, despite the fact being this way has prevented me from finding career opportunities more easily).

I'm considering the very real possibility that I may not find the art and writing success I envisioned for myself in high school and at the beginning of college, and given my minor in psychology, I've contemplated getting a master's counseling/therapy, since I've always been fascinated by psychology, and can support myself through a private practice while still being able to work on my art. Also, the job growth for said jobs in this industry has been projected to skyrocket in the next few years, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.

I'm going to keep applying for internships regardless of what happens, but I don't know what will come of all my efforts. I recently had a chat with my counselor/career advisor who told me that not getting an internship during college won't prevent me from getting a job, and that he's had students who have gotten jobs with no experience beforehand, but he also said getting an internship generally helps (and that working on personal projects can be quite effective in showcasing your skills). The problem is that I'm going to graduate with my bachelor's with a sizable chunk of debt, and want to make sure that if I'm going to grad school, that my tuition will be paid via scholarships or a good financial aid package.

Maybe I'm just terrible at networking, or maybe I took a wrong turn somewhere and fucked my life, but I don't know what to do anymore. I obviously want to keep drawing and writing and helping people because doing these things makes me happy, but I'm useless to society because I'm mathematically deficient, can't network as aggressively as other people, and am not looking to become extremely wealthy any time soon (I don't want to become rich, just have enough to live comfortably so I can pursue my passions). If my dream as an illustrator/webcomics artist doesn't work out, I have self-published writer on the back burner, and a therapist/counselor after that.

hdk3of,3758,2020-06-21,"My Grandfather was a Paranormal Debunker, and his Last Investigation Killed Him",insomnia_storyteller,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/hdk3of/my_grandfather_was_a_paranormal_debunker_and_his/," My Gramps was a paranormal debunker - he never wanted to be called an investigator, he always said “there’s nothing to investigate, only to prove wrong”. He was never a believer, putting Houdini to shame (for those of you who weren’t aware, Houdini was quite the skeptic). He knew how to explain every bump in the night or strange shadow in photos. Gramps was called in to hundreds, maybe even thousands of buildings, sites, and homes throughout his career. Some people were genuinely scared of their doors slamming and paintings falling while others wanted to test his abilities. He was always able to prove to the homeowners that the way their floors sloped allowed for the doors to slam if the windows were open, or that their paintings were hung in just drywall and eventually the nails would slip. Even the people who tried to fool him never succeeded; he found their hidden rooms or false floors, and in more modern times became quite the photoshop expert. 

Whenever I became scared of a monster under the bed or in the closet, I would call Gramps and he would explain to me why I had no need to worry. He was my greatest comfort, and soon I was doing some work with him, keeping me occupied in high school. As a college student it was great, as he was able to make it an internship for me and I got elective credits following him into homes and learning his craft. While I didn’t intend to take over the family business or anything, I was very fond of the time I spent with him. He wouldn’t take me on all of his trips though, as I had other obligations. There is one trip in particular I cannot decide whether I regret not being there or am glad I missed; this is the one I want to share with you.

I didn’t know about 19 Fort Wood Lane until after Gramps was there. I don’t think I ever would have if he hadn’t meticulously created written records for each of his jobs, and if this one hadn’t been so well protected. I was cleaning out his rented office space last night, drowning myself in work to avoid my grief. About a week ago, Gramps had passed in a rather strange and sudden manner. A month ago, his doctor discovered a mass in his thyroid - cancer I guess, and it had begun to metastasize in both his brain and lungs. Usually, thyroid cancer can be caught early and is very treatable, so this came as a shock.

However, even the best have their moments, and this was Gramps. He suffered for only a short while, passing a few weeks after the discovery. He chose not to treat it, for what I assumed to be his honor and desire to go on his own terms. Now though, I am not too sure that’s the case - he may have known treatment would be futile. As I said, I was cleaning out his office when I found the envelope. Unassuming and untitled, it sat in the bottom of the desk’s top drawer, almost asking to be ignored. I think it was the lack of labeling that made me open it though - everything else was dated and titled, and this envelope lacked any of Gramps’ details. 

Inside I found just a few pieces of lined paper, not unlike any of his other notes and files. However, this being separate I knew it had to be important. In his classic slanted, half-cursive handwriting, Gramps was describing one of his more recent cases. His notes were usually quick, more note-like than story like, as typically he could just say “hearing voices, security camera mics were hacked” or “mice in the pipes causing the horrid screeching noises” along with quick descriptions of the events, but this was again, different. 

“19 Fort Wood Lane, this house should be condemned and left to rot. Not a soul belongs here, it is the work of something I’ve spent my whole life denying. But I can’t deny this, not anymore. Many have faked it, but there’s not a chance in heaven nor hell that this is some kind of fraud. I saw things here, things which I cannot explain. And this is the place that will get me killed, I know it.” Immediately I was thrown off, this was very uncharacteristic. Gramps was never dramatic, and I had never heard him speak of 19 Fort Wood Lane - the date was just over a month ago, so it had to be recent. I had seen him so many times since then, and not once did he mention it. 

“Mrs. Penderson called me, reporting a strange figure roaming around at night. She tried to deal with it, but her husband was often away for business and with a new baby she had the right to be scared. I immediately thought it was an intruder, and was determined to do what I could to help Mrs. Penderson, as I can only imagine what would happen to a young woman home alone at night. I arrived on Friday night, and she insisted on staying with me and the baby. Her husband was across the country on business, and this was confirmed by location services, credible testimonies, and photographs. I performed my usual checks, but not a false door nor loose window was to be found. We settled into the master bedroom for the night, baby asleep in her arms while Mrs. Penderson and I sat up waiting. It came every night as she told me, so it didn’t take long for me to notice something.

It started as a soft sound of footsteps up and down the hall outside the closed door, as if pacing. Not the sounds of a man in boots, but rather a soft pitter patter of a light-footed woman. Strange, as she told me it was a man in the house. After a while the noise ceased, then started up again, this time coming from the master bathroom. Mrs. Penderson jumped and I have to admit I was startled, since as far as I was aware this room was only accessible via a door in the room we were in. How could footfalls travel from the hall to the bathroom without passing us?

‘It’s starting’ she told me, and despite the dim light I could see the fear in her eyes and the color drained from her face. I assured her I would catch the bastard, it was cruel to terrorize a woman like this. ‘Don’t go in there’ she said, this time with a tremble in her voice even the best actors couldn’t fake. ‘I’ve never looked it dead on, I just know something bad will happen if you antagonize it. I called you here to prove I’m not crazy, but I don’t need you to get rid of it. I’ll move, we can go. I just needed you to believe me. Please, let’s go.’ I can’t say she didn’t warn me. 

‘It’ll be okay miss, I promise. I just want to take a look. Whoever’s in there can’t hurt me, and you won’t have to move. Just let me scare him off’ I headed towards the bathroom, and flung open the door, reaching for the light switch. I flipped it, finding no light came on. I tried again, up and down, noticing it wasn’t working. I backed up into the bedroom, and tried that switch - it worked fine. I hadn’t seen this before - I had checked, and the breaker for the bath also controlled the bedroom. The bastard must have broken the bulb. 

Without a second thought I walked into the room, taking a few steps forward before feeling a rush of air and hearing the door slam behind me. I could hear Mrs. Penderson screaming, and the baby began to cry. Normally fearless in these situations, I was horrified to feel the goosebumps creeping up my spine and noticed a slight tremble in my hands. Taking a deep breath I took another step, but was stopped immediately by a rough force. 

Stumbling backward, I looked around trying to adjust to the dark. Moonlight was filtering in through the slim window above the shower tile, and I could make out the details of the room. However, standing in the bathtub was something that hadn’t been there before. It was a detached tub, so it wouldn’t be a shower curtain or anything, and there was no chandelier or artwork on that wall. The figure was in the shape of a man, but bigger than any man I’d seen. I stood probably eight feet tall, but incredibly slim. It may have been even taller, as I made out what looked like a top hat adorning its head. 

My blood ran cold as I knew this was no trick. The thing began to step towards me, and I tried to scream as it reached for my throat. Nothing came out, and instead I felt the thing sink its hand into my skin. It was impossible, it had to be, but I could feel the weight of its hand sinking in and crushing my windpipe. I fought and struggled, but it did nothing. I only survived because it let me go, releasing its grip and slowly walking back to the tub before dissipating altogether. 

I stumbled through the door back to Mrs. Penderson, grabbing her hand and telling her we had to go. I didn’t look back, didn’t bother with any belongings, I just knew we had to go. I had been warned, and I was not about to fuck with something so powerful. We ran out the door, and I helped her into my van before we drove off.

I don’t know what we encountered that night, but I know it let me go on purpose. It wants to be known, wants me to tell people what happened that night. I spent my life trying to convince people it didn’t exist, so it is only just that it gets to show me how very real it is. And it has killed me. The doctors might say it was cancer, but I was completely healthy before that night. When that thing reached for my throat, I think it infected my very being, planted some poison in my cells to make sure I would know exactly how powerful it is. 

The tumor in my neck has odd tendrils growing out of it, something the doctors had never seen before. I told them I had no idea what it could be, but I know it is the thing’s ‘handprint’ - the mass is exactly where I felt its horrible hand enter me. It left me alive just long enough to understand what it did, and for the fear to fester. But I refuse to speak of it, to let my loved ones think they can stop it from killing me. Now all I can do is hide it from them, make sure no one ever goes back to that house and sees such hellspawn. If anyone reads this, know with my full intentions and honor that what I experienced that night was real, and believe me when I say don’t ever think that we are alone for a second in this world”

hdl0nf,15,2020-06-22,[F1 Student] Received job offer but the deadline to apply for CPT/adding internship course has passed,siriusapp,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/hdl0nf/f1_student_received_job_offer_but_the_deadline_to/,"I recently passed the interview for a QA position at a well known tech company in the Bay Area (this position is hired by a vendor who works with said company.) The recruiter said the interview went well and I will have a virtual meeting with a senior manager early next week.

I am currently a graduate student on F1 visa. So I'd need my school's authorization, approved CPT application, and to register for an internship course in order to be able to work with any employer. However, the deadline to add the course has passed and I would have to wait until Fall to do any of these aforementioned things. 

So the question here is: **what should I tell the recruiter about my situation?**

I have discussed this with some friends who are working professionals that were or are also on student visa and they all said to go to the end of the hiring process and once I get an offer, I can ask if they can postpone my start date to Fall.

However, since this is a position hired by a vendor company, I feel like they ""interview quick, hire quick"" and they can always get other candidates to fill in and I will just lose this opportunity.

I will try to talk to my school and see if they can do anything about this since I know so many people have their internships canceled due to COVID-19, so I feel extremely fortunate to have this chance to have a job and I don't want to just let it go like that."

The Advice im looking for is how i can move on with my life because i have literally no idea how to continue. Im at rockbottom (for an american seems tobe homeless and without a job with a side of debt). 

So as you may have notice this is a throwaway account. My life has been the rated g version of a series of unfortunate events in the past year.
So to start off i have had suicidal tendencies since i was 18 (23 now) My first attempt was when i was 18 before i started to live out my life on my own. I had a second attempt on my life when i was 20 and a third attempt earlier this year. The final attempt actually made seek help and tell my friends and my father (Almost all of my family i have grown to despise for reasons that may not be fair to them)
Anyway my story of everything i had falling apart starts about 11 month ago. I lived in CO and had a steady job and was making much more then i was spending. I built up enough money to act as a barrier to try and advance my life a level or two. i had a business plan that was well thought out but didnt take myself into consideration. in any case i put in my 2 weeks and started my business, i wanted to keep the bridge from being burnt at my old job so i left with what i thought was a good reference. i did the bare minimum for my business and i went about 6 months without making money. The reason would probably be best described as Acadia (Basically lazieness caused by depression, defeatism, and hniaolism) i simply couldnt get out of bed because i saw no point in continuing living too often. The entire reason i wanted to start a business was so that i would be forced to work 48 hour week where all i could do is think and stew in my own depression. I was hoping that i would have a since of pride or ownership and that may outweigh the things that i was feeling but it just didnt. Realising this and my funds running out i decided to get a new start away from the things that i new. I had a friend who travels alot. She wanted to go to school and i wanted to move out. So i moved to Minnesota. while i was moving i got in a car reck and it was determined to be my fault. (I was using a uhaul truck and didnt have insurance because i dont own a vehicle). So i started off my year with out any funds and debt. i get to the new town and bus my carryon bags from the flight to my new apartment (a month prior i got a storage unit in the town and moved my few belongings to the town before i flew) the first night was cold. i didnt have a blanket and i slept on hardwood floor. My roommates boyfriend was going to arrive the next day and bring his car. He was going to help me and my roommate to move our stuff out of the storage unit i had scouted out for us (I had about 1/4 of her stuff with me before i moved).  he arrived and we drive to the unit to find my lock cut off of it and a red lock replacing it that said ""see Manager"". We arrived in the middle of the night to move stuff and this was all the day before new years. so we go back to my appartment and we wait for my roommate to fly in later that night. when we had all met together and we essentially missed new years. we planned on celebrating the next day. the next day came by and i call the emergency number for the unit (they were still closed for holiday). I got a manager on the phone and learned that my unit was caught in a mix up of 2 other units, which may have been fine if one of the units wasnt search for drugs by the police 3 weeks earlier. I was pissed and when the manager opened my unit half of my units contents were out of their boxes and on the ground. The police realised that something was wrong about halfway through and thats when they found that their system had my unit wrong and the actual unit was searched. They left a copy of the warrent and slip of paper from the unit owner that nothing was taken from my unit. So i repack my things and we move it (luckly nothing was broken). We got back home and prepped the fireplace.  we started a fire and i prepared some hot toddies (i make some fantastic cocktails) while we were having a good time by the fire, a large peice of metal used to close the fire place came down and smashed my cell phone. 
By this point my phone was kinda lifeline for me. i had left into a brand new town and am heavily relient on my friends to keep me from wanting to kill myself. We hadnt gotten internet set up at the place yet and i had lost my connections to my support group. The next several weeks i was mooching off my roommate. she understood because i told her the events that lead me here. She let me use her phone to call and for finding work until my phone could be repaired (almost all of the last of my money) we took frequent trips to the library thoughout jan and i had my courtdate for the car wreck in CO in feb. She took me out for a drink.

My roommate and i had a non standard relationship. we were the same age and worked together for about a year on 12 hour shifts. She at the time was going through a crisis of her own which involve her boyfriend at the time about to prepose to her. she decided to travel the world and leave him vagabonding style. she broke up with him in a weird way, and we started to have adventures of our own. We did alot in a short amount of time and i grew feelings for her she said that she started to have feelings but then she let them go to travel. We only had this clear after i had decided to travel too. she went one way and i went anouther. i was heartbroken and it cut my journey short. (that is its own story) In any case, this is important because my feelings for her werent completely snuffed though i worked hard todo so. I thought that she understood this when we moved in together but we had a miscommunication sometime before then that i only noticed when we went out to drink.  We got home and i noticed the miscommunication and i told her. I wanted absolute clearety between us. She freaked out and we didn't talk for a few days. (i believe i hurt her). I few back to CO to my Court date (Car Wreck) and while i was there she called me and told me that she had to move out. It didnt make since for her to move out so i instead offered to move instead. I wasnt going to be able to pay for a 2 bedroom apartment on my own and her parents were paying for her (They were willing to pay the total sum) This broke my heart again. i was feeling horrible and i felt like i was abandoned by my only friend i had regular contact with. i had just started work at that point at a call center for shit pay and i found a spare bedroom in a house full of college students (5). The property management company required 2 paystubs and i had only received 1 i needed to wait 2 weeks before the second.  I was not liking my new job,but it was all i could find. dealing with people who dont know what they are talking about while they scream about how you are the source of their problems.  My roommate (still the only support i had) Left for a valentines day weekend with her BF in Canada (Where He lived) and i was alone and breaking down. i went to the old place that made me drink toxins and junp off bridges. I Got drunk and took evey pill i could handle with how much alcohol i had (what i thought were blood thinners). my note was an audio recording. 
note: I called a suicide hotline and no one answered. This has happened to me everytime i have called and attempting to kill myself.
I was disappointed that it didnt work the next morning. I have officially fuck up 3 suicide attempts. Maybe i should stop drinking before i do it. 
i must have threw up most of what i had taken, but i was shitting blood for a day or 2. My chest hurts just thinking about it. I remained depressed thoughout the week and by the end of it i couldnt stop crying. I tried to self harm again (the only coping mechanism that works for me) and i was sitting in the kitchen with a bleeding shoulder. it was midnight and idk why i was there. my Roommate opened her door and i quickly tried to run out the back door. I didnt want her to see me. when i new i was caught though (she got to the kitchen before i got out the door.) I stopped and she asked me what was up. i told her that i was in a bad place. i broke down and told her that i had attempted to kill myself while she was gone. She was hurt but didnt tell me. We were still great friends, but maybe not anymore. she hugged me and i cried. She convinced me to get a theropist (an active diologue that we had been having was that i should be getting real help). The next week she tried to cheer me up and i went to my first oppontment. Everytime i went it would put me in a depressive state. Just going to someone you dont know and telling them that your sad and why. Telling them how you wake up sad and them responding that im allowed to feel that way. I was annoyed my theropise was insistent from the beginning that there isnt a ""solution"" for my major Depression. I was waiting for  something useful to come out of his mouth. Everything we were ""trying"" where things that i had tried years before. (i have had problems since i was 14 and i have always been researching.) without going into detail. spring break arrived and my roommate decided to go to canada for the week. Then COVID happened. Schools were suddenly online and my roommate decided to stay in canada. i no longer needed to moveout but now i was alone with no one. Then i lost my job. i wnet to my next appointment with my theropist. I go to the front desk and was met with a confused stair from the receptionist. she asked, He didnt tell you? It turns out that he was getting his necessary hour as an intern to become fulling licensed from the School. Meaning that he was effectively no longer my theropist. He went home to take care of family during the epidemic and no one told me.  they told me that they arent taking people in person after that week and they were working on digital options. i told them to email me the details. They never did. 

one thing i forgot to mention, i Had field my taxes for the previous year in feb. I didnt receive when i was supposed to so i call. It turns out that i accidently input my direct deposit info incorrectly. This made to payment bounce back to them and then they were going to send by mail. I didnt receive it before covid. then IRS shut down during covid. i only made it to the end of my lease due to the covid payout. it was enough to get a plane ticket back to CO where i am now. 
This left me with 3-3 months of isolation, i took walks and i socially distanced. I looked for work and couldnt find any. I wasted away while i waited out my lease. i moved everyhing i owned and all me roommates stuff into a storage unit that i was reimbursed for by my roommates parents. I payed a guy off of craigslist to move my stuff for cheap and left to the airport on my cheap flight. 2 day before the rioting in minneapolis. 

I am here now in CO, Living in my friedns spare bedroom. He doesnt want me to stay too long and i have been looking for work. My old jobs wont hire me for reasons that i dont think i will have answered. Im running out of money to pay for food and i am still in debt. the Debt is growing and i dont want to become a burden on my friend. He is really nice for doing this.

Going back to the subject of advice. I need somewhere to go.  I could try and stay in CO but nothing here has made me happy. (no where i have been infact has done that)  I know that i cant fix my sadness. this is more that i am looking to travel more. maybe meet knew people while i work somewhere else.  I need to pay off my debt but i need board and work.  any advice that would help with my other problems (Depression, opportunity  to find work my way out of debt sooner then later would be nice, while i travel.)

If there is a better place to post this feel free to say so. even if it is harsh
P.S. I wrote this quickly and didn't proof read, I don't like these memories and would like to avoid then rn.

hdmyb1,3,2020-06-22,the only thing a coward can do is ramble,sleepingorawake,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hdmyb1/the_only_thing_a_coward_can_do_is_ramble/,"I've always been saving a Reddit account for my 17th birthday, but today is the day I've grown so desperate as to make one ahead of time... consider this a throwaway for my future account, if I make it as far as to get it.

An introduction: I'm 16 years old, female, with social anxiety and a quick temper. A week ago I graduated high school. I should be happy about this, but I'm anything but that, since all I see in my future is hopelessness and misery; getting rejected from an internship I've planned for so long by a scumbag of a human resources manager was the last straw that tipped me off to come here.

So here is my life story. First thing, yes, I've had a happy childhood, up until my family and I moved to this relatively obscure Asian country in 2015, and my dad was diagnosed with stage 2 throat cancer... out of my whole family I was closest to him and was devastated with the prospect that he might die soon. Thankfully, he got treatment as soon as the cancer was detected, and within a year's time, with chemo- and radiotherapy and surgery, he was completely fine... but not for long. A year later we found out it had metastatized to his lungs undetected. No way he could survive that now... the doctors said he only had 9 months to live. It was at that point that he descended into alcoholism... I honestly couldn't believe he was the same man anymore. My mom tried everything - sending him to a religious rehab center as her last resort - none of it worked. Eventually we had to ship him off to our old home in Spain where we wouldn't see him for months. This, coupled with the arrival of a teacher I could only describe as a creep, with all the things he did or tried to do being worthy for a whole other post, was where my life truly started going downhill.

10th grade... that was the year of my first suicide attempt. The immediate reason for it was petty - got a point, then lost it thanks to a rival classmate - but it was a last straw to everything I had endured over the years. I straight up walked out of class without a word and climbed over the railing of the sky bridge outside... but in the end I didn't jump. Three stories high was still survivable, albeit being a worse alternative than death. Eventually I was talked into climbing back over the railing by several teachers, feeling angry and ashamed at myself for being such a coward.

Then comes the summer of 2018, which I often consider the low point in my life, since, you guessed it, that was when my dad passed away. Those last days with him were both so beautiful and so saddening... I told him that I'd love him forever, apologized for everything before he went comatose... my mom said that his last words were to her question ""are you worried about sleepingorawake?"" He said, ""no, not at all."" I eventually got over my dad's death for the most part, but tear up every time when I think about it.

11th grade was when I decided to turn my life around. It was on Halloween 2018 that I made my first real friend, who I'll call L, at this school, a new student my age who shared many of her interests with mine. I also decided to revive two major creative projects thought up several years before, and in the process struck up a friendship with one teacher who offered me advice and criticism for these. But then again, that school year had its share of bad times: near the beginning of the year I found out I had a failing grade for my favorite class due to an error that couldn't be fixed; I locked myself in my room and cried and cut myself. Soon this became my standard coping mechanism for any issue I found too great to handle, including remorse from cycles of lashing out at my family for things they said or did that enraged me, which only got worse over the years. These times I've always contemplated suicide but never got around to perform the real act, both because I was scared of what would happen next and still clinging onto the things that I loved in life - family, friend(s), pets, school, personal projects, all that.

I went on to make another friend, this time online on Discord, in summer 2019; let's call her W. At the time I thought she was the most amazing person in the world, almost like my aforementioned real friend but a bit better. But it was her who gave me my first taste of toxicity, after she showed her true colors upon moving our place to talk from DM's to her own server. Not only did she do things (which I often recognized as inappropriate only in hindsight) without my or another of her friend's agreement, she would also deliberately leave us hanging during a discussion or roleplay session, and antagonize me against said friend, Z, and vice versa. We were both mad; he didn't show it, I did. I snapped over W multiple times, but my rage always flew right over her head and she dismissed it as a joke... but on the last time, December 24th 2019, it devolved into a full scale verbal fight. I said that I'd leave her if she didn't stop... and she threatened back to kill herself over me. That was what made me leave her once and for all, heeding my mom's advice on yandere people. But still, W and yet another friend of hers stalked me across the Internet to the point that I, along with Z who had also had enough of her, had to ""fake my death"" on Discord. Thankfully, Z has been a truly amazing friend who I've laughed with in good times, and asked for help, and helped, in bad times.

Meanwhile, in the real world of my final year of high school, after some ambiguity I applied to several colleges, mostly in the US but one in Canada and one in Scotland, and all but one or two of which I truly wanted to go to. I had good grades and scores on tests as the time, so I thought I'd be able to get in quite a few of them. Come the time when results were announced, I found that I had been rejected from every single US university. My mom would only berate me for being useless and that I shouldn't have been shocked or sad that I didn't get in anywhere. I cried myself to sleep the night I saw the results, and was seriously contemplating suicide by then, but could never find a good, quick and painless way to do it, so I had to hold it off... and it seemed to be worth it for a while, since, most unexpectedly, that one Scottish top tier university accepted me. However, I soon discovered that I can't afford to go there, and, despite meeting the conditions to switch to a cheaper tuition, it would end up taking away my offer to go there. It's a once in a lifetime chance: if I reject it like that, and apply again they'd spare me the dirty work and just tell me not to come back again because for all they'd know, I'd reject it again even if I don't. 

Meanwhile, L is drifting away from me, to the point she no longer speaks to me in class despite her seat being right next to mine; one time she didn't even acknowledge my existence during a PE class. On graduation day, I had to say goodbye to everyone who I bonded with over all these years; my classmates, my teachers, my wonderful counselor who's helped me ever since my attempt in 10th grade... And that's not even to say all the things going on in the world right now with COVID, even though in my country it's nothing... can't go abroad, so I have to stay and do whatever internships I can, which brings us full circle to the mothertrucker of a manager who denied me this morning. I wasn't even yelling at him like he said I was, almost everyone I meet says I talk just a little bit too loudly for comfort.

No experience = no higher education = no job = no money = no good life. I don't want to be a useless person, a millstone to both individuals around me and society as a whole. I'd be stuck at home, watching Youtube, browsing Reddit and other websites, whatever, all useless things that only waste time, at least according to my mom. It's not like I can get things done; I have the ambition but not the motivation for my personal projects. It's not like I'll ever meet Z in real life and feel like a real person cares about me.

I'll see what the people of this sub have to offer, whether it's enough to keep me from deciding to give up on life once and for all. I don't know what to do with all the things I value in life, whether they outweigh the things I want to leave it for, and whether I am brave enough.

TLDR: Life got bad since 2015, had to deal with dad getting cancer and alcoholism, remorse from anger, betrayal by friends, rejection from universities and internships, inability to go to dream school, lack of motivation and general depression; too much of a coward to die"

I am passionate about what im learning. I enjoy most of the subjects taught in college.

I feel like I'm not doing enough.

Should I build my profile according to what the industry is expecting or by working on things I like?

Should I focus solely on the basics like DS, ALGO, OS, DBMS etc or upscale to the current trends like DATA SCIENCE, AI, ML, UI/UX?

All the material, courses on online platforms for the current trends seems like a shortcut to get to these subjects. 

Until now I have worked on one DBMS project, one DATA MINING project, studied a little bit of statistical learning, sometimes work on DS, ALGO problem solving questions. But I feel like I am not concrete on anything. I haven't done any internships either. 

Since I like most subjects I don't know how to just pick one and build the relevant skills in that?

At the moment I don't think I have any ""skills"", I just know a little bit of most things.

I am scared that I won't survive in this field. I am so confused. I have no idea if what I'm doing is right or enough.

Any advice/tips to figure this out would be appreciated. Please help."
hdp22v,1,2020-06-22,Social Work and Business Management,[deleted],findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/hdp22v/social_work_and_business_management/,"I am currently working towards a master's in Social Work, and have been, surprisingly, doing very well. So far, I have been thoroughly enjoying the program. While in school, I have been working as a sales associate at a large retail chain. However, as Fall 2020 is coming close and school is about to start, I decided to put my two weeks in because I may not be able to manage working such a strenuous job while also managing an internship (graduation requirement) and classes. On the last few days at work, a lot of the management team tried to convince me to stay, offering me a raise and/or a position in management or HR. 

During undergrad, we were required to choose a concentration(not a minor, but focus within your chosen major) within our major (undergrad major was psychology), and I was deciding between gerontology or human resources/organizational business. I ended up choosing gerontology and now going back to school to pursue social work.

While I am excited to finish my degree and start my career, I can't help but imagine what it'd be like to be a part of a management team or human resources team. I am passionate about both career paths, and thinks it would be crazy to pursue both. But would it be that crazy? Should I choose one path or is it possible to do both?

If anybody has any advice or experiences they want to share, it would be greatly appreciated!!"
hdplre,1,2020-06-22,Stick with a summer internship I don't enjoy?,ArmsInTheRain,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/hdplre/stick_with_a_summer_internship_i_dont_enjoy/,"I [F24] am a Master's student and started looking for a summer job back in January so I would have something to do when the semester ended. With the COVID-19 situation, summer jobs have been few and far between, so I was getting pretty desperate. I got a tip from a friend that company they work for was looking for summer interns and jumped at the chance. I got a position and was feeling pretty pleased about getting this internship at such short notice.

However, it's been a few weeks now and I'm really not enjoying it. I don't have any experience in business and the internship is in sales (it's medical equipment and I have a background in medical science so that's why I was initially interested). The start-up is pretty small and new, so everything feels quite disorganised, as they're still finding their feet (which I totally understand, but it leaves me feeling like I'm an spare part since I don't know how to help with anything, and nobody seems to have time to teach me). I also saw this morning that someone with a business background had sent in a CV asking if the company had any internship opportunities in sales, and they honestly seem like they'd benefit a lot more from the position than me (and I think the company would benefit more from having them).

I really don't want to be sat at home doing nothing all summer, and I've only just started the internship, so I feel like I should stick it out and see if I get into it a bit more. But I also feel guilty for being given this opportunity and not getting the most out of it - especially now I've seen that there are other people applying for the position.

Any advice on what should I do?"

hds8yz,1,2020-06-22,What would be the better option to pursue?,throwawayheyheyhey25,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/hds8yz/what_would_be_the_better_option_to_pursue/,"Hi everyone! This is my first post on here. I am a recent college graduate and working full time now as an entry level software developer in the US. I'm building websites but while using competitive technologies like micro services, Angular, docker etc. So it seems like getting more technical abilities and staying in the IT field would be a good option for me right? However, my background is mostly in business. Whatever I picked up about IT, I picked up on the job and past internships. The caveat here is that I have surface level understanding of coding and all these other technologies, enough to do okay at work, but not enough to level up to the next position. So I have two options at this point: study CS like crazy and try to get all the knowledge CS majors get in their 4 year cours, and then some more to get promotion. The problem with this option is that I don't know if I ever can catch up with them without getting the formal education. My other option is to switch career paths to that of business and use my existing IT knowledge as a bonus. The problem with this option is that I have already lost 1 year to IT and the switch to business will be extremely difficult and I'll be behind my peers who started at the same time as me. 

So at this point I don't know which to pursue. If anybody has faced a similar situation or have any advice for me, please help me out. Thank you!"
hdsdw0,5,2020-06-22,Careers and Studying Abroad,Aneducationabroad,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/hdsdw0/careers_and_studying_abroad/,"One of the most useful aspects about going to college is the career development aspect.  However, I’m not talking about what goes on in the classroom (frankly, I’ve written enough about majors lately!), but rather what goes on outside of it.  From work permits to networks, studying abroad can also make a massive difference for where you end up professionally.  Also, as a heads up, I’ll try to keep this post shorter than some of the previous ones, but it is still an important one.  

**By The Numbers**

When students and parents ask me about the economic benefits of studying abroad for a degree, one number immediately jumps to mind - 25%.  That’s how much more that someone with significant international experience can expect to make over the course of his/her career, and that number starts on day one.  For more, visit [here](http://www.prweb.com/releases/2012/5/prweb9541667.htm).  

Of course, it’s not just money.  It’s getting a job, too.  International experience sticks out on a resume, and if a hiring manager is only spending a few seconds looking at each one, you want to stick out.  

**Networks**

That said, many of those first jobs don’t come from blindly sending in resumes, but instead from professional networks.  People who earn degrees abroad benefit greatly from this.  First, in the country of study, international universities are intently focused on creating a pipeline from graduation to employment; some even require job placements!  Also, as an American, you’ll stick out (in a good way) and people will want to have coffee with you, mentor you, and generally remember you when a friend says they have an opening.  

That’s overseas, but what about back in the US?  Luckily, with LinkedIn and Facebook, there are thriving communities of alums for most foreign universities overseas here in the US.  Some, like the University of Edinburgh or Oxford, have chapters in major cities much like any other university in the US.  (Pro tip - many of these groups offer scholarships!)  These do tend to be smaller, but this plays to your advantage.  It’s a more unique shared experience when you do reach out, and that means that it’s more meaningful.  

Think about it like this - if you only have time to respond to one person, are you going to respond to the person who is from your home state, or (all other things being equal) the person who was from your high school and mentioned one of your favorite teachers?

Also, don't forget internships!  Even an unpaid internship can help you build an overseas network quickly.  For many students (provided you don't infuriate the border protection officer who processes your visa) you can be paid for up to 20 hours a week in many countries, meaning it can also provide you with a nice chunk of spending money!

**Brand Recognition**

University admissions is difficult.  Stanford and Harvard have acceptance rates of around 5%, which is a fraction of Oxford or Cambridge for American students.  I’m not promising that you’ll get into Oxbridge, but I will say that you can leverage your uniqueness as an American to get into a better university abroad.  Yes, you have to think outside the box a bit; St. Andrews gets plenty of applicants from the US.  But Edinburgh doesn’t, despite the fact that it is placed significantly higher on global rankings.

That increased brand recognition matters, and you should own it every chance you get.  My MA is from the School of Oriental and African Studies (wonderfully PC name, I know), but it is a part of the University of London.  You’d better believe both names go on my resume; those in the know love SOAS, and everyone else recognizes UoL. 

At any rate, those same international firms that recruit at T30 schools in the US are there at top foreign institutes as well.  And the ability to work in the US AND work in the country you’ve studied in is incredibly attractive to them.

**Work Permits and Such**

That brings us to work permits.  This varies by country.  Some places, like the UK, are moving towards a less open approach to allowing students to stay after they finish a course.  There is a workaround, however.  If you are recruited by a firm in the UK, chances are they can get a work permit for you.  This is easier with bigger companies; a multinational has no problem doing this, as it can use a special visa that allows it to transfer personnel between different foreign offices.

However, plenty of other places are much more open.  If you want to stay in continental Europe, for example, you’ve got a path to permanent residency and even (in some cases) citizenship, even if you don’t have a job lined up on graduation day.  Many places give you a period to find a job, or do an internship, or simply travel.  

**Final Thoughts**

If you followed that link above, you’ll see that there are plenty of other staggering numbers about studying abroad.  I think they show something beyond the money, in that they demonstrate that those who study abroad are driven, passionate people.  Most of all, I think that it shows an ability to act independently, think critically, and exist globally.  All of those are incredibly useful in the coming years."
hdsjzd,12,2020-06-22,Seeking Advice From Former International Students in Australia,lmhbali16,cscareerquestionsOCE,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsOCE/comments/hdsjzd/seeking_advice_from_former_international_students/,"Hi,

***A little bit of background first***: I'm an international student from Europe, currently in my final year of Bachelor of Science (majoring CS and DS) degree in Australia. I have a couple side projects, internship experience (in Australia) and my mark is decent (I have a D WAM at one of the top unis). So I'm fairly confident that I can get a job in Australia after graduation.

**Problem**

I have been looking for graduate role and it's been a little bit frustrating. Although there are companies that I can apply to, 80-85% of the vacancies require applicants to be Australian citizen/permanent resident or New Zealand citizen. Even when they do not state this requirement, I call their HR to ask whether I can apply, and they just tell me to find opportunities somewhere else. For example, one of the Big 4 accounting firms allows international students to apply for grad role as long as they have permanent residency or proof that they are going to get one. Unfortunately, international students cannot apply for PR after graduation, and so I asked their executive at one of my uni workshops about this issue and they just straight up told me to find another employer. The same issue comes up with some of the bigger tech companies as well where they are open to Australian citizens only (I'm not talking about FAANG companies).

Hence, my problem is that I cannot even apply for the role I want to, even though the Australian government allows international students to work in Australia for 18 months after completion of degree (and with one year of experience they are even eligible for permanent residency). I would feel better if employers reject me after an interview so that I can at least have a hint on what I need to work on, but the fact that they do not look at my CV because of my background is sad. Also, I would like to stay in Australia as I like the culture, national parks and I also have friends/family here.

**Question**

I am confident that I can get a job here, but I would like to have a chance at bigger companies as well. So I would like to ask former international students who got into bigger firms or people who know about similar situation, how did you manage to secure your role? Did you have similar feeling about finding jobs when you were student as I am having right now? Were you able to get an interview from employers that did not want international students to apply? What would be your advice in general?

Thanks in advance!"

I'll be doing this over the summer, for about 10 hours a week. Although we'll definitely try to write a paper towards the end, it seems pretty unlikely that we'll actually get published before college applications. The professor did tell me that he would write me a supplemental rec if the research went well, so there's that. 

Would conducting potentially unpublished research be worth it in the end, from a college applications perspective? Could I add a research abstract as additional information? The alternative to this would be me trying to find a cpmpany-based internship."

My question is, is it recommended that I do an internship and get hired and get some work experience first, and then go back and get my masters?

Everyone that says you feel like you’re failing the entire time is correct. I literally felt like I was gonna fail and i couldn’t even believe it when it said Pass on the screen. I did have some technical issues with the Pearson Vue software. I had to restart my laptop twice because it kept freezing on me. However, it was still nice taking the exam from the comfort of my home. Resources I used included the Testout Security Pro practice exams for the Security+ since I got it from school, Jason Dion’s Practice exams on Udemy, and Professor Messers Videos on Youtube. I would basically just take the exams and retake them until I was scoring high 90s and I made sure I understood what I was getting wrong.

I was a student about to graduate from college and I had (and still have) no promises of a job lined up. Since I had never been hired by an employer in Michigan I decided to do two things:

1. I applied for Unemployment Insurance from California and submitted a W-2 from an internship in the bay area that ended last summer, stating that I'm searching for work
2. I ALSO applied for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance from Michigan stating that I was self-employed, without proof of income (I had plans for a side gig), and was affected by the pandemic since I had COVID symptoms at the time

Since I was approved for both, I continued with certifying the next couple weeks to receive support from both states; In my mind, they both deemed that I was eligible, so I foolishly thought that there should be no problem. 

As soon as I got my first payment from California EDD (450/wk + 600), I double-checked their websites and realized that I'll be double-dipping the $600 federal weekly benefit on BOTH claims. Today I found out that the payments from Michigan have just been issued and I'm starting to panic. 

I'm new to unemployment and I'm really unsure as to what I should do. I've been trying to reach out to the Michigan office for the past week but they aren't answering phones or messages. Did I commit fraud? If so, was I not supposed to apply for both, or was certifying the real mistake? Should I just stop certifying weeks for Michigan and hope that they answer my calls? What kind of consequences should I expect? Any kind of advice would be appreciated"

&amp;#x200B;

I have recently graduated with a bachelor's for CS and like many, I have been struggling to get into the industry due to my lack of professional experience. Unfortunately, I never did an internship since I was working full-time in a Helpdesk position while completing my degree. Now as I am job searching, it seems every phone interview I get, they hesitate because they are always looking for someone with at least some internship experience.

&amp;#x200B;

I was born in the US but I have a cousin in Mexico who also completed a CS degree in her university there and was able to land a good job as a data scientist. She says there are opportunities available there, especially for someone like me who is fluent in both English and Spanish.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been looking online for information on working for a Mexican company remotely (taking advantage of everyone working from home during these times) and so far I can only find information on people working for the US while living in Mexico. I want to do the opposite of that. I understand that the pay will be considerably less since it will be a salary for cost of living in Mexico, but my plan is to only work there enough to rack up some experience and apply for a better position in here in States later.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone know if something like this will work? Also, I am not sure if it helps, but my parents were both born in Mexico and I do know that the process to get Mexican citizenship is pretty easy if you can prove that your parents are Mexican citizens, but I'd rather not have to do that if it's not required.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know if you any of you guys have any advice."

Right now, I'm just applying to a bunch of positions on linkedin and indeed. I don't care what the company is, or what position it is, or what the GPA restriction is. As long it's a software / data / web development internship position, I press the apply button, fill everything out, attach my resume, submit it, and get on with my search.

But what if this is a flawed way to find internships? Should I focus less on applying to a bazillion of positions and only focus on selecting some positions I think would be a good fit, position where I pass the GPA qualifier, create a resume and a cover letter (up to this moment, I have not created a single cover letter because I thought it was a waste of time) to fit that position and actually put an effort to getting hired by THAT company?

I'm very interested in seeing what you all think about this. Is it better to apply to as many positions as possible, or put my effort into getting hired by several different companies?"

However, because of all the stuff that's going on, I'm wondering if this crisis will make the search for a first internship even more difficult than it already is due to things like economic strain caused by the pandemic, perhaps a lack of career fairs, etc. I'm just curious what your guys' thoughts on this are, since I'm new to the internship search process and maybe won't be able to anticipate how the current situation might affect it. 

Another reason I'm wondering about this is because I'm currently debating whether or not to take next semester (or year) off to go to another country and do my mandatory military service. It looks to me that this coming semester will be pretty heavily  neutered in terms of us getting the social aspects that come with the college experience, and if that also includes a decreased likelihood of obtaining experiences that advance career prospects (i.e. an internship), then that might be enough to push me to making this decision."

* Why I want an MBA: Switch to early stage VC, also to move to California with GF
* Why I want one now: Tired/bored of STEM (in terms of day-to-day work, still a fan of the industry), want more client-centric work, want to move to California, just want a change of scenery in life in general
* Target schools: Stanford (Top Choice), Harvard, Wharton (is Wharton worth it??), not sure I'd attend for any other school.

**Background**

* Work experience: 3 internships (all in quant trading/research at Citadel/Jane Street/HRT), 4 1/2 years full time at Jane Street as a quant researcher, Total Comp last year was \~700k (after bonuses, pre-tax), Flat firm hierarchy so no ""career progression"" in a sense, comp has increased obviously
* Extra curriculars and other experience: Not much post-college (in college was part of cultural groups, officer position in STEM club, volunteer software engineer), some basic volunteering, quickly failed startup, hobby stock trader (pre-quant job), hobby poker player
* Undergrad school/major: Princeton - CS/Math
* Other education/coursework: A lot of classes in operations research
* Race/nationality: Asian
* Sex: Male

**Stats**

* GMAT Score: *780 (51Q, 48V)*
* Undergrad GPA: 4.0

Right now with COVID my family's in a tough spot, and fortunately I do happen to have a great skillset related to CS, Finance, and Marketing (eCommerce). I do want to set up small business stuff but I really need at least a few hundred dollars so was looking at freelance gigs.

From what I've seen it is SUPER competitive and I am not sure I can even get a freelance gig (for coding) without paying smth (I am basing this off my experience from Freelancer).

All my previous internships had me working on sensitive projects so naturally they came with NDAs and an inability to publicly display my works so my GitHub does not accurately reflect my work.

My question is: is there a way to get initial freelance gigs (I am talking like $100-$250) for things like web dev, SWE, and even implementing machine learning models without a portfolio to show for, and if so how?

I have my doubts btw about the above being viable, the reason I ask is because i was hoping to showcase those projects on my Github and not lose time developing projects just for the sake of showcasing. Money is scarce and college is expensive.

I recently graduated college but had a very hard time finding a ""real"" job, and sort of had a change in my mindset. One of my good friends and roommates recently asked me if I wanted to move in with him in a different city, right in the downtown area, and I would only have to pay some of the rent (I would have a much smaller space than him).

So, my new plan is this: move in with him, in a new environment. Job searching has been tough and I have no motivation to do so at my house in the suburbs with my parents always around me. I need to be somewhere else, somewhere I can feel excited to start my life.

That being said, I am now applying to a bunch of minimum wage jobs, like servers/hosts and baristas. Now, the issue is, my current resume is mostly professional experiences (internships, campus organizations, etc). 

Should I make a new resume that focuses solely on the service industry jobs I've worked? I have worked in an amusement park as a supervisor, I worked at a local indoor attraction, even at Panera for a brief stint.

Or will these restaurants/coffee shops simply see that I'm responsible with my current resume, and I can expand on my experiences in interviews? Or will they simply pass over me?

Also, in case you were worried: no, I'm not giving up on my career! I just want to figure out exactly who I am and what I want to do first. In the meantime, I just need a job to help me pay for rent and get me back on my feet after 3 months of doing nothing.

So I (F20) rented a room in a house from another college student(F21 let's call her K) for the summer. K told me that the house was only going to be occupied by 1 other person and her dog. 

I've been living in the house for 2 days now, and I am now just told that all 4 of her roommates will be coming to live in the house (along with 1 of their boyfriends). This is a 1-story 5 bedroom house, so I have a lot of space in my room, but the kitchen and living room is not big enough if all 6 of us want to be in there at the same time. 

Her roommates are super nice, but I am not used to their lifestyle and ngl they make me feel a little insecure with their party lifestyle and excess of privilege showing. I will be spending most of the week in the house because my internship is partially remote and I will be taking 2 online classes, so it might be hard to focus if they decide to have a party one night. 

I've already paid for this month, but I was thinking of asking for the money back and moving out because she did not tell me about this (I asked her 2 weeks ago if anyone else besides her 1 housemate was living here). I don't have a 2nd sublease ready but I'm sure I can find another one soon. Would I be an ass? Should I even be upset about this? Will she even give me my money back?

My boyfriend thinks I should be way more upset about it, but I'm just kinda bummed out that I'm going to be surrounded by 6 people I don't know and I'm just a reserved person. I'm not really sure what I should do with the situation to be very honest.

My boyfriend is also willing to move out while I'm here so I would feel more comfortable, but that means $800 a month down the hole just to be closer to me. Should I let him do this or just stick it out? 

Much thanks appreciated. 

TLDR: I paid for a sublease and the subleaser said only 1 other person would live there. Turns out 5 more people are going to live there and the house is really small. I'm a shy person and this is way out of my comfort zone. What should I do?"

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 21 year old Male from the NYC metro area looking to start my career.  I have a bachelor's degree in a social science with a specialty in data science and natural language processing.

&amp;#x200B;

I've had a really hard time finding any internships or an entry-level job in the NYC area.  I've probably sent over 350 applications, had my resume tailored by several people, tapped into my network for references, and gotten nothing.  Not even a preliminary interview.

&amp;#x200B;

My stats:  

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Work experience\*\*:  

&amp;#x200B;

1. 2 years as a a research assistant in a lab at my university doing data extraction, cleaning, and modeling

2. 1 year in industry as a web analyst (basically a test monkey to report bugs on the site)

3. and 5 years in the service industry (bar).

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*GPA\*\* \\-- 3.86 out of 4.0

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Projects\*\* \\-- 3 projects, all posted on my GitHub which is on my resume and my LinkedIn.

&amp;#x200B;

1. R with a heavy emphasis on data analysis on data visualizations, 

2. Python (jupyter notebook) employing machine learning models on a dataset in sklearn and an accompanying report

3. I used the SQLite3 package in python to create a mock database for university course registration that's navigated through command line.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Coursework\*\* \\--  I've taken several higher level maths courses (linear algebra, stats, calcs) in addition to advanced computer science courses; additionally, my university recently rolled out a computational linguistics Master's program, and I was given permission to dual-enroll in several of these classes (and received A's in them all).

&amp;#x200B;

I've been targeting mainly consulting firms and tech companies looking at data analyst positions or junior data science roles as well as entry-level consulting roles.  I don't have any internships, so it's hard to get looks since I don't have any ""real"" industry experience, but I have my research assistantship which I think is pretty big.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just kind of at the end of my rope.  I feel like I'm in many ways a desirable candidate, but I've applied all over NYC and California since November and got nothing.  My confidence is running very low.  This lack of success has been exacerbated by coronavirus, obviously.  So I'm extending my search to Europe; even if the pay is lower, I wouldn't mind getting some experience in a foreign country for a few years.  I think it would be a wonderful experience, actually.

&amp;#x200B;

I applied to a couple positions in Prague, and to my shock I received an email from an extremely prestigious consulting firm requesting an interview.  It was my first interview, and I prepped a lot for it, but was obviously still nervous. It went ok.  Not sure if I'll be advanced to the next stage.

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggestions on where to look?  I'm looking largely in Prague, Germany, and Italy (I know the Italian economy isn't in good shape, but I speak Italian so I figured why not).  I'm open to doing pretty much anything in data science/data analysis where there is opportunity for growth.  I don't mind doing grunt work (but there's a difference between ""grunt work"" with learning opportunities and just being a data entry monkey).

&amp;#x200B;

I know I'm kind of rambling, but if anyone has any thoughts or suggestions on where to look or any  insights on these industries in under the radar cities, feel free to drop the info for me."

Mainly just looking for perspective.,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/he7cr9/how_likely_am_i_to_hear_back_from_this_it_company/,"So last Friday I finally landed my first interview in IT, I had been applying for atleast 5 months ahead of this and had the unfortunate pleasure to graduate from college just as COVID dropped.

I applied for a Tier 1 Help Desk position, and a few days alter I got an impromptu phone call, I had a very nice discussion with the employer who despite knowing I have no experience beyond my college labs, organized an interview. In particular I received compliments on my resume, saying it was considerably better than most new graduates he had seen.

The interview was done over Microsoft Teams with what would be my Team Lead, and the company's COO. They asked me a bit about my experience at an office internship I did last year, and a bit about my final IT project, which I felt went well. But I was pretty obviously very nervous... There was a family emergency the previous night which shook up my nerves heavily.

Then came the technical test, and it's safe to say I did not do well on the first scenario. 

_____

They gave me the following problem, and asked me to troubleshoot it as if I was taking a support call.

https://i.gyazo.com/1d619ef59fdfc73018bfd40880f773aa.png

Walter can't reach the Internet, but Jessie can. They can both reach the Server. How can Walter reach the server?

Well first I started with the obvious, was Walter even connected to Ethernet at all, via the little icon on the Windows task bar? Yes.

Okay I next had him check the physical Ethernet cable to make sure it is in there securely. It is.

Then I decided a good attempt would be to see if the router was on at all. I directed ""Walter"" to open up a command prompt via the Window's command line and to run a tracert command to google.com. Now I don't know why I tried this because in hindsight, obviously it's not going to work, he can't reach the router anyways, so how would I know if the router was on or not?

Then since I had been studying firewall settings the night before I thought ""Oh maybe there's a firewall rule blocking HTTP or HTTPS traffic."" and it this point they stepped out of the scenario and assured me it would not be a firewall setting.

Then I had to awkwardly think for 5 minutes, by this point I was stuttering a bit, clearly really nervous. And they ended up throwing me a bone ""DNS"", so I decided to finally od the thing i should've done this whole time and run an ipconfig, and get the ""user"" to read it out. The Default Gateway was missing! And so was the DNS settings.

Now I realize that's because their DHCP server was down, but at the time I couldn't think about it at all, I just didn't have an answer. I knew the Default Gateway wasn't there, but I had no idea how to get the address of the router from Walter's computer...

So a bit more faffing about, when I finally gave in and said at this point I would have asked for help, or passed the ticket up then asked to see the solution later, so as not to waste the customer's time any further.

______

They asked me about email protocols, and Exchange server which I was mostly able to answer, as well as two other technical questions which I aced. But I could kind of tell they were growing a bit more disinterested. The COO especially was hardly saying anything, and it seemed like he had kind of just gotten dragged into the interview with the Team Lead.

I asked a handful of questions about the business, and the biggest feedback I got from them was ""Yes you're a green horn, but you're really knowledgeable for a greenhorn."" and ""If we hired you, we'd do so knowing you'd be a net loss until we got you up to speed."" and ""You'll learn more in 3 months at an actual IT job than you ever did in college.""

Idk, I'm getting super mixed signals, and now I'm stressing out about it. All-in-all I'm surprised I got an interview at all to begin with, the economy where I live as already entering a recession, and when COVID hit it just got worse, so I'm surprised I wasn't immediately passed over for somebody with actual experience.

At the same time they obviously have atleast some interest in hiring a newbie, otherwise they wouldn't have contacted me at all. But I personally feel like I bombed the interview... Like I knew the answers, but just couldn't think of them at the time, I had run into the problem a ton of times in college...

I'm not holding my breath, it's seems pretty unlikely I'll hear back."

During these 3 months I worked a total of 200 plus hours ""overtime""(as ridiculous as it sounds) and was not payed for it, in fact, I was told I was not pushing myself and that I was a bit too ""clumsy"" to be in aviation by my supervisor. I will not argue that these accusations were false for I know I am not the perfect worker, however, I was and will alwaysbe willing to try my best(I mean think about it, 200 plus overtime and I'm not pushing myself!?) Nevertheless I ended up leaving the job and sarted back working for free again. At this point I was willing to work in any capacity related to engineering even if it wasn't aviation, my country at the time were starting up oil drilling operations with Exxon Mobil and I started applying for technician positions with sub contracting companies. I particularly wanted these jobs because you were sent for training at foreign facilities in Germany, Dubai and Brazil. I applied three times withing the space of 5 months, got interviewed, did exams and testing and was turned down each time. By the end of it I was drifting into a dark place, I was consuming alcohol on a daily basis and stealing money from my father to hang out with friends, all the time not working or doing anything productive. About 1 month after I received a call from a friend of mine about a job opportunity in the Caribbean as an aircraft technician, however they wanted us to be licensed by the USA to working with them given there entire fleet of airplanes were US registered and that we would have to past exams in order to get the job. At this point  would have taken aanything after going through the dryspell I did and I agreed to do it after being told that the employers would pay for accommodations and the exam in the USA and we would repay them in the future when we started working, however the other expenses were all taken care of by my father. My journey in the USA (florida) is an entire story by itself. However summarized me and my partner ended up passing the exams, however while over their my partner received a call for another job opportunity that was of more pay. He had made the decision to ditch our current prospect employers for the new ones. To understand my dilemma you must understand that this offer came before we had written the exams and we were told by our new employers that we need not pass the exams to get the job however we were still encourage to write them(since this was the point of going there in the first place) I decided since my partner already agreed that I would too since it was not practical for us to separate while over there. Glad forward 2 months after writing the exam we were told by the new employers to return to our homes and awaiting confirmation on a work visa. At this point I had to call out former employers and tell them we would no longer be coming to their facility (yes it was an awkward conversation) now I am at home, feeling accomplished with a bright career ahead if me(pay was super  good too). I  celebrated for 2 months consecutively  alcohol and partying again. On my third month I realised that I was not receiving the response about the work visa and gave my employer a call. He then proceeded to explain to be that the encountered a problem they were trying to resolve with lawyers.(probably know where this is heading) I was still very confident and hopeful things would be okay, then more months began to pass, 2,3,4,5.....all the time I kept calling my employer to get an update but he kept ensuring me they were working on it. It was only on my 6th month i learned through the lawyer who was working on the visas that they were officially and finally denied and that a reapplication would have to occur with some additional requirements that needed to  fufilled. After doing some research and understanding what went wrong I realised that the whole the would never come through. At this point I had loss all hope in my career, and probably was drifting towards suicide. Never got too close to the point but I would be lying if I said that the thought didn't cross my mind a few times. I applied to another one of the oil companies again as a desperate last attempt to salvage the wreck that was my life, I dressed up, walked into the interview and came out feeling awesome. Usually this is the part of the movie where the guy gets through after trying so many times, but guess what, received and email saying that I wasn't picked again. guess life's funny like that. To sum up my life at this point, I had a bunch of certificates and licenses all which cost my dad an arm and a leg and that which had not earned a percent of that cost. To be honest, I had become numb to disappoint and my expectations for life were pretty much zero, and I know you're probably waiting for the part of this story where I finally make a breakthrough,  i have to say there isn't one, well there isn't an obvious distinct breakthrough, it was more of a breakthrough with me internally as a person. I started to accepted failure as part of my regular day, I started to expect mockery and humiliation from the people around me and I pretty much live that way now. But it doesn't phase me a single bit. Eventually I wasn't even putting my full effort I was just sort of flowing with time. And this I realised was a mistake. A man who has failed a thousand times but perseveres stands a chance more than the man who has failed only once and gives up.

I’ve been working at this company for about 6 months and I have 2 more months to go. I feel like it’s the perfect fit for me! I love the culture, the people, the opportunity to grow as a developer, and the amount of trust that they’re giving to an intern. Basically, the interns here are being treated like everyone else. I get to work on new features that the customers are actually using and I have done the same if not more amount of work than the other developers here (despite being an intern). 

My question is how do I bring it up? And when should I bring it up? Who do I bring it up to?

I am going to be a sophomore in college next year and my major is computer science. I really enjoy it, but I struggled a lot on my intro assignments. I found myself asking for help constantly and spend a lot of time on problems that shouldn't have taken that long. I really do enjoy CS though and want to keep pursuing it, but I am just worried that if I am struggling with assignments, how can I work as a software engineer or even do an internship. I'm always eager to learn and put in a lot effort. I just worry that if I can do something small as college assignments, how can I do actual work for a company. 

If you also struggled but were able to be successful in the future, I appreciate any advice you could give.

Thanks in advance for the advice."
he9gd6,2,2020-06-23,Red flags or am I exaggerating ?,Kalvers,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/he9gd6/red_flags_or_am_i_exaggerating/,"  

Hi,

For some backstory first. Apologies for the incoming wall of text. I posted this first on a throw away and then realized I didn't care all that much.

I recently started a new position at an SMB first of May (so during Corona) as ERP-application manager - or so I thought. There are a couple of things that have been irking me but they've been stacking up and I'm not sure anymore if I'm just exaggerating or if there really are red flags here. I 'd say was exaggerating because I've always had trouble adjusting to a new place, new leadership, new rules, ... It's something I'm aware of and am trying to exclude here. The place is an SMB that has 'only' had a programmer running their IT business needs for about 20 years and someone who recently started but after 8 months quit too. The programmer in questions is now WFH completely and I haven't met him outside of phone calls - it works but he's tiring to work with. I say 'only' a programmer, because I fully believe he did whatever was possible with the budget and skills he had - really not trying to be demeaning here. I could never do what he does and respect him.

So I'm basically looking for some input / opinions from strangers online because it's been driving me crazy. Now on to the matters at hand, and issues that have been irking me. I'm listing everything in order of annoyance to me. 

**Working hours:** When I started they told me it was a standard 39 hours /week contract. I've checked my timestamps this weekend and I've actually been working more like 41 hours / week. About a week or two when I was complaining to my boss about having too much ad-hoc work thrown at me by users and having my planning screwed twice in two weeks because 'something super urgent' came up (surprise the issues weren't but had to be solved asap according to my boss) he smirked a bit and told me that that was business and that in order to get everything done I’d have to work more hours and that he was working about 3 hours extra every day to stay up to date. According to him, I can’t keep working my standard hours but have to do more extra’s. I didn’t respond, but I fully believe that working overtime is sometimes necessary, but if you’re working 3 hours extra every day, you have a structural problem. My last job I had to stay home for a month or two because I was over worked, with therapy I realized I had to set more strict boundaries and that’s exactly what I do. I work extra when needed and if there’s a time sensitive issue. But staying late to research a new type of smart TV that they want to implement ? Hell to the no, that’s for business hours. I also I received about 12 e-mails from him, in regards to 9 different issues, starting from 18.00 – 21.30, that’s starting to become more frequent every day. I’m starting to think he might work a lot…

**Onboarding / responsibilities:** I was hired as an ERP Application manager – with some infrastructure responsibilities. This was actually a facet that interested me in the position at first. Now, they’ve gone on and introduced me to everyone as IT-manager without letting me know I’d be the IT-manager. As the only IT-guy on site, I understand that I’m the de facto IT-manager, but at least tell me and not let me figure it out when I see the business cards ? The first week I started I got half an hour tour of the entire production site (50 people) and was then pointed to a computer (that’s about 5 years old) and told to read the documentation. I spent the entire week reading and trying to understand everything and had to beg for another tour of the facilities with someone who could actually tell me how people were working (the previous ‘tour guide’ was my boss, who’s the operational manager but who’s only been there a couple of months and doesn’t really know the current procedures). I’ve also had a 20 minute discussion with the boss’ wife who stated that all this COVID-19 is terrible for the business (true) and everyone will continue wanting to WFH even after and that’s the worst part of it. Not the loss of lives or whatever, that they have to allow WFH – gasp.

**Trust I guess is the issue ?:**  Every issue that I’ve had to talk to my boss, I’ve had to fight tooth and nails because of multiple reasons. It usually boils down to him asking me to keep everything as cheap as possible. It’s a mindset that I also have, but sometimes you have to spend money in order to reduce more money down the drain in the long run. Another thing is our ISP sent me an email to let me know that we might be eligible for a fiber connection. We’re still on a copper WAN-connection so I figured I might as well do the ground work, figure everything out and proactively come up with a solution or advice on how to proceed. Kept my boss in the loop every step of the way. Now has come the time for a yes/no/later decision and they’ve stated that they’ll contact other people to verify my work, just to be sure – adding no offence of course. I mean, I get that I’m new and trust hasn’t been established, but I’ve been busting my ass off, providing them with numbers, hard data and even a flippin’ powerpoint presentation on this and adding no offence doesn’t really work. 

**The HR-lady:** someone new started in HR and I’ve had about 3 meetings and mail chains that are 5 different mails all about whether or not she should use a laptop and which one would be the cheapest possible. The people there were the CEO and the operational manager. Adding in their time, I believe we lost money just choosing the cheapest tbh. She was also introduced to a ‘mentor’ in the company who showed her the ropes in the company. I was not even aware they had the concept of mentors in the company and have had to beg for information everywhere, while I noticed that her mentor just about told her everything she needed to know. I’m glad for her, but realized that they really didn’t put in any effort into my position or onboarding.  

**The intern:** When I was talking to my boss about my work load, I stated that now is a perfect time for either a summer intern or someone to help me out with at least the basic stuff. I gave examples such as helping with cabling, cleaning the serverroom and switch cabinets, helping with inventorying different clients (not all of ‘em are joined to the domain…) and stuff like that. My boss agreed that it would be a good idea and we settled on me making up a possible work load and then discussing it again. As I was working on a PC from an HR-employee, she had a printed e-mail from my boss asking for someone to help out in IT who is mostly going to manage Sharepoint. Our Sharepoint isn’t a top priority issue, I haven’t had the time yet to start the Sharepoint project (which he knows) and has stated that we’ll continue Sharepoint 2021. The HR-lady confirmed that it would be the only intern we’re going to look for to help with IT. 

I’m staying with these issues for the moment – but will happily provide answers if needed. I guess I’d just like some feedback on what you guys think. I’m pretty sure I’m going to have a chat with my boss about everything because bottling stuff up is just bad, but I also think that I’m probably just not the workaholic they expect me to be (and never again will be)."

he9qpr,2,2020-06-23,Not sure what I’m doing wrong.,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/he9qpr/not_sure_what_im_doing_wrong/,"Long story short I wasn’t the smartest kid growing up, even to this day. I graduated high school with a  GPA of 1.38 and figured I’d enlist after graduation. So I took the asvab and got a cringing score of 34 on the second attempt. Anyway I did my time honorably as an 0331, immediately after separation I went straight to a community college. 

Starting from the bottom of the very bottom Math 80, English 98, and Reading strategies basically all remedial courses. I felt like a grade A retard and would question my motive for even being in college. Often pondering that I might best be suited for breaking rocks the rest of my life, that was in 2017. 

Fast forward to 2019 I attained my associates of science and transferred to a university, where I’m currently majoring in biomedical engineering. With roughly 3 years till I graduate, despite the progress my gpa is a 2.5 and declining, I’m not sure what I’m doing wrong. I’m utilizing my campuses resources such as the tutoring facility and barely getting by. 

How can I increase my gpa? I’ve been thinking about dropping my job as a full-time janitor at Walmart, or taking fewer classes during the semester. Furthermore I’d be financially stable  if I were to quit and focus on studies, but I figured it’d look good on a resume while being a full-time student. 

On another note I’m a junior, when should I be searching for internships? The personal story at the beginning probably wasn’t necessary, but I thought it’d give you an idea of my academic background. Anyway advice, criticism, and guidance would be appreciated thank you."
hea4bs,1,2020-06-23,Adjusting Expectations,Hwsnbn2,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/hea4bs/adjusting_expectations/,"Little bit about myself: I used to be a Web programmer working mostly with Microsoft SQL server 2000 and ASP 3.0. I did that for about seven years. I haven’t worked in technology for almost 15. I have a Master degree in MIS.

I’m currently enrolled in a cyber security Boot Camp. The program is about a year in length.  It covers a variety of topics from Microsoft security to Linux security to moderate networking concepts. It’s operating in conjunction with HackerU.  I read some very unflattering things about the program but I’m basically committed to it since I’m on the hook for almost $20,000.

Assuming I pick up as much as I possibly can during this next year, and I managed to score a network +, security + and Cisco Cyber Ops certification,  what kind of salary range and career opportunities do you think I can look forward to?  I’ve heard people suggest that I’m looking at an entry-level $30,000-$40,000 a year position. Or worse, a trip to Best Buy as a member of geek squad. I’ll be honest the salary range sounds absolutely absurd to me considering the amount of training money and certifications that I plan on getting.

However I’m not well-versed in the market or career landscape. Many of you are. With that kind of background and training what do you think I could expect to get as a career? Should I also get a + certification?  What are the certifications could I obtain  to help me counteract the lack of recent experience? I’m working full-time 50 to 60 hours a week as it is (unrelated field).  The program is practically full-time itself. And I can’t afford to just simply drop my job and get an internship. It’s simply not an option. I have to be able to support my family.

Any advice or information will be worthwhile and appreciated.. Thank you."
heasqp,1,2020-06-23,Game development internships?,edoelas,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/heasqp/game_development_internships/,"Hi, I am a computer science student that is in a weird situation: I have finished all the subjects in my bachelor's degree but I haven't handled my thesis yet, so next year I am not able to enrol for the master.

My thesis basically is the development of a game (at least a part of what could be a game) and it should be finished by September. Since I can't study anything after I finish the thesis I have decided to go for an Erasmus internship (an internship in another country in Europe where you receive some economical help from the EU). If it is possible I would love to do this internship in a game development company but I have found out that compared to the number of game development companies in Asia or USA in Europe we don't have that many. I also have to say that even if I love computer science I don't know that much about the game development world. My main goal in this internship is to develop my skills.

So the question is: do you know about any company in Europe that can be interested in an intern?  Maybe a small indie company that just need somebody to help with side tasks? Maybe a bigger company that is trying to catch new talents?

Thanks!

PD: If there are any other options that can be interesting apart from the Erasmus internship (maybe in Asia or in USA) I would also be interested in having a look, so please share them."

I was asked by a client of mine to assist in building a few machines for their interns to use for CAD work, but the caveat is I had to adopt some ECC Ram they purchased incorrectly in the builds.    


I thought I verified that both the CPU (Ryzen 3800x) and Mobo (MSI X570A Pro) were ECC complaint but the machine fails to post, in fact the EzDebug led just goes straight to indicate a CPU problem.   If I switch the RAM out for standard ddr4 3200, the machine posts/boots fine so it's definitely RAM related.     


I gave a quick glance through the uefi/bios to see if there was a portion to enable ECC mode but didn't see anything on first check.    


Any advice or feedback here? Secondly, if that MOBO won't work, any suggestions on one that might?

hegdr1,305,2020-06-23,Made With Extra Love,lifeisstrangemetoo,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/hegdr1/made_with_extra_love/,"“Jesus Christ,” said Landsman. “What do you think he’s doing with them?”

I didn’t reply. I simply stared down at the dead woman whose chest cavity had been unceremoniously ripped open. Like the rest, her heart had been removed with surgical precision, in stark contrast to the brutality that had splintered her ribs like toothpicks. 

I sighed and rubbed my head.

“I suppose you can ask him that when you catch him,” I replied. “Do it before my shift tomorrow and I’ll buy you a beer.”

“You’re leaving?” said Landsman.

“Promises are promises,” I said. “And besides, it’s bedtime.”

He shook his head, but said nothing. I ducked under the evidence tape, and climbed into my unmarked vehicle. The ride home was silent. 

When I arrived, the sun had already set, and darkness was rapidly creeping in. I checked my watch--only a few minutes late. I unlocked the door and trudged inside. My wife was on the living room sofa, watching reruns. 

“Dinner’s cold,” she said without looking up. “And she’s waiting for you.”

I relaxed a bit, and made my way down the hallway toward my daughter’s room. The door creaked open, and I reminded myself to put some oil on the hinges when I had the time. 

“Hey, sweetheart,” I said tentatively. 

Sarah turned her sleepy head. Clasped tight in her little arms was her favorite teddy bear, a brown plushy that was even bigger than her. We had bought it to stop the nightmares once the killings started. It had only moderate success. 

“Hi Daddy,” she said. 

The air between us was tense. 

“Did you catch him yet?” she asked. 

I shook my head. 

“I saw about the woman on the news,” she went on. “I wasn’t supposed to be watching but I saw it.”

I sighed and sat down on the corner of the bed. 

“We’ll catch him soon,” I said. 

“Promise?”

“Promise.” 

I bent down and kissed her on the forehead, and she rolled over and was soon snoring. I watched her for a while, lost in thought. Truth be told, we had a pretty good idea of who was behind the slayings, but no idea where to find him. 

The prime suspect was surgical intern at the local hospital by the name of Paul Brown. He ended up cracking under pressure and was fired from his job for stealing painkillers. Threatening suicide, he had been committed to the very same hospital at which he had once worked, and released just before the killings began. 

But so far, all of our intensive searches turned up nothing. My head buzzing with a million problems I could not solve, I stood up and went back to the living room. 

“Gonna come to bed tonight?” I asked my wife. 

She said nothing. My answer. 

Two hours and four fingers of whiskey later, I had fallen into an uneasy sleep. My dreams were not pleasant. 

*

The next morning I awoke to my phone alarm with a sigh. The sky was a pallid gray as I drove into work. I decided that I could afford to be a little late, and that I would stop by the toy store for another teddy bear, hoping to both comfort my daughter and thaw my wife’s icy mood.

Yet when I got to the store, it was closed. I could see from the parking lot that the insides had all been torn out.

*That’s odd. Didn’t the store only just open a few weeks ago?*

I climbed out of my unmarked and went up to the large display windows, now empty and devoid of toys. I pressed my face to the glass. My stomach dropped. I reached for the radio on my belt and called it in, then I went back to the trunk of my car, grabbed a tire iron and smashed the lock. 

I ran in, hoping that there was still time to render aid. But as I drew closer I saw that it was far too late for that. The body was pale, and the blood had already dried. The chest had been carved open and the heart removed. But the worst part was that I recognized the body. It was Paul Brown.

*

By the time we put it together, the owner of the store was long gone. The name he had used to register the business belonged to a dead guy. At first I was upset that we hadn’t caught him. A couple days later, I found a better reason to be upset. That was when we found out what he had been doing with the hearts.

That was when the teddy bears started to smell like rotting flesh.

hegixx,10,2020-06-23,[IWantOut] 26F USA -&gt; France,katsiano,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/hegixx/iwantout_26f_usa_france/,"Hey! First time posting here. I apologize in advance, brevity is not my strength!

I currently have a BA degree and after managing a restaurant for a few years then moving into a 9-5 office job, I realized I want to move abroad. 

For context, I studied abroad for a full year in Stockholm my junior year of college and I loved it. At one point I applied to a language program at Lund to go back to Sweden after graduating, with the idea of studying Swedish for a year then applying to a master's program in Stockholm so I could move back. I got in right as I was starting a stable relationship I thought would one day lead to marriage and the idea of settling down in the city I grew up in sounded less ""unknown"" than moving abroad and constantly dealing with visas for years. In retrospect, I was afraid I'd study there for 3 years then not find a job for a work visa or a partner for a sambo visa. I should've taken the risk!

When perusing Master's programs for what I'd like to go into, I looked at Europe partially because I would like to eventually end up back in Europe but also the cost tends to be far less than US programs. I found a really amazing Master's that's in English in Paris. Part of the program involves a form of an internship which is far easier to obtain if you have strong French skills. I found this program after it was too late to apply for this fall's start date, so I originally thought I could self-study French and apply to the program for next fall. I've been self-studying for almost 80 days, and I took one semester of French in undergrad before switching to Swedish.

I'm kind of changing course a bit because my current job isn't really one that I can work in mindlessly for a year before moving- it's a sales based position and if my company knows I plan to move, it isn't really feasible for them to keep me on. Instead of finding another job here locally for the next year, I shifted gears and have been considering becoming an au pair. I worked in after school childcare in high school and work well with children. It would give me the ability to learn the language and develop a strong base from immersion and language classes versus 100% studying in the US and it potentially affecting my internship abilities down the road. 

Thanks to COVID, France is just now allowing visa applications. I'm not even sure if I could get a visa right now for something that starts in September so I may have to delay finding a family until winter. The Master's program requires you be under 30 when you start your internship, and au pairs also have to be under 30 in France. If I want to start the master's next fall I'd have to either find a year long au pair contract starting around September (VERY tight on trying to get a visa) or a 6 month contract in the winter/spring. I could also au pair for longer and wait until the following year to study the Master's. After living in France for 18 months I could even potentially be able to apply for other programs that are French based programs depending on my French level so it could open more doors. At the end of the day if I need to delay studying for another year to create a better long term result for myself, I'd rather do so than rush it.

**Here's my questions**\- 

1. From my research, an au pair uses a student visa. If I move to France on a student visa as an au pair, then apply to and get into the Master's program, would it be an extension of my visa or would I need to apply for a separate one? Would I be able to do this from within France?
2. My passport expires in 2022. Since an au pair visa is originally issued for 12 months and then just extended, if I did find a family for a September start date, would I need a new passport before I could apply for a visa? Technically at that point my visa would still be current at the end of the original visa. Has anyone gone through the process of renewing their US passport at the US embassy in another country who can weigh in on this?"

- Have 2 jobs lined up right now, and I want to build up my resume for future internships (rising sophomore).      
- Currently on the waitlist for dorming, and I'm dreading a shitty room assignment considering I have insomnia problems.     
- Feel like (so far) I have closer friends at home than on-campus.   
   
At the same time I realize that:  
- Social life once I return in the spring will suck since I missed the fall semester.     
- Many people might stay remote, so I could actually get a GOOD single dorm assignment      
- If I return in the spring it's basically guarenteed that my 2nd semester dorming will suck if not that many people decide to pick the remote option, this is because I have to do the selection process again if I opt for remote.     
- I play a spring sport, and I might miss key off-season practices that get me closer to my team as well as better on the field.     
  
I have to pick by July 1st and housing services won't assign waitlisted people room assignments until mid-July. I'm thinking of asking on June 30th if I could get a number on how many people picked the remote option, if its large than I would assume it would be better to just go (better room assignment)?"

hei1yq,2,2020-06-23,Instructor seems to think I'm slacking off. I want to tell them that I'm not.,[deleted],ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/hei1yq/instructor_seems_to_think_im_slacking_off_i_want/,"So I have this internship report to deliver. 
Most of the actual ""reporting"" part is actually done, but there were still several parts of the document that needed work.

First, some context: I have combined type ADHD, not medicated, and I hate academic writing with a passion. I take several times longer to write things than most of my non adhd peers. Making even a small essay overnight is unthinkable for me, even on my greatest hyperfocus moments.

I have trouble getting started, gathering sources, reading AND understanding such sources, then incorporating them into my writing; I get stuck on sentences for hours(and sometimes, days). Yes I do the ""word vomit"" technique, but then I get stuck again when I have to rephrase that mess into something comprehensible.

So, after going through all that trouble beating myself up and wondering if I'm stupid, lazy or anything of the sort(you know, the basics), I finally managed to finish the remaining parts of the document, relying heavily on older reports as models(which was, mind you, encouraged by our instructors). I thought I made a nice job. It wasn't great, I was sure it  would have mistakes, but it was done. I was happy with my work. I finally decided to send it to my professor for correction.

The answer? Told me everything was too short, and didn't have enough sources. Told me I was being ""economic"" with my writing.

Now don't get me wrong, I don't mind criticism of my work, that's not the issue. This instructor is known for being blunt and I'm fine with that, because she is ultimately helpful and seems to genuinely want to help.

But this time it felt different? It sounded like the classic ""you are not trying hard enough sweetie :))"" that we all know too well and it hurts. I think that I should probably voice my feelings, but not sure on how to do it.
Partially because I struggled, partially because of external factors i could do nothing about, I'm already several months past the time expected to hand it in. I'm afraid that if I voice my struggles, she will not believe me, and think I'm making excuses, since she is also known to be really nagging about deadlines compared to other professors. Also I'm not so sure how to convey my frustration without sounding passive aggressive, let alone ask for help once more.

Tl;dr: how do i ask them for help and explain that I've been struggling
Thanks for reading, help is appreciated."
hei76q,132,2020-06-23,Dear Fellow Internationals: it is time we woke up and demand deferral,vickyvaugn,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/hei76q/dear_fellow_internationals_it_is_time_we_woke_up/,"For those of us still expecting to attend a US bschool this year, we are being tricked. After a few emails and exchanges with the program I was accepted to, I was able to get a deferral to next year. I think it shows the lack of ethics that these schools pretend they ""dont know what will happen"" and ""they are dedicated to helping us navigate this challenging time."" In reality they just want us as revenue:

&amp;#x200B;

**1) Visas are being shut-down, and more is to come (OPT/F1 are still next to be cut):**

* Trump banned green cards, then extended it this week. Read the press releases...they hinted this would happen and continue to further hint at this being extended. Our schools made us think H1B and J1 were off the chopping block, we learned this week they were not...
* Weeks ago, reports were saying there would be more immigration bans. We learned this week that became true. H1B and J1 and some more are gone. Press releases hinted they willbe extended. We should operate under the assumption that they will be extended. I keep hearing lots my friends say ""oh by the time we need jobs the suspension will be over,"" that is naive.
* Press releases still point to OPT and F1 being next to be suspended (and then, of course go through more extensions of suspensions). We should not expect to be on campus this year or even most of next year. At the least Trump plans to hold the suspensions as a bargaining chip to enact real immigration law reform.
* These developments are unprecedented and we should not be expected to take a $170K investment risk on an investment that should be SAFE. If i wanted to gamble this much I would take that money and invest in start-ups or start my own company.
* Many embassies are still closed and backlogged, I dont expect Trump to allow them to open until winter of 2021 or start of 2022. He will use the virus as an excuse to cut immigration anyway he can

**2) The next wave is coming, and classes will be 100% virtual for the whole year with 100% virtual internships to follow, and even a 50% virtual year for '21 to '22:**

* Go to virus dashboards and see that cases are yet to sky rocket in some countries. When they do, we will be restricted for immigration (see Brazil)
* Cases did not even decline in the US. Look at the dashboards, they are INCREASING in many states. US is highly interconnected and there is no way to contain it
* The winter is coming, any break we may have gotten from the virus is expected to worsen. 95% of transmissions happen inside. No program is ready for outdoor classes...especially in the winter
* Any programs keeping students on a string and saying they dont know what the class format will be these next few weeks are showing their lack of ethics. It will be almost entirely virtual but they want to make sure we enroll first before telling us. I have friends who work in admissions (not at my program, but at others) and this is the conversation happening on the inside

**3) The economy looks okay now but it is unstable and very few will be hiring when things hit the fan. Even if we can enroll and recruit virtually for the whole year, getting a job will be a GOOD job (the job we go to these schools to get) will be a bloodbath:**

* Even the top 3 programs have recruiting challenges in depressed economies. Fewer companies recruit and career opportunities are less sexy. Look at the '08 recession, reputable firms were retracting their offers as a result of the downturn (even at schools like GSB and Wharton). Poets and Quants has many stories from this time
* Even if a vaccine is found it will likely only be circulated to healthcare professionals and essential workers. Even the well-off won't have access to the vaccine for 2 years after it is founded. Look at prior pandemics and how the vaccine was distributed. If the US can't distribute testing correctly, what will make us think they can distribute a vaccine more effectively.

&amp;#x200B;

My recommendation is to be persistent. A lot has changed this week and we have seen the writing on the wall. We should not let us convince them that things are ""uncertain"" or we are ""still waiting to see."" My program told me ""no"" and gave me lots of anxiety when I asked for a deferral. I made a respectful case and continued to follow-up with my concerns. At the end of the day, there is some good people there. And many of the people on the staff at these schools have a good heart and can see things changing.  Good luck and let me know if you are looking for further advice on how I went about it!

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT**: We learned recently the US is restricting F1 visas, as some of us had predicted would happen. WSJ does a good job of explaining specific details of the new ruling many of the publications missed, which says students will not be able to take online class in their home country if they can't make it to the US (difficult to do with embassies backlogged and closed). Clear your cookies, open on brave browser, open on incognito mode, or just buy a subscription to get beyond paywall, no other publication has this important detail (that I can find):  [https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-rules-detail-how-foreign-students-canand-canttake-classes-at-u-s-colleges-this-fall-11594056119](https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-rules-detail-how-foreign-students-canand-canttake-classes-at-u-s-colleges-this-fall-11594056119)

Here is the seventeenth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?That's completely up to what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.

All the best,

\--Nick

As a first generation, low income, out of state student this raises quite a few concerns for me and I’d appreciate to know what other students in my position are doing.

My school has a great business program with a 98% job placement rate in your field after graduation. However, It’s also so expensive. 

Is it worth transferring back to college in my home state as a junior? I’m having trouble thinking about paying the same tuition price for remote learning. My home state just passed an act that allows families who make under 60k a year to attend college with no tuition fees. While this is a great opportunity, I’ve been very successful at college OOS. I’m very involved on campus, in various groups and organizations, have made amazing friends, lined up internships, and am getting such a great education. 

While it would be cheaper to transfer to school back home it would break my heart and I would be losing out on all the opportunities I’ve earned so far in my college career. My current school seems the most beneficial to me for when I enter the workforce. Once again, I would hate to pay full OOS tuition to get an education remotely and am having a hard time deciding what to do in this situation. Any advice or hearing from other OOS students is greatly appreciated!"

I really do enjoy CS though and want to keep pursuing it, but I am just worried that if I am struggling with assignments, how can I work as a software engineer or even do an internship. I'm always eager to learn and put in a lot effort. I just worry that if I can do something small as college assignments, how can I do actual work for a company.

You could say I'm stuck without direction, not sure what to do next in order to start my career.

I primarily work in C++, but am considering picking up another language. However, I'm not entirely sure which language is best for employers right now. I see Java, Javascript, Python, C#, Node.js, Angular, and I even saw Swift once. Which one should I focus on? At the moment, I'm leaning most towards Java but I'm not sure if it's the best option. If it helps, I'm looking for jobs around the New York City Area. Most of the jobs I find that require C++ also want a senior developer, which I definitely am not. I'm looking for jobs using the terms ""Associate software developer,"" and ""junior software developer.""

I did not get an internship while in college: I didn't think my mental health could handle it at the time. I also have no work experience: I've been unable to find any sort of work, including ones that aren't for a computer science career. Essentially, all I have is a bachelor's degree.

I've been on several interviews, but I never get a call back for a second interview. I've been through an assessment period with a company, but I was not selected for the actual internship position that was offered. That was the closest I got to getting employment, so I'm at a loss. It's possible that it's somehow my interviewing and general job skills that are hindering me, but it's equally likely I just don't know what to do next. I've looked up suggestions on what to do on the internet, as well as talked to people in the industry, but nothing has come of it."
hepfoz,5,2020-06-23,"Feel underqualified for my title, stuck in a department I can't stand, might have severe impostor syndrome",SistersOfMerci,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/hepfoz/feel_underqualified_for_my_title_stuck_in_a/,"I'm currently struggling with my career situation.

I started my job about a decade ago as an intern working in COBOL on a mainframe before I had finished college for my (non-programming) degree. The company culture was pretty relaxed and everyone seemed to enjoy being there. Over time, the management style started to shift and more and more demand was being placed on developers in expected overtime and workload. I was in my 20s and I adapted to it-- I was single, living at home, saving up money, and looking to eventually buy a house. Being a younger dev, I was shifted from the mainframe systems to a modernized proprietary platform (using a language similar to Java which compiles to Java bytecode) fairly early in my career. I worked hard and long hours as I had no training or experience in OOP, but eventually became very proficient and motivated.

Thankfully, I was consistently promoted eventually to Senior Software Engineer. I was in my early 30s when this happened, and shortly after this promotion I was starting to feel the effects of burn-out. I had been neglecting my personal life in service of my job and had been supporting a somewhat shaky production system in addition to being brought onto several death-march projects as a ""problem solver"". While our off-hours rotation was not too bad, I was beginning to get fed up with having been on a rotation for 8 years by that point with no real break. I had bought a house that I wanted to start enjoying, I wanted to pursue some non-screen staring hobbies outside of work, and I wanted to start dating, which was something I put off almost entirely because of my career. The energy I had in my 20s for nights and weekends was long gone.

As of last year, our department was drastically reorganized. Instead of our previous organization of teams being sectioned by which application they supported, they were split into service and project scrum teams. I was told that I was chosen to go on the production service team. We would be supporting much more territory with far fewer developers and a smaller off-hours rotation. I immediately felt my anxiety and depression bubble up and most of the concerns I had about this setup have come true. We have spent very little of our time since the reorganization doing any significant amount of programming. Most of our guys are spending their time going on wild goose chases, acting as an extension of the help desk, making tweaks to legacy stuff, or dealing with issues indirectly introduced by project teams.

After a couple of months of this, I'm fed up. I have been melting down and unable to deal with the stress and chaos of supporting a production system on an almost daily basis since then-- I do not like what this role is doing to me. Our department's  plan is to eventually rotate people on the service teams into project roles and vice versa, but there is no timetable for this yet. I'm currently making serious inquiries to see if I can get transitioned from my current team to one of the project teams early so I can get some kind of reprieve from dealing with production, as many of the people who I used to work with have had very good things to say about their day to day.

In the event that management won't allow me to transition, I'm considering what to do next. I'm a bit panicked that my title is overstated for what my skill set actually includes. For actual technical knowledge, I have SQL, SVN, Eclipse, JMS, and some (outdated) Java 6 experience in some decently complex work like solving concurrency issues, memory/GC analysis, and performance tuning. However, the bulk of my knowledge and certification is in a proprietary framework developing with the Java derivative. I've been reading up on job postings and the requirements for someone with my title (even without senior) seem far beyond what I have for a skill set. At the moment, I'm in a position where I have no opportunities to learn any new industry standard skills on the job and my existing skill set is actively atrophying. My day leaves me so exhausted and upset that I'm having a hard time working up the energy to teach myself anything.

These questions might seem obvious or sound like things I should research for my own self, but I've got really bad mental fog and have been circling on these for a while. I have no friends in the industry outside my own company so I have zero perspective. I'd really appreciate any thoughts this subreddit has.

1. What are some good approaches for learning new skills? I struggle in trying to read books or documentation, but I excel in taking classes and learning exercises. I'm just having a hard time determining the best sites or places to go for that sort of thing as I've done almost all of my learning on the job.
2. I've never had to go job hunting in my life so I'm really not familiar with what it's like to start at a new job as someone with some experience. Will companies overlook missing technical requirements based on experience? How often will a company offer on-the-job training or the opportunity to get up to speed on any gaps, or is that unheard of? I'm nervous about my title combined with my skill set looking terribly underwhelming.
3. Any thoughts on industries or specific companies that tend to be lower stress? I'm heavily valuing work-life balance and personal skill growth over promotions and paychecks at this point and would frankly gladly accept a demotion and a pay cut to be able to sleep at night again.
4. What would be some good things to start studying? I've been researching LinkedIn job postings and came up with this broad list of things that would be beneficial, but I'm open to suggestions or thoughts on where to prioritize:

* Getting my Java knowledge caught up to current day
* Spring Boot
* REST Web Services
* C# (no experience with C based languages but I hear C# is an easy jump from Java?)
* HTML5
* CSS
* JavaScript
   * NodeJS
   * React
* AWS
* Git
* JSON
* MySQL
* Conceptual stuff like UML, Design Patterns, and Agile methodology

tl;dr - a job I used to appreciate has become a daily stress bomb for me, and I'm not sure if I have the ability or skills to move on. Any advice anyone has to offer would be greatly appreciated. I'm working with a therapist on getting things together emotionally, but I could really use some help from you folks with more standard industry experience."

Bit of background. I'm a Civil Engineer with a Masters from England and have been in the US working as a CivEng for 6 years. About 2 years ago i decided to dabble with a little java and very slowly picked it up in my spare time while i studied and worked full time. Recently I spent 3 months starting a seperate project in python and enjoyed that too. Given the greater interest in software engineering and the higher payscale I am wanting to transition from Civil to software engineering. I have applied to a local university to take evening classes for bachelor courses in CS but given im 30 and i have to work full time it will take me years to obtain a degree.   
What would be the best way for me to move forward considering i have to support my family, being the largest earner and I have a kid. Is taking evening courses going to make my resume appealing enough for a company to consider me at an entry level? Do i need a complete degree or to intern somewhere for a year or so?

The company’s office is a very open and collaborative environment, and I was really looking forward to joining the team in person and meeting all the new hires since my internship ended last August, plus seeing/talking to people every day.

&amp;#x200B;

However due to COVID, we are all remote and I don’t love it. Everyone else seems like they do like it, which makes sense considering most have families/kids or just don’t like commuting. What’s worse is that there is a chance the company is going to go fully remote eventually (is what everyone is saying). I really enjoyed being in the office in person and having that social interaction (which I did get in my internship to an extent).

&amp;#x200B;

I am having some meetings to meet some of the team which is nice, but outside of that I will most likely never be talking to them in person, which bums me out. I didn’t make a ton of friends in college, and while I know professional relationships are different from non-work relationships, I was excited about getting to know new people/going to happy hour/work events, etc. I guess I am posting in this sub to see if anyone else is going through the same thing or has any advice. It’s hard to form relationships over Zoom and Slack, but I am hoping it will get better as I get put on more projects and am working with more people.

Please do not mistake me for being ungrateful, I know tons of people are going through hardships without being able to find a job - I consider myself lucky. Also, if anyone has any general advice about starting my job or anything I should keep in mind, I would love to hear it. Thanks!

Seattle, WA


Summary: 
Started as a Payroll Specialist, took on AP Specialist responsibilities, HR Generalist is leaving as of June 30th and I will be taking over the role and have been training in the role for the last couple months.

My boss said I have proven myself to be a valuable member and able to manage up, he recommended me to  position relating to Benefits Administration in another department in the company (this position will be temporary for about 8 or so months).

I asked for a raise (in a more professional sentence) and my boss agreed but I am unsure about how to calculate how much I want since these positions are different from each other and a lot more than the typical position. 

I’ve tried researching salaries online and looking at posts of people who have taken on multiple roles but couldn’t find out how to re-evaluate compensation and wanted to reach out here! 


Detailed Background Information:
I recently got a job in Feb 2020 as a Payroll Specialist for a small company (my boss/manager is the CFO of the company) in Seattle, WA. COVID-19 hit hard soon after I started and I started working from home. I handled training and stayed in communication with my team + manager and took initiative to take on more tasks such as asking when team members need help, creating processes, finding ways to reduce costs + responsibilities during this time period. 

I started as a Payroll Specialist (hourly) and was suppose to start as part-time and move to full-time but my boss wanted me to start full-time to get adequate training in the beginning. 

Since early April, I started taking on the responsibility of AP Specialist - the role was spilt into three people (spilt handling three different companies) before as a portion of their job and now I handle the full responsibility for this position between the companies.

Our current HR Generalist (who worked part-time but felt like it would be better as a full-time role) has put in their notice and their last day is June 30th and I will be taking on their role when they leave. I’ve been training with them the last couple months for the transition. 

Recently, my boss recommended me to help out on another department in Benefits Administration. For this position, the current employee will be gone from sometime in October/November or earlier until March/April 2020. They initially were going to hire an intern and then I was recommended so I will most likely be taking on this role also. The current employee is currently salaried and full-time. When I take over the position, some of the responsibilities will be done before they leave so it will not be on my plate. They estimate that it should take 1-4 or 3-8 hours a week to handle the role when the current employee is out. (Hours seems suspect since they are currently salaried and full-time but I’m going with the flow). This position is still an ongoing conversation. 

A subcomponent of these roles is process creation and improvement such it is a small company. 


Past Experience:
I’ve worked for a number of small businesses/startup in industries such as HR, Payroll, AR, operations, website developing, cyber security, etc


In relation to these roles:
HR + Recruiting - 1.5 - 2 years, of you include subcomponents of jobs, 4.5 years total

Payroll Specialist - 5 - 9 months 

AP Specialist - no AP experience before 
this job, had 5 - 9 months of AR experience 

Benefits Administration - 5 - 9 months of managing benefits for different employees 

Process Creation and Improvement - 3-5 years


In summary: 
- I don’t mind doing all the roles/positions, I am working on a new job title (if you have any recommendations, it would be much appreciated!). I am taking on a lot of different responsibilities and felt a pay increase would be fair considering the circumstances and would like to better understand how to estimate a pay rate/ increase for a position like this.
- Should this be a salaried or hourly position? 
- What percent would be considered a reasonable/fair salary increase?

So the thing is, I am currently a student in ChemE with a minor in electrical. I recently got a job at a company as a solutions engineering intern in a co-op role. The thing is the job description is very vague. I asked them about it and they said that was intentional as the job of a SE is very diverse and different day-to-day. I’ve two months left till the start of this internship and I wanna know everything I can to be prepared. 

I really do not want to let them down as I feel like they really took a chance on me as a person with a ChemE background with less than exceptional skills in coding. 

•How should I better prepare? 
•What does the life of a SE intern look like? (I searched this thread for previous posts and read all of them but would love new input). 
• Is it possible to get a relatively strong base in SQL and Python in two months? (Its not mandatory to know but I would still like to learn as much as I can). 

Any and all advice is extremely appreciated. :) Thank you!"

* first internship in data science/ml. (did swe internships before)
* \#1 telco vs. 3-year-old start up of 30 people with the acquisition made last year. Founders of start-up also interned and worked for the telco some years ago. (how to interpret this for my choice?)
* same salary, full time seems possible in each based on the previous people.
* what should the workplace atmosphere look like in companies like these?

In my experience, after all my internships and education I found the work/life balance the most valuable criterion. I know I need to prove myself for some time in a new company, but once they see I am able to do things, I feel I can return to the normal. Other than this, I was always working for big organizations before, and those were great with a desk assigned to you, in some place away from your supervisor. Obviously, I do not want to be peeped by my supervisor whenever I stand up to get some coffee or have a quick phone call. I cannot really see what the work environment should look like though in each of these. Any insights into companies like these, tell me please."

Is it best to intern at a tech consultancy? Its my understanding it's exceptionally high stress for interns/grads but the work is more well rounded.
Or should I go for a more traditional internship with a company where I'll more likely work 'business as usual' tasks?
Or would a bank be fulfilling?

Ideally I'd like skills to be able to work anywhere in the world.



Any and all suggestions helpful, if you're wondering these are the choices for me in Australia/Melbourne:

Businesses:

I worked through it just fine and understood most of the concepts. However, after I finished the course my employer asked me to set up the board differently so instead of using the camera to capture a training model we upload pictures as well. I had a little trouble with that and got stuck.

Currently where I am at is using several datasets as well as the terminal to predict some pictures. However, everywhere I looked I found no place to make my own database. That is one place I wish to start. 

Some background: I have VERY little experience in CS. I have taken AP Computer science in high school, but that really only teaches the basics of JS.

hf4znn,6,2020-06-24,Why I'm moving from mobile development to .NET development (career move),afterhoursdev,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/hf4znn/why_im_moving_from_mobile_development_to_net/,"Context: Senior Android developer currently but have been working in .NET professionally since my internship.

This might seem like a bad choice given the popularity of apps and how much companies are still willing to shell out for mobile apps but I want to give a few reasons why I think that moving from mobile to web is a solid career decision at least for me personally and hopefully this might help you in some way.

1. Apple continues to build the walled garden, further isolating itself from everyone else.
2. Almost all apps are just pretty API clients, meaning the app itself lives on the server, you are just making the screens to consume it.
3. Experience in Android will get you nowhere in iOS (job market) and vise versa since they are completely different 
4. The Android community loves to over complicate architecture and use DI even when its not necessary. It happens in the iOS and .NET community as well, but it happens all the time in Android.
5. Hate on .NET all you want, but the tooling keeps getting better and better each year
6. There are significantly more jobs in .NET (although many of these are legacy apps)
7. As hard as I have tried to specialize I always find myself playing with new tech. Since you can do just about everything with .NET, I can still specialize (to an extent) while not feeling like i'm tied down to just Mobile or just Backend web, etc.

These are just a few reasons why I decided to make the switch. How am I actually switching? I'm not just going to quit my job since I still work very reasonable hours and I'm fully remote. I am going to do more projects in .NET and do some side consulting work. Once I get a bit more momentum back into .NET and the web side especially, then I will likely make the transition. 

For those student who are concerned about specializing in a technology, just know that you can always choose a different tech stack later down the road. I had a lot of fun doing mobile, but I think its time to go down a different path."

I am a double major residing in Southern Ontario and will be graduating university in 2 months. I did a double major (BMath and Bachelors of Business Administration). I have always been so undescive about my career path because I case about pay, intellectuall stimulating work and job security (can really only have 2/3 of these imo) and I feel recently I have been selling myself short on my potential because I'm so risk-adverse. I also got accepted to a grad program for September-December to prep for CFE writing after university.

I have ALWAYS been on the fence about getting my CPA. Though, my end goal was never to work in public accounting. My situation is such that I tried some internships in financial institutions and didn't enjoy them (mostly since I didn't really enjoy the work or understand it well enough bc i didn't like working with financial assets, but i did enjoy one internship where I was a Supply Chain Analyst since the work was engaging, I could tangibly see the result of my work and overall, made more sense to me. And I think it was more technical so I could see in future roles the value added of my math degree and experience with programs.

The issue is that last year, I ended up getting an offer for a CPA rotational program for a great company and at the time, since I was risk adverse, accepted the offer because why not? I was set with a job a year in advance before graduating and seeing people struggle finding work right now due to COVID makes me realize i made the right choice. So I began prepping and taking accounting courses to set myself up to write the CFE. This offer also would help reimburse for course/exam fees and give study days off. Great offer.

But now, I'm currently hating the courses. Audit, Management Accounting, Advanced Accounting...etc. Accounting is boring to me and it takes me 10x more effort than others to understand stuff. But I was set for a career  towards CPA bc I was bounded by this offer. But then I realized I needed to take more courses to get the CPA; Capstone1/2, prep for CFE and then get two years experience until I actually get the CPA. It's a big BIG commitment. Those in AFM tell me a lot of people who lack motivation drop out of the grind and people are always ask me why I'm not utilizing my math degree to something more if I don't like accounting (and how I can get paid more with other jobs).

Honestly, I think I've learned that I like solving puzzles and working with data. Things like Tableau, PowerBI, SQL, Python. I even know/worked with SAP, SAS and R but I don't know how to code like a genius. So people wonder why I don't do business analytics or data analytics in a tangible industry which I prefer. But it's just that I am signed for this amazing offer but I'd be there for 2 years at least. So I don't know what to do.

It seems to risky right now to look for other jobs bc of COVID and idk if other places are hiring and if its stable. I think there's risk of me getting black listed too. Maybe I'm overthinking and should stick with this offer, but straight up, my end goal has NEVER been to be an accountant. And honestly, people tell me my earning potential due to my math degree is much more for a non-accounting job anyways. So that's a plus. Because if i'm not in accounting for the money, nor for the work, nor wanting to be an accountant, WHY AM I GETTING MY CPA?!?

So I need advice. This is a big commitment with the studying/prep and I just don't know if I have the motivation if I already am lacking it right now and after 5 years of school I'm sick of studying. but this is also a great opportunity/job I signed for and the company is great with great people but its at least a two year commitment. I don't want to undervalue myself, and I think because I'm risk adverse, I just opted for this path but I don't want to do this anymore. What should I do?"

I don't hold any European passport, and I'm a computer science student under a working visa rn. I'd like to know realistically what are my chances to get permission to move to the UK.

I'm about to start my graduate internship as a product owner, and I have a relevant background working with football (writing articles back in Brazil, and data analysis here in NL).

Since I'm not an English native speaker, I'm not even thinking about trying to pursue something in communications. But is only a graduate internship enough to apply to tech vacancies that would require the company to sponsor my visa? I also have some savings I could use to pay my visa process but are companies open to this kind of discussion or they would already not consider my application?

Does anyone have any tips for me? Any advice will be highly appreciated.

Thanks!!"

This is my first REAL job, they’re working me as somewhat of an intern but with pay and the expectation that in a to total of 3 months I’ll be a salary paid designer working full time. It‘ll be a month after this week is up and the issue I have only just recently discovered is that I’m leaving when I shouldn’t be. It’s not really on purpose intentionally... like I was told I work 10am-1pm mon-fri. And I guess I was talking that a little too literally.. I just realized this today after one of our sales people called me to talk about a proof I sent them. The proof still had issues and I’ve sent it to her at least twice today. She told me to call her if I had questions and I called her twice within about an hour to an hour and 15 minutes. And I should’ve called her back right after I did the second time. 

My problem with that was I felt that it would’ve been like right away and that it would’ve been annoying.. so right after the call and talking about that I’m understanding that I’m assuming too much.. but like that’s just how my personality gets, I don’t want to annoy people. But I know deep down I need to jus get over it! I write down the specifics in a note book jus as an extra bit of help for myself but even that jus doesn’t seem to do too much to improve my situation. I don’t consider myself a bad designer, I know there are things I’m still learning but my issue is this:

What kind of suggestions can you give me to help in this situation? I’ll consider any kind of advice that may sound like it’ll improve my situation and if more specifics are needed I’m happy to provide them via a reply!!"

TLDR: long term toxic black mold exposure in dormitories from negligent church internship. 
May be cause for fibromyalgia. What legal action can I take?

-there was not an option to live at home or have off campus housing. 


I have been attending a church internship/college program for the past 3 years. My first year there, i came in a very healthy 21 year old female. I started experiencing the worst and most unexplainable symptoms. Each day I increasingly became more sick with no reason of why. I took the next year off school, to dedicate that time to doctors appointments and medical tests to figure out what was going on. 
Once I understood my condition (fibromyalgia) I returned to the internship for two more years. 

The campus was unbearably filthy. The dorms were held together by mold. The church hosts a summer camp, and we interns prepare the campus each summer. We were always directed to paint a fresh coat over the mold. 

My second year, my roommates father tested the most in our room, which covered the entire 10x10 wall, in which my area of the room was. The rest came back as toxic black mold, and the severity could not be detected, because the toxicity was too high for his tests to read. 
I remember he reached out to the church, that this needed to be taken care of, and they ignored it. 

The church internship I’ve been attending is recently under legal fire, for rape, sexual misconduct, overworking interns, and the conditions of the dorms. 
Here is one of the few news articles: https://kfor.com/news/more-victims-come-forward-as-allegations-against-church-of-the-harvest-grow/

I recently researched a little more on Fibro, and I have found some articles and records that show a direct link to mold exposure leading to fibro. 

The church is already facing many different lawsuits, but I feel like now I really have something that can justify what I’ve gone through with my fibro."

hffsmb,0,2020-06-25,Is Software Development the right career for me?,dragonejt,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/hffsmb/is_software_development_the_right_career_for_me/,"Hello reddit,

I kinda wanted to post my history and experience with coding and software development, and then ask a few questions:

I first was exposed to programming when I started learning Java in an afterschool class in middle school. At the beginning, it was easy, as I was just learning basic concepts like the main method, how to print output in Java, arrays, and the like. However, when my teacher moved onto data structures, I became completely lost. The homework assignment was to generally ""implement"" a certain data structure that was talked about in class using our own classes. For example, if we had to implement a linked list, we had to create our own Node class and then create our own Linkedlist class. Things became even harder when I started to learn algorithms afterschool in high school, I had no idea what to do when everyone else in the class seemed perfectly capable of using Dijkstra's Algorithm and all sorts of other data structures and algorithms. My knowledge of programming basically came to a standstill in high school, and I just played around with Java occassionally.

In freshman year of college, I chose to major in Computer Science because I had experience with coding and because many others in my high school were also majoring in it. I started off a little bit ahead because I took some AP tests in high school, but college really beat me down. At the end of my first semester (Fall 2019), I had failed Calc 2 (integrals, applications of integrals, sequences and series, polar and paremetric stuff) and Digital Design Fundamentals (Logic Gates, Boolean Algebra, PLDs, latches, flip-flops, finite state machines, CPUs, etc). Part of this was due to my own procrastination, but also part of this was because the content was indeed difficult. I retook the classes I failed this semester (Spring 2020), and I managed to get a GPA above 3.0 for my scholarship, but that was only because my school deletes a certain number of failing grades if you get a higher passing grade by retaking it.

After my first year in college, then came/comes Summer. I did not have an internship offer this Summer, so I am spending my time learning full stack web development and working with others on a GitHub project. I am really enjoying learning web development and creating little websites and servers, and I like working with my team on the GitHub project.

So, that's basically my history and experience with coding and programming. I then have a couple of questions to ask the subreddit:

1. **Is Software Development the right career for me?** I am really enjoying web development and working on my GitHub project, but data structures and algorithms are still very difficult for me. Is the majority of a Software Development job focused on using complex data structures and algorithms in your code, or is it more using code to create interesting projects?
2. If I continue with Software Development as my career choice and it turns out that I actually dislike coding, are there any other career paths that I can take as a Computer Science major?
3. How much will I have to learn in order to keep up in the realm of Software Development? I am learning web development using Javascript and the MERN Stack right now, but how fast will the popular stack change? (e.g. When will nodejs no longer be extremely popular, or how far in the future will I have to learn a new tech stack or new language to keep up with my job?) I like learning new technologies to use, but it is sort of different when I need to learn something just to keep up with the progression of technology.
4. Is Software Development a stable career? I keep hearing about how Software Development is very popular and very competitive in order to get into a big company. Also, I hear about Artificial Intelligence taking over Software Development or something like that.

Thank you! I am going to use the responses and comments to see if I should switch my major to something else or continue with Computer Science."

I was with this girl, we'll call her Y. We were together for 8 months, and shes my first girlfriend. She has serious mental health issues. She had a ""good voice"" and a ""bad voice"" in her head, and reguarly had episodes of having trauma flashed to her.

I supported her through everything, I got her to stop self harming, through all of this and at times had to even communicate with these voices if they took contorl of her. I was always there for her. It was diffiucult. and quite a few times I tried to end things because it was too much for me, but ended up staying due to her begging and crying at my feet. 

We were in love and things were good, even if they were difficult at times.

As she is studying abroad, we had had the conversation about Visas and what would happen once it ended. We had talked about how in the 3, 4ish years when it ended, We could think about marriage as an option. Althought it feels like were really young to do it, I loved her and wanted to spend the rest of my life.  To be clear this was not a relationship for the visa situation.

One night she told me she didn't want to do an internship anymore, which meant it would be another year shorter. I wasn't really okay with that, and she couldn't understand why I wasn't comfortable with it. Mid argument she decides to tell me shes going to stay the night at another guys place, who I knew she barely knew but due to covid was the only person around. I had only met him once in passing and again funilly enough did not like the idea of her disapearing off with some other guy when were in a big fight. She then actually tried to end things with me and threatened to call secuirty on me if I didn't leave, but clearly didn't mean it. At that point I was done and properly ended things and thats kinda where things went bad.

She had a huge breakdown, that bad voice took control and was harming her and talking to me, and she was laughing and calling me abusive (which I never have been, I've always tried to help her) and saying how she was going to die now and that I had killed her. I was terrified and tried to film as much of it as I could as I was terrified of being accused of murdering her or something. at one point she was going to smash a mug on her head. if I called for help she would bite her tounge, This lasted from dinner until 6 in the morning. I eventually managed to call the police, who she took the phone off of me and lied to. and then threatened me again with the tounge biting if i didn't play along. I managed to mouth help me to police without her seeing and they separated us and she snapped out of it.

I collected MOST of my stuff, and my brother picked up me and took my home and Y was left with the police. This was the last time I have seen her in person. I found out she had been left on her own which I still do not understand, and she started sending me clearly suicidal messages which scared me, so I immediatly called the police again and the university to get to her. They found she has taken pills and alchohol and got her to the hospital. 

We talked a little after this but I wanted space from her. She clearly was shaken and genuinely seemed to be doing much better, and for the first time trying to get better herself instead of expecting me to fix her. She really seemed to be working hard. A few weeks passed and I still loved her at this point and was ready to shrug off that night as a breakdown from the start, as she had had a really rough week. We talked a little and talked about the idea of getting back together (which is lunacy for me to think after all this shit) and mid that conversation she decides to tell me she thinks shes still in love with this dude from before we dated (I had known about him in the past as someone she used to love, and that she had never actually had anything with) At this point I was done, it was just the same shit again. I was pissed and told her I didn't want to talk wiith her anymore. She was desperate, talking about how much she loves me and saying things like this, which I didn't respond to. She then tried to guilt trip me about not being in the hospital with her which really pissed me off and she knew when she wrote it it was a mistake, which was the only thing I had responded to here. 

This comes back to the part of I only collected most of my stuff, as I wanted a lot of it back, 5 weeks after not speaking with her I send her a message saying 'hope your okay, I was wondering if we could talk about getting my stuff back now covids not so bad. 

She never replies

okay I assume maybe she missed it as its a platform she could have easilly missed it on, so send it on instagram

still no reply

Today I sent another message the day after asking if we could talk about this. And she says she will mail it and asks if theres anything else I wanted to say. I said how she broke my heart with the stuff she said to me, and she responded by telling me how when she saw my message she froze up and paniced for an hour, and shes been doing really well since and has lots of friends now (when I knew her she had close to none) and was dating people (great...). She started telling me how she wants to tell me she hates me and that she basically blames me for everthing that happened and that im a terrifying thing in her head and how she almost died because of me and that shell never forgive me. how she remembers all the good things and it disgusts and terrifies her. And that I lied to her because I said id be there for her and stuff. And that when I had doubts I should have just left instead of trying to help her and be there for her.

I got really angry here. I didn't show it too hard but I kinda had a full on breakdown. I've always been there for her, always tried to support her and she acts like I was this asshole the whole time for trying to help her. I stormed out my house in the middle of the night in a rage I've never been in, full on screaming and raging for over an hour. My friends and my family I live with kept calling me but I was too angry to answer. I ended up walking about 4 miles until I had calmed down enough to answer my mums phone call and my dad found me. I'm not someone who ever gets angry. Like literally ever and I completley blew off the lid tonight. 

It sounds selfish but I just don't understand how she gets to be happy, and finally seems to be good with her mental health, and is dating again while I'm left as a depressed mess for the past 5 weeks, having panic attacks because of the trauma of that night. And just hearing that she was dating again broke me. I'm so angry at her and hurt and just sad and I just don't know how to be okay. I tried to help her, I spent so long trying to be there for her and doing what I can to make things better for her and it ends up like this. It just feels so unfair. I feel like I did everything I could. I'm more writing this out for me than anything. 

I just don't know how to be okay and move past this."

Even worse, I know that the job market is filled with people currently unemployed looking to go back to work or recent graduates with more experience than me trying to find work. So, I feel really bottom-tier right now haha. 

I am about to graduate with a degree in Industrial/Organizational Psychology aiming to go into consulting in the future. However, it took me a while to pick that concentration so I haven't made the most out of my college experience. I didn't join any clubs, never held a leadership position, never did an internship, and the last time I worked was three years ago when I was a Freshman in college doing random jobs. I've just been focusing on getting good grades every semester and enjoying my summer vacations in between. But now, it's all catching up to me.

Now that I'm about to graduate, I really want to begin my career but I feel like employers won't see my potential or my willingness to learn because truthfully, it doesn't look that way on my resume. Regardless, I know that I am a great student, got great grades, always got along with people, and learn really fast. I just feel like there isn't anyone willing to give me a chance to prove it. 

Currently, I'm applying to jobs this summer hoping to land an internship. Any internship. At this point, I could care less if it was paid or not. I have done a few interviews but they either never got back to me or told me they had to change the internship to next year due to the pandemic pushing their business flow back. 

All in all, I guess I'm hoping for some tips on how to seem employable? I know that I am but I understand that employers don't see it that way when they see my resume. I'm also trying to pick up some random skills that I see trending just to keep my mind busy. I'm delving into SEO Marketing, brushing up on Photoshop, and trying to get online certifications from accredited universities. Also, any words of advice or positivity would definitely help!"

Demographics: Asian female

GPA: 4.0 UW

SAT: 1490 (730 M and 760 R) planning to retake to 1550+ in Sept

Subject tests: 780 US History

PSAT: 1500

Course Rigor: 12 APs including full IB diploma, 19 total advanced classes on high school transcript, taking most rigorous schedule offered at my school

Intended major: Computer Science (became interested in majoring in CS recently hence the lack of many CS-related ECs)

ECs 

STEM:

* FTC Robotics: Part of the programming group in my team for 3 years. Team has won several awards each year at the regional and state level, including 1st in state in 2018
* taking free 8-week data programming and web development course this summer called STEM League, hope to do some personal coding projects too
* doing yearlong CS internship in senior year
* HOSA: 3 years participation, top 10 in state each year in nutrition, pathophysiology, and medical terminology, 5th in internationals for nutrition in 2018, qualified for internats again in 2020

Humanities:

* Speech and Debate: squad captain for a speech event since 11th grade (leadership position), qualified for state in 10th and 11th, 3 year participation
* Research project on Fidel Castro, as well as IB Extended Essay on the psychological aspects of obesity. Both involved substantial analysis of academic literature and consumed almost all of my 10th grade summer

Community Service

* attended a 2-week service trip in rural Ghana last summer to build toilets for a village, got in touch with a local nurse there and will be sewing 150 cloth pads this summer to donate to her clinic
* Animal Welfare Club: leadership position since 10th grade, will be president senior year, helped organize many fundraisers for animal shelters and organizations
* organized a fundraiser at my school that raised around $2000 for an environmentalism club, sold reusable water bottles as well about 70 bags and scrunchies that I sewed out of repurposed materials

LORS: one from my IB Physics HL teacher (will probably be good but not excellent, I participate in her class but my test scores are meh), other from my IB TOK teacher who had me for three years in high school (will probably be excellent because he's always praising me for how hardworking I am and told me that he and my psych teacher ""gossip"" about how I'm an outstanding student)

Essays: I'll try my best, won't make it cliche

I'm pretty flexible when it comes to geographic location, weather, school size, culture, etc. Ideally I want a school with a CS major that can give me some flexibility in coursework as although I want to major in CS I really like the social sciences too (particularly psych) and I'm not a super heavy STEM person. Ability to study abroad would be cool too but if not that's ok. Any recommendations would be highly appreciated!"

My first IT job(after sysadmin Intern) was BI Consulting(SAS 4GL, Oracle, Java app&amp;middleware, linux/unix/even solaris, bash). After 2 years I decided to change it to something a bit modern. I worked as Application Admin(Java stack, MS DB, Jenkins, Docker, Linux, bash, python) - 6 months (it was a short contract). Next - 1year as an Implementation Specialist(funny title)(a lot of Jenkins and Ansible, GitLab, Java stack, cers, keycloak, Nginx, Oracle, postgres, Linux, python, go, bash), after delivering the CI/CD for ETL system I decided to look for new changes. Now for 1y I'm working as IT Developer(Jenkins, Ansible, Linux, K8S, Docker, Groovy) - I'm responsible for Sheared Libs related to our platform and CI/CD stuff. Fortunately, the platform starting being stable, so my only work will be adding a new requirement from business to the existing code base, sometimes some fixies. Generally maintenance work. 

That was a short introduction :) So I have a problem because I never worked as a full-time programmer, \`DevOps\` or SRE. I have no commercial exp with clouds, exp with k8s is rather limited(PaSS), no expiration with monitoring(only Zabbix). I can't consider myself as a great programmer, I can solve the problems, but still no real experience. I have some GH projects, small blog, however, it's rather hobby/non-commercial-exp. I like CI/CD processes, coding, automation, but become \`DevOps\` require commercial clouds skills. Software Engineering requires at least 2y of \`only coding\` experience. 

What should I do now? I feel like a victim of my bed choices :) Change a job to junior devops/SE, until I don't have any children, and money isn't a priority. Maybe learn more at home and get some certs(not popular in my country)? Or just stay in my current company(a quite large bank) and climbing the ladder?"

Advice?",SilverSquare,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/hfjynu/i_do_digital_media_majored_in_video_editing_and/,"**TLDR**: I have experience in Digital Media (Video/Graphics) and Digital Marketing. I graduated two years ago, majoring in Broadcasting (Video Production/Editing). Took a Digital Marketing Apprenticeship for 5 months. I feel lost and have nothing to show for it on my resume.

I honestly need help and don’t know where to turn to. Lately, I’ve been feeling lost in my life in terms of my professional career. I currently reside in the SF Bay Area.

I’m into Digital Media (Video Editing, Graphic Design), Digital Marketing (Social Media, Paid Social), and Content Creation (Random YouTube Videos, Occasional Twitch Streamer.)

To give context, two years ago, I graduated in Broadcasting/Video Production with video editing as my main strength. In my senior year, I became a Marketing Coordinator for one of the college organizations where I helped design flyers, advertised events, and helped with community management of our members. 

I felt it was too late for me to double major or minor in Marketing, so I took an apprenticeship for Marketing and got a crash course in Digital Marketing where I got the run down on things like SEO, SEM, Paid Social, Organic Social, and other things. It felt like another semester of college in a good way, made some good friends out of it. Felt like my second chance.

2 years removed from college. 6 months removed from that apprenticeship. I feel like I’ve got nothing to show for it. It’s hard to find work even before COVID-19 took over. I regret not networking in my major. I regret not taking an internship in my senior year. With everyone gunning for a job now more than ever, it feels even more hopeless for me.

I don’t know what to do with my skill set. I feel like I haven’t progressed. I’m 27. No professional experience. I don’t know HOW to progress. It feels overwhelming. I feel like my windows of opportunity are closing. I’m scared of applying to jobs because I have anxiety of not having experience or taking more than I can handle. But I also don’t know where to find out how to even start grinding that experience. 

AI feel overwhelmed looking at job descriptions. I feel like with each passing day, my skills in production and digital marketing are fading away to the point where I feel like I don’t know if I can be confident enough to say I have those skills. Most internships I see only offer college credit. Looking at LinkedIn/Glassdoor/Indeed have me feeling hopeless. I don’t want to waste quarantine wallowing in self-pity. I need help finding some sort of direction...

1. What can I do with my relevant skills? (Video Editing, Graphic Design, Knowledge of Digital Marketing.)

2. How do I grind relevant experience in Digital Marketing like SEM, Paid Social, Social Media, etc. if I can’t find an entry level job? Especially since I didn’t major in it.

3. How does one find/grind relevant experience in Digital Media? As a video editor, it feels really hard to find work. How do I use this time in quarantine to prove that I have what it takes?

4. What else should I be looking for? A Career Coach? Other websites? Other resources? Etc. I feel completely lost. What questions should I be asking myself?"

EAE has just opened today and I am currently looking at two courses, NP's and NYP's cybersecurity course. I've heard about NYP being a great school for IT courses but ive also heard the same about NP. The distance frm my house doesn't affect me at all. I heard that both courses offer a nice course structure but i also heard that NYP has a lot more industry partners so itll benefit internships in year 3.

I have a slight bias towards NP after going there for many computing-related competitions and I generally enjoy their campus. I havent had the chance to explore NYP SIT after their open house so could I ask how's the place like? How are the facilities (specifically for IT courses) like in both polys?

And for those in either school who have EAE'd their way into the course, how was the experience like? What did you look out for in your write-ups?

hfmgxj,1,2020-06-25,I regret choosing my parents' happiness over mine.,r00t_bot,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/hfmgxj/i_regret_choosing_my_parents_happiness_over_mine/,"Might quite a read. But here we go.

I went abroad to study a 4 years back and since then have got my bachelor's degree. I did my internship in a fortune 500 company which is a big deal where I come from because my country is quite small, poor and under developed and opportunities as such are very rare. So I finished my degree with great grades and a good internship. I never wanted to move back home but it was my parent's wish for me to move back. 

So I started applying to jobs in both my home country and the country I was staying at. I got offers from both. From the country I was living at, the salaries were not really high and I would not save much. But back at home the salary is comparatively better and since I don't have to pay rent to live with my parents that money is considered saved. I told my parents I want to study for my postgrad. But I can't afford it if I don't save up. 

A few weeks went by and I had to narrow my offers to two basic choices. One was the company I did my internship in. A multi national fortune 500 company. The pay was decent but like I said I wouldn't have saved much. The other was one back at home. The salary which the company agreed was quite good and I could be off to my postgrad in 2 years with that salary. 

So I came back home since my parents want me home and also because it seemed that I can save more here and go for my master's sooner. When I got here the company I got the job from reduced my salary saying first I gotta go through probation. They never mentioned it before. The probationary period in my country is 3 months. I said fine since it wasn't going to make such a big difference if it was only 3 months. However, I'm in my 9th month right now and I'm still on probation getting the same shitty salary. 

The company completely uses me. They make a lot of money by selling my work because they have good contacts with the government. I have to work from morning till around 10pm at least for 10 days every month. Every time I have to go through that I keep resenting the choice I made. I can't go move back now since my parents won't let me. So I'm basically stuck in this dead end job until I can save enough money to go for my master's. Oh yes. I don't even save close to the amount I hoped for because the 'probationary' salary is so little it's close to minimum wage. I have tried searching for other jobs as well but during this covid situation, nobody in my country is hiring or at least giving a better salary than my current company is giving. 

I know my parents want the best for me and I know they realize they've made a mistake. But it's too late to go back on it now. I hate my life here and I regret the choice I made so much. I might not have saved much but I would definitely be happier I guess. And be more appreciated for my work. I just keep thinking what could've happened if I chose to stay. I'm out of options. I've no idea when I can leave this shit hole. I hate every minute of it."
hfmoxk,0,2020-06-25,Should you do a CS Masters Degree purely for money and job prospects (UK),LampToast,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/hfmoxk/should_you_do_a_cs_masters_degree_purely_for/,"Hello All,

I know the question ""should I get a master's degree"" has been discussed a lot in this and similar subreddits but I just wanted to ask about some more specific details I couldn't find when looking around.

I'm just about to go into my third year at university and I am currently on for a CS Master's course. Through my own experiences I have found I am not very fond of academia but I have not managed to get any internships and became concerned about my future prospects. I know this is not the best motivation but I was thinking a Master's degree could buy time to get a summer internship while also boosting qualifications which would in turn raise my chances when applying for jobs.

I have seen a lot of advice suggesting I don't go into a Master's degree purely for the monetary aspect or assuming it will definitely help my career if you don't like academia, but I can not ignore the fact that money and a good job is a big motivation for me.

Some extra context is that I am not entirely sure what sector of computer science I would like to go into and not entirely opposed to any field or experience.

My question is, in the UK is a Master's degree still significantly beneficial in terms of salary and ease of finding jobs and whether in this situation it would be wise to do the Master's degree in hopes of future prospects or try my luck when applying for jobs out of my third year, without the Master's qualification and without guarantee of an internship.

Thank you for anyone who takes the time to read this, it is my first post here and I hope that I didn't ask any silly questions and was clear enough with my wording."

No, two engineers discussed this in a nearby cube (not sure if they knew I could hear). This was two good engineers that I trust that were commiserating together. They were saying they hope he will be gone soon.

I am an EE intern at a large company, in one of the engineering departments. I get emails from corporate all the time about the high ethical standards of the company, and I haven't experienced or witnessed anything that doesn't align with that. However, I have heard some gossip in the office about one of the managers in a parallel group that has committed some heinous acts of violence against his reports. He held a knife to one guy's neck, burned another man, and ripped someone else's eyebrows out with duct tape. Horrifying stuff, I'd never want to see that or have it happen to me.

If I come back to this company after I graduate, I may end up working under this manager. The company is great, and I've wanted to work there for a long time. I have made friends with the engineers, and have had a wonderful mentor during my internship.

Is it worth the risk to go work for this company, seeing that they have a bad egg in a place of power? Is there anything else I should be weighing?"

I'm 22, live in Florida and ever since I was 17 I've felt completely lost in what I wanted to do and when I would finally take that first step. I've had a few things happen tome that made me feel like all my efforts have been for naught. I've had my old charter school lose my transcripts, lost my scholarships due to my mother being deported, had to move to another country when I was younger, moved out of my father's home at 19 to live with my best friend's family who graciously accepted me ended up being an incredibly toxic environment.

I won't go into any ridiculously long details regarding the above as thanks to my girlfriend I've managed to rebuild my relationships with my family, move on from my past, get my GED and move out of said friend's home while simultaneously removing my need for validation from strangers. Plainly put I'm ignorant. I knew nothing of colleges, taxes, financial aid, internships and never had my parents push me hard to succeed in school as they were content just to survive in the U.S being immigrants from a harsher country.

Now I've been looking both into trade schools and colleges attempting to decide on a career choice. it's frustrating with how overwhelming it can be and obviously the fear of making a decision and it backfiring into debt has always been what's kept me from even pushing myself. That being said...

I've always loved technology. Computers, video games, websites, smartphones, etc... My original dream was to be a game designer and unfortunately it's not a field that would support the lifestyle I'd like to live. I'd like to someday be so in tune with programming and development that I can potentially make games as a hobby :) I want a career that ultimately supports me when I'm not working as opposed to doing something I adore and barely making ends me.

I've been looking into doing a 4 year school for computer sciences and taking advantage of all the free resources available to me without tuition being attached. CS50, Codeacademy, multiple books on scripting, YouTube, etc as well as I've been looking into a trade school for cyber-security and information technologies.

An idea I also had was to become a trade electrician as one of my close friends has been doing it for a few years and is willing to teach me on the side. Use that time to make extra money and then begin attending college for said software development/computer science degree.

exposition aside.. What pathway would be the most realistic and one I could spend more time working on than triple checking to make sure it'd work? I'm sure that applies to absolutely anything you put your heart into. I don't have any financial support other than myself and I want to work my ass off. I heard going to a trade for cyber security can be scam as cyber security is something integrated into software development and not a stand alone degree like a bachelors and going to college is usually better for IT careers as opposed to a trade school

Would it be wise to work on as many certificates and gather an understanding of computer sciences alongside a college?

If I were to do a trade what are very stable trades I can do in the IT field that can help me secure a job in the IT department as I work on my education as well?

I know I love computers and I know my attitude towards anything is what's going to govern how I feel about anything. I'm lost as to what is generally considered a strong choice for someone who know's very little about CS and wants to make a career out of it. :) If there's any other sub reddits that can help to I'd appreciate any redirection and advice!!

1. Since I will not be completing an ECE major, I am going to miss out on the labs, what could I do on my own to make up for this? I saw that there are circuit simulations, is that the way to go?
2. Should my priority be in completing the master's degree and then getting an internship?  OR Should I find an internship while completing my degree?
3. I know this is not the standard route to getting a job as an engineer, any other advice for me in this situation?

I have worked at my present employer since 2015. Worked on site teir2, in the general helpdesk for 25+ companies and for the last year contracted on site for a dedicated team for a large production and research company.

We have seen in the past week hundreds of employees let go, or furloughed for short stints. Whole departments shuttered, all due to covid and the lock downs forcing businesses to shutter.

Contract got renewed with said company and I got offered ultimatum. Take a 4 day 10 hour shift working weekends instead of my weekday shift, have 3 days off during the week or be laid off as there is a hiring freeze from my main company and no one can go back there apparently. So of course I took the change in hours.

My issue is I have a coworker who repeatedly calls out, half asses his job. Doesn't reply to emails. Calls off sick for 2, 3 days at a time and nothing happens to him. Other employees have gotten canned for minor infractions, but he seems to get away with everything. 

We have company policy that says call off more than 2 days with in 6 month period  unexcused and it's written up next time termination. Yet he gets away with it at least a dozen time in the past 6 months. These were not scheduled. 

He gets an email from client for assistance and he just assigned it to himself letting it sit, so when he goes away from calling out the person will call in furious thsy nothing was done/they weren't contacted. 

Many of us has said something to management but they don't discipline him. He isn't some fresh out of school intern, guy is 32. He should know better.

I bring this up today, as I'm kinda pissed. My manager who knows I do great work gave me that ultimatum to work this shift by myself or take unemployment, yet why wasn't this shift offered to the fuck up dude or someone else. It almost feels like I am being punished for doing a good job and asshole gets rewarded.

Has anyone else here seen someone get away with being a crap employee while others are held to a different standard?"

How should I go about my job hunt if I need a job in manufacturing/quality engineering?",abhiram267,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/hfpmdq/ended_up_without_any_relevant_valuable_skills_and/,"First of all, sorry for the long post. I’ve been unemployed since December 2019, and I haven’t had any luck in the last few months on any of my applications. The last interview I gave was in January 2020. 

I did my bachelor’s in mechanical engineering from India and worked in a small company, which made hydraulic torque wrenches, for less than a year. I quit the job and moved to New York to pursue my master’s degree in mechanical engineering. Right after graduation I got an offer to work in a Quality Engineer role which sponsored H1B visa (which is the most important thing for any Indian to be working in the US). I took the job in this small company that provided professional support services. I was told during the interview that my role was going to be related to Quality Engineering. Very soon they had me recruiting for contracts they had in government sector. That’s when I realized this was staffing company. They bid on contracts mainly in Government/Defense sector and once they won the contracts, they had us engineers recruit people for those roles. By the time I realized what was going on they said they will sponsor my H1B visa. I was lucky to get picked the first time and I got my H1B visa approval. 

After I received my H1B visa I thought to myself now that I have my work visa it will be really easy to get another job in engineering (preferably manufacturing or quality). I started applying for more than a year but I never got calls from any opportunity in which they were ready to sponsor. So I continued working for this staffing company for almost 4 years. Then I found out Canada had opened their doors for immigration. I applied for Permanent Residency and I got my PR in a year. I made the toughest decision of my life of quitting the current job and moving to Canada without already having a job in Canada. Luckily, I’ve family here in Canada so I’m doing fine. 

But, because I spent more than 3.5 years in that company, I have gained absolutely zero engineering experience and now that’s hurting my job hunt. I have nothing to show. The company I worked for didn’t use any standard industry practices and the only thing I learned from working there was some MS excel shortcuts. Employers and recruiters see my profile as an intermediate/associate level candidate with master’s degree and expect a lot from me and when they realize I have nothing to show in terms of experience, I’m immediately thrown out.

I really want a job in engineering, and I believe I will be able to learn quick and I have the potential. All I want is to get my foot in the door. I don’t know how to go about it. Any manufacturing jobs require experience in manufacturing environment (or shop floor experience). Unfortunately, I don’t have any internships or thesis to show. I’m ready to take a step back and start from the beginning but I’m not sure I can explain this to recruiters. I really need some advice on what I can do."

hfqmtt,2,2020-06-25,Grief: Laptop died.,potatpomaster,pcmasterrace,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/hfqmtt/grief_laptop_died/,"Hey guys! 

I don't know if this post will get moderated or blocked or something because it might be inappropriate for the sub but as fellow pcmr I feel only you can understand what I feel right now.

Today after 2 years 11 months and 3 days my Helios 300 died. I was playing fortnite when suddenly the laptop switch off as if somebody had pulled the plugged on a pc everything off. I was only on for about 20 mins the charger plugged in battery around 90 per cent when I started fortnite.  I immediately tried CMOS reset, battery reset a different charger but nothing worked, no lights no fans. I opened it up there was nothing different. No shorts or burn marks on the board everything seemed to be in order. I immediately took it to a computer shop that diagnosed it to be a CPU and GPU failure. Quoting almost the entire price of the laptop for a motherboard replacement. I had to sit down because of shock And partly because I know I cannot afford to replace this and partly because this meant that my baby was actually dead and it's not coming back.

This was my first and only gaming device.  I'd never had any consoles, no handhelds. I've been a pc gamer since I was able 3 and was playing chips challenge and road rash on my dad's pentium 3. I live in India, there's no tolerance or acceptance for gaming as entertainment (atleast in my family, with my dad taking digs at me calling me deranged for even playing computer games to my mom hiding the power cables if I ever exceeded my 30mins of game time). I'd always played on whatever the family computer was at the time.  Yk typical family computer a couple of generations old with minimal GPUs. Playing everything from gta vc to csgo on my 8400gs finally in 2018 I had saved up enough to go out and buy a 1060 laptop. I was so happy when I saw the how smooth games ram and how beautiful they looked I could finally keep up with others when I played online, I could finally use my steam library. I made friends, conquered maps with them, went of raids, did missions for the lotus (Warframe reference for those who do) had memorable experiences and incredible moments. 

I feel deeply sad that after 18 years of struggling for 60fps after a mere 2 years it's over. I'm back to square one except there's no family computer to save me now. There's no going back. Now I'm back to being all alone. I know it's not the end of the world but I can't help it. I cannot accept that it's over.  It cannot be right? I worked so hard to get it. As I sit here looking at the pale green pcb of my laptop I only want to ask you guys, what now? How do I bring it back? How do I deal with this sadness? I feel worse than when I lost my pet I feel worse than when I got a rejected for my internship I feel bad like I've never had before and I can't seem to let it go. I don't know what to do.

Thank you for your time and patience.

hfqt1b,1,2020-06-25,Extend Internship or Go Back Home,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/hfqt1b/extend_internship_or_go_back_home/,"This is going to be a pretty lengthy post. **TL;DR: I'm trying to decide if it would be best if I extended my internship for 6 more months (January 2021) OR finish school back home and reapply back next year.**

Like it says in the TL;DR, my boss recently gave me an offer to extend my internship for 6 additional months. I currently work in California for a pretty big company. I love this internship. I love the people who work here. They have been like a second family to me and I want to stay. I really do because I don't think I'll get another opportunity like this ever again. I think my future is working in this company and growing my technical knowledge within this company. However, there are a lot of caveats extending this internship.

My boss told me that they're trying to bring people back in the office (in a limited capacity) so if I extended, they'll expect me to be on site to do some needed things. The problem is that the site is in California and ""home"" is in Arkansas. If you don't know where Arkansas is, it's a 30 hour drive (roughly), making the assumption you try to drive straight with no stops. It would be impractical for me to drive or even fly back and forth every few often. While I do enjoy working here at the company, I have no friends (besides my coworkers) or family here. It's been socially barren for me living here by myself for the past 4 months since quarantine. I haven't physically spoken to another human being for a long time. It's quite sad. And I won't lie; I am getting home-sick at this point. I want to go back home and see my parents, my family, my friends, my dog. And I haven't seen them in 7 months.

Staying here, especially in this type of environment, would be hard for me socially and probably financially too because I would have to find a new (and potentially more expensive) place to live since my lease ends next month. I think that's what a lot of my co-interns, especially the ones who are extending kinda can't connect with. Unlike everybody who's in my intern group, I traveled from, by far, the farthest. Everybody who works here lives either in California or Nevada or in places where it's a relatively easy drive back from site. Meanwhile, I live pretty much halfway across the whole country.

As for school, I know I can just delay my graduation but I think it would be impractical for me to do so because I'm at that point in my curriculum where I would just be taking a bunch of unnecessary courses and my course path would be so messed up just by delaying. I'm scraping the bottom of the barrel in my degree right now. Literally, most of my courses are electives just so I can meet the credits threshold for scholarships.

Now, at this point if you read all that, you may be wondering why I'm even considering staying in the first place. I did list a bunch of cons to staying and it does sound like an easy decision to make. But, like I said, even with COVID, this is still probably going to be the best I'll ever get with my career. I'm working at a pretty big company that does things that I'm interested in. What my boss told me is that the company is no longer hiring externally for now since the job market is kinda rocky right now. There are exceptions. He said that if I want to be hired after graduation, they would have to go through the normal hiring process and then get approval from upper management. So, assuming they're still in the state of not hiring externally next year, my best chance to get hired back would be to maintain contact with the employees there (which I do have) and just use my connections to get in. I like to bet that by next year the economy will get better and this company will start hiring externally again, but it's still just a bet.

And that's my situation. The only reason I'm making this is so I can get some thoughts on what you would do in this situation. The plan for me is still to go back home, graduate, and go back to work there next year. But I want to make sure that I'm not making a stupid decision and I'm just holding onto to a thread that, in the end, is not worth hanging onto. I'm just not sure on what the job market will be like next year. I would feel really bad if things don't get better and I end up in a position where I can't get hired."

Unlike many others who post here looking for guidance, I'm not a recent graduate. I’m in my early 30's with a family and an aging MBA degree. I currently work as an account manager for a manufacturing company where the scope of the work is quite large for a typical role of this nature due to the smallish size of the organization. It’s great because I get to wear many hats including sales, strategy, project management, operations, logistics, scheduling, financials, etc. I basically do everything from quote to cash except physically make the product. I’ve done this work for a number of years and it is a very involved role. The pay is good but it isn’t what I want to be doing for much longer. 


I had a brief stint teaching business at a high ranking international private school overseas for a while, and that was good fun, but I’m back in the same type of role now. For you Myers Briggs enthusiasts, I'm an ENFP – but definitely a little more on the reserved side than some of the other ENFPs out there. I’m a creative type with a mind for business. I’m a musician and love design, photography, video, etc. and I’m a big picture thinker that can still make data tell stories. I’m great at seeing patterns and making connections.


I've always had an interest in the intersection of human behavior and business, and I saw myself working in marketing since I was in high school. My undergrad was in marketing, and so was my internship, but when I graduated in the midst of the financial crisis I took the first job that came along, and it was not marketing. Continuing to stay out even after the rebound is on me and I take responsibility for that, so fast forward over a decade later…. I know the best time to plant a tree was 10 years ago, but the next best time to plant one is today.


Marketing is honestly where I should have gone all along but now I’m worried it might be too late for me. I expect to initially take a pay cut from where I am now, but I can’t afford to get into a marketing assistant type salary. Also, is my age an issue? Is there a way to get in with my experience – possibly as a project manager or account manager? Brand or product manager? I’d eventually (in due time, of course) set a goal for myself to move up to marketing manager and director level. My current employer does not have the need for any additional help in marketing, so an internal transition is unfortunately out of the question. 


I know experience outweighs education and I’m willing to put in the hard work, but I don’t know if I’m even qualified for the jobs mentioned above. I’m very much a beginner with Adobe and, other than my AM sales and operational experience, my education (MBA and a couple recent marketing certs), and the knowledge gleaned from heaps of business books read, I don’t have any other concrete skills aside from an insatiable desire to continuously be learning. 


Does anyone with experience in the field have any recommendations? Ideas, tracks to take, or cold hard truths? I just recently moved back to the US and my network in town isn't too strong at the moment. 


Any help from you wonderful folks would be greatly appreciated and, if you’ve managed to read this far, thank you so much! :)

I am an architecture major, but this summer I have been considering switching to computer science.  I chose architecture because I found it fascinating and meaningful but I have had second thoughts because of its relatively low pay, high unemployment rates, and limited scope of careers.  You also need to attend grad school and have years of work experience to become licensed, and the coursework is stressful and time consuming because pretty much every assignment is a project that is graded subjectively.  I was hoping it would be more technical and less design-oriented.

I think that computer science might be better suited to my abilities and goals.  I took the introductory computer science course last semester, and enjoyed programming a lot.  It seemed to come easier to me than it did to a lot of my classmates.  It was also a relief to be graded non-subjectively like I was in most architecture projects.  I have spent free time learning some more programming and have read a lot about the career.  It seems like an exciting career with a lot of potential in the future, and I am excited to see how it will continue to change the world.  I think cloud computing is a huge deal and would like to learn more about that.

My concerns are that by switching at this point I might be putting myself at a disadvantage.  Scheduling classes will be tricky, and I'd probably end up with a more intense course load for sophomore year, which might not be great for my GPA.  My freshman year GPA wasn't great to begin with and it seems like landing computer science internships is already very competitive for students who started freshman year.  I have heard that many CS graduates end up unemployed.  If it makes it any better, I have most of the general education and elective requirements out of the way.  Is it hard to get good grades in these classes, even with good time management skills?  My biggest concern is that I would fail computer science or end up switching without being able to switch back to architecture.

Thanks for reading, I look forward to reading your input :)

TL:DR - I am an architecture major, considering switching to computer science for my sophomore year.  Would it be hard to get good grades in CS courses with tough schedules and to land internships when starting this late?"

I lost my job.

I do NOT get along with my roommate. She causes me immense stress. 

My mom said that I can live with her and find work out there. However she is 2 hours away. This doesn't sound bad but let me explain.

Im pursing my Bachelor's in Psychology and I plan on going into Grad school at UCF. I want to volunteer, and intern in relevant places, but with COVID, it seems really difficult. I want to gain experience before I get into grad school to increase my chances of getting in.

I applied to volunteer as a Guardian Advocate but I haven't heard from the trainer yet, so I don't know how that's looking.

Orlando has a lot of opportunity, and by going back home, my opportunities decrease. 

Thankfully my classes this coming Fall will be online so I don't have to worry about that. 

The lease for my current place ends in 6 months but I cannot share a space with this woman anymore. I can also save 600 dollars or so by being with my mom since Im positive she won't charge me rent. But by Spring if things get better with this pandemic, then Id have to move back and find place to live again and that's just too much.

I want to work in IT part time while I'm at my university studying a double major for Computer Science and Physics. I'm going to have work, in general, while I'm in college to pay for my tuition, and money is nice to have for security reasons, so I thought since I got my CCNA RS in high school I could get into IT as a side job. I just graduated high school and I'm studying for my A+ cert while looking for a entry desk job currently. The reason why I want to do IT for the 6-8 years I'm in college because I believe I will have a better paying job compared to working at retail, I can use the experience from those jobs and help me build my resume to get internships relating to my field of study, and since I'm going into a CS major that IT experience gives me flexibility to change careers if I want or need to. But Internships or research projects that are related to my majors/field of study will get priority over IT jobs because I already have career that I'm ambitious about: I want to be a quantum physicists. I ideally want to do IT jobs while theirs no internships for my field available. I'm willing to put forth the effort so that I can get a decent paying IT job to support me through college, and I'm willing to adapt to jobs around me with XYZ certification required. But my studies and my main career will have a greater priority over me working in IT. Is it reasonable to think I can get $20 and up part time job working 20-25 hours a week with the necessary certs and one to two years experience at help desk or entry level IT job. If not what is the ball park I should expect. I know this depends a lot on the location and the current job environment but I guess I'm asking holistically about the likelihood of that happening. And I'm actually planning to move to different university in a year, so if you know of a location that could give me what I'm talking that would be appreciated. I'm just trying to figure out out if I'm way over my head and understand what's doable with the over saturated job market we're in regarding IT."

I am studying Computer Engineering. I have had one internship through put school so far as a Software Engineer and did not have a postive experience.

It was mainly application development with a touch of web interaction. I was on a team that developed custom tools through Autodesk's Revit api (Architectural modeling software). 

It really put a sour taste in my mouth for software. I found the work boring. I would like to stay on the software track, but centered around more physical/mathematical applications. 

Interested in simulation and modeling, along/paired with AI/learning algorithms. Robotic simulations, fluid flow, etc. Really just physics/mathematical simulations.


Is this type of work common for ce/cs? Ive seen research in these areas (a big one is two minute papers). But im not sure if that type of research is few and far between. And if in industry there is a great deal of that work.

Just want to make sure im not fooling myself in terms of opprotunities in software and this leads into mechanical cad and s&amp;m work.

I'm 24 year old and I live near Rotterdam, 
I only have a degree in Mechanical Engineering since 3 years ago, I continued with my Master in Mech E but then I decided to quit last year because I liked programming more. My graduate internship (3 years ago) was focused on programming in Unity, here I had to develop a VR game from scratch that will be used by a multinational big engineering company and I had to write a big assignment/research about it, that's how I got interested in programming during my Mech career. 
So I started getting into Game Development on my own, I self studied everything on my own, made my own small projects, finished 3 small mobile games in Unity (C#) (and failed some other projects ofcourse), constantly pushed myself to learn more about computer science in general so I dove deep into data structures/algorithms, OOP principles, time complexity, leetcode, cracking the coding interview, many different books about CS, nand2tetris project and the list goes on and on, basically everything an average CS student knows. Because I didn't want to specifically constrain myself in gamedev, I wanted to learn pretty much everything the average CS student knows, and I'm very happy with how far I am with my knowledge.

I didn't only focus on gamedev, I learned Javascript (easy to switch from C#) and developed some big custom discord bots on the side, a chrome extension for a browser game (my most successful small project, used by 50% of the playerbase), some small python scripts to automate some Blender workflows, started learning HTML/CSS/JS from Wes Bos's web dev courses. Currently working on a group project with some people I met on the internet (Open source web dev project using React, Strapi, Postgres).


**I started applying a month ago:** 

I feel I'm ready and that I now have to start learning by working in real world group projects so I start applying to game dev jobs because that is my main knowledge right now.

- Rejection 1: I applied to a junior position at a small company that develops small ''serious games'' for different industries, I looked over their portfolio and requirements and I meet all the requirements. I applied and their answer was that they'd prefer someone with a game development degree instead.

- Rejection 2: I saw a junior unity developer position that needed someone who has experience in VR development, I saw myself as a perfect fit to all their requirements mainly because I spent 20 weeks on a big VR project during my graduate internship and succeeded. I still got rejected because they found a better candidate (I really thought they'd accept me on this one because I was super confident about myself...)

- Rejection 3: I applied to a junior unity developer position for a small-mid company that develops various mobile games/apps for some big names in the Netherlands. I looked over their portfolio and in my mind I knew I would easily be able to make those games of that scale. I finally got a response and was sent a programming test. This was a fun test that tests your programming and design skills in Unity, I had to write every step of mine in a logbook and write a documentation on how the program works. I was super happy with the results and I mail them my project back. 
They tell me I have passed the test and that I'm invited to an interview, yay! I scored a 7,1 / 10 which to them was high compared to the average of 5,5 of all the applicants. The interview took 2-3 hours, they really liked me and told me they will invite me for a 2nd interview for contract negotiation and that they will mail me the date. 1,5 weeks pass and I ask them if they already have an update or now, they tell me they are very busy and will come back to me asap, another 1,5 weeks later (today) they tell me that they have chosen another person for the job.


Now here I am writing this. Game dev jobs in the Netherlands are scarce, the ones that are available are asking for 3+ years of C++ experience (which I am planning on learning after I get my first junior job). But I see there are more front-end, back-end, fullstack dev jobs. I'm thinking I should just forget about game dev and continue with web dev. But I don't have a portfolio of projects because I have never made a website with a domain from 0-100%. I do have knowledge and experience in HTML/CSS/JS, Jquery, node.js etc, currently working on a web dev project with React and a postgres database and Strapi for the backend. I've spent a good amount of time on learning all those technologies and the principles of web dev, I've just never got to making an actual hobby website to fill my portfolio.

What should I do? Should I just go all-in on learning web dev, doing freecodecamp, the odin project, finishing Wes Bos's courses and filling my portfolio? I feel bad ditching a couple years worth of game dev experience and starting over in a different field, jobless.
If I go the web dev route, how will I know if I'm ready to apply to web dev jobs?

I feel so lost I just don't know what to do anymore. If you want to see what my resumé looks like PM me and I will send it to you.

Thank you guys


**Edit:** I can't respond to all you guys so I just make an edit post here: Thank you all for the kind words, I didn't know this field was this hard to get into. So seeing that there are no game dev jobs anymore to apply via Indeed (seriously, it's all empty now) I will just focus on web dev from now on and start filling my portfolio. If anyone wants to follow my journey, I'd love to make some CS friends, pm me your discord tag or twitter name :)

Thank you all again!!!"

It also helps to add specific from the Interveiw to the body of the thank you.

Applied to hundreds of internships during a 3 co-op program. This by far made the most difference.

Bonus tip:

The one of the best Interveiw questions to ask your employer is: ""what can I do to be better prepared in the mean time, should I be hired?""

Also helps if you can hold a short conversation discussing some of the likely answers to this question.

Good luck peeps!"

In essence, I don't really have any business connections and my family has no background in business other than production. We came from a very poor village to the U.S. so we've spent along time just building the foundation for us to stay here. My dilemma is that while I am attending a top 10 university I'm finding it challenging to build my own foundation for the future with regards to a career.

I have 2 years working experience from the dinning Halls 1 of which I worked as a manager, and after about a year gap (in work not studies, I've been a full time student the entire time sometimes going as far as taking double loads in coursework). I landed an Internship as a Sales Associate where many of my duties extend to marketing and in a few cases managing the other sales associates.

I'm not too deep into my major coursework but my majors are Global Studies and Linguistics with Speech and technology emphasis, I am also working on getting a Technology Management certificate from the same university. My coursework for Global Studies is very interdisciplinary so I am taking advantage of that to study Management/organization, technology, and Marketing. My emphasis in linguistics isn't as flexible, but most of what I am currently studying or have studied correlates to what is explored there, I am using it as a back up major so to speak, so that I can develop some hard skills in a research field.

I am in place to graduate next year, but the thought of graduating into a recession is pretty unnerving for me considering my dilemma, to circumvent that a little I decided to extend my coursework a little and ""Study"" abroad for a year ( going to take electives that provide me with major credit) while doing internships in those countries. During this time I also plan to apply for graduate school although I haven't figured out the logistics for that yet (funding/programs to apply for).

After all of this, I just worry that I am overlooking something, I do not come from money by any means so all of this just feels like a gamble. I am plagued with the question of whether or not I am doing the right thing and if I really am prepared to enter a work environment that I've only really seen in movies or TV Shows. I want to know if I'm not and what I can do better."

I have 2 classes left before I'm done, which I can do either during the summer, or during the fall, however there's a few reasons I might choose to do at least one class in the fall and graduate later. 

First of all, I was registered to do my level 1 CFA exam in june, and because of COVID it was postponed to december. I was really banking on that helping me find a job right out of university, so I figure it might be better to graduate after having just done the exam, rather than graduate 4 months before, I think it would open more doors. 

The other reason is job availability. I'm not so sure hiring is the priority right now in this economy, and I could wait and hope that the situation is slightly better in December/January. 

Having worked part-time as an auditor/analyst at Deloitte and another auditing firm for about a year, but without any real internship experience, I'm looking to get any sort of advantage I can.

So, should I graduate in 6 weeks, with no CFA and in a bad job market? Or delay it 4 months, hopefully have my CFA Level 1 passed, and hopefully have more prospects?

I appreciate any advice"

I plan on taking a year off and applying by march for fall matriculation in 2021. I was in college for 5 years and the entire first half I was studying studio art and digital media before I finally transferred schools and switched to CS. The transition was obviously very tough but I made it through. The math courses are what really tripped me up and I ended up getting a bunch of C's because of them. I definitely improved during my last year (getting all A's and B's with one C) but my GPA is obviously low and I'm trying to figure out if it's worth applying considering my &lt;3.0 gpa. I've had a year-long internship and coop at a very large and well-known tech company and I am beginning full-time work soon at a very well-known bank as a software developer. 

I really enjoy CS and I recently found out that my employer will pay off most of my tuition so I think this is a golden opportunity while I am still young and have time on my hands. 

What should I do over the next few months in order to improve my application considering the low gpa? Would repeating one of my math classes and getting a better grade be the best thing to do?(Would probably bump my gpa to a 2.91 if it got an A). or should I focus on things like MOOCS or other things?

I also really want to move out of my house where I am living with my family, and to do so I would need a job to support myself.

Just wanted to see if there have been any people who have decided to switch out of a stable career into IT.

I have been a Secondary Maths teacher for 7 years in Australia, and have found that there is overwhelming pressures within the job that I will soon not be able to take anymore. I enjoy the interactions with students, however all the extra administrative work makes this job incredibly overwhelming. Thankfully I'm in a position where I can consider a career change (no kids...yet...but I am in my late 20s)

I have seen a few online courses such as a Master's of IT or a Master's of Cyber Security, which I am willing to put the hard work to complete.

I have heard that a job in IT will most likely begin in helpdesk, which again I am willing to start at (provided there is room to grow).

I guess questions are:
1. What was it like moving from another career into IT? In terms of starting from the bottom, salary, learning a new skill from scratch etc
2. Did you all start on helpdesk? Has anyone here not started on helpdesk and perhaps moved onto did something related to the skills learned in the degree?
3. Has anyone here done a Master's in IT (and how important would IBL or an internship be?)

Any insights would be great!

I don't use it frequently, but I feel like I need to or I'm going to hurt opportunities I have. I have the ability to land interviews with great companies and I'm already at a decent one for my internship and may mess up a returning full time offer. 


Being moved virtually had definitely hurt my mental health by raising my anxiety. It's draining my energy and I'm losing focus as a result. Little things get to me just so much more and my living situations and plans being compromised have brought so much stress. I had to take a half day yesterday and today I can barely pay attention. 


I believe this problem is short term because everything being online and may last until the end of the year. Should take Adderall and just do what it takes to be my best? Deal with adjusting off of it later? I tried online therapy and it doesn't reach me. I tried a routine but I cannot stick to it. My will power that once let me do stuff for 6-7 hours at a time has evaded me and I feel depleted. I don't have the strongest support system. I don't want to mess up everything I've worked for.

**EDIT:** It feels like a little more than burnout and I'm going to try to get on Wellbutrin. I honestly don't take care of myself well right now- showering, eating right, exercise and I think a boost will help me get in a routine that sets me up to succeed. Definitely going to try and get more + better sleep and time away from screens. It's been a stressful time but it's comforting to read these responses and know I'm not the only one. Hopefully my focus returns after trying these things. Thank you for helping!"

Hey guys, here to seek some help from y'all. 

MY HISTORY:

I'm (a 19year old) a first year (almost ended) engineering student in a tier 2 city (my hometown) in a tier 3 government college. My exams and college are a mess and barely happen on time and delay results always. I stayed back here because of certain family reasons (I'm financially well off so that's not an issue). I've been a fairly bright STEM student throughout school and competitive exams but college is going pretty bad because of the bad environment and some mistakes I made. Because I don't have a complied first year score so lateral entry to a better college isn't a possiblity. (Possibly depressed(in therapy) and little to nil social life, kinda supportive family and a great long distance boyfriend). 

I've taken up 2 training and internship courses (Machine Learning and Data Science) since January and my aim is to get a great Computer science job in India itself (Rs. 12LPA+ ) by 2023. I've been an decent performer at both these courses. A good CSE job is really really really really my top priority right now.

I didn't even know what a VPN was about a year ago and had average to poor knowledge of coding/tech. I studied the basics of programming in C++ in school though. 

I'm still a noob and have a LONNNNNG way to go and I'm genuinely up for the fight and all it takes but it feels like I'm never going to make it because of my lack of college resources and the overwhelming competition theses jobs have. I've till about 2023 to prepare myself. 


TL;DR/MY QUESTION: 

Any strategy/plan/keypoints to get an off campus placements (Salary: Rs. 12LPA+) in India in 2023, considering that I've a non conducive college, barely any contacts in the field and hardly any help from the engineering college I'm in?"

I worked for 6.5 hours a day and three days a week. I was paid $200 for each week, so $400 total. I calculated my hourly pay and it comes out to be about $10.25 an hour, which is below $14.00 an hour and I'm pretty sure that's the minimum wage.

I was paid through CashApp and nothing in the paperwork I signed said taxes would be taken out of my pay. Also, I don't think I'll be making enough this year to need to file a tax return, so I don't see why taxes would be taken out of my pay. Even if taxes were taken out of my pay, surely it wouldn't have been so much? If I was paid $14.00 an hour I would have gotten $546, and $400 is about 27% that amount, so surely I wouldn't be taxed at 27% if I'm making so little?

Can interns or part-time workers be paid below the minimum wage in DC or did I get shafted?"

I am working at a Fortune 500 company this summer as an intern in a data analytics role.

For starters, I don’t feel smart enough to be working at such a big company in this type of role.

They hired me, and I’m fearful that they feel like they made a mistake. Like, I’m not spectacular enough, or I’m not catching onto things as quickly as I should be. 

My assignments so far:

I have been asked to create a dashboard for the department, as well as create a presentation deck for a project that is going to be introduced to some clients soon.

I have gotten told that I’m doing well, I’ve been given good feedback on where to improve on these assignments, as well as feedback on what they like about my work, etc.

So, I take their feedback and I apply it to improving my assignments and I feel like I am not doing any better. 

I am eager to set up meetings with my bosses every time I tweak these assignments, per their feedback. I want to know if I’m doing better ASAP. Lol. I want to be talking about these things with my bosses all the time so that I can just know if I am doing better.

Because of COVID, my internship is remote, so if I want to talk to my bosses and get feedback, I have to schedule a zoom meeting. I don’t want to annoy them and take up time by constantly trying to Zoom with them to talk about little edits I’ve made to my PowerPoint, or to ask if my PivotCharts are okay... 

I am wondering how often I should be scheduling times to meet to go over my new phase of improvements/changes? 

How do I get continuous or timely feedback without being annoying?

Also, how do I get over not feeling good enough? I feel like they are just being nice to me because I’m their intern, but that they don’t actually like me :( imposter syndrome is a BEECH."

It was almost office closing hours. I wanted to wrap up the rest of my work before leaving. 

As I was reading, I overheard voices outside, 
""She has been inside the office the whole day!""
""What?!""
It hit me that I realise the person they are talking about me. My heart ached when I thought about the words.

For the rest of my college life, I have been quite an introvert. I went through dramas, friendship losses, etc. I couldn't bring myself to trust another person or get close to them. 

I am in my final year- doing internship-and those very words reminded me how 'isolated' I was. I didn't dare to talk with my colleagues. One of them doesn't seems to talk to me often. She would avoid eye contact with me and conversed with the other colleague. It hurts me when I see the pair grew closer. I stayed in the office for the full day, occasionally going to toilets, avoid them. I didn't want to see the disdain on one of their faces. 

But hearing them saying how coped up I am, it affects me. I hate that helplessness inside. I can't stop people's mouths from opening. 

I do want to talk with them yet I didn't want to interfere their conversation. Hence, I was told that I was quiet. 

I heard how people perceive me at first without knowing me. I can hold a casual one to one2 conversation. It's hard to keep a group conversation. It's even difficult when I can't speak with one of my colleagues. 

Any advice for a college intern..."

My main question is whether the plan below looks solid or what else I should do. I have not taken any sort of proper Data-Structures and started programming in college so I feel like I have a large ways to go. I am willing, however, to study 6-10 hours a day with focus

I have finished my first year CS at UIUC and studied up to basics of Java and programming studios which included projects like Tic-Tac-Toe, Snake game, Naive Bayes classifier for digits along with discrete math class.

I am now studying for coding interviews upcoming. I interviewed at Facebook last year but utterly flopped in my first round but got strong feedback from my recruiter that I'd be able to try again this year so I am practicing with Facebook as my target.

**My current plans are:**

1. Finish the ""Data Structures and Algorithms: Deep Dive Using Java"" course on Udemy which explains Sort and Search Algos, Lists, Stacks, Queues, Hash, Trees, and Heaps
2. Complete the ""CodeRust: Hacking the Coding Interview"" which gives what I believe to be the most common questions to the above topics like reverse a linkest list or Implement stack using queues
3. Practice Leetcode and Cracking the Coding Interview book questions.

**I have some questions about the above:**

* Should I switch to python instead? If so at what point.
* I have heard about the Udacity Nanodegree for DS &amp; A. Considering it is free for a month and is roughly 150 hours to complete, I should be able to complete it for free. Is this a better option than the learning plan above?
* Are there any other resources I should consider?"

Throughout my first year(with summer), the CS courses/ projects I did were quite difficult.

I'll be taking data structures next semester, and Object Oriented Programming the semester after that, and I'm super scared because of how difficult these courses are. I'm not planning or thinking of giving up because I already spent a year learning this and my parents will definitely not even let me do that but the stress this degree is giving me is a lot. From not knowing how to code, to learning how to code in two programming languages, to worrying about creating a side project and creating a resume to worrying about getting an internship...

I wanted your recommendations and opinions on where I should go from here. I enjoy networks and cyber security but I do not have a clear direction so I was hoping you guys might be able to guide me.

Weirdly, I got a job as a Data Scientist for a new startup. Yes, a big luck. I was given a chance to study on my own for the past two months. My workload is very slow. I mainly do database management and research for the company (usually related to marketing, AI, Machine Learning, Data Science). However, I still have a feeling I might need a master to land a better job in the country.

hgrjyv,1,2020-06-27,Need some advice about future,SportLower,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/hgrjyv/need_some_advice_about_future/,"Hello people! I'm in desperate need of some advice. I've asked my parents, my siblings and my friends, and while they did give me some insightful advice, I am still undecided.

Basically, I live in Austria and I am 16 years old, turning 17 next month in July. I finished 10th grade last year around this time, and there is this law here that everyone under the age of 18 HAS to do something, whether that is going to school or doing an apprenticeship. I moved here five years ago, and while I have improved in my last year of school, most of the schools here look at all your grades, and my middle-school grades are pretty bad because I was an idiot and because I also had trouble with german. So since I could not get into the school I wanted, I had to register myself at the Public Employment Service (going to call it PME from now on) and look for an apprenticeship. They basically ask you about your interests and what job you would like and then send you said jobs to your email (if you fit the criteria). You also get a person which you can call at anytime if you have any questions, and you meet up with said person around every 2-3~ weeks, where she just asks you questions and tells you about things which might help. At the time I wanted to do an apprenticeship as an IT-Technician even though the chances were pretty slim I would actually land a job because a) my middle school grades, b) there are really not a lot of apprenticeships and c) they like people who quit a tech-school midway because then they have some experience with coding and don't have to start from zero. I have been invited to some tests and even to three interviews but had no luck.

At one of the meetings, said person who you can talk to suggested I roll in a 10-week long course where I would basically learn everything that comes with job-hunting (CVs, talking on the phone, how to behave at an interview and so on and so forth). She also told me I would get paid for it. I took the chance because I thought it would be better to do something instead of sitting at home all day, and as a bonus I would get paid too. Little did I know it was a mistake. The first week was great, I learnt a lot of things, they pointed out the mistakes on my CV and corrected it and I found it really informative, The next 9 weeks though were hell, we would basically sit 7 hours in a PC-Room and our ""coach"" would tell us to look for jobs and send our CVs. Thing is, there are only so many jobs and while a new one pops up every week or two, we basically had to sit in front of a laptop wait for time to pass. First 10 weeks I found nothing, but I had to chance to go for 10 more weeks (they give this chance to people they thought did their best to look for a job but didnt have any luck) and I accepted, because they told me I had the chance to start an apprenticeship through them (basically paid by them) and I just had to find a company I would work at. So I was basically working for free for said company, they just had to teach me. (I also never ever want to do this course again)

At this point, I decided that I wanted to try my hand at studying and go to university to study law, but to do that I need a certificate for which I need to study then do tests every around 6~ months from German, English, Maths and the job I chose. I can do this certificate for free only if I am doing an apprenticeship (then it gets paid by the country). Only other way I can do it is if I pay for a lessons, textbooks and everything else separately. First price I found after a quick google search (for the lessons, textbooks not included) is 3000E for a year or 1590E every 6 months (which I have to pay up-front). I can't afford that and my parents don't want to pay for it if they know I can get it for free.

At this point I decided to look for other jobs too and I found a company which offered me the chance to work for them paid by the course I was in, and then later on (in a few months) they would let me sign with them and be an official employee of that company. This was last year in November. I had the chance to do four or five 3-day internships for them (even did one last week before christmas) and then I had to wait until the 27th of January to actually start working for them. (this was already a bad sign but at that point I did not care because I was just happy I could finally start). 

I started working and I was really happy that I was not jobless anymore, my colleagues were nice and I liked the job too. The company told me I would 100% sign with them on the 27th of April (so basically 3 months from when I started) and that made me even happier. I worked overtime (even though I am not allowed to) and even went in on a Saturday (basically worked 48 hours) because I thought the boss was happy with how I worked and that's why I was getting signed. I worked from the end of January to around the first or second week of march before Corona hit and I stayed home until May.

When May came everything changed. For the first three weeks, we had no break at all. We worked 8 hours without stopping everyday, and since I didn't sign with them on the 27th of April I went to my boss and asked when to reschedule. He told me he is going to talk with the higher-ups and then get back to me, and that he did. A few days later he told me how he thinks I am not doing enough for the job, how I am not good enough and I have to improve if I want to sign with them. He also told my colleague to assign me more work (we talk a lot with each other because I mainly work with him and we're also both from the same home-country) and he told me he has nothing to assign me because I already do everything I actually learned and CAN do. My boss also told me to annoy my co-workers and constantly keep asking them to teach me new things but we are 7 people (me included) in a huge warehouse and nobody ever has time to actually teach me anything whenever I ask them (my boss has taught me nothing, everything I learned was from my colleague before). My boss also frequently just goes to the wait-room and drinks coffee whenever one of his friends visits (it doesn't matter if we have a lot of work or not) and then gets annoyed at us because ""we are not fast enough"" and ""we are not giving it our 100%"". 

The negative just kept piling up and at one point I called my ""coach"" and told him that I want to talk to him about the job. I told him everything, and he said he was going to call my boss and then he was going to make an appointment where he would personally come to the company and we would sit down together (me, my coach and my boss) and talk about how I feel. We had said discussion and he basically admitted to what he was doing and nothing useful happened (it's what I thought but my coach thought that everything is cleared up and fine now). My boss told me I could sign with them on the first of July and then have a three-month term where I have to prove myself. I had a week to decide if I want to start or not, and this week on thursday I said yes but I am not sure if I really do.

I don't want to be jobless again however I feel pressured by my parents (especially my mother because my dad has been jobless for more than a year and doesn't want me turn out like he did) but I don't want to work somewhere where I would work for ten hours everyday, not be able to take a vacation, and basically just don't feel good in the company. 

Here I am now and I just got a call from the office if I can sign on monday (one of my parents has to come with me because I am underage) and I said yes however I don't know what I should do. There are a lot of things wrong with the company and I honestly feel it is a toxic environment and I would not feel good working there, but everyone is telling me to suck it up and work there and look for something else in-between however I would basically have 0 free time. Also, to do said certificate I mentioned before I would have to go to a school (don't know which one yet) AFTER work (so basically go study after ten hours of work and then do the same thing the next day). I also need 30 minutes by bus to get to my workplace (and back), and while my parents can come get me once in a while, gas costs money too.

I really feel like I should not sign however I feel bad for my mom and for all the work people put in for me (office lady writing up the contract, coach coming to talk to my boss and always being there if I had trouble) and I feel like I would just fuck them over right now. I also feel bad for my colleagues because another person would help them for sure (the company doesn't want to employ other people because ""they have no money"" even though they made 6,7 milliard euro in sales last year) and there is just too much work for the little people we have.

This might sound like a pity-post or as if I would be looking for someone to tell me I shouldn't sign, and it is probably that way but I really don't know what to do. I have horrible back pain, my feet hurt even though I changed shoes three times and everything sucks right now. Please give me advice on what I should do.

Thank you for everyone who takes my time to even read my post, it took me a bit of confidence to share it online but I thought I have nothing to lose anyways and should just post it."
hgrth4,1,2020-06-27,Need advice on what to do.,SportLower,LifeAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/hgrth4/need_advice_on_what_to_do/,"Hello people! I'm in desperate need of some advice. I've asked my parents, my siblings and my friends, and while they did give me some insightful advice, I am still undecided.

Basically, I live in Austria and I am 16 years old, turning 17 next month in July. I finished 10th grade last year around this time, and there is this law here that everyone under the age of 18 HAS to do something, whether that is going to school or doing an apprenticeship. I moved here five years ago, and while I have improved in my last year of school, most of the schools here look at all your grades, and my middle-school grades are pretty bad because I was an idiot and because I also had trouble with german. So since I could not get into the school I wanted, I had to register myself at the Public Employment Service (going to call it PME from now on) and look for an apprenticeship. They basically ask you about your interests and what job you would like and then send you said jobs to your email (if you fit the criteria). You also get a person which you can call at anytime if you have any questions, and you meet up with said person around every 2-3~ weeks, where she just asks you questions and tells you about things which might help. At the time I wanted to do an apprenticeship as an IT-Technician even though the chances were pretty slim I would actually land a job because a) my middle school grades, b) there are really not a lot of apprenticeships and c) they like people who quit a tech-school midway because then they have some experience with coding and don't have to start from zero. I have been invited to some tests and even to three interviews but had no luck.

At one of the meetings, said person who you can talk to suggested I roll in a 10-week long course where I would basically learn everything that comes with job-hunting (CVs, talking on the phone, how to behave at an interview and so on and so forth). She also told me I would get paid for it. I took the chance because I thought it would be better to do something instead of sitting at home all day, and as a bonus I would get paid too. Little did I know it was a mistake. The first week was great, I learnt a lot of things, they pointed out the mistakes on my CV and corrected it and I found it really informative, The next 9 weeks though were hell, we would basically sit 7 hours in a PC-Room and our ""coach"" would tell us to look for jobs and send our CVs. Thing is, there are only so many jobs and while a new one pops up every week or two, we basically had to sit in front of a laptop wait for time to pass. First 10 weeks I found nothing, but I had to chance to go for 10 more weeks (they give this chance to people they thought did their best to look for a job but didnt have any luck) and I accepted, because they told me I had the chance to start an apprenticeship through them (basically paid by them) and I just had to find a company I would work at. So I was basically working for free for said company, they just had to teach me. (I also never ever want to do this course again)

At this point, I decided that I wanted to try my hand at studying and go to university to study law, but to do that I need a certificate for which I need to study then do tests every around 6~ months from German, English, Maths and the job I chose. I can do this certificate for free only if I am doing an apprenticeship (then it gets paid by the country). Only other way I can do it is if I pay for a lessons, textbooks and everything else separately. First price I found after a quick google search (for the lessons, textbooks not included) is 3000E for a year or 1590E every 6 months (which I have to pay up-front). I can't afford that and my parents don't want to pay for it if they know I can get it for free.

At this point I decided to look for other jobs too and I found a company which offered me the chance to work for them paid by the course I was in, and then later on (in a few months) they would let me sign with them and be an official employee of that company. This was last year in November. I had the chance to do four or five 3-day internships for them (even did one last week before christmas) and then I had to wait until the 27th of January to actually start working for them. (this was already a bad sign but at that point I did not care because I was just happy I could finally start). 

I started working and I was really happy that I was not jobless anymore, my colleagues were nice and I liked the job too. The company told me I would 100% sign with them on the 27th of April (so basically 3 months from when I started) and that made me even happier. I worked overtime (even though I am not allowed to) and even went in on a Saturday (basically worked 48 hours) because I thought the boss was happy with how I worked and that's why I was getting signed. I worked from the end of January to around the first or second week of march before Corona hit and I stayed home until May.

When May came everything changed. For the first three weeks, we had no break at all. We worked 8 hours without stopping everyday, and since I didn't sign with them on the 27th of April I went to my boss and asked when to reschedule. He told me he is going to talk with the higher-ups and then get back to me, and that he did. A few days later he told me how he thinks I am not doing enough for the job, how I am not good enough and I have to improve if I want to sign with them. He also told my colleague to assign me more work (we talk a lot with each other because I mainly work with him and we're also both from the same home-country) and he told me he has nothing to assign me because I already do everything I actually learned and CAN do. My boss also told me to annoy my co-workers and constantly keep asking them to teach me new things but we are 7 people (me included) in a huge warehouse and nobody ever has time to actually teach me anything whenever I ask them (my boss has taught me nothing, everything I learned was from my colleague before). My boss also frequently just goes to the wait-room and drinks coffee whenever one of his friends visits (it doesn't matter if we have a lot of work or not) and then gets annoyed at us because ""we are not fast enough"" and ""we are not giving it our 100%"". 

The negative just kept piling up and at one point I called my ""coach"" and told him that I want to talk to him about the job. I told him everything, and he said he was going to call my boss and then he was going to make an appointment where he would personally come to the company and we would sit down together (me, my coach and my boss) and talk about how I feel. We had said discussion and he basically admitted to what he was doing and nothing useful happened (it's what I thought but my coach thought that everything is cleared up and fine now). My boss told me I could sign with them on the first of July and then have a three-month term where I have to prove myself. I had a week to decide if I want to start or not, and this week on thursday I said yes but I am not sure if I really do.

I don't want to be jobless again however I feel pressured by my parents (especially my mother because my dad has been jobless for more than a year and doesn't want me turn out like he did) but I don't want to work somewhere where I would work for ten hours everyday, not be able to take a vacation, and basically just don't feel good in the company.

Also saw internships come by while looking and I noticed that a lot of them want you to be currently enrolled in a university degree and claim that the internship is fulltime. 

How does this work in practice for people that have done a similar internship? Are you actually working and studying fulltime (or maybe choosing specific courses in specific periods just to distribute load, in which case you're probably missing out on preferred subjects)?"

Is there a similar limit for internships, forcing students to only apply once they feel their chances are high ( or can you just fail the interview a few times and still get an interview in your fourth year again?)

I'm reading that you should just apply to everywhere all the time and ignore rejections.

As well, I realize that FAANG internships are going to be fairly standard technical questions.

I was curious to know how difficult the technical interviews were for Shopify, ibm, or the banks ( for those of you who have some experience in this domain)."
hgtc39,4,2020-06-27,Would game dev be a good way to learn programming?,LoneTroll,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/hgtc39/would_game_dev_be_a_good_way_to_learn_programming/,"So as my title states I was wondering if game dev be a good way to learn programming.

I'm asking this because I'm almost graduating with a diploma in IT networking which also involves a bit of programming (bash, powershell...)

I recently did an internship that also involved a bit of programming, mostly powershell.

During my interniship I had to write 2 scripts (I had to work with CSV files, extract data from them or combine them and so on..) I was really struggling to make progress and wasn't really programming ""the right way"". I realized that the tasks weren't particularly difficult tasks but I took almost 2 weeks to complete them while someone else would have solved the scripts in 2 days, maybe even 1.

I have always struggled with programming, never really got the grasp of it. I understand what the assignment is most of the time but I never know how to start or what to use. It's like I have all the ingredients to cook something but I don't have the recipe so I don't know what to use or when to use it. (if that makes any sense?)

I always wished that someday I'm gonna get that ""click"" in my head and that I will get good at programming but unfortunately it hasn't happened yet.

So back to my question, I really like games and looked in game dev for a bit and found the game engine Godot and I really liked it, I followed and did the tutorial [Your First Game](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/your_first_game.html), and I must say that I liked it and it seemed fairly ""easy"", I must admit that I only copy pasted stuff though...

I lurked this subreddit a few times and read a few posts from people in the same situation as me, struggling with programming. I also read other posts about the best way to learn programming (video tutorials, books, freecodecamp, projects and so on).

I think for me the best way to learn is to find a project and complete it, that's why I think that a small 2D platformer game might be a good way to learn.

Would using Godot be a good way to learn programming? I know that Godot uses its own language GDScript, would Unity be a better option which uses a popular language (c#)?

Would like to get some advice from you guys, I'm also open to hear suggestions.

Thanks in advance!"

I'm meeting with my manager soon to set goals for my internship. It's a rather short one--about 5 weeks because of COVID.

He said once I step through the codebase and get a better understanding of the project, we'll set goals together based on what I feel I can achieve, and what the team needs.

With my personal projects, I tend to set very ambitious goals and don't end up achieving them. How do I prevent this from happening here? I want to set high goals because that's just my personality, but I absolutely need a return offer.

This is my first internship so I'm a little lost; any help would be greatly appreciated.

My dilemma is that I'm worried that requesting a temporary leave of absence to work at another company for the internship ould negatively impact the job that I currently have. I recently transferred to my current branch and it was agreed that I would work more hours during the week as they have a couple older staff members. So while I plan to resume the part-time bank job after my internship, I am worried that I would be replaced by someone else. I think I am pretty capable at my job but I often get quite anxious or nervous around my managers, so I'm not sure how much they value me as an employee. We do have regular one-on-one coaching with our managers where we can ask anything, but I'm not sure how to broach this topic. I don't want to let go of what I currently have and end up with nothing in the end, if that makes sense.

I'm concerned that my GPA after graduating will be too low to get into any prestigious Masters/PhD program for something as competitive as deep learning. Currently I'm at a 3.3 GPA and if I put full effort into my coursework I can expect to be at a 3.6 GPA by the time I graduate (August 2023).

I'm primarily concerned about:

1. Whether I need a graduate degree from a top US school in order to get research positions at big name tech companies like Google/Microsoft/etc.
2. Whether my GPA allows me to reasonably expect to get into a US school that satisfies criteria #1.

I currently hypothesize that my low GPA is due to a lack of interest in the topics covered in university, because I'm really good at (and have put a lot of research and effort into) full stack engineering, systems design, and other practical skills that I don't learn in school but end up using during internships. So I'm pretty sure that if I set aside a few months to study I can get a near-perfect score on GRE or subject tests. I'm also fairly confident that if I work on networking I could get involved in a few deep learning research projects with profs at my school and some referrals. 

It's mainly a gpa concern at this point, because my next best alternative is likely to take a software engineering career right out of undergraduate."

Tagline: IMPORTANT: Correction Email Regarding UCI Class Structure for Fall 2020

Dear Incoming Graduate Students,

First of all, I’d like to welcome you to UCI! Congratulations on your acceptance and your choice to come to UCI. Next, I want to offer you a sincere apology. We thought we had been sending you regular messages, updating you on the status of life here at UCI, and we recently learned that our software was misconfigured, and none of you were getting any of them! On the plus side, things change so fast in the COVID world, that we can now give you the latest information without the burden of any past confusion.

Speaking of confusion, it appears that some of you recently received an email from Vice Provost Michael Dennin indicating fall courses will be online. Please note that he was only referring to undergraduate courses. Graduate courses tend to be much smaller, and graduate students who live on campus live in very different housing than undergraduates.
So, what can you expect for fall?

Coursework: Approximately 30-40% of graduate courses in the fall will be offered in-person. The Registrar’s office is still in the process of updating its course catalogue for the new academic year, and we will let you know when that is updated and where you can go to see it. For those who may be unable to attend class in-person due to your own health challenges, inability to enter the country, and so on, faculty are committed to providing you a way to complete your coursework. Please work with your graduate program directors on your particular needs.

Other Activities on Campus: Graduate School is about so much more than coursework. You may have internships, networking, research, and other scholarly work as well as engage in clubs and other UCI organizations. Despite the impacts we have experienced, these activities are continuing. We switched all activities to virtual in March and beginning June 8 have launched a phased in-person restart to the rest. This includes a wide variety of things like the library, research labs, entrepreneurial resources, cultural and racial affinity groups, our recreation center for your own exercise, and our sports if you want to watch others exercise. UCI has a universal face covering policy, significant deployment of hand sanitizer and new cleaning regimens, as well as limited access to stairwells, elevators, and rooms. We will respond as a campus as the public health issues change, and we will keep you as informed as we are able.

Housing: Graduate students with housing guarantees are being offered leases now. If you are unable to make it to campus due to COVID or visa-related challenges, please work with housing to decline your spot. You will retain your guarantee. If you would prefer not to move in but are otherwise able you will not necessarily be able to retain your guarantee. Students without guarantees are on waitlists, and we need to move to provide them housing opportunities as well. You may also be asked to be sequestered in your apartment for a period upon arrival to campus. The protocols here are still being put in place. Please work with housing on your move in date and needs. Please visit housing.uci.edu or email housing@uci.edu for more information.
What if I have more questions?

In general, your graduate program advisor—usually a faculty member in your new department—is the best first person to go to with questions. Should have any for us centrally, though, please don’t be shy. You can email grad@uci.edu anytime for questions about life once you are here and gradapplicant@uci.edu for any questions about life before you arrive, getting paperwork to us, and so on.


Finally, please save the date for September 25 for a virtual graduate orientation. Most of the events will be recorded, and you can access them anytime, but some will be live. Also please be on the lookout for an email regarding another virtual town hall that we will be holding soon. This is meant to be a space where I and my panel of experts can address your specific questions and concerns. We hope to see you at both!

Best wishes for a safe arrival to campus. Welcome!

I've been working on four different personal projects on and off, three in Java and one in Python. One of them is a program that allows the user to input the amount of points a football team scored on offense and allowed on defense, and the program then calculates the average points scored per game, points allowed per game, point differential, as well as a binary search. Another project is modeled after an RPG character select, with certain default skill levels in certain categories (ex. Smithing: Level 10 for an orc). The other projects also implement variations of sort algorithms. 

I'm planning on writing a poker game in Python as well. 

Do these projects seem good enough to land me an internship, or do employers want to see candidates with chrome extensions or mobile/web based apps on their resume?"

I am an undergrad CS student and am currently taking Programming Fundamentals 2 in C++, and I feel like the class is going pretty well. I’m understanding everything but I’ve taken a look at the syllabus and I get this feeling that this class isn’t super comprehensive when it comes to having “advanced” knowledge of C++. 

However, when I look up online courses with a title such as C++ advanced topics (on LinkedInLearning or similar websites) it seems that the concepts covered are not that different from my university’s programming 2 syllabus. (Topics such as the preprocessor, pointers, classes, et cetera)

When internship position descriptions state that advanced C++ is a required or highly recommend skill to have, what does that mean? What topics are good to cover? I understand C++ has a broad scope, but is there anything generally more “advanced” I should be looking into? And also with respect to data science/machine learning?

I was always afraid of death, so much that no pain would ever make me want to die.

Or so I thought...

Over the course of February and March, my entire life, everything I was building for myself, had come unraveled. In February, I had a girlfriend who I couldn't find fault in, an internship in an incredibly competitive field with a promising career ahead of me, and an amazing converted house with great roommates and friends, in a city I loved.  In the first half of March, Coronavirus hit, and my life fell apart.

First, my girlfriend left. She said she still wanted to be with me, but that she thought her health put her in a place where she couldn't. I insisted that it didn't matter and that I wanted her still, but she insisted and things went dark. Then I lost the internship, because the office closed and interns had to be let go for security concerns. I tried to find a job still, but the pandemic shut that down right quick. My lease ran out in May, and because I lacked stable income, and my rent was pretty expensive, my parents made me move back in with them, far away from that life I was trying to build. 

I can't take it anymore. My mom is trying to be supportive and help me work things out, but my dad is toxic positivity embodied. I can't opt out of telling him something, and he'll just invalidate anything I say. He can't stand to be wrong, and he can't stand the thought that I'm not happy. 

I'm trying to regain control, I really am, but the universe seems to shit on anything I try, I feel like I'm back to square one within days of trying anything. I still see a future, but it's fading fast. 

The last straw was today. I'd been trying to talk to my ex girlfriend. Our relationship was brief, but I genuinely don't see a better partner as even theoretically possible. I figured we were in a place where we could come together again. At first, it worked amazingly well. Then, suddenly, she stopped talking to me in the middle of a conversation. I gave it a break and asked for a phone call this time, but there's still no response. She hasn't rejected me, or even blocked me. I don't understand why. She just won't talk to me, but won't forbid me from trying, and being placed there is a constant state of emotional torture for me. 

I can't move on either, because I have a long history of being ghosted and rejected by people I thought I was wowing for no particular reason at all. Everyone in my life claims I'm a catch when I bring it up, but damn it, I don't believe it at all; how can I, when I get rejected so much while my lazy slob of a brother managed to find a life partner before he was 19? My ex, additionally, is someone I care about much more *specifically* than anyone who rejected me in the past. Before this, I could at least get back on the horse and try again, because I wanted a relationship more than anyone in particular. Now I only want a relationship with this person, and no other. All I see in moving on is setting myself up to be rejected again while also painfully forcing myself to see people who aren't nearly as important or significant to me than my ex.

I don't know if that's the only thing that's making me feel this way, but that feels like the last straw that broke the camel's back. I'm not so sure I want to live anymore, if I have to do it without her, and my dad breathing down my neck, demanding to know why I wasn't down for dinner tonight when I told him outright that I didn't want to share it, and he insisted I tell him tomorrow anyway, just makes me feel worse, because I know he's just going to invalidate my feelings, inundate me with toxic positivity, dispense useless love advice because that hasn't been a problem for him in 35 years, and finally try to gaslight me into thinking I was never unhappy at all. I hate my life, and with my ex ignoring me the way she has, it's finally gotten to a point where I don't really feel alive at all anymore.

To be honest, I feel like the universe, or something in it, is fucking with me. If you're familiar with the idea of a ""fear eater,"" it genuinely feels like a fear eater has decided to instead harvest my misery, building me up only enough to crush every good thing in my life, and a part of me now craves death because at least then the ""misery eater"" probably would stop considering me interesting anymore. I'm not sure how much I believe that, but that's at least how it feels.

I don't have a plan for suicide, but for the first time in 23 years of life, I can honestly say I don't really feel happy about being alive right now.

And finally, I am seeing a therapist remotely, who is mostly helpful, and is aware of all of this except for the suicidal ideation, as that has emerged since our last session. I just need to be heard out right now. I'm sorry for being such an emotional wreck..."

I really like it, the colleagues and the topics I'm working on.

A few weeks ago, my supervisor approached me and asked what my plans after my studies (I finish in september) were and it sounded like he was offering me a position. I said I was not sure, because the company is very far from my family etc, and that I would probably look for something over there.

Fast forward to now, I kinda like it here and also got used to living here, so the distance to my family is not that critical anymore (probably not in the long term, but still). I thought about staying at the company for another 6 months or so. I heard of many companies stopped hiring, that's why I'm afraid of not finding a job in the coming months after my studies. So continuing working here would secure me a job (which I also like) at least until beginning of next year. Then, depending on the pandemic situation, I can still look for other options.

What would you do in this situation?"

\&gt; **The automatic CAQ renewal only benefits students who will be extending their study permit from inside of Canada**, who will complete their program in the Summer 2020 or Fall 2020 term (i.e. by December 31, 2020), and who will either apply for their PGWP or leave Canada before December 31, 2020.

but i can't find any equivalent statement on the quebec/ canada immigration websites??? the answer to this is significant as it will mean the difference between getting started with study permit docs/ having to wait until i get my CAQ renewed. 

there seems to be some acknowledgement that renewing legal docs will take longer bc of covid, its been mentioned that anyone who has a study permit issued before march 18 will be allowed to enter canada. but how long is this valid for and does this apply to expired study permits??? i can't leave for canada early bc my internship ends on august.

I only have one internship with a non-profit organization at my school, and I feel like that is not enough for me to compete in the job market.

So I was thinking... Is it a reasonable idea to stay an extra quarter or two to pick up a minor as well as take place in the UC Washington Program that my school offers so I can hopefully have a better shot at landing a job despite just wanting to be done with school and move on with life?

Another option I was also considering is joining Americorps after summer, but I'm not sure if the year spent in the program would pay off at the end.

I'm looking for a bit of advice on what path I should take to eventually get into Equity Research or Asset Management.

&amp;#x200B;

Background: 

I started college in a completely unrelated major, and after my first year, I realized I didn't like it and decided to switch to our school's business college. In the first semester of my Sophomore year I wasn't sure which major within the college I wanted to do, but around January I finally settled on Finance. 

I had no idea what to do for an internship and was applying to anything and everything titled 'Finance Intern' on the LinkedIn job board (without any luck, obviously). It wasn't until quarantine started that I started doing some research on what I wanted to do, and the work it would take to get there. I started reading this sub, as well as WSO and realized that I hadn't been doing anything I should have been doing previously to get into more prestigious roles like ER or AM.

I have some solid leadership roles in clubs on campus and have a 3.8 GPA, so internships and networking are the two things I need to work on most.

So, I'm now entering my Junior year without any internships under my belt and the way I see it, I have two options that would help propel me into ER/AM and I just need some advice on which might be the better route.

&amp;#x200B;

Option 1:

I can add a major in Accounting to extend my time here by one semester, thereby adding an extra summer for some internship experience. This would allow me more time to network with alumni from my school and hopefully leverage a solid 'sophomore' internship into a good junior year internship.

Option 2:

I can continue majoring in only finance, and apply for some of the top MSF programs, and get access to more alumni and recruiting resources. I did some research on LinkedIn and found there were \~60 alumni from my undergrad school across 10 of the bigger firms in ER and AM, whereas a school such as Vanderbilt had \~350. This would make it much easier to make valuable connections in the industry.

&amp;#x200B;

Any and all advice is appreciated!"

*There are 3 things that have been depressing me. And they will be explained in each section which will be indicated in* ***bold***\*. Thank you again for reading and commenting.\*

**School**: Currently I am attending flight school. Aviation is my passion and I love every moment of my training. However, my depression mainly comes from my college phase. On May 2019 I graduated with a Bachelors in a degree I disliked. Why did I do it then? Well, I wanted to save myself and my parents some money and time. I know... it was stupid, but at that point I just wanted to hurry up and rush through, get my college degree, and start flight school and never look back. I graduated within 3 years and while that is a huge accomplishment it took a lot of sacrificing. I sacrificed and missed out on so much. I literally sacrificed my sanity and personal well-being by putting all my effort into getting college done. *Some examples: I took 21-24 credit hour semesters while having a 30+ hour part-time job. I ignored a lot of friends during this time. I ignored my siblings during this time too. Lastly, if I failed a class I would avoid taking summer and winter breaks and I would sign up for 4-5 classes each break to get ahead.* It was stressful and draining. At times, I would literally finish my night class at 10:30 PM, walk to my parking spot, cry my eyes out in the car, and then drive home. And to make it worse, sometimes I even lifted my hands up and closed my eyes wanting to crash and never have to worry about anything again but I would always catch the wheel and drive home crying.

**Relationship**: I just got out of a 2 year relationship. And this relationship was NO DOUBT the single **BEST relationship** I have ever had. All of my previous relationships all ended with me being lied to, cheated on, or us just ending it casually. However, this relationship was something else. I loved and still love this girl. We both care for each other. But we chose to stop our relationship as a couple and continue as friends because we are both going through a hard time.

\---*Backstory---*

*We both met at a summer internship. She took interest in me, told a bunch of people, and I mustered the balls to ask her out on a date. But I wasn't sure if I wanted to keep dating because of her anxiety. I was scared. But as we kept seeing each other and talking, I started to love her for who she is. At times, she would hold my hand, look into my eyes to calm down her anxiety and panic attacks. We both dated and after about a month and half I told her ""I love you"" and she said it back actually meaning it. We continued to be together for a year and things started to get rough. She went through surgery and had a fatty growth removed that was causing her immense abdominal pain and anxiety. But during this time I was struggling through my senior year of college. I was distraught, distracted and depressed with the thoughts of not being able to graduate college, not being able to get into flight school, etc. So before her surgery I told her I needed time away to focus on myself and work on myself. She understood but asked me to stay because she was scared out of her wits on what the surgery might do to her and the one person that helped reduce her anxiety was me. So I stayed and as we kept seeing each other after the surgery I hid my depression from her and struggled by myself. I hid it from everyone and this made me bitter. I wanted to do my best and make sure others thought well of me, but I would be so upset with myself I would lash out at people. And at times I would lash out at my girlfriend (or ex at this point, I'm still in the process of getting over it). We started to fight and it got worse and worse. Eventually we had a good phase during the winter where we went on multiple vacations where we would spend time together ignoring all those fights and triggers. But once we stopped having vacations we went straight back to fighting but this time both of us would say ""I don't know what I want right now. I love you but I just don't know if we should be together"". Eventually she said she wanted to break-up but stay as friends, but I would keep pushing to try again by staying together. We fought more and more, and eventually it got to the point where we both said many hateful and regretful things. I took a couple days from talking to her and eventually compromised and told her ""Let's break up, because I know that's what we both need right now, but we can also stay friends"". When I said this she had the most genuine smile and gleam of happiness that literally made my heart so happy. We both said we'll break up but still see each other as friends and both agreed to be open to a relationship in the future but accepted that we don't know what will happen between then.*

Right now, it hurts. I regret so many things I have done and haven't done. Our relationship was something special and just the thought of being friends and her seeing some other person scares the ""poop"" out of me. She's been is so many horrible relationships and it worries me because this girl means the world to me. And no... it isn't the honey-moon phase or just a ""relationship"" this was the real deal. Today I talked to her and she said she was open to the possibility of us being together but just doesn't know. And while I agree, that uncertainty frightens me.

**Family**: All of these things have been affecting my relationship with friends and family. School isolated me from my family and friends. Every single time I look at my diploma I want to throw something at it. I've neglected time my siblings needed with me and I feel awful about it. After this break-up I was able to see all that, that I neglected my relationship with so many people (starting with my ex and my family). And it pains and hurts me that I did so. **BUT** this experience has allowed me to open up and reconnect with friends and family. I thanked them and asked for their advice and its shown me that there are people behind me supporting me every step of the way. I was finally able to talk openly to my parents and siblings about all of this. I wasn't able to see that before but now I do. I just still get sad and hate myself for neglecting these people and stressing out about things and lashing out on them. This past week has been eye-opening and tearful because I finally was able to talk to everyone.

To conclude this post I want to make a few statements. I was depressed and I still am. I regret so many things in the past. While I am trying to work on myself now, I still am so scared for the future. As a human, I want a perfect, crystal-ball answer on what's going to happen to my relationship, my career, etc. but I know I won't get that. I need some of your advice and inputs to see some more hope.

I was able to really talk with those around me and already feel better, but I want another point of view. I was able to identify these problems and am now working on it. As of right now, I have been able to start changing myself by making dedicated school schedules for flight training, start a diet and lose the 50+ pounds I gained over the last 5 years, and focus on my relationships with friends and family. Furthermore, I am now trying to find an official therapist and re-involve myself back into a holistic outlook. What should I do? Any advice? What are your thoughts on my break-up? How have you dealt with these similar experiences? What should I do? Am I on the right path?"
hhlw66,1,2020-06-28,"I'm beginning to realize my boyfriend of 4 years may have extreme paranoia. He's going to see a psychiatrist on Monday, but what can I do to help?",iftheronahadntcome,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/hhlw66/im_beginning_to_realize_my_boyfriend_of_4_years/,"**TLDR: My boyfriend's anxiety issues have spiraled into paranoia. I convinced him to see a therapist 6 months ago, and that's been helping, but I just realized how bad his mental state is, so our therapist has helped me convince him to take medication (he has a virtual consult Monday). How can I be supportive of him, and also work through his manic episodes (which involve him threatening to leave the relationship about once a month?). I know he says and does what he does mostly out of fear.**

So my boyfriend and I have been together for a few years, and he's had a ton of unhealthy behaviors. One of these involves angry outbursts of screaming, cursing, and threatening to leave the relationship at least once a month as a result of literally any disagreement. 95% of the time, these disagreements are not worth breaking up over - he's just terrified of confrontation.

If you take a look at his life, it makes sense - he had  verbally abusive father, and a physically abusive older brother (he even tried to kill him when they were kids). Any confrontation he had growing up of any kind resulted in screaming, threats, physical beatings, etc. I come from an abusive home myself (my mom tried to kill me when I was 17, and I no longer have a relationship with her or my family of any kind), so I can empathize. But I never took that anger out on others. 

Originally, these outbursts came from disagreements. It doesn't make them okay (me disagreeing with someone doesn't warrant them being emotionally and verbally abusive), but lately, they take less and less to happen. He used to tell me this was because we had financial issues. Now I have a good job, and we had a point a few months ago where we hadn't argued or had him threaten to leave in 4 months. One day, he just came home and told me I was ruining his life and that he wishes he never met me, etc. He was driving us somewhere and he even dragged the wheel around like he was angry enough to almost crash the car.

He admitted the next day that he was just upset and stressed at work and had no clue what had come over him. He's admitted on numerous occasions that he's scared that one day I'm going to become just as angry as he's been. I finally convinced him to get into therapy 6 months ago, and there's been a lot of growth. He's actually been able to talk about some things without blowing up, and has been realizing where his anger and anxiety comes from.

However, he threatened to leave again. Just yesterday, he was telling me how much he loves me, and how he wants to spend our lives together, and how happy he was for the future. Then he came out of his therapy session this morning almost in tears and feeling extremely sensitive. He then started threatening to leave and saying he couldn't do this relationship, etc. 

My theory? His anxiety is getting to levels reaching paranoia. Since I got my job, it's gotten worse - he's afraid that given all of his issues that it's only a matter of time before I leave him. I convinced him to leave work and go to a programming bootcamp (it's what I did and how I got my job) so he doesn't get us all COVID (he was going to job sites with 200+ people every day and we both have pre-existing conditions that can cause COVID to kill us). It's like now, the prospect of me ""eventually becoming abusive"" is getting worse - he was really verbally abusive during my bootcamp and constantly threatened to leave during school, causing me to almost miss assignments and get fired from my resulting internship. He even admitted that he was scared to go to school because he was scared that I would ""try to get payback"". Basically, anything that requires he trust another person and the closer I get to being entirely self-sufficient, it freaks him out.

But it's not just in our relationship. He's talked himself out of doing so many different things because he's sure he's going to be bad at it. He used to have a really bad stutter as a child, and is *terrified* of social situations or speaking to people. He shits on himself for where he is in life despite him working to fix it. He's woken up in the morning in tears before about going to work because he's scared he's going to get in trouble about things, even though at least once a week his coworkers and supervisors spoke his praises, and he got semi-annual raises and a promotion. He said once that he was going to quit smoking, and *lied* that he smoked a cigarette and fell off the horse to see if I'd yell at him, because he's so anxious about confrontation, despite me literally never yelling at him about this (or most things) in the past. When we don't have problems, he literally makes them up, because he's so uncomfortable with there being a *lack* of yelling and confrontation and arguments in his life. His anxiety permeates every part of his life and has been effectively ruining it for years.

He's finally agreed to get medication. I'm now at a point where I don't feel angry like I used to - I feel sorry for him. He has some agency in his actions sure, but at this point, he's just an angry, sad, depressed person, and I'm realizing how little anything I do has to do with his emotional state. Our therapist managed to calm him down today when I called in an emergency session (we see the same therapist individually and together as a couple, and she's very good at what she does) and convince him to start seeing her weekly for a little while since he has a lot to unpack. But in the meantime, I just don't know how to help. Any suggestions would be appreciated."

If I continue to attend my current school, I will graduate December 2021 (3.5 years). I have been accepted to a top tech school but by credit hours I will end up graduating in December 2022 (4.5 years). Currently interning right now at a billion dollar company and taking classes, so I feel comfortable where I am. Money isn't a major factor since that school offers substantial financial aid to reduce costs by a significant margin and my current school is only 47 minutes away from home. When I graduate, I don't plan on living near or in the state of the ""better"" school, rather I prefer to live in this current state. Would you recommend staying where I'm at or going to a better school far away cause of connections with the wealthy and more opportunities, or staying to be safe and stable?

I know connections help, but if they're far away and having their own load of busy work, wouldn't they be more inclined to help themselves out and their local connections first? Like, if I attend local school, I still have everyone close by. But attending fancy school means we all disperse and go our own directions after graduation. I also hear experience matters the most which is what I'm currently investing in for my current internship this summer. Also, I am upper middle class but I am not rich.

When I started my recent job and I also heavily use python in that job so basically i kinda fell out of touch with Java but I would be able to hop back in with Java if I do 7 or 8 leetcode problems.

I’m gonna start interviewing soon and here’s my main problem :

Java : it takes too long to write simple code but it’s a language I heavily used for 4 years for intense academic projects so I really know the ins and outs of Java 

Python : a language that I recently picked up and I love how fast it is to just write up some code which seems optimal to show I know how to solve a problem without getting stuck on how to declare an Array of Hashmaps or something but I have this fear that since I don’t know python enough I don’t know some of the short cuts and pythonic way of writing code, I also don’t know much about all the libraries python has available so I’m scared I’m gonna look like a  noob trying to write code in python. 

I wanna start practicing leetcode in python even though it’s not my best known language but is that a bad idea? Should I just go for java since I know it more?"

Back in spring, I decided I wanted to try to intern with a local nonprofit. Going in, I figured I wouldn’t be able to get paid much if at all. After shooting some emails out and interviewing a couple of places, I decided on where I wanted to spend the summer.

They said right off the bat that they didn’t have the budget to pay me an hourly wage(this is before COVID hit). However, they were supposed to have a summer camp program where I would help coach, and they said I would be able to get a stipend for coaching. I was fine with this, especially since I knew I was going to be getting college credit and would get a stipend.

When COVID hit, though, they informed me that they had to cancel the summer camps. I was a little sad, as this meant I would be completely unpaid. I shrugged it off though and just told myself I’d be getting the credit and that was fine. I also figured as a nonprofit, they’re likely struggling financially due to COVID.

I went into it being willing to do whatever kind of work they had for me, but I told them I was interested in communication, social media, marketing, programing, etc.. They said they had plenty of that kind of work for me to do. 

For the most part, though, they’ve just had me help with inventory stuff, reorganizing the office, etc. that’s just basic manual labor. I’ve done some research for a project which was since, but it was only 1-2 weeks of out of the 8 I’ve been there.

A couple of weeks ago, I saw my supervisor post on LinkedIn that they were hiring for a social media/marketing intern. $15 an hour. I was a little confused, as that was the kind of work I was hoping to do for them this summer. I thought maybe it was a position for fall and not summer, but they’re looking for someone to start in July. This past week they’ve been interviewing people on Zoom while I’ve been in the office lifting heavy boxes to help reorganize and make room for things. 

I’m kind of confused and a bit offended. At first I thought maybe they were looking for someone who was graduated, but they’re considering upper-level college students like me, too. Is this abnormal? I feel a little taken advantage of and looked over. Should I say something, or just keep my head down and just do what they want me to for the remaining 7 weeks?"

Just looking for a little advice from anyone who has applied for cs jobs or hires people in the field. I am currently going into my senior year as a computer science major with a minor in management information systems. Unfortunately the area I live in and go to school at is not very friendly when it comes to tech jobs (very retail heavy with some minor business jobs). 

For that reason it is exceedingly difficult to find any internships that actually pay, most are unpaid. I’m kind of on my own when it comes to gas, food, bills, etc. Most of the internships I see require around 15-25 hours, which I don’t believe I could juggle school, my job and that without sacrificing one. So I am unable to quit my current job for those reasons. My question is, for most jobs in the field, would it be a major deal breaker for a company to see my resume and not have an internship on it? (I am of course keeping an eye out on any paying ones if I see the opportunity)

I got very lucky with landing a CS internship and the project is to build a certain kind of program. Basically, we want to build a controller software for a balance measurement app we're working on. What we want the controller software to do is for it to allow a researcher to modify/customize movement tests however they want (eg what position, which phone sensors to be used, how long, how many reps, etc) and then be able to send that custom test to a specific end user/s using the corresponding balance app. Balance app already has a bunch of tests on it, if that matters.

I have no idea where to begin looking for information or what do I even look up so I can have an idea on what I need to build this thing. I have just started reading about APIs if that helps. If anyone can point me to a direction, that would be so helpful. My mentor is unfortunately not in CS and does not know what to do either. Thank you very much."

So I have been working  at this athletics internship since my freshman year of college. I have been in college for the past 6 six years due to just being in a new environment and personal and family issues that have made college really challenging for me. So for now I have been at the organization for 5 season. My situation is that I want to turn this into a full time job I've gotten to know everyone there, they are like a a group of mentors and family to me. So i feel like when I go to ask about a job they will hold how I've been in school against me. Like one of my co-interns  got a job at the end of the Spring once she graduated with the company so I'm always hoping that would happen to me. But i also have self esteem issues where I compare myself to people bc her relatives are in the industry and she comes from that background where as though i don't and im the first one  in my family to go this far in terms of distance for school. 

I guess  what I'm  asking is how do I turn this internship into something long term? I've put in the work and sacrificed a lot to work with this organization and I just want it to turn into something. Like I just don't want to was the time I've spent with them. I'm not opposed to going elsewhere I just want to stay where I've already established myself. I've watched this organization grow from a low point to a high point  so its a part of me at this point. I've  expressed interest in working with them but I have to wait till I graduate.

As dumb as this sounds, I really thought that we were going to be friends for life.

She is the kind of person to always have a boyfriend, and I have known almost all of them. Her most serious and longest relationship was with this guy (20M) let's call him, Adam. They had a pretty toxic relationship in my opinion and it when on and off for about 3 years.

When my friend went to college (prestigious and preppy) she started dating this new guy, let's call him Owen. To be honest, Owen is the nicest and most genuine boyfriend my friend has ever had, and they had a pretty good relationship too. Even I became friends with him.

Owen came to live with my friend and her family to work for an internship. Like I said before since I live so close, I come over almost everyday to hang out. In the last few months, my friend had told me that her ex Adam was transitioning into a female, but she needed me to make sure that Owen does not know that she is in touch with her ex. This happened a while ago.

Yesterday, my friend threw a bit of a tantrum. She told Owen that she was bothered that I was coming over so often (even though she constantly calls and asks me to come over) and she told me that she was bothered that Owen kept hugging and showing affection to her (even though she is always asking Owen to hug and show affection to her. Owen and I decided just to go to her backyard and chill for a bit just to give my friend some space. He asked me why I was in contact with Adam and thought that was weird. But I had forgotten that my friend had told her boyfriend that I was in contact with Adam, so he didn't know that she was talking to her ex. I had completely forgotten my friend's secret and accidentally let it slip that I was not in contact with Adam. I begged Owen to not tell her that I let it slip and he said he wouldn't say anything.

Later that day, my friend told me that she felt uncomfortable that Owen and I were swimming together and hanging out without her. (she doesn't like to go swimming because of some scars and she didn't want to go outside even though we asked.)

An hour ago, my friend texted me asking why I told Owen about Adam. I explained to her what happened. And I also added that I did not tell her immediately because she was upset with me and her boyfriend and I wanted to give her space. I seriously was going to tell her tomorrow though.

She is very mad with me. We have never had an argument before. I really feel like even though I betrayed her trust, It had been hard for me to keep up with the lies she tells her boyfriend and it is exhausting to always have to lie for her.

I don't know what to do.

edit: also, the reason why I can't cut her off is that I am very close with her little sister (11) and I like to think of her as my sister. I really don't want to lose that"

I just started my internship with a company about a month ago in their marketing department which is where I want to be. They just posted a internal job for a marketing associate position. Now in order to complete my degree I have to complete the internship which will not end until August. Should I apply for the job even though I have around 1.5-2 months left to go in the internship so I can obtain my degree or will that job application just go unnoticed?"

I'd be really  grateful if I could receive some advice regarding getting a remote job,  being myself in a third-world country. I know the typical route is to  work onsite first, and then after a few years make the change to remote.  I'd really love to do that, but most companies in here are either  dying/failing or abuse the employees, without paying them for the extra  hours of work, and sometimes working on Saturday and Sunday, without  even getting payed and not respecting the Work Contracts and this happen  very often during the month and if you refuse, you are fired. If I do  get another job in here, at around 270 euro monthly, this salary is not  enough to live (kind of) comfortably.

Things  like what websites to apply for these kind of positions, a story about  how you or someone you know got a remote job without many years of  experience, or if you know some distributed companies that would be  willing to interview me, would help me a lot.

I'll do as many  interview projects in order to prove my skills as necessary.

Due to that, I fucked up handing in my documents for my internship to school and the company.

I think I also need to hand over a form to grade me to my Internal counselor, but I'm afraid I get negative feedback due to asking for a grading late and almost near the end of my internship (Friday this week).

I also am feeling nervous about the teacher that I got assigned by my school, I was supposed to send in documents last Friday but again due to the situation with my grandfather, I totally forgot it was the due date.  
Both my teacher and the employee that is supposed to grade me know of the situation, but I really feel like I fucked it all up.

All I want to do is call in sick and pretend I am, and lock myself up in my grandfather's home (well  since I occasionally go there to ""guard"" it.)

How can I save this situation?"

Sorry if it’s a wall of text &lt;3

I [20M] have been considering dropping out of college. I’m majoring in construction management, and just finished my sophomore year in May. I originally went to college for an engineering degree but switched after the first year when I decided engineering wasn’t for me.

As long as I can remember I’ve always had this notion that to succeed in life I have to go to college and earn a degree, which has strongly been enforced by my mom [~60] and dad [~70]. They even started college funds for my twin sister and I when we were young so we didn’t have to worry about finances while attending. 

Last summer, I was fortunate enough to land an internship as a field engineer (not actually engineering related) with a commercial construction company. That summer I got to do a lot of hands-on work such as demo, carpentry, and other work like that while occasionally doing work in the office or on the computer related to the management side of the field. 

This summer, I was able to return to work with the same company, but I’m now rarely doing hands-on work and spend most of my day in front of the computer on a job site working on submittals, RFIs, and other management related tasks. Though I’m thankful that I can have this experience, I’m not happy. I’d much rather be doing the actual construction.

I’ve also always struggled with school, and I still have trouble focusing and sometime have no motivation to work on homework. I do have a learning disability, but other posts I’ve seen on reddit for people with similar issues lead me to think that I actually have a form of ADHD that was misdiagnosed. I do want to get professionally tested for this. 

When quarantine started, my three roommates all went back to stay with their families while I stayed at the apartment. All my classes went online and I was able to finish my semester strongly. But I didn’t enjoy what I was working on, and often thought about just dropping out and doing something else while also thinking that it would never be a possibility due to my parents. 

Because of these reasons, I’ve started to consider dropping out and going to a trade school either as a carpenter or as an electrician. If I go into either field, I’d be making money working as an apprentice while learning about the trade for 3-4 years. I’ve also thought about potentially getting a commercial drivers license as I’ve always liked working with large equipment.

I’ve only told my sister and her girlfriend about this. They both are supportive and my sister said she would even be there when I would tell my parents about it.

However, I think my parents would be less than receptive to this and wouldn’t be happy that I’d be wasting two years of school and tuition just to drop out. They’ve always pushed that college is the key to success, but my dad never even finished college and went on to become a successful business man, while my mom is in a career that doesn’t relate to her original degrees. 

I have also wanted to discuss this with my best friend/roommate [20F] and later the rest of my friend group,  but don’t know how they would react as all but 1 are in traditional college. Of my friends, I’m also the only one whose college education is 100% being funded by their parents so I don’t know if they’d react negatively to this thinking I’m throwing away an opportunity that was handed to me. 

I guess after all that, I’m mostly looking for advice on how to tell my parents I want to drop out and pursue a career in a construction trade since they might be disappointed in me for this decision. I would also like some advice on I could discuss this with my best friend, but it’s not as important since I think she and other friends would be mostly supportive."

I am currently an incoming senior in Computer Engineering, so I am beginning to gear up to find a job, or at least do the preliminary research and start applying as the new grad positions start to open up. My original plan before COVID was to only look in other places, such as Boston, Dallas/Houston, DC area, maybe Phoenix (I have lived in NC all of my life, and because I’m Jewish, I’m trying to look for a bigger community where I move.) Now, with COVID, I am beginning to reconsider these plans for several reasons. 

1. I am currently working at a company as an intern that seems to emphasize that as long as you do good work, you’ll get a full time offer, even with COVID. I also love what I’m doing here and think it would be a great first job if I was to get a full time offer. I am also potentially going to be working for them part time in the fall/spring if the situation allows. 

2. COVID has eliminated a lot of the job market for the time being, I know it will recover, but I’m not sure if it would be in enough time for me to secure a job in one of those locations by mid 2021. 

3. Even though I have had 5 internships, the bulk of the jobs I am seeing in these places have a couple of years experience in order to be considered, this makes my options potentially more limited unless internships would count towards those years of experience. 

4. I would want to make sure it would be safe for me to go out and make new friends, and I don’t know if I am being realistic with the timeframe anymore on when things will pick back up because of how badly the US is dealing with the pandemic. 

Any guidance or advice. on what to do in this situation?"

I went to school for computer programming associates, which I did well in and my company let me do an internship at work for 3 months while holding my prior position for me. I loved working on what I was in dev and was decent at it so they tried to make a spot for me . Unfortunately  with covid the company is trying to be fiscally responsible so they cant justify another dev salary right now.

I've been looking for jobs now in Minnesota and Texas as I'm not opposed to moving there. The issue I run into is every posting wants 10-15 years of experience with every language known to man under your belt as well as enterprise level deployment technology knowledge. Is it worth applying to these positions still?

I'm pretty good in java although I've not used spring at all yet. C# and python I'm also decent at and have a strong foundational knowledge of SQL which I suppose labels me as a back end dev since I havent done UI a ton. I've got experience with a few web languages and mobile dev too but they arent my strong suit by far. What would you recommend I learn or do next to secure employment in a coding job?"

I work at a large tech company in the PNW, and I work in a pretty low-level job that I took basically just for the sole purpose of getting my foot in the door and making some decent money at the same time. My manager is well aware of the fact that I have higher aspirations than this - I've told him plenty of times that I like working at company X, but I don't want to be a grunt for the rest of my life. He knows this and appreciates it. He is constantly talking about how many of his employees have moved up in the company and gone on to take on bigger and better roles because he promotes them and wants to help push their careers forward. I have been at the company about 2 years and my manager has even approved the expense to have the company pay for me to pursue a second degree, so for the most part I feel like I have a lot of opportunity here.

Here's the problem: I have an opportunity to take a temporary reassignment within the company (kind of like an internship) for about 6 months as a software engineer, which is the job I want. I have had two interviews and both of them went really well, and on both occasions the interviewers have told me that I seem like a great fit and they're really excited to keep moving forward with the process. Essentially I feel fairly confident that I will walk away from the final interview with an offer to join the team for the temporary reassignment. Because it is a reassignment, my manager's approval is required and so when I first applied for the job, I sent him an email saying that I had applied and that I would like him to approve the reassignment if I get an offer - it would be a huge career boost for me and considering how difficult it is to change careers right now during the pandemic, I feel like this is a can't-miss opportunity. 

His response was along the lines of ""I can't approve this - you're critical to what we are doing here. Feel free to escalate to (his manager) if you feel like my position is unwarranted."" Now, to be fair, I am in a special position on this team. I am one of the more advanced-level members among my peers and I have a lot of technical knowledge that would be missing if I were to leave. That being said, this has also been the case with other employees, all of whom he has approved for temporary reassignment. In my time at this company, I have seen 5 other people get approved for temporary reassignment, so I don't understand why I should miss such a potentially life-changing opportunity for the sake of keeping his team afloat. I am also not the only person who has this particular skill set on his team, as there is one other person who is roughly as qualified as I am for the work that we are doing, so it isn't like I would be leaving him completely high and dry.

Needless to say, when he replied no, I was furious. I still haven't responded because I am debating whether or not I should just leave the company altogether. This feels like sabotage, and frankly if I'm not going to be given the opportunity to advance within the company, I'd rather just leave completely instead of wasting my time. I'd also like to take it as an opportunity to screw him over a little bit because frankly, it feels like that's what he's doing to me. I figure, he either loses me for 6 months on the reassignment (with the potential for a full-time offer after the reassignment period) or he can lose me permanently because he isn't willing to let me advance.

So here's my question(s): Am I out of line in thinking that this is unfair when I have seen others be given these opportunities? How do I approach this situation when I do escalate this to his manager? Do I continue to escalate further and further until I receive an appropriate response? And if I wind up being told ""no"" by everyone up the chain of command, is it a sign that I'm stuck as a grunt and should just quit?"
hi5ups,1,2020-06-29,Advice for Summer Preparation Heading Into the Fall,funstudent3,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/hi5ups/advice_for_summer_preparation_heading_into_the/,"Hello everyone,

I'm currently a rising junior at a top 10 undergrad CS school, and I am trying to decide what to do with my time in preparation for job applications and interviews in the fall (I'm assuming that's when most interviews and job app. stuff will be). 

To give a quick breakdown, I currently have a solid SWE internship at a smaller but established company, but have no personal side projects under my belt. I am pretty experienced in C++ and am learning more JS/TypeScript, but I lack experience in other languages such as Python, HTML, CSS, etc. My most recent class was the data structures/algorithms class at school. 

I am deciding between doing the following outside of work this summer:

1. Going through Cracking the Coding Interview, reviewing important concepts and doing practice problems 
2. Grinding leet code 
3. Taking a quick online course in Python and working on a side project or 2

I am trying to find the right balance between learning new stuff and creating good side projects that I can talk about during interviews, and studying/doing practice technical questions. Even with a summer internship, I am not sure how much not having a real side project will hurt my chances of landing a good interview/internship.

Does anyone have any advice for me in general in the way I should approach this summer, and what I should place an emphasis on? Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you very much!"

The position was suppose to start over the summer. They sent a welcome handbook, guide to benefits, and I signed something that stated the salary and the starting bonus along with the rules of the company and the expectation for the job. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, due to COVID, they recently pushed the job from starting in August until December. My recruiter, who of course works with the company, said that they were still intending on hiring us, that the company isn't effected financially even stating that they received a good amount of funding and that they weren't even in a hiring freeze for mid level or senior positions. However, she said that it seemed the company was making this decision based upon starting new recruits remotely wasn't, in the company's eyes, for the best.    

&amp;#x200B;

I was able to find another job which will go until December in the software field. It's an internship. However, I'm worried, if come December, they rescind the offer my resume won't be nearly as good as before since I will be a 7 months from graduation with only two internships on my resume and a personal project. 

&amp;#x200B;

I took this job, denying other offers, due to the salary, benefits, location and the technology I would be working on which were quite good. Now, I'm stuck not sure what to do next. Any help would be appreciated."

Personal background: I'm a hikikomori/socially withdrawn with zero social skills. I'm afraid of going out and talking to people. Currently studying online and have no work experience.

About the internship: It's a 3-day internship experience that's being done online because of the pandemic (a big opportunity for me given my personal situation). It involves a few skill seminars and a group work project. The main thing is the 30 min of 1:1 networking over video call.

How do I network 1:1 with people? I'm unfamiliar with professional settings and how to act while 'networking'. I also don't know if I'm comfortable talking about myself or what I'd even say. If I can I'd like to shift the conversation to the other person as much as possible."

I am currently an incoming senior in Computer Engineering, so I am beginning to gear up to find a job, or at least do the preliminary research and start applying as the new grad positions start to open up. My original plan before COVID was to only look in other places, such as Boston, Dallas/Houston, DC area, maybe Phoenix (I have lived in NC all of my life, and because I’m Jewish, I’m trying to look for a bigger community where I move.) Now, with COVID, I am beginning to reconsider these plans for several reasons. 

1. I am currently working at a company as an intern that seems to emphasize that as long as you do good work, you’ll get a full time offer, even with COVID. I also love what I’m doing here and think it would be a great first job if I was to get a full time offer. I am also potentially going to be working for them part time in the fall/spring if the situation allows. 

2. COVID has eliminated a lot of the job market for the time being, I know it will recover, but I’m not sure if it would be in enough time for me to secure a job in one of those locations by mid 2021. 

3. Even though I have had 5 internships, the bulk of the jobs I am seeing in these places have a couple of years experience in order to be considered, this makes my options potentially more limited unless internships would count towards those years of experience. 

4. I would want to make sure it would be safe for me to go out and make new friends, and I don’t know if I am being realistic with the timeframe anymore on when things will pick back up because of how badly the US is dealing with the pandemic. 

Any guidance or advice. on what to do in this situation?"

hi9gcu,476,2020-06-29,I hate it when people say that first-gen low income have it easy when it comes to college admissions,ElonMusksSonName,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/hi9gcu/i_hate_it_when_people_say_that_firstgen_low/," I agree, it sucks for middle class families when it comes to college admissions. However, it pisses me off when people claim that FGLI applicants have it easier than middle class applicants.

First of all, the college admissions process is so expensive. A single application fee is $75 to $100, the cost to send your AP score to colleges is around $15, a cost of an AP test is around $94, the SAT is around $49.50-$64.50, the ACT is $67, a single SAT report is $12 (after the first 4), et cetera and the average applicant applies to *at least* 10 schools. Also, if you get SAT/ACT/AP exam prep (which costs a pretty penny), and the cost of ECs, it builds up. You can get a fee waiver, but then it's not enough.

Also, when it comes to ECs, the accessibility of those ECs depends on the socioeconomic status of the school and area: there are schools without resources for those ECs itself, and colleges look for students with passion, intellectual vitality, creativity and dedication for those ECs. FGLI students may not have the resources or time to discover these passions, which is a prominent part of a college app.

Music, sports, theatre, can be huge money and time commitments, and ECs like Science Olympiad and Debate are a huge time commitment, which some people can't commit to since they might have responsibilities outside of school, such as working jobs or taking care of family after school, which is a huge portion of their time and life. For sports, you might have to pay registration/trip fees and for musical instruments, you have to buy the instrument, spend time practicing, pay for the concert trips and lessons, etc. For science olympiad, you have to dedicate MONTHS for studying for events, and even more months if you have a build event (buying the equipment, the resources, etc which costs around $60). A huge part of ECs is knowing where to look for them, and sometimes people don't have those resources.

Another thing: when you are the first in your family to go to college, it really isn't easy, navigating the admissions process yourself. It's stressful, it's complicated, and you don't know where to look, and no matter how much your parents try to help, you have to do a lot of it on your own and build yourself from the bottom. 
Some people I know get into T20s and have certain internships because of connections, and being FGLI, you may not have those connections. It's unequivocally scary, and to my FG students, I really respect you all. (I respect all of you on A2C)

For people who are FGLI and from an immigrant family, they might not have the resources that a lot of people have. Money can also be tight at times. When my mom immigrated to the US, she barely spoke English, and after our father died, she was a single mother raising 4 children (I am the oldest) while getting her GED (and we didn't have a car). It wasn't easy, settling into the US, and I speak and write English the best in my family. Our family made around $25-30K a year, so it wasn't easy to stay afloat and feed 4 kids, while taking care of grandparents, and my mom sacrificed a lot to get us into a good school. A lot of our clothes were either only on clearance or thrift stores, and I didn't even have a bed and I had to share a room with my mom. For example, $10 went a long way, and we'd be reluctant to spend over $20 on something we didn't need, let alone $75 for an application fee to college. I go to a better school now, and we recently moved into a new home after living in a domestic violence shelter for months.

So to my fellow first-gen low income students, I have the highest respect for you. What makes you special is that you've worked so hard, you've gone through so much, to get where you are right now. Don't let the rich girl whose parents donated a building and bribed a college a shit ton of money discourage you. The college admissions process is inherently elitist. However, you (the people who build themselves up from the ground) are the type of people that make this country great, and build this country. You're creating a future for yourself and for others. You may come from a place where college isn't an expectation, and the odds may be against you, but you will succeed, and all of your hard work will fall into place. ❤

I believe in you and I'm rooting for you💞"

So basically, back in November, it started when I got the offer to be a SWE intern with one of my dream companies, and I was supposed to fly out to their offices and work there. I prepped vigorously for interviews for the prior previous month, so this was a huge sigh of relief. Obviously covid messed that up, but fortunately, my chance to intern with them had been preserved, albeit remote. I started about a little more than a month ago, and I'm upset that I feel I'm underperforming at this job...

&amp;#x200B;

 I definitely get along very well with all the other interns and employees when I talk to them and I try to explain my situations and struggles to the fullest extent about everything, but theres a lot of new tools I've never worked with before, lots of new keywords, a HUGE codebase for this project that is hard for me to grasp, and not amazing explanation from my mentor.

In March of this year as my student internship ended the company asked me to fill in a paid position for someone on Maternity leave until June and that in September I would be converted to a full-time permanent position. 

So beginning in April, I started with them in a full time, temporary position with the understanding that this would be for a few months and that I would become permanent in the Fall. 

Well, as time progressed and COVID hit harder they never spoke to me again about the fall. In fact, the only thing I ever heard was we have no idea what is going to happen. Fair enough and I carried on. 

At the end of May there was an all staff meeting where they introduced the person that would be taking my promised spot in the fall from a different office. They didn't warn me or follow up with me after. I was left hanging. 

Finally, I went to HR and they had no idea that I was promised a spot in the fall and they thought that I was to be temporary forever I guess.

So, last I got accepted as an intern (i mean, I will be a volunteer) in a cool organization that gives an occasion to learn about marketing and design etc.

Now, as first step I needed to look through an orientation folder - and since i am still fighting with procrastination and lazyness (and also, there was an 8 hour video to watch), it took me 10 days to do that, which i guess is not a very good sign to my employer ha.

Now in the message I am sending the person that take care of me to tell her I finished watching, do you think it's a good idea to say something like ""sorry for the delay in replying, it took me some time to finish watching the formation! I would sure love having a schedule with deadlines so I can make sure to keep at it!"". So in a way, to imply ""aaaaaaaaaah alright I have some terrible lazyness sides, but when I am pushed and have a schedule, I can be great !""

Because it's true, I am a bit better when I have deadlines set by others (i am trying to learn to set deadlines by myself, but it's less convincing). Like, I  often end up one or two days late anyways, but generally having a deadline gives me a huge bust of energy. In one night before a deadline, I can do the same work I would do in three days before the deadline (even if I spend all my time on the work during the three days ! the farthest away from deadline the slowest I am, I guess that's the Parkinson law?)

So do you think that's a good idea, or my employer would run away from a newly accepted intern that rejects the fault of taking 10 days to reply on not having been given a deadline? (In other words, I have a hard time supervising myself?)"

I've seen other students profiles and they've done multiple spring weeks, been the head of several finance societies etc... They have an impressive profile. I started getting into finance really late. Like so late that I'm surprised (and grateful) that I got this internship but I have literally no finance experience as I'm studying a non finance degree.


How detrimental will my lack of experience be when connecting with employees at the company I'm interning at? I know having a bad profile will create a bad impression but I think that LinkedIn would be a really good way to build my network especially when starting out as an intern but I'm really scared about how badly it will look. (I'm interning at a big bank which I think makes this even worse)

Is there anything I can do to show my interest in finance  (like any reputable online courses I can put on LinkedIn)?

My interest is to be a UX Designer. And I have aims to pursue higher education in the near future to get to that.

I am a Computer Science graduate and straight out of college I joined an MNC that focusses on ETL Technology as an intern, 1 year 6 months ago.

Internship was good and helped me fast track my Web Development skills (at least had the relevancy to my future and the team was super helpful). After the internship (6 months duration, so till June 2019), they said, they do not have vacancy in that team, but they do have one in Product Support Team. 

Out of fear of becoming unemployed, I gave the interviews for that job and got in. I knew it was a mistake since I didn't like the role, I thought I will keep it as a temporary job and try finding other jobs. But I got tied up in preparing and giving exams for higher studies. The exams got over in November and I had time till December to apply for higher studies, but couldn't apply due to issues with arranging the documents in time. Higher Education is postponed by a year.

My job currently is to set up calls with customers and solve their issues, raise product bugs and lacks anything related to what I want. And the timings are also unwelcoming: 2 PM to 11 PM.

After all this, I actively applied for jobs that were relevant to my future till March, but couldn't get into any roles due to the lost touch with the domain. And then the pandemic hit and now I'm stuck with this job which is a dead end, since there is no good career growth.

Due to all this, that has happened, I have developed even more hatred towards the job and every morning I wake up with the same thought: ""why the fuck did I take this job?!""

I was planning to quit it and give my self the time to freshen up my skills and start applying.

On a brighter side, I got an unpaid internship with a startup with the role that I want to pursue: UX Designer a while back. I am contributing the weekends to that job. Which is some kind of relief. Though it is unpaid, they are planning to make it paid in some months. (I'm not counting on it, but it's a good news)


What should I be doing now? The job that I have during the weekdays contributes 0% to my future. And money doesn't seem to be an issue, since I can stay at my parents house.

hioen1,1,2020-06-30,First time poster looking for advice,Level3Lag,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/hioen1/first_time_poster_looking_for_advice/,"Hello everyone. Similar to many other posts on this sub, I am a recent college graduate who is trying to look for work however I feel like my resume just goes into black holes. I originally graduated with a degree in Political science and had the intent of going to law school but after interning at a local DAs office I just realized that I didn’t think I could invest the money and time for a career I didn’t love. I ended up going back to school and got a degree in Management Information Systems (with a 4.0 for what’s it worth) and am currently interning at a local company till the end of summer. While I was in school I had to work third shift at a plastics factory to have a source of income. It was really hard trying to balance life and school and I felt like a loser cause all of my friends were finding careers and I felt like I was just falling behind. Currently I’m applying for full time work but I haven’t had much luck. My biggest fear is that after my internship ends I’ll be right back where I was searching for jobs with no luck and I’ll have to end up doing factory work again just to make money. I’m currently trying to apply out of state (in Denver actually) and have talked to multiple recruiters and usually only apply on actual company sites but I’m not getting any responses. I feel like I have a decent resume but maybe I’m missing key words or something. I just don’t know, I know having a degree and good gpa doesn’t mean I deserve a job but I feel like I do have relevant experience but entry level jobs always want more. It’s frustrating not even getting the opportunity to interview and try to prove myself to a company. I guess I’m just looking for advice on how to maybe make my resume stand out more without exaggerating. For example I have worked with SQL, R and some programming languages like C++ and python but I’m no where near an expert. I don’t know how to phrase that on my resume. I just feel like there has to be some reason why I can barely seem to get responses and I just feel stuck right now like nothing will ever change.

TLDR: went back to school for a better degree, still can’t seem to get interviews. Looking for different approaches/ things to get noticed."
hiognx,3262,2020-06-30,This sub is the reason I fought for my mental health - In less than 3 months I became a 4.0 student and got back into my hobbies,777sadurn777,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/hiognx/this_sub_is_the_reason_i_fought_for_my_mental/,"**EDIT:** Reading everyone's comments that I inspired them to not give up makes me so happy!! I did not expect this post to get so big and I'm extremely grateful for all of the amazing positive feedback! I just want to add that I am NOT advocating for relying 100% on medication and I do still have to put in the work to stay focused and not lose hours of my day. I still have many symptoms of ADHD that I can only control on my own! I am very safe with my medication and try to take an off-day twice a week. As for those still struggling, I'm here for you and hope you get the help you need soon! This was not to rub it in ANYONE'S face but to share my story!!!

For 23 years I was told by psych after psych that ADHD and social anxiety was not a good enough diagnosis in itself, and that I must have something else along with it. I live in a pretty conservative pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps area of the US and was told to exercise, focus, and maybe try meditation or yoga. I was always offered a prescription for Strattera and mood stabilizers with no other options - just take it or leave it. Even bringing up the possibility of trying a stimulant would cause an eyeroll from doctors.

At the time I found this sub, I was ready to give up. I remember crying my eyes out because of all the posts about seeing people doing so much better after trying medication, and wishing that a doctor would allow me to have that chance. The people here motivated me to keep trying and not give up on finding the right care team who would not only help me find medication, but also listen to me.

Every doctor in this area, and even my own family, SWORE that I could not have ADHD. For the dumbest reasons, too:

""You're too smart""

""You're too young to be on stimulants""

""...hyperactivity? You sleep all day!""

""The ADHD is caused by bipolar disorder. Adults don't have ADHD alone""

""I can't give you a stimulant because you could lose too much weight"" (I'm obese though? lol)

and many more...

I didn't give up though. I knew the mood stabilizers and SSRIs were not doing anything. And Strattera was essentially a sugar pill to me. I jumped from doctor to doctor. Each one of them agreeing that I had symptoms of ADHD but insisting that I was bipolar.

I started speaking up for myself. I started reading everything I could about mental health. I was firm in telling them that I did not believe I had bipolar disorder and it made no sense considering I don't have an issue with depression or mania. I started refusing the Strattera, with one doctor even telling me that it could take OVER A YEAR for Strattera to kick in when it still wasn't working after 8 months.

Finally, it happened. I went to a new doctor. She almost laughed at the fact that I kept being diagnosed as bipolar with no real signs of it. She was SHOOK at the fact that none of these doctors offered any other medication for ADHD and that my anxiety was ignored. She prescribed me Vyvanse that day and asked me to come back in two weeks.

My life changed that day. When I first went into her office I was failing school, unable to work, obese, unable to remember anything, all tasks being difficult to complete, picking my skin, constantly being tired, and maladaptive daydreaming for hours a day.

**What happened after medication:**

That Vyvanse, along with finding a care team that listens to me, **got me my first 4.0 ever this past** **semester**, despite COVID switching all my classes to online. It made me to **start eating healthy again**. It made me **enjoy decorating my home and keeping it clean**. It made me enjoy **working out**. It made me wake up **feeling refreshed in the morning**. It made me **realize I'm a fantastic** **programmer**. It got me **back into playing music and video games**. It got me a **cyber security internship**. It helped me **remember to reply to my friends and family, which has strengthened our connection.** Oh, and I **stopped picking my skin for the first time since I was 6 years old!!**

The other who doctors didn't listen to me or didn't ""believe"" in ADHD told me I would get addicted to meth, become underweight, and have terrible reactions to stimulants without taking mood stabilizers or anti-psychotics. They refused to look at my ADHD as a valid diagnosis alone.

**Basically, what I'm saying is to please not give up**. **If you are from a close-minded town, have a family who doesn't take you seriously, or your doctor refuses to try other forms of treatment, there is still a way for you to overcome these obstacles. Stay strong. Pay attention to how YOU feel. Be an advocate for yourself.**

I struggled with these things for years and while it hasn't fixed all my issues (social anxiety is still p bad) it has helped change me into the human I wanted to be. And I'm not even done yet.

**Do not give up. I am cheering for you! &lt;3**"

This summer, I had a job lined up at a mid sized company that I was pretty excited about, until it got cancelled due to COVID. Luckily, I’ve been able to land a remote internship at a very early stage startup with a, at least to me, very promising mission (but with little infrastructure or scaleability rn). The company has a total of two founders (both with prior entrepreneurship experience and both very intelligent people) who handle operational and logistical stuff (steps to take, things to implement, product planning, etc.) while I’m the sole engineer. Right now, I’ve built a simple web app that handles the current process, although the complex technical part of the product (which will eventually allow for scaleability) is not yet implemented, and is honestly very overwhelming to think about. That being said, even though the company is very early stages, it has been accepted into a well known seed accelerator, and we’re looking to produce a functional product by the end of the summer for a seed demo.

Anyways, my question is: given that I think in the long run, the startup has a promising future, is working here for this summer and potentially part time during the school year into full time next summer a good career choice for an undergraduate CS major? The alternative being a personal project + leetcode + all that other traditional stuff in hopes of landing a large tech job. 

Really struggling to plan out where to devote the bulk of my time working, any advice would be greatly appreciated."

I'd Rather Die than Go Back There [Part 1],Masaman14,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/hiq5su/we_discovered_a_new_island_in_the_pacific_ocean/," I was laying on my back in a calm and serene sea, gentle waves lapped against my body and warm sunlight shone upon my face. I couldn't be quite sure just how I got here, but this place seemed oddly relaxing in a way, at least for the time. A distant chirping, or perhaps clicking filled the void of sound and I let out a gasp and took in my surroundings. The white-yellow light of the sun slowly but surely faded to a muted blue tone as the rest of the sky began to darken and the water around me started to shift from a crystal-clear aquamarine to a dark, ugly shade of maroon, radiating out from the sides before engulfing my submerged and helpless body. Indescribable pain shot threw me. I knew I had to wake up. 

  
  *Wake up.* 

  
  My eyes snapped open and I quickly leaned over to grab the television remote to turn off the channel that had apparently been playing all night. 

  
  It was the worst nautical catastrophe to strike the Pacific, even the world, since the disaster that hit Tōhoku, Japan in March of 2011. Over 13,000 civilians dead in 12 countries, with the most severely affected locations in the state of Hawaii and the insular nations of Papua New Guinea and the Marshall Islands and infrastructure damage as far away as Sydney, Australia. As the United States and several Pacific nations reeled from this inexplicable tragedy, I stretched back in my recliner and halted the daily stream of news that had been pouring out of my television and into my ears. I had heard, but not exactly listened to the variety of pundits assigning blame to various personalities and agencies. The Hall tsunami (named after the Hall islands where the tsunami first made landfall) had remained plastered on my TV, newspaper and internet homepages and was all anyone ever talked about in the past week, especially in my home of Auckland, New Zealand. The truth was not a single living soul could've predicted just why or how this event could've taken place and I was one of the few people on Earth who was to become privy to this knowledge. 

  
  I had always known it might take a while for my master's of science in cell and microbiology to pan out, but it had always been a stark passion of mine ever since my family's move out here in the middle of the largest body of water on Earth, and although my parents had long ago moved back to the United States, I had decided to stay out in the islands and pursue my interest in the fascinating lifeforms found here; a product of millions of years of isolated evolution. Upon learning of the small and harmless flightless avian species of the kiwi that provides the nickname for locals around here, and comparing it to the gargantuan moa bird that towered twice as high as a man and is rumored to have even hunted human children before it's extinction, New Zealand truly had a firm grasp on my attention as a microcosm of evolution for a variety of species across the animal kingdom. Even the natives of this strange and remote island were of great interest; an entirely unique culture nearly wiped from the histories when exposed to an invading force of warfare and disease. 

  
  My shoddy 5th floor 1 room apartment wasn't exactly the peak of glamour, which is why I jumped at the opportunity to make something more of my meager existence. No wife, no kids, no family, very few local friends to speak of; what did I have to lose when I was contacted November 13th with the offer of a very lucrative, very taciturn job regarding the Hall tsunami? I was working in the Biology Research Center at the University of Auckland when I was approached with the offer. They were Americans from what I could gather, same as me; their presence and demeanor demanding a certain aura of respect you just don't see outside of military or law enforcement personnel. I was informed that I wouldn't be fully informed on the exact extent and specifications of the mission until I met with them at the American Consulate General down the street and agreed to their conditions. I packed my bags that very night. 

  
  “So you're telling me the Hall tsunami is some kind of supernatural event?” I inquired a few minutes into my briefing with the same gruff looking man who had met with me the other night at the university. 

  
  “Not supernatural, it just appears to be caused by forces outside of the realm of what we consider.... normal. What it is exactly, we're not sure, which is part of the reason your team will be investigating the epicenter of this event,” he responded in a somewhat short tone. 

  
  “Yes sir, but with all due respect, and I'm not sure if they informed you of this, I'm a biologist specialized in cellular and microbial life. Marine biology is not my field of expertise.” 

  
  “You won't be examining the sea, we already have a separate team that will be dispatched for that in the upcoming days after meeting up with you on the ground. We've discovered a small landmass that's surfaced near the epicenter of the tsunami that we've designated UL-1052.” 

  
  I stared at the stoic jarhead incredulously, contemplating whether this was some kind of hoax or not. 

  
  “It's not volcanic in origin, and it doesn't appear to be seismically active. It's an ovoid shaped island roughly 3.4 by 1.4 miles across, around 3.74 square miles in land area with no significant surrounding lagoon or atoll. Fairly flat in shape, but estimated to have a sloping concave topography that rises 50, maybe 100 feet.” 

  
  I attempted to swallow the bizarre information that was just foisted upon my mind.   

  
  “B-but we have maps and satellites and GPS, islands don't just appear on our planet out of nowhere!” I was growing noticeably more nervous and sweaty by this point. 

  
  “Well, this one did,” he responded in a seemingly collected and unfazed tone that told me he had delivered this information to many before me. 

  
  ”You don't think it's from... space? Like an aster-” 

  
  “Extraterrestrial? Unlikely, considering we would've noticed a 4 sq mile rock flying into Earth's atmosphere. An asteroid of that size would be world-ending, to say the least. We know that it surfaced at the precise pinpoint center of the tsunami down to the decimal point and we know that weather, tidal patterns and ocean currents all remained relatively standard for this time of year before the Hall tsunami and the emergence of the island.”   

  
  I was at a loss for words. If what he said was true, it would completely revolutionize our understanding of geology and plate tectonics. There can be major shifts along fault lines that cause massive changes in elevation along the sea floor and there are even cases of volcanic islands sprouting up in extremely short time periods, but an island large enough to create such a tsunami simply appearing in the middle of the ocean was certainly new to me, and I imagine most mainstream biologists as well. 

  
  “Your flight leaves this Friday at 0500 hours. You'll be on a commercial flight out of Auckland to Honolulu, and from there you'll be taking a charter flight to Wake Island where you'll rendezvous with the rest of your team. The navy will be escorting you and 15 other members to the epicenter, 160 miles Southeast of Wake Island where you'll conduct your select research and exploration that has been assigned to you for two weeks, after which a check of $350,000 USD will be wired into your bank account.” 

  
  I read aloud the NDA he had handed me at the start of the briefing. “...the disclosing of any details of said assignment on UL-1052 or dissemination of any classified information gathered before, during or after your contract has expired will result in...” 

  
  “Will result in death under the Espionage Act of 1917 and Sedition Act of 1918, that's correct. Any rumors of said mission or landmass being circulated online or in the media will be denied by the US Navy and Air Force and those spreading that information will be treated as criminal foreign assets and dealt with accordingly.” 

  
  Hawaii couldn't get to me any sooner. Truth be told, my 9 hour flight seemed to drag on forever as my heart pumped and legs thumped in unison the entire duration of the flight out of a mixture of excitement, fear and anxiety. Although the money was a great bonus, my main motivation was possibly being a part of one of the greatest biological and geological discoveries of the 21st century. I couldn't help but stare out the window into the pitch black abyss of the ocean that surrounded my plane and wondered just what could've emerged from it's depths. I was never one to be too terribly afraid of swimming or water, but something about deep oceans, rivers and lakes always unnerved me ever since I had learned about some of the more unsavory prehistoric leviathans that dwelt where human eyes were never meant to view them. 

  
  Upon arrival in Honolulu, it didn't take long to meet with the suits, or rather, for them to meet up with me. Nevertheless, obtaining my bags after landing was still the usual pain in the ass. *Guess there are some things even mass government surveillance can't fix.* We only had a couple hours to catch up with our fellow crew members at Hickam Air Force Base before we took off, but it was honestly more than enough time since there were only 4 other passengers on our plane, much to my surprise. Strangely enough, I appeared to be the only American, or at least, only American-born member there, as I learned quite quickly that the first coworkers of mine that I met, Singh and Kekana, were South African, and just so happened to be husband and wife. 

  
  “Before you get the wrong idea,” Singh began shortly after he was introduced to me, “my wife was actually the first to be contracted. It's a good thing that I came... highly recommended in the field, or I probably wouldn't have gotten this job.” Singh began to ramble on over just how long and why they had been working as anthropologists in Hawaii for what seemed like ages when I decided to introduce myself to the large, and I do mean **large** man that was sitting across from us in the aircraft hangar.  

  
   “You must be... security?” I asked, making eye contact with the hulk of a man.  

  
   “No,” he quickly interjected with a slight Eastern European accent. “Marine biological scientist.”  

  
   I quickly apologized for my error, introduced myself and slithered down into my chair in embarrassment at my somewhat prejudicial assumption, but Simonov appeared to more or less laugh it off, replying “it's not just you little men with glasses that can be smart, you know.”  

  
   The last of my coworkers to arrive at the hangar, Sofia, a petite Filipino geologist, was also likely the most pleasant and the only one to introduce herself to me. I found out she was one of the youngest members there, only a couple years older than myself at 29, and maybe I would've gone for the phone number had they not confiscated our cell phones upon entering the base. It had been quite a long time since I had any sort of serious relationship or interaction with the opposite sex, if I was being honest with myself.  

  
   “Hey did you take a look at that Simon-guy?” Sofia wryly whispered into my ear when we boarding the plane. “He's gotta be at least 6 and a half feet tall and he looks just like Arnold... Schwartzman?... you know? The actor? There's no way he's our marine life expert.”  

  
  I merely gave her a smile and a nod as I took my seat, glad to see at least someone had a sense of humor. I was informed that the rest of the crew was already waiting for us at the Air Force base on Wake Island, most of whom had already chartered a flight directly from the mainland United States, and hence we were to depart almost as soon as our arrival on one of the most remote islands on the planet. 

  
  Our remaining crew was just about what I was expecting for an expedition such as this. Including myself, we consisted of 2 biologists, 3 anthropologists, 4 geologists, 4 military personnel and survival experts (including a field medic who doubled as our team's dietitian) and 3 miscellaneous experts focused on archaeology, paleontology and whatever other fields the US government had deemed might be in any way even tangentially relevant to our mission. Whether we would all end up being lifelong friends after this astounding and groundbreaking opportunity I wasn't yet sure of, but I knew I for one wasn't going to treat this as a vacation. They paid us, and they paid us handsomely for a reason, whether we were the absolute best or most professional scientists in our field wasn't important. 

  
  After getting to know some of the other passengers on our half-day long naval escort, it didn't take long for me realize that nearly all of us on this mission had one thing in common. We had no families, few friends and minimal connections back home. I was just a glorified intern when I was contacted by the G-men, Simonov was unemployed, Sofia had only just finished her Master's, our more eccentric anthropologist, Allen, was participating in this strange new trend where Millennials live in their vans and travel across the country and most of the other crew members didn't really seem to have stable jobs from those that I spoke to. None had children. 

  
  This would no doubt ensure our utmost concentration and devotion to this reasonably short expedition before the next team would be brought in. I knew that in the marines, this kind of mentality takes months of training to achieve, but hand-picking the loners and outcasts of society sped that process up exponentially. For most other more integrated members of society, they might hesitate before risking their life to save a member of their crew if they had kids or loved ones back home- that is, if the mission even came to that point. One of the archaeologists, Rick, wouldn't stop talking about how the money was going to make from this mission was going to fix his failing marriage with his wife back home.   

  
  I imagine an added bonus is that very few people would come digging in the case of any... disappearances on the mission, considering we were forbidden under penalty of death of informing any outside parties to our whereabouts for the next 2 weeks. I had no doubt that the only reason Singh had been conscripted in the first place was so that he wouldn't come looking for his wife had anything happened to her, but I certainly wasn't going to tell him that. It was a slightly unnerving revelation to say the least, but understandable. 

  
  Nearly everyone crowded around the bow of the ship when someone managed to peak just the smallest speck on the horizon. I hadn't been sure what to think when I had first heard of it, but I stared slack-jawed as we grew closer and closer and discovered that the island was not made up of basalt or other volcanic stone like I would've expected, but nearly enveloped in a canopy of green. Grasses, bushes and trees covered this spectacle of nature, and had I not known better, I would've thought we were back in Hawaii. 

  
  “How is there...” I muttered to Sofia before trailing off. 

  
  “I don't know,” she replied without losing her gaze towards the island, clearly understanding what I was going to ask her. 

  
  The ship's dinghy was dispatched when we were about 600 yards offshore in cycles of 4 randomly assigned groupings. I was somewhat disheartened to hear that Sofia would be among the second group of 4 to be dropped off at the island, while I was among the last (I suppose my masculine instincts weren't entirely dead) but the security team (who were the first to be dispatched) assured us that when they established a perimeter and set up base camp, it would be just as safe as there as it was on the boat. They set off around 1 PM that afternoon and it seemed like hours before the dinghy returned, empty of supplies and ready to pick up the second assigned grouping. 

  
  “I'll see you there,” Sofia assured me, as she, Simonov, Rick and another I hadn't yet made myself acquainted with clambered into the minuscule vessel and soon set off.  

  
  It was another 30 minutes before the next set of names were called off, and naturally, another 30 before the last shuttle of the day arrived. Allen, Singh, Kekana and I climbed in for what may not have been the most treacherous boat ride of my life, but certainly felt like it, with my heart thumping away and my stomach churning at every wave. I was a bit hesitant to climb ashore for one reason alone: I always hated the feeling of wet sand getting into my shoes, but I sucked it up and stepped onto this virgin soil, untouched by mankind for who knows how long. *Maybe all of history?* 

  
  Out of all the sights I took in while Wagner (one of the more burly soldiers) escorted us through the jungle, was just how normal most of the flora appeared around us; luscious green vegetation, palm trees with ripe coconuts, ferns that were were so densely placed, it made it almost impossible to see more than a dozen yards in any direction. Postcards didn't even look this pristine. However, during our short 10 minute waltz through the jungle I began to notice them; the spires, large red rocks jutting out from the surface every so often. From what I could tell, they were maybe 4 ft wide at the base and roughly 15 ft tall, gradually tapering off once they left the ground, colored a rather vibrant hue of orange-red. 

  
  “What are the structures for?” I asked while motioning to to one of the spires. 

  
  “I don't know,” Wagner replied. “They were already here before we arrived. They're spaced apart all over the surface of the island.” 

  
  “Do you think they're natural? Man-made perhaps?” 

  
  “Look kid, I'm just here to keep all of you from drowning or getting poison ivy. I don't have a damn clue what this is.” 

  
  I took mental note that some crew members were certainly appearing to be more reliable than others, and kept pace with my equipment in hand as all four of us that had just arrived on the island gazed in awe at this alien-looking landscape. 

  
  As our hike ended and I set my eyes upon base camp I was pleasantly surprised with how much progress had been made in the past few hours since the first dinghy was dispatched. I mused over the bizarre situation I found myself in for only a minute or two before joining in conversation with some of the other researchers. Sofia explained to me that although pillar or spire-like structures made out of rock do indeed exist in nature, it's almost unheard of to see them spaced out so evenly apart, leading us to the only logical conclusion that they had to have been man-made. 

  
  As we discussed, I kicked around some of the barren soil around my feet (a bad habit I had acquired while in the field), staring bewildered at the others.   

  
  “But who could've built such structures on a **sunken** island?” I asked the rest of the crew with emphasis on the 'sunken' bit. “And this far out as well?” 

  
  Kekana suggested that perhaps some great sea-faring people had populated the island generations ago, only to have it sink due to shifting plate tectonics before having reemerged after the recent Hall tsunami, but she was quickly shot down by the geologists who revealed it would've been impossible for an island of this size to disappear without the whole plate sinking or the sea levels rising, which would've heavily affected the neighboring islands as well. 

  
  It was at this point that I noticed that I was no longer kicking up a cloud of brown dust and debris, but rather felt my shoes scuff against something solid, perhaps only a few inches below the layer of topsoil. I looked down and saw red stone staring back at me and reached down to touch it with my hand. It was smooth, hot and somewhat porous, and more or less matched up with the texture found on the spires that littered the island. Sofia and the other geologist looked as puzzled as I was upon closer inspection of the stone, claiming that they couldn't quite pinpoint exactly what type of rock it was, but that it didn't appear volcanic in origin. 

  
  “I think this answers the question of whether they're man-made or not,” Sofia chimed in, much to the team's agreement, “but how did they form?” He bent down and scraped at the red rock with a knife, finding it quite easy to grind into a fine powder. 

  
  “Why don't we try taking one of the pillars down with the sledgehammer? We could analyze the core and determine it's properties and mineral components,” Rick eagerly interjected? 

  
  “Whoa, cool it,” I stammered out. “For all we know this could be one of the world's next UNESCO world heritage sights or one of the 7 wonders of the world. We're not 'sledging' anything.” 

  
  Digging wasn't necessarily out of the question yet due to the relatively shallow layer of soil covering the bulk of the island and the soft porous stone found beneath it, but we agreed to split up and scout out first the perimeter of the island, starting the next morning, and then explore deeper into the heart of the island in the upcoming weeks.   

  
  We had landed on the northwest side of the oval-shaped island which was tilted at a 30° axis in respect to the equator. Splitting into teams of 2, each of us were to circumnavigate the perimeter of the island and meet back at the pre-marked entrance to the base camp on the other side of the island before sundown in 6 hours. I was assigned with that meathead Wagner and another shorter soldier named Perez, along with Simonov (who by now was actually beginning to grow on me), Sofia (much to my delight), Singh, Kekana and Allen. We were the team that was to circle around the coast counter-clockwise, which at an average brisk walking speed, shouldn't have taken more than a few hours.   

  
  That night as I was busy dreaming and fantasizing about what kind of wondrous discoveries we would make, I couldn't help but experience a distinct feeling of dread. In my dream, dark raindrops pelted my body from the sky, which had quickly shifted to a gnarly blue color. Slimy dark tentacles slithered across the ground in every direction, wrapping around every living thing in it's path. I recognized that I was dreaming, but the fear was quite palpable as I could feel the sensation of every drop of dark liquid hitting my skin and rolling down my arms. 

  
  *Wake up.* 

  
  My eyes creaked open. I was thrilled to discover that I was the first that had roused in the early hours of the morning, when the sun was still barely peaking over the horizon, but this excitement quickly dissipated upon the realization that I would have to wait until the rest of my squad awoke. I could've attempted to go back to sleep, but what would be the point considering I would have to wake up in a few hours anyways, and I highly doubted that I would be able to calm my nerves enough to get some shut eye before then anyways. With that amount of time I could walk across the entire island by myself and be back before anyone noticed; and it was with that thought that I quickly rationalized what I did next. 

  
  If there's anything I hate about tropical climates, it's the humidity; sweltering, boiling, stuffy humidity that makes your skin tacky and unbelievably moist. In the twilight hours when stinging sweat rolled into my eyes and made it nearly impossible to see, I looked back at my miniature flat back in Auckland with fondness, as even the sand, dirt, mud, grime and insects couldn't compare to the- *the insects?* My thoughts interjected. It wasn't until now, 5:30 AM, trekking down the beach that I finally noticed the raucous buzzing in the worst of locations. I wondered just why it took me so long to notice the little devils considering the creeping itching sensation I felt quickly resonating across my forearms and shins and looked down to discover a plethora of small red bumps littering my skin.   

  
  The funny thing is, out of all the mysteries I expected to encounter on this strange little isle, the common mosquito definitely wouldn't have been high on the list, but I suppose if other terrestrial flora had somehow appeared on the island then it wouldn't be entirely out of the realm of possibility to assume that terrestrial fauna would as well. This realization made me seriously ponder what other Animalia or possibly extinct Animalia one could find on this long forgotten rock and it didn't take long to imagine myself getting ripped to shreds by some giant mutated Gila monster or being constricted by a stealthy python before being forced down it's horrible gaping gullet before my mind snapped back to reality and I dismissed these silly assumptions. 

  
  Was my solitary daybreak hike along the beach an incredibly selfish and possibly foolish action to take? Perhaps the latter, definitely the former, but just like a child on Christmas Eve, I couldn't help but to gorge some of my more curious instincts before the main event. I picked up a small stick, and much like a small child began to swing wildly at passing branches, bushes and leaves, imagining myself as some great explorer of old slashing through the jungle. I was so preoccupied with this monotonous juvenile task that I almost didn't notice the discolored patch of water that petered out from a large rocky outcrop which I was about to pass. 

  
  I stopped in my path to take a better look. It appeared to be a slightly lighter patch of blue water that seemed most intense near the side of the rocks rather than the open ocean. In the dim light of the morning sun it made it difficult to distinguish, but it didn't take me too long to realize the discoloration in the water was not caused by a reflection or something inside of it, but rather by a light, and it certainly wasn't coming from the sun, which had actually risen on the opposite side of island from where I was.   

  
  I cautiously approached this large stony hill jutting out into the water and mused over what could cause this luminous path whose greater source still remained obscured by the edges of the rock. I considered the possibilities of another intrepid explorer from our expedition who might've left a little earlier than I had, bringing a flashlight with him, or perhaps a small vessel had parked itself beneath the shade of the rocks and still had it's lights on. 

  
  As soon as I rounded the corner and saw what was in the rocks, I threw down my stick and I ran. 

  
  “Yes, yes Allen, you heard what I said. You speak English don't you?” I blurted out a bit more harshly than I would've meant for it to come off.   

  
  My agitation was a bit unwarranted considering I was shaking my tent-mate awake around 2 hours before we were scheduled to get up, but after the third time he groggily slurred out “whaaa?” with his eyes half open and mouth hanging agape, I was nearly at my wits end. 

  
  “Allen, I woke up a bit early to see if I could learn a bit about the trail we were scheduled to go on today when I found this huge rock on the edge of the shoreline, and in that rock facing the ocean was a cave.” 

  
  “So what?” he quickly responded before attempting to turn over and lazily swat at me with his hand. 

  
  “A cave with goddamn blue light pouring out of it.” 

  
  That woke up his curiosity a bit even if his mind was still halfway in dream land, he finally slumped forward and sat up in his sleeping bag before replying, “are you sure it was from the cave?” 

  
  “Only one way to find out.” 

  
  By reading their faces, some of the crew were personally suspicious of me, some were curious, but almost all were skeptical of my claims of a glowing phantom cave.   

  
  I attempted to explain my reasoning further as to why we needed to leave as soon as possible instead of at the scheduled 9 AM, “look, we don't know if this is some kind of natural process that occurs on this island and how long it's going to last. It could have dissipated by the time we reach there this afternoon.” 

  
  “I'm not skipping breakfast,” Simonov said as he unfolded his arms and picked up one of our prepackaged MREs. “Okay, I'm ready to go now,” he corrected himself before kneeling down and picking up a second package. 

  
  “Kid, you're not thinking straight. Let's all get our heads on right before we start breaking not only our schedule, but also our protocol,” that smug and unreasonably calm soldier Wagner assured me as he put his hand on my shoulder a bit too tightly for my liking. 

  
  “You!” I proclaimed in a bout of nerves and excitement. “Why haven't you radioed this in yett? You need to inform the higher-ups now. We don't have the proper equipment for a full cave exploration and we need to get it sooner rather than later.” 

  
  “I for one really want to see this cave,” Sofia pitched in. “Who else wants to see which ecosystems would develop in an isolated cave that already lies on an isolated island?” 

  
  “Lights in those caves probably means people,” Singh quickly added. “Are we not the only ones here on this island?” 

  
  “People?” Allen inquired, eyebrow raised. “My money's on aliens.” 

  
  *The guy really was a lot stranger than I had previously assumed*, I thought, and most of the crew's facial expressions mirrored my inner voice. 

  
  “Wagner, you need to tell your superiors about this right now,” I nearly shouted as I took his hand off my shoulder and jutted my scrawny finger at his chest in a burst of confidence I didn't know I had. 

  
  “It doesn't matter if we tell them now!” Wagner yelled, eyes ablaze. “They've already known about the caves since before you got here.” 

  
  The entire camp fell silent as all eyes fixed upon the stoic muscle-bound figure. 

  
  “Look, a few days before you were recruited, we sent a purely exploratory scouting team onto UL-1052 and we encountered the caves directly before leaving. This wasn't part of your briefing because we didn't deem it necessary information. We brought the desired equipment for cave exploration,” he seemingly chided, eyes moving around the crowd that had formed around us. “And besides, we couldn't contact them even if we wanted to.” 

  
  A few of the more nervous-looking members let out short gasps of shock before Simonov spoke up, “what the hell is wrong with your radios?” 

  
  “Nothing! The radios work just fine offshore, but for whatever reason when we're within a mile radius of this place, our equipment goes haywire. Radios don't pick up any frequencies, satellites can't transmit jack, and with most electronics it's a complete crap-shoot whether they work at all, compasses don't even point north for god's sake! Go ahead, try it for yourselves.” 

  
  “So you brought us all the way out knowing we couldn't have contacted our family? Friends? Anyone!?” Singh exclaimed while glancing at his wife. 

  
  “You knew what you were signing yourselves up for, nothing was out of the question! That is, assuming you even read the damn paper you put your name on. Or you were just too blinded by that triple-figure payout?” Wagner harshly rebuked. “Technically...” he said staring around the group. “We're all in quarantine right now. Nobody is leaving this island even if they wanted to, so no need to get antsy and rush the mission.” 

  
  As red-faced and eager as I was, I knew Wagner was right. We were to eat breakfast, pack up the designated supplies and then set off for the opposite sides of the island just as we had intended since yesterday. If Wagner was telling the truth then the lights in those caves weren't going anywhere, and neither were we for the next 14 days... At least. 

  
  “So, you said it's like a glowing blue light shining out of those caves,” Sofia huffed as she struggled to catch up to me and lug the 30 lb rucksack I had seen her packing earlier. 

  
  “Yeah, almost like a neon blue, but it was pretty dim. Maybe due to being obfuscation from the light of the morning sun. We're like 2 minutes away, you'll see pretty soon.” 

  
  “Pretty brave of you to go running off without everyone,” she beamed. “Or pretty stupid,” she tacked on while we trudged through the sand. 

  
  “Look, there's the rock now,” I quickly pointed out as I could feel myself growing just a little bit more anxious, and it wasn't entirely due to approaching an isolated subterranean landscape with completely bizarre properties. 

  
  I was remiss to see that Wagner had since taken the lead since we left base camp, but he probably did know a lot more about survival and exploration than I did, and I felt far safer with him and Simonov around and I'm sure Kekana and Sofia did as well. 

  
  “Follow me, it's quite shallow,” Wagner assured us as he rolled up his pant legs and began to wade into the water closest to the rock. 

  
  We formed a line hugging the wall of rock as the water began to rise up past my shins, knees, waist and even began to lap up to my chest, and rather humorously Sofia struggled to keep it beneath her chin, but after some time the sea floor began to rise again as we came up to the mouth of the cave. 

  
  “This is the rock that you saw, right?” Simonov leaned over to ask me. “I don't see any lights.” 

  
  “They were here. Maybe the sun's just too bright at this time of day.” 

  
  Eventually we all managed to get out of the water, most of us looking like we had just taken a bath with our clothes on, and we crowded around the entrance to the cave; a circular maw about a dozen feet high and perhaps that same width across. However, unlike earlier, there were no spectacular lights flashing or shining of any kind, just a dark cave with bland grayish slime covering the walls, likely made up of some kind of algae or fungus. 

  
  “So kid, are you done creaming your pants?” Wagner snidely remarked. “We'll enter by the book, and after we're done wasting our time, we'll go back the same way we came and circle back around the perimeter of the island as we planned.” 

  
  “Well, what are we waiting for?” I said as I pulled out my headlamp and strode past him. “Let's go.” 

  
  The first thing I noticed inside the cave was the smell, an immediate acrid stench of rotten fish and a hint of something metallic, which seemed to be... *Copper? Iron?* Not to mention the dramatic rise in humidity that made the musk of the cave so overpowering that it felt like I was breathing in the noxious chemicals directly into my mouth with every breath, which I suppose, technically was true on a microscopic level. 

  
  *Not the most romantic of locales*, I thought to myself, glancing back at Sofia who had a cloth wrapped over her mouth and nose with her hand. 

  
  “What do you think of these cave walls?” I shouted back to Sofia after a good 200 yards of walking. 

  
  The tunnel was sloped at such an angle that the cave entrance was already completely obscured behind us, with not an ounce of the sun's rays able to reach us in these depths. 

  
  “The walls? I can't even see the walls or tell what kind of rock is underneath because of this junk coating everything,” she replied, lifting the cloth only for the precise amount of time it took to say the words before covering it back up for dear life. 

  
  “Rock? Wall?” Simonov retorted from behind me. “No, I'm pretty sure this slime **is** the wall.” 

  
  Simonov, stopped Sofia in her tracks, asking to see her bag. She reluctantly obliged and he pulled out one of the long metal instruments she had managed to stuff in there used for measuring rocks- *Or something like that?* What it's real purpose was, I didn't know. 

  
  “Look,” he announced, as he plunged the 5 foot metal stick into the side of the cave. We stared awestruck as the instrument sank 6 inches, then 9, then a foot, then went in all the way up to the point where Simonov's hand was gripping the thin metal rod, at least two and a half feet deep. 

  
  “What on Earth is that?” Kekana blurted out before Simonov violently ripped the rod out of the wall, releasing an unexpected (even to him) flurry of viscous blue liquid. 

  
  Simonov seemed more shocked than anyone, quickly jumping back before his legs and lower body could get plastered with this unknown slime. It seemed exceedingly hot, as steam quickly rose from the growing puddle at his feet, and to our shock the wall began to ever so subtly undulate and quiver around the point of entry. 

  
  “Didn't expect that to happen did you?” Sofia quipped, wrenching the rod from his hand and wiping off the blue slime with the handkerchief she was previously pressing against her mouth. 

  
  Wagner pulled out his own machete he kept on the sheath buckled around his belt and curiously scraped it along the ground before attempting a mimicry of Simonov's stunt, finding that the ground appeared to be made of a much more solid substance than the gunk on either side of us. 

  
  “Hold on...” I murmured mostly to myself. “Everyone turn off your headlamps.”

   
  “What for?” Wagner retorted. 

  
  “Just do it!” I cried out. 

  
  As our headlamps went out one by one, it was quickly apparent that this was no ordinary cave, as we found ourselves not surrounded by the pitch black darkness we would've expected. The first thing I noticed was the glow of the neon blue substance that had spurted out of the wall and pooled on the floor; quickly dimming in the warm air, but still glowing nonetheless. Then, glancing all around, it was easy to see that the slime on the walls we had assumed was simply some kind of mold or algae earlier was glowing blue as well. 

  
  “That explains that,” I mumbled, too star-struck to rub it in anyone's face. 

  
  We all gazed around the gently pulsating, dimly glowing blue walls in awe, even Wagner. The texture was difficult to describe; a somewhat uneven patchwork of what looked like giant dark blue arteries (carrying what I assumed to be the luminescent liquid that had nearly coated Simonov earlier) along with lighter blue fibrous wiring that branched off in every direction, all coated some kind of thick translucent gelatinous substance. 

  
  “I told you it was aliens,” Allen said, staring at the mesmerizing albeit somewhat unnerving pattern that surrounded us, but this time no one bothered to disagree with him. 

  
  “What's that?” Sofia exclaimed, sticking her finger further out into the cave at a darker spot on the ground. 

  
  Without saying a word, I swiftly switched my headlamp back on and jogged the 20 or so feet down the cave toward the object that appeared to be embedded halfway in the ground. With some hesitation due to the slime layer that coated not only the floor, but the object as well, I knelt down and wiped away the dark slimy sheen, revealing a black round object. 

  
  “What is it?” Simonov repeated coming up behind me, as I frantically fought to pull it up from it's cozy abode. 

  
  It didn't take long before I had pulled the object out of the ground with grime and sweat covered hands, and couldn't believe my eyes. It was a helmet; a rusty military helmet. And on the side was printed only one word in faded letters:

I just graduated with a B.S. in CS from Georgia Tech with a 3.94 GPA.

However, I don't have any work experience. I did not prioritize internships during college (something I regret).

So here I am. I've set up my LinkedIn and created a resume to the best of my ability (had a experienced friend in the same field who looked it over).

I've primarily been looking on LinkedIn for ""Entry Level Software Developer"" jobs, but I feel like I'm missing other job searching avenues that might be better suited to my situation.

Most of the ""entry level"" jobs that I see require \~3 years of experience or other qualifications that aren't likely to be possessed by a 0 work experience individual like myself.

I'm really looking to just get my feet wet and (finally) get some experience doing what I love in the real world. I'm not so concerned with the pay (though, there are limits - I still have to live!). I just want some experience so I can better catch the eye of a company that truly interests me and matches what I would like to do with my life.

Any tips regarding how I should approach finding my first job would be a much appreciated gift!

What other website resources would you suggest for finding job opportunities? Glassdoor? Indeed?

How can I better filter out the more experienced positions and find ones for \*true\* entry level candidates?"

hitx6b,10,2020-06-30,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (6/29/2020),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/hitx6b/weekly_job_qa_thread_6292020/,"Hi all,

Here is the eighteenth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer? That's completely up to what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.

All the best,

\--Nick

hiv4uq,2,2020-06-30,Should I bother learning Node.js?,kinetic87,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/hiv4uq/should_i_bother_learning_nodejs/,"I just got a webdev internship with no prior web experience. I primarily use TS (which I love) and vanilla JS for the backend. So far, I've survived checking documentation. But should I bother investing time in Node.js? 

I am not a fan of JS and it's not for me, but I heard it pays well, correct me if I'm wrong."
hixqg2,0,2020-06-30,The Grind is Killing Me,tomsmith856,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/hixqg2/the_grind_is_killing_me/,"I am a CS student getting ready for internship applications next year - the grinding I am having to go through is ridiculous.

Approximately one LeetCode problem a day (1 - 2 hours), the project grind for my portfolio and the open-source grind (getting up to speed on a decent open-source project can take weeks, if not months) is ruining my life. Oh - and it seems the latest thing is certifications. So now I have to start grinding for cloud certifications as well.

I spend most evenings overwhelmed by worry and stress, grinding myself into an early grave - and for what?

I'd feel better if I knew that once I was in the field, I could calm down a bit. But nope - working developers tell me that they constantly grind to ensure they're ready for job interviews if they get let go.

Is this it? Is this our fate? Grinding LeetCode/projects/open-source/certifications/new frameworks/new technologies/new languages until the day I retire/die?

The saturation of this field has ruined it and sapped all the fun out of learning and hobby coding."
hiyfu9,1,2020-06-30,Ok...getting kinda of discouraged again,ThrowThatBacon,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/hiyfu9/okgetting_kinda_of_discouraged_again/,"So, I (28 M) have been diagnosed with ADHD since I turned 18. I was put on vyvanse and had an adverse reaction. The we tried Straterra and it worked real nicely for years until I turned 25, I started noticing that I was really depressed all the time, and when the generic came out my insurance wouldn’t cover the name brand...the generic was basically like taking a skittle that made me depressed. I went to Adderal, which worked for a while, and now I’m on Vyvanse again and have been for about two years. I can feel it kick in each day and wear off. I was taking escitalopram (Lexapro) for awhile but finally stopped taking it and switched to Wellbutrin about a year ago. I had an old quack of a Dr try to diagnose me with Bipolar and take my off the stimulants. I told him that wasn’t an option and I disagree with his diagnosis (turns out he didn’t think ADHD was a real neurological issue). He gave me Lamotrigine (Lamictal) and I have been taking it for about 18 months. I stopped seeing him after 3 visits and just have my primary care physician managing my meds. Right now I’m taking vyvanse, Wellbutrin (generic), and lamictal (generic). 

The symptoms of ADHD (inattentive type) started showing up when I was 15. I went from a 4.0 gpa to flunking out of school. I love learning but the homework was just....physically painful....so I stopped doing it. No matter what my parents tried (positive or negative) or what a very good CB Therapist tried, nothing could convince me to do my HW. I would ace all my tests (except for a few classes that I had a hard time grasping in which I got Bs or Cs on the tests). Sadly passing the end of semester exams, demonstrating a mastery (or at least a working understanding) of the subject, and even helping/tutoring my peers...wasn’t enough to pass my classes (which I’m still confused about). 

Now I am 28, married, have a kid, and I am ending my Jr year of college and starting my Sr yr in the fall (I have been working towards this for 5 years now). Everyone always told me that college was different and that I would enjoy it. I hate it. Again, I LOVE learning. I’ll go above and beyond to learn and master the material....but some of the homework assignments just SUCK! I hate them! I’ll muscle through them and maintain straight A’s until the last couple weeks of the term. It’s like I just give up and lose all motivation....even in the classes I enjoy. I have watched all four of my classes this semester go from As to Fs and D- during the last two weeks....and I feel powerless to stop it. 

No matter what medication I take....it stops working after a few weeks or (in my current case) just makes me hyper focus on the wrong things. I have zero motivation to do my work, until it’s too late to pull the grades up to the required level. I have retaken over a third of my courses and about 1/4 of my remaining classes are retakes.

Here is where I get really distressed. I have my dream job lined up to start (potentially) in the fall of 2021...contingent upon getting my bachelors degree in the spring of 2021. I was hoping that seeing the realization of my dream so close would motivate me.....but it’s just making me feel worse about the fact that I just can’t seem to do anything. I make plans, I set time, etc. but it’s like I’m incapable of following through with them. 

This school year I have to finish my remaining credits and take an internship. My dream job is teaching gig and it is HARD CORE competitive. This may be my only chance to get it....and my stupid brain is going to stop me from reaching yet ANOTHER goal. 


What do I do?!? I’m in counseling with a Cognitive Behavioral Therapist who specializes in ADHD but I’m still really struggling. 


I think motivation is my biggest issue. It is so fleeting. I’ll be wicked motivated to do something until it comes time to actually do it.....and then it’s the worse thing in the world and I would rather do ANYTHING than that task. 



Hav any of you dealt with this successfully? I am so discouraged and ready to just say screw it and give up. I feel like ADHD has robbed me of so many things and I can’t stop it. I really am a resilient person, I have over come a TON of hardships (mentally and emotionally abusive childhood, untimely deaths which forced me to become the family patriarch at the age of 26, and more). But for some reason, I can’t beat this. 

I don’t have to have a degree to be a stay-at-home Dad, my kids won’t care if I’m ADHD, and my wife’s degree can land her a very high paying job. She wants to stay home and I want to work outside of the home.....but honestly I’m not sure if I can. I feel disabled. 

I am to the point where I would give everything physical asset I have for some sort of inpatient treatment or intensive partial inpatient treatment if it would help even a little with the ADHD that seems hell bent on destroying my life. 



TL;DR - I cannot control my ADHD and it is getting really close to taking my dream job away from me. Nothing I do works for more than a couple days or weeks. What have you tried that works? What do I do?!? I’m ready to just give up and resign myself to a lifetime of missed opportunities and failed aspirations.

*******edit********
I am seeing my counselor on Thursday. I am not suicidal or struggling with suicidal ideation, but I am beginning to understand why so many ADHD Males take that route. I sound really depressed in my post, but I am seeing someone who helps! I just don’t want to panicked anyone :)"
hiz81t,1,2020-06-30,Getting Over Fear of Failure,WhatIsThatWeird,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/hiz81t/getting_over_fear_of_failure/,"I've had trouble dealing with failure since high school. I got rejected from my dream school and ever since then I've avoided, if possible, any situation where I could fail. For example:

* I went to an easy college and dropped all my hard classes to maintain a 4.0. Whenever I felt like I might not get an A in a class, I would drop it. Even though the 4.0 was built off of easy classes, it felt like I succeeded.
* I only interviewed for one internship / job and it was at the company my brother works at. Since he is well-respected and well-liked, I was almost guaranteed to get it and I did.
* I've joined a few different teams for competitive games that I play. However, the second things start getting hard or maybe I feel like I'm at fault at all for poor performances, I quit. This has been a strain on some of my friendships

Those are a few examples of what I'm talking about. For some reason I care so much about failing. This is causing me problems now because I want to break out of my comfort zone and start interviewing for a different job. I'm not too fond of my current one and want to explore new avenues. I can't bring myself to start interviewing because of my fear of failure. I know that breaking out of my comfort zone is a good thing, because the one big time I did it recently, I met my girlfriend. But when it comes to doing it in my career, I struggle a lot.

I went to therapy for my anxiety in general and I talked about this with my therapist. She said it basically comes down to that I'm putting my self worth in what others think of me. I'm worried that if I go interview and bomb it, I will somehow be a lesser person. Not because I bombed it, but because of what I think the person who interviewed me is thinking. I'm basing my self worth on what I think other people think of me.

I know it sounds extremely silly, and typing it out, even I know that it's silly. However, it is really causing me problems as my happiness at my current job is deteriorating and making me miserable.

Does anybody have any experience getting over something like this? Are there any resources you used to help? Should I get back to therapy?"
