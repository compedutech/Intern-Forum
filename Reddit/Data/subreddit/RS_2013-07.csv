Seeing as I did not do much during my intermission(nary?) period (Summers) in High School except Sleep, Eat, Play, and Lurk. I'm looking to go above and beyond in College!

My major is International Business and Global Management/International Relations with it all falling into a Pre-Law 
Track. However I'm still undecided. =)


I'm looking at internships and non-profit organizations and not necessarily volunteer organizations either.
 
(I also never do for-profit organizations if I could do a non-profit and Never Ever affiliate myself with a religious organization.)

E.G. NOLS, Americorps, Pathways (can't do Peace Corps). http://ylamerica.org/ Something akin to that.


TL;DR So r/College what are some good Non-Profit Non-Religious-Affiliated Summer Programs/Leadership Programs or even Programs in general that are hiding under my nose?

1hgfee,17,2013-07-01,Not quite sure what I'm doing wrong here...,[deleted],GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/1hgfee/not_quite_sure_what_im_doing_wrong_here/,"Before I begin, I will state that I am currently employed, but I'm seeking a job with better pay and to try and better my credentials. Essentially, I'm at a dead end job in my field where I cannot move up the ladder, and I'm barely making ends meet financially. 

That being said, I've been with my company for three years, and I have a degree in my field along with internship and volunteer experience. My previous job was at a retail establishment I worked at for 8+ years. My degree is in education, but given the area I'm in, it is loaded with individuals with education degrees (there are seven colleges within an hour drive of where I live which all have education programs). I'm trying to utilize my degree in alternate methods (technical writing, corporate training, etc, etc). 

I've been religiously writing resumes, CV's, checking Monster, LinkedIn, and Craigslist daily, and I've lost count of the number of applications in total I've sent to locations (definitely more than 20-30+ in a month time span recently). I've had one call back, but my gut told me something shady was going on with it (it was a job I found through Craigslist) so I didn't go in for the interview. The other response was an e-mail from a company stating that I wasn't going to be considered for an interview, and two weeks later saw the position freshly posted on Monster. 

I'm not quite sure what I'm doing wrong. I've taken a huge amount of advice from resume building websites, articles, etc, when crafting my resume (it's basic look is what I used to get my current gig). Each of my cover letters is catered to whomever I'm applying for, etc, etc. The only two things I can possibly think of is first the company I work for I've found out doesn't have as great a reputation as I thought when I accepted the job. In networking, I've met a number of people whose first reaction to where I work is, ""I'm sorry"" and then they spout a slew of negative things about my company. And the second is that a recent company policy prevents supervisors from giving references, they are merely allowed to state if someone works there or not. 

I'm not quite sure what I'm doing wrong, but if anyone has some insight, or things I'm possibly missing, it'd be a great help!"

As sort of a preface, I’ll say hi. You may remember me as the one that nearly [shit themself](http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1doky4/tifu_by_being_a_dumb_shit_and_overloading_on_poop/) from a combination of a metric asston (pun? No pun? Relevant unit of measurement?) of Fiber One bars, laxative, and lactose goodness. As an update on that, I’m obviously still living and my intestines didn’t leak out my ass. I consider this a good thing. However, it took 7 days for my bowels to move those bars through me, and when it finally happened I discovered the mystery behind the creation of Stonehenge. I shat a monolithic fiber block so big I could not hardly push it out, so dense it would not dissolve with multiple flushes and so heavy it took two hands to lift. I understand the miracle of childbirth, but I digress. On to bigger and better fucks 

**Background**

This is all relevant I promise. I’m going to keep it as concise as possible so it doesn’t get *too* long. It’s just an unfortunate collection of events transpiring to create a much larger monstrous escapade of upfuckery. A rendezpoo, if you will. 

I.

So I work at a healthcare type company, let’s call it Joobly Goop. Now I’ve been working in Joobly Goop’s IT department for a few years now. I’m a pretty good worker. I know saying that is generally not a good worker thing to do, but I get all my work done, don’t dick around, stay late to finish projects, and help whenever I can. Sometimes I even remember to restock the cokes in the fridge. I have no issues to record. Until now. 

II. 

I have had on and off clam infections for about 7 weeks now. I have had swamp-poon for so long that I’m almost expecting a dragonsnake to lunge out at my face, grab me and make me disappear up my own vagina every time I bend over. Anyway, I just started taking my most recent antibiotic, Metronidazole, which is specifically for lower abdominal infections.  It also is specifically for ripping through my stomach, intestines, hopes and dreams. I have always been sensitive to all types of antibiotics, but this particular kind is like getting butthumped in reverse. 

III. 

Over the course of this spring, they hired this new intern guy. For the sake of privacy I’ll call him Wonderchild, because I secretly already do. Now this guy is a proper asshat. He is the rhinestoned and floral scented sombrero of asshats, because for some reason he’s so fabulous and his shit just don’t stink. This guy comes in at 9 and leaves at 3, taking an hour for lunch in between. Plus, he’s never around his desk when you need him. This isn’t why he’s an asshat, but it certainly contributes. 

IV. 

I got moved teams recently, to help pick up some of what mine now is doing. It’s not bad, except I wasn’t too knowledgeable on their particular scent of IS. No big deal. I integrated pretty well, was pretty quiet etc. But this time I stuck out like an awkward pubescent boner through athletic shorts. I was the turd that streaked the perfectly bleached tighty-whities of the corporate office. 


**The Convergeance** 

On to the main act. The best of the best of the worst of my life, lightly frosted with shit and dusted with crushed dignity. So the company I work for manages hospitals. Each hospital has a couple servers in the data center for bills, patient records, e-mail, et al. 

I never work with virtualization. I was used to set-ups, but not maintenance. So a lot of these servers have virtualized partitions for some of the services (I still don’t fully understand this, make note that this is only my 4th week on this team). You have to use software to manage them. So my job was to run patches on this one cluster of servers that belongs to some hospital somewhere in [Redacted]. 

So I’m sitting here running patches while Wonderchild is supposed to be looking over my shoulder, since, even though he’s an intern, no one wants to fuck with my training and just gave it to him to supervise me. However, he wasn’t supervising, because this tampon of a man chucked deuces right after I started and did his famous vanishing act. The fucker is harder to find than Houdini and I was half expecting to pull him out of my pocket. Mistake #1. 

So I’m basically sitting there, minding my business. I start a new patch and it’s like ’13 hours left’. Damn patch, you thirsty. So I leave it to its devices in the virtual center while I work on something else. I’m typing away when my stomach decides to offer its opinion on the matter with a *squeeeeeee*.  “Hm, that was weird.” 

Keep typing. Then the next sound I heard resonating through my poop chute was only what I think translates from Stomachese to something like “HEY CUNTFUNGUS, DID I FUCKING STUTTER?” because it was a low tone, a husky roll of a noise, like the trills on a snare being replicated by Barry White’s vibrato, only much much less pleasant because it quickly escalated into a “WOOOOOOHHHHHHH” kind of like a boat horn. I knew I had to get the fuck out of there and down the hall to the bathroom.  One problem, I'm not supposed to leave the servers up if I'm not working on them and no one else is around to watch them. So I paused the patches and locked my computer, very determined not to soil my freshly dry-cleaned work pants, and galloped on air to all the way to the restroom. Mistake #2

The assplosion was intense. Sweat beading down my forehead. I was in legitimate pain. I felt like I was holding my ass’s hair back while it puked after a regretful night. And in between pukes it would try and reassure me like “it’s ok honey I think I’m almost d-“ *BLEEEH*. I felt sorry for the person that came to use the restroom as well, because it was quickly becoming noxious in there. So much so that I considered notifying the Environmental Protection Agency.  When I emerged, my manager looked concernicus, but whatever, he's a manager something probably happened because something always happens. There’s always some TweedleTwat that is like “hurrduurrr” and fucks something up. 

But then the rest of my team was scurrying around like ""what the shit omg"" like someone just put a puppy down right in front of them or something. So I was now curious. I walked up and asked one of them what was wrong and he said in a very exasperated tone, “Operations in [Redacted] went black.”

Oh fuck me gently with a chainsaw. What I said was, “Oh no, that’s not good.” What I was thinking was ""oh my fucking shit what did I do"". I tried not to look too conspicuous as I pretty much lunged myself at my computer and unlocked it. When I finally saw what had happened I almost shit myself a SECOND time. 

Instead of pausing the patches, in my haste I disabled the cluster completely. And since they were mid-patch, the drives got corrupted. When the dust settled and we all got busy working on how to actually FIX the issue, my manager just looked at me and shook his head. 

I was that TweedleTwat. I fucked up. 

**TL;DR** Maybe I should work in business. 

Edit: Before anyone asks, I didn't kill anyone. They have paper copies of patient records. "

I'm here today to talk to you about not dropping your laptop.

So the same user from ""What did I Just telll you..."" came to my cube this morning after the move with her laptop.  She has it on the select boot device screen.  Only the Optical Drive and Network adapter are listed.  So I power it down and boot to internal Hard Drive diag.  Of course the diagnostic couldn't run because the hard drive was thoroughly deceased.  Having enough to tell me what needs to happen I directed the user to go to our actual help desk room (which I don't sit at on Mondays) to obtain a loaner laptop as I don't keep them in my cube.  The user just stands there staring at me.  So again I said ""I don't keep any loaners down here you'll have to go up stairs.""  The user then says ""There's only one lady up there.""

To give you some background, my Front Line support team consists of myself, an Intern, a contract sysadmin, and a full time Graduate.  The Graduate is the lady.  She still has a bit to learn, but that's why we're rotating her through the different IT groups before she gets a permanent seat.

Anyway, the user had absolutely 0 confidence in my graduate's ability to get the issue fixed.  The user kept constantly asking for me, unfortunately my Monday mornings are packed full of conducting IT orientations which is why I'm not in the hot-seat on Mondays.

Still though, it's depressing that even a female user has no faith in a female IT admin to fix her issue.

tl;dr Female user doesn't want help from female IT admin.  Apparently I'm also mommy, daddy, teddy bear, and binky all rolled into one."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[I suspect you come across a lot of political nuance in your work.  I don't really understand who is opposing marijuana legalization anymore.  The libertarian slant on both sides in America seem to be for it.  Who is the major force behind prohibition these days?  The corporate prison lobby?  The church?  anyone else?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfdy6/i_am_ethan_nadelmann_jd_and_phd_founder_and/catt2p2?context=5)|Our opponents vary.  Demographically, we get the least support among conservatives, Republicans and people over the age of 65, although the polls indicate that support for marijuana and other drug policy reform is growing rapidly even among those groups.
 |With marijuana legalization, the prison guard unions and private prison corporations have not really been all that involved in opposing our efforts.  It's more the police chiefs who get bent out of shape on this issue.  The prison industrial interests are most active in opposing our efforts to reduce incarceration of people arrested for low level drug offenses.  They killed us when we tried to reform California's prison system back in 2008 with Prop 5.
 |But, I'll tell you, our most forceful and duplicitous opponents are the prosecutors, and for them it's not really about $$$ but about power - their inter-personal power in the criminal justice system, their power to coerce people to inform on friends and family members, their desire for the power that comes from winning higher political office, and so on.  And they often oppose everything -- not just marijuana legalization, but needle exchange programs to reduce AIDS, and Good Samaritan laws to reduce OD fatalities, and alternatives to incarceration.  It's remarkable how uncountable prosecutors have become in our American system of (in(justice)!
[Are there any politicians currently in office who you think really do care about the interests of the people and put that first, instead of worrying more about public image and political considerations? If so, who?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfdy6/i_am_ethan_nadelmann_jd_and_phd_founder_and/catry0v?context=5)|Yes I do.  When it comes to drug policy, most of the gutsy folks are in state legislatures, but as for members of Congress, keep your eye on Steve Cohen from TN, Beto O'Rourke from El Paso, Hakeem Jeffries from NYC, Jared Polis from Co, Earl Blumenauer from OR and most of the others who have been willing to step out on marijuana reform and prison reform etc.  Quite frankly I also think that Nancy Pelosi has provided relatively good leadership on our issues.
[Is it dangerous to publicly promote the legalization and regulations of drugs? Are there any threats from criminal organisations, who don't want to lose their market?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfdy6/i_am_ethan_nadelmann_jd_and_phd_founder_and/cats7qc?context=5)|I don't think it's dangerous, especially in the US, and I have not seen fellow reformers even in Mexico get threatened by drug traffickers for our sort of advocacy.
 |I must admit I used to worry a little more about folks in law enforcement coming after me -- especially back in the late 80s and early 90s when I was just starting to speak out, and only a few years earlier had had a security clearance and had been interviewing DEA and other federal police agents all over the world.  But nothing happened back then, and I don't see it happening now.
 |I guess the interesting question will be when legalization starts to become a real possibility in Mexico and people start fighting over who will get the profits from legal marijuana.  But at least until then I think we're OK.
[, you are a hero. Question: Do you suggest championing ""jury nullification"" to the masses? Or is that just not going to end the drug war machinery?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfdy6/i_am_ethan_nadelmann_jd_and_phd_founder_and/catt87c?context=5)|Yes it is a very good idea to make more people aware of the jury nullification  option.  While it admittedly has an ugly history with all white juries in the Jim Crow South using it to acquit people accused of lynching and other race-based crimes, I believe it is used primarily these days by jurors who think the current drug laws are unjust and even unnecessary.  More people need to know about this option, and to exercise this right when they get called to serve on a jury.
 |I think Steve Silverman and Flex Your Rights, who did that excellent video on how not to get arrested when you're stopped by the police, has something in the works on this issue, which should be excellent.
[Do you believe that drug use would increase, decrease, or stay the same if the bans were lifted?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfdy6/i_am_ethan_nadelmann_jd_and_phd_founder_and/catsfav?context=5)|Much depends on how one removes the ban.  The best evidence shows that removing the penalties on possession of small amounts for personal use, while keeping in place the prohibitions on production and sale, has no impact on levels of consumption.  But it does reduce the number of people being arrested, reduces the harms of illicit drug use, and allows addiction to be treated as a health issue rather than a criminal justice issue.
 |With respect to legalization of marijuana, my best guess is that we will see some increase in the number of consumers because it will be easier to obtain and probably less expensive than it is now.  But I think the increase will happen not so much among young people -- who already have incredibly easy access to marijuana -- and more among older people who find they prefer it to alcohol or pharmaceuticals.
 |As for the other drugs, take a look at what the Europeans have done with prescribing pharmaceutical heroin to people who have been addicted to street heroin.  There you see no overall increases in use -- in fact, quite the opposite.
[Ethan,](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfdy6/i_am_ethan_nadelmann_jd_and_phd_founder_and/cats151?context=5)|It's easiest with marijuana -- and basically involves making the historical comparison to alcohol Prohibition.  That whether one likes marijuana or hates it, the fact of the matter is that marijuana prohibition works no better than alcohol Prohibition did, and is generating many of the same sorts of negative consequences that Prohibition did back then. I can tell you from our research in doing marijuana reform efforts that the two arguments that appeal most strongly to people who are on the fence about legalizing marijuana are 1) better to allow the police to focus on real crime than to keep wasting time and resources arresting young people for marijuana; and 2) that it would far better for state and local governments to regulate and tax marijuana than to effectively leave the ""regulation"" and profits to organized and unorganized criminals. My principal personal motivation for doing what I do has more to do with seeing this issue as one of human rights, but I find that is not the sort of argument that appeals to most people in the middle on this.
[I run into this problem a lot. I feel as though my views are solid and backed with evidence but any time I try to explain it to someone , the idea of regulating dangerous drugs sounds so ludicrous that anyone in a discussion seems to react with gut feelings and not following through with logic. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfdy6/i_am_ethan_nadelmann_jd_and_phd_founder_and/cats151?context=5)| 
[What country's drug policy model, or hypothesized model do you think would be ideal for the States?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfdy6/i_am_ethan_nadelmann_jd_and_phd_founder_and/catswsv?context=5)|I think the first country to provide a model was The Netherlands, which introduced the quasi-legal regulation of retail sale of cannabis through the ""coffee shop"" system with substantial success back in the late 70s and early 80s; and which also was just about the first to introduce needle exchange and other harm reduction programs to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS by and among injecting drug users thirty years ago.
 |The second model is Switzerland, which really took the lead twenty years ago in creating heroin maintenance programs to reduce the health and public safety problems associated with illegal heroin use in street drug markets. That model has now been adapted in Germany, Denmark, The Netherlands, the UK and to some extent in other countries as well, not least because it has proven so effective in reducing not just the health harms associated with heroin, but also drug related arrests and crime as well as criminal justice costs.
 |The third model is Portugal, which I describe elsewhere in this AMA. If you want to know more take a look at the academic analysis published a couple of years ago in the British Journal of Criminology by Alex Stevens and Caitlin Hughes.
 |Finally, when it comes to marijuana policy the fact of the matter is that the United States has really emerged as the global leader - obviously not at the level of the federal government, but very much so at the level of civil society and state government. That said, keep you eye on Uruguay, as I said elsewhere in this AMA.
[New synthetic drugs are all the rage nowadays. These compounds are generally available for years before they can be made illegal and there's literally hundreds that become available each year, it would seem this is an especially hot area on the prohibition debate. Often these carry greater risks than traditional illicits. What is your tact when discussing these in the context of prohibition over the entire spectrum?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfdy6/i_am_ethan_nadelmann_jd_and_phd_founder_and/catsg8q?context=5)|The key is keeping our eyes focused on safety -- making sure that people, especially younger people, who use these substances don't get hurt.  i am proud that last month DPA co-hosted, for the first time, the annual international club health conference, which was held for the first time in the US.
 |I am really struck by what New Zealand is trying to do.  Synthetic drug use is a big issue there, and the government is now moving forward with a bill to allow synthetic recreational drugs to go thru an approval process much like the process that other drugs go through.  That means that a drug used primarily for recreational purposes will have a chance of being legally approved and regulated, just like other drugs, if it can establish its safety margin.  This could well be in effect by the fall.
[Ethan, I appreciate your time.  Do you think it would expedite the process of ending federal cannabis prohibition if a midwest state like Missouri was to pass a legalization initiative?  T ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfdy6/i_am_ethan_nadelmann_jd_and_phd_founder_and/catstag?context=5)|Absolutely, yes. Midwest or even more so in the South, where Missouri sort of is.
[What are your thoughts on the ""Three Strikes"" laws concerning drug cases? Thanks for the AMA.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfdy6/i_am_ethan_nadelmann_jd_and_phd_founder_and/cats9dc?context=5)|I was delighted that DPA was able to help with the ballot initiative in California last November -- Prop 36 -- that reformed the notorious 3 strikes law in that state, and that won with more than 2/3 of the vote.  Now the challenge is getting the law implemented effectively and passing similar sorts of laws in other states.   
[Have you ever done drugs? Remember BE HONEST!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfdy6/i_am_ethan_nadelmann_jd_and_phd_founder_and/cats1ld?context=5)|Yes, and you can read about it in Rolling Stone's recent profile of me ([Link to www.rollingstone.com](http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/ethan-nadelmann-the-real-drug-czar-20130606) and also in the interview that came out yesterday in The Fix ([Link to www.thefix.com](http://www.thefix.com/content/ethan-nadelmann-drug-policy91855).)
[1\) Are there people that helped enforce drug laws, or even write them, that are now opposed to them and working to change them?  2\) As a student without much money or power, how can I get involved?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfdy6/i_am_ethan_nadelmann_jd_and_phd_founder_and/catsqze?context=5)|Re 1), take a look at the organization, LEAP, which is doing great work organizing mostly former law enforcement officers who now oppose drug prohibition.
[How do you answer to claims that marijuana is a gateway drug or is as harmful as harder drugs? I know there are some studies disproving these claims but none, to my knowledge, officially funded by the government.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfdy6/i_am_ethan_nadelmann_jd_and_phd_founder_and/catsq2n?context=5)|Actually there are lots of government studies and government funded commissions that establish that marijuana is not a gateway drug and is in fact less harmful than many other drugs, including the legal ones. Take a look, for instance, at the National Academies of Sciences report on medical marijuana back in the late 1990s, which said clearly that there is no evidence for the gateway effect of marijuana. MY view on the gateway theory is that it is an ounce of truth embedded in a pound of bullshit. On the one hand most people who use heroin or cocaine tried marijuana first, but it's also the case that they tried alcohol and cigarettes first as well. On the other hand, the vast majority of people who use marijuana never go on to use cocaine or heroin or methamphetamine or even to get in trouble with marijuana. That's why my old friend Lynn Zimmer once said that trying to prevent heroin addiction by focusing on marijuana use is like trying to reduce motorcycle fatalities by discouraging bicycle riding.
[Does Drug Pollicy Alliance promote any kind of drug policy reform outside the U.S? Do you have plans to create an office in Latin America? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfdy6/i_am_ethan_nadelmann_jd_and_phd_founder_and/catscmm?context=5)|Yes, we're doing more and more work throughout the Americas.  I've been quite deeply involved in Canada over the years, advising the past four mayors of Vancouver, testifying before the Canadian Senate and now doing everything I can to bring attention to the atrocious drug policies of the Harper govt.
 |I and DPA have also been deeply involved with the Latin American and Global Drug Policy Commissions, co-chaired by former presidents Cardoso, Gaviria and Zedillo, helping advise and publicize their work.  And last year I had a chance to meet directly with Colombian president Santos, Guatemalan president Perez Molina and Mexican president Calderon, the first two of whom are remarkable allies in calling for new drug policies, and even Calderon was interesting on the issue.
 |But what I am most excited about right now is the marijuana legalization effort in Uruguay, where President Mujica is leading the effort and I have a colleague working fulltime in Montevideo trying to help local activists as well as allies in government.  Stay tuned for news from there.  There's a good chance that Uruguay could become the first country in the world to legalize marijuana -- and the race is on among Colorado, Washington State and Uruguay as to who will be first to actually create a legal regulatory system for cannabis 
[What do you propose is the best approach to changing the way our current prison system in the US is handled? I feel getting the government to reform our current prison will be next to impossible seeing as its a great money maker for the government and also a great form of population control. What steps would you suggest be taken to change the current system, other than just putting drug offenders in rehabilitation programs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfdy6/i_am_ethan_nadelmann_jd_and_phd_founder_and/catrzwl?context=5)|Drug policy reform is the cutting edge of prison reform.  That means, of course, taking marijuana out of the criminal justice system.  That cuts drug arrests in half, from roughly 1.5 million to half that, and it also keeps all sorts of people on parole and probation from getting pushed into jail or prison because they refuse to stop using.
 |The other important step is ending the criminalization, at least of possession, of all drugs -- more or less what Portugal has done with great success over the past twelve years.  Roughly three-fourths of all drug arrests are for nothing more than possession, and altho most of them do not land up on state and federal prison, they do land up in local jails, and often can land up in prisons for failing drug tests.
 |Of course there's also the challenge of getting rid of mandatory minimum sentences that send people to prison for inhumane amounts of time, and effectively give all the power over sentencing to prosecutors.
 |What we need as a country to do is declare as our objective that America's rate of incarceration should be at the global average, not in the global lead.
[Hi, Thank you for being here! I follow DPA and it's work closely and I'm looking forward to the debate today. My question is about individual activism. I regularly write my representatives regarding this issue and participate in community events when able. Where would you direct someone who wants to become more active in this movement? Is there a specific career path/degree program/etc. that you would recommend? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfdy6/i_am_ethan_nadelmann_jd_and_phd_founder_and/catsk5q?context=5)|No one career path is optimal.  The key is to learn everything you can about the issue, and to work on becoming an ever more effective advocate, and to acquire the sorts of skills that every advocacy organization needs -- could be legal, financial, communications, public policy, fundraising, etc.  And keep your eye on dpa's website drugpolicy.org and the websites of other drug policy reform organizations for job and internship possibilities.

[Ethan love your work, it's very inspiring. Are you planning on coming to Australia in 2013?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfdy6/i_am_ethan_nadelmann_jd_and_phd_founder_and/catsgo6?context=5)|No plans right now, altho the folks in nimbin tried to get me to come recently for their annual event.  I did go in late 2010, and did a speaking tour of Melbourne, Sydney, Canberra and Brisbane, meeting with parliamentarians, activists, and many others.  There's some good reform efforts underway; if you're interested, contact Dr. Alex Wodak in Sydney; and check out LEAP in Australia.
[When Cannabis is legalized in a state, do individuals with cannabis-related criminal charges get any sort of retroactive pardons/forgiveness?  Sorry if I've worded this poorly, I can't Lawyer.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hfdy6/i_am_ethan_nadelmann_jd_and_phd_founder_and/catt6tu?context=5)|I don't think there are any retroactive provisions in the WA or CO laws but I have heard that many prosecutors in those states are in effect implementing the law in a retroactive fashion, deciding not to prosecute people who were arrested before the law was passed.

1hf69l,8,2013-07-01,College freshman in need of advice/guidance...,roosegoose,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1hf69l/college_freshman_in_need_of_adviceguidance/,"Hi, I'm an incoming college freshman who'll be majoring in Computer Science at UMass Amherst. I wanted to get an idea of what I could do to make the best of my education. I had a few questions regarding CS/general advice regarding the major:

- I've been spending most of my time learning Python and Java. The first few classes are taught in Java and I figured it'd be a good idea to get a head start. Additionally, I've been trying to work with the terminal on my Mac most of the time. I'm assuming familiarity with Linux is really important.
I'm also considering doing a minor in Math. If any of you double majored in Math or minored in it; do you think it has been beneficial?

- Side Projects: I've started some side projects and have some more ideas, and I don't know if they're great, but whatever I choose to make- should I put it on github? I'm learning, and obviously the stuff I build won't be amazing, but effort counts for something, right? Additionally, what should I do if I want to contribute to open source projects (I know Python has some cool libraries I'm interested in)? I'm at a total loss here.

- Summer Internships: I'd like to get a job for the summer after my freshman year. I'll only have taken 2-3 CS courses by then. I'm not sure how to apply for jobs if I have neither experience nor too much knowledge. If I can demonstrate some skills though side projects, will that be a solid substitute for the time being? Any other advice will be helpful...

- Lastly, does the school's rep matter a lot? I know UMass isn't well known like Stanford/MIT/Cornell/Michigan, it's not ranked very high overall as school (90 something according to US News), but it does really well in graduate school rankings for CS (#20). Would it be worth it to transfer to a higher ranked school for more prospects (like Cornell or Michigan)?

- Any other advice would be greatly appreciated!"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[So how close to reality are most Crime Investigator shows? Not at all close right? Or if not what is one that you find pretty close to reality?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catip9z?context=5)|A lot of crime scene shows take a substantial amount of creative license when it comes to the forensic sciences.  There are a few things they tend to get right, but we most definitely don't all drive hummers, look like models, or get DNA results back in under an hour.
[Do you think shows should have some sort of disclosure in the show/credits that say they are not 100% accurate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/cau7732?context=5)|That would be a nice thing to have.  However, people are still going to assume that a lot of what they see on TV is factual.  Especially since it is based loosely on true science.
[Do murders evolve like everything else? What I'm asking is now days when you have shows like CSI regardless of their creative license they still have made forensic evidence mainstream. Do you find... cleaner crime scenes now? Do you think criminals are taking more precautions and cleaning up after themselves better after these rise in forensic crime dramas? Thanks for the AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catj428?context=5)|I think a lot of criminals watch TV shows as well, but there are techniques we are capable of that they may not know about.  I don't really think in the whole scope of scenes that we are seeing much difference.
[What's the coolest technique you use that we wouldn't normally know about?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catktex?context=5)|Touch DNA.  We can get DNA off of sweat, fingerprints, hair (without roots), all sorts of fun stuff.
[Could you or someone else please ellaborate on how this is done? Especially the hair without a root, wouldn't that just contain proteins?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catyqpi?context=5)|Hair still contains cells, while historically hair without the root has been very very difficult to generate complete DNA profiles from, advances in forensic science have yielded results from hair without the root.
[How many gallons of semen have you seen smeared on walls and floors?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catisw4?context=5)|No comment. (A lot, especially hotel rooms.)
[ what would be the strangest item you found some on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catiwt2?context=5)|That's an interesting question.  Depends on your definition of strange, worse has to be small children's underwear.  Never an enjoyable experience.
[Have you ever found anything written in semen on a hotel wall?  Any names or treasure maps?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkpmv?context=5)|The map to Jimmy Hoffa.
[That makes me sad. Poor little kids. I hope you don't find things like that often.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkbhl?context=5)|Unfortunately, it happens more often than I'd like.
[So...more often than never? And if it never happened then you wouldn't be able to like that it never happened because you'd lack the experience to like.  Sorry that sentence just bugs me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catl1my?context=5)|Sorry, I've answered a lot of questions tonight.
[How much schooling have you had? Whats the grosses thing you've encountered? Have you ever made a mistake that cost the case? Have you ever had a serial killer case? What about a child murder? Hows the smells? Can you refuse to work a case? Whats your favorite genera of movie and favorite food?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkd3x?context=5)|B.S. in Chem. 2 week decomp. pulled out of a river. Nope. Nope. Nope. Not too bad once you get used to it. I'm not sure, never have though. Comedy and Sushi.
[Are your one-liners as cringe-worthy as Horartio's?  Or do they.  (•_•\)  ( •_•\)&gt;⌐■-■  (⌐■_■\)  Murder. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkpbb?context=5)|Mine are usually pretty lame.
[Has a crime scene ever actively scared you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catjfjj?context=5)|Scenes were the suspect is still at large, or gang-related scenes can be scary in the fact that retaliation can happen at the police while we are there.  There have been instances (not in our agency) where drive-by shootings have happened at the scene with gang-related crimes.
[Yeah that's kind of what I was thinking of.. Wasn't sure if that was solely something that happened on TV. So --excuse me if its a dumb question -- are you technically a part of the police? And have you ever been in actual danger?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catjmcx?context=5)|I am non-commissioned, so I am technically a civilian.  I do no carry a gun or a badge.  I am an employee of a law enforcement agency though.  To my knowledge, I have not personally been in danger.
[ still I will be living vicariously through you during this AMA while I am stuck here in the cornfields. Thanks, OP!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catl2xl?context=5)|Thanks for growing corn for me to eat.
[Police are civilians as well, even the ones with guns, as they are not a branch of the military.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catlw94?context=5)|That is true.  In terms of what I was talking about was commissioned officer (or in our case deputy) vs. non-commissioned (civilian) deputy.
[What has been the worst crime scene you have been to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catise4?context=5)|Execution-style murder, or a fire-death scene.
[How can I commit murder and get away with it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catipjx?context=5)|Figure out a way to not leave a trace that you were at the crime scene or had no contact with the victim.  There is a theory that forensic science is based off of that states, ""Every contact leaves a trace.""  It has held up for 100 years, good luck with that.
[Surely there are times when you aren't satisfied with the evidence you got at the crime scene though, and can't convict right? TV shows (you're prob sick of hearing about them\) make it seem like you catch every one every time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catlex8?context=5)|Many times there can always be more evidence.  We don't always catch the suspect.
[Of course, even this is a trace. :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catzgwr?context=5)|Yep.
[Have you ever investigated a scene, presented the undeniable evidence to the court, yet they still decided against your findings?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catir94?context=5)|Yes.  The only thing we can testify to is the evidence and our role with it.  There may have been other factors in the case caused court to rule otherwise, i.e.  validity of search warrants, probable cause issues, etc.
[That's gotta annoy you. Providing undeniable, undisputable proof that someone committed a crime, but the court throws it away. I know it bugs me when someone throws away all my hard work.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/cativ04?context=5)|Yes it can be annoying, but there is a reason the criminal justice system exists.  I am a firm believer that it is better that 100 guilty men go free than one innocent man be convicted.
[Aka do all the dirty work, while someone (prosecutor\) else writes the narrative to fill in the story?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catzf5g?context=5)|Not necessarily, we write reports of our findings and our opinions based on the facts presented.  There is a possibility of prosecutors not using our findings, but juries like to see CSI findings.
[What if there were 101 possible suspects in the rape and murder of a loved one? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catjx4f?context=5)|Then you try to get the right person.
[How have shows like the CSI franchise changed the courtroom setting? I've heard that now a lot of juries assume there will be a lot of forensic evidence. Has this affected any of the trials you've been involved in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/cau3uhv?context=5)|People on juries now do seem to think that we can find forensic evidence on everything, when in fact that might not be the case.  I've addressed this question a few times in this post I think.  If you can't find it then let me know and I'll try to answer.
[Have you seen the show ""Dexter""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catjpbk?context=5)|Love that show. I have a special interest in bloodspatter analysis (not bloodsplatter, that term makes people in our industry crazy) so I get a special kick out of it. When people ask me about my job I like to say I'm like Dexter, but without the killing people.
[Follow up question: Do you think you would be able to find evidence that leads to catching Dexter by now? I can't believe he's still a free man.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/caty5dw?context=5)|I'm sure there is evidence out there.  I haven't seen past season 4 of Dexter but from what I've seen, he never is in the same place, and few people even know where the scene of his killings are.  That would make it tough to investigate.
[Do cops dislike you? Do you stroll into a crime scene and flash your badge like.. I'm CSI, Bitch!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catj8z8?context=5)|No, we have a very good working relationship with our agency.  We are under the jurisdiction of our Criminal Investigation (detectives)  so we see many of them on a daily basis.  We also have a very good working relationship with our coroner's office.  Many people don't realize that a body belongs to the coroner once it is found, because of our good relationship, they allow us to complete our scene investigation before they will touch and remove the body to help us out.
[What's the funniest situation you've ever found at a scene?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catiuns?context=5)|Woman tied to a bed.  She asked her boyfriend to tie her up and then left her there.  Neighbor heard her screaming for help 2 hours later and called the police.
[So was there anything for you to do there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catjjp6?context=5)|Nope, but it was pretty funny.
[I thought they only called you guys after the police determined there was a crime scene? Just wondering why you would even be involved with that one..](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/cau3xqt?context=5)|Most times that is the case.  We aren't involved a lot with this scene, but we did a little bit with it.
[What is your education background?  what kind of schooling and experience do you have/did you need to do what you do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catjk8w?context=5)|I have a B.S. in Chemistry and I'm beginning my M.S. in Forensic Science through the University of Florida Distance Learning program soon.  I've been at the job for a little under 2 years.  With what I do, they were looking for someone that had a background in the hard sciences, the rest of it can be taught.  I do the majority of the drug analysis for our agency, so the Chemistry degree definitely helped.
[Hardshell or softshell tacos?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/cativ2w?context=5)|Softshell, hardshell hurts the roof of my mouth.
[Have you ever danced with the devil under the pale moonlight?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/cativ2w?context=5)|If by devil you mean my ex-girlfriend then yes.
[Have you ever witnessed someone at the scene or in the lab screw up, ruin evidence, and cover up their mistake? Do you know of this happening elsewhere? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catjl2g?context=5)|I've witnessed plenty of screw ups.  Hell I've done it myself, nobody is perfect.  We just have to document what happened in our reports and what we did from there, that is pretty much all we can do.  When you try to cover up a mistake is where you get into BIG trouble with Brady issues and such.
[What is the hardest part of your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catisuq?context=5)|Having to disconnect emotionally from the things we bear witness to on a daily basis while still remaining mentally connected.  Having to think like a suspect and use that knowledge to help solve a case can be difficult.  Few people understand the things law enforcement, military, and paramedics/EMS have to see all the time.
[As an EMT who had a bad day thank you for recognizing that we actually see bad shit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkso5?context=5)|I have a great respect for what you guys do.  I was a boy scout and had to do mock scenes quite a bit, and have had to use that training in real life (car accidents).  
[How do you disconnect emotionally?  I can see how this would be one of the most difficult sides of the job - you see the worst that people do.  How do you keep your faith in humanity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/caunza8?context=5)|I work with good people and see the good side of humanity as well.  You just have to find your shut-off switch and flip it when bad things come along.
[Does psychology play a role in this process? Is there a forensic psychologist present during the investigation? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catjpom?context=5)|In what process?  I am responsible for physical evidence, I don't get involved with all that other voodoo.  But seriously, with the type of work I do, one would not be necessary.
[What's the weirdest thing you've ever found on a crime scene?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catitmo?context=5)|Old (80's) man's anal lube gallon sized bottle.
[Was it relevant to the case? Or just a random jug of anal lube that was not connected to the case at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkjam?context=5)|The girl he brought home said he tried to rape her, so she shot him.  Kind of relevant?  I'm not sure.
[I mean, I guess. What I really meant was was it actually used and/or marked as evidence, or just an odd discovery while you were there?  Sorry, I worded my question pretty horribly the first time lol.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkpb6?context=5)|It was collected as evidence.  Although, we collect a lot of things from homicide scenes.
[If a murderer collected lint from a public laundromat and spread it all over the crime scene, how would that affect your investigation?  Edit: er, I just got put on some sort of list, didn't I? :(](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkrt3?context=5)|It would definitely throw a wrench in things.  It would be collected as evidence for sure, but I'd hope that there would be other items of evidentiary value present at the scene that would help point at someone.  Fingerprints, blood, hair, saliva, etc.  Hope that helps, would be interesting though.
[What's the dumbest thing you've ever seen a perp do to get caught?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catjunf?context=5)|We had a guy burg a store while it was closed and try to run when he saw the police coming.  He broke his leg stepping off a curb, so when the officers pulled up he was sitting on the curb surrounded with money and bleeding.
[That is pretty funny.  Why did CSI get called out to that scene though?  Isn't it pretty cut and dried at that point?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catk0hu?context=5)|There were 3 other places he had already robbed, we processed them anyway.
[What is the most fucked up, and most emotional thing you have ever seen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catk685?context=5)|Kid was hunting with his friend, propped his shotgun against the truck while loading up, it started to slip and he grabbed it, shooting his buddy in the head.
[Who are you? who, who, who, who?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catjnac?context=5)|Suey13?
[Do epithelials count as DNA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catjjj4?context=5)|Yes, the newer DNA analysis techniques can even get DNA off sweat.
[Is there ANY possible way I could kill someone and get away with it in this day and age? I'm only asking for a friend who wants me to kill his wife.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catjx8a?context=5)|Probably.  If he tries really hard, and is lucky.
[What is the pay like? What is starting pay vs. experienced pay?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catk2dy?context=5)|I do pretty well for the living expenses of the area I'm in.  My starting pay was $40,000/year.
[This was already asked. What TV Shows or Movies most accurately depict what you do? What is your favorite thing to do for recreation and or leisure? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catj7jb?context=5)|That is a great question, unfortunately I don't get to watch a lot of the shows, but I have quite a few queued in Netflix to watch eventually.  The original CSI: Las Vegas did a pretty good job in the early years before it got a little far fetched.  I do scene work and lab work, many agencies have different people for each job.  However, I do not carry a gun or interview suspects.
 |As for recreation and leisure, I enjoy reading and I have been doing martial arts for many years.
[Does the portrayal of your career in the CSI tv series as being an exciting, case solved every week, sort of thing annoy you? I've heard a huge amount of man hours can go into investigating with no guarantee of success. It would annoy me, but im not sure why.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catirqq?context=5)|It doesn't annoy me, makes us seem much cooler than we actually are.  There have definitely been some cases I've put a lot of man-hours into.
[Seen any X-files type things at your crime scenes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catk23z?context=5)|Nope, just x-files DVDs.
[What's the saddest thing you've seen while on the job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkx5f?context=5)|I go into people's houses on what is usually the worst day of their lives.  That is pretty sad.
[Thanks for the AMA! I was thinking of doing this when i become older. Would you recommend it? Also what are some pros and cons of the job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catl0jp?context=5)|I would recommend it if you can handle the gore of it and have an interest and strong attention to detail.  As to the pros and cons, if you read through the AMA there is quite a bit of detail.  Thanks for the post!
[I know a person that is finalizing everything to get this kind of job. Any tips for her when she gets it. Stuff to do and not do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkwzg?context=5)|Leave work at work, don't take it home with you.
[Do you have to dress with coveralls in crime scenes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catjf4s?context=5)|Depends on the scene.  If there is a possibility that DNA evidence will play an important role, then we will wear Tyvek suits (the white bunny suits that you see on tv).
[Haha Yeah, I wore one on a school play in which I was a CSI. So, explain, in which cases would DNA possibly play an important role?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catjoy8?context=5)|DNA can play an important role in many different kinds of cases.  It can definitively prove that someone was somewhere, which can be hard to prove otherwise. 
[What did you go to college for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkknh?context=5)|Chemistry, and the free t-shirts.
[How does it feel when you successfully catch someone?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catk049?context=5)|Best part of my job.
[When you put sunglasses on, does this happen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catku0q?context=5)|All the time.
[Thanks for being here! I am interested in becoming a Crime Scene Investigator and was wondering how you feel about your job? Is it a difficult job to have and do you regret it at times? Does it hinder your everyday feelings towards things? Cheers!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catksm8?context=5)|It hasn't hindered my feelings toward things, but I have pretty tough skin.  Part of being able to do my job is being able to filter my job from my home life.  I don't regret it for anything, I get to help solve crimes!
[What do you do on a slow day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catl11y?context=5)|Catch up on paperwork.  There is always paperwork.
[Do you work with a blood-spatter analyst?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catl4n8?context=5)|I have training in Bloodspatter analysis.  I do it myself.  There is a very qualified individual out of Washington State that is VERY good too.
[Have you ever had a case in which you had to, say, check the reflection off of the eye of the victim's photo using the freeze frame from a security camera? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkhf4?context=5)|Nope, if you have a video software program that can do that you might be able to sell it to the FBI for a lot of money.
[Can you tell us more about this? security footage is sold to the fbi? any footage or only ones with crimes? do you just give them the original tapes or copies? etc (interesting\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/cau7j5g?context=5)|What I meant was that if you have software than can enhance security camera footage like that, you could probably make a lot of money off it.  There is a TON of dramatic license taken in terms of video enhancement.
[I'm a highschooler and I'm interested in entering this field and have a few questions. What would be a decent major in college? How does one get started?  What's the ""ladder"" look like to get up to a CSI? Is the pay decent? Not asking for your salary but maybe a ballpark. Thanks :\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catl6tj?context=5)|I think I've answered this one a few times.  If you read through everything I'm sure you'll get your answer.  Sorry I can't help you here.
[I work at a police department and have a pretty good understanding of real world physics, forensics, police procedure, etc and at this point my suspension of reality is too high to watch shows like CSI  for the most part. Do you experience something similar? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkpnw?context=5)|They are comedies to me.  I watch them to get a good laugh.  Thank you for your service.
[Does 'The Who' ever start randomly playing while you are putting on sunglasses?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catktr3?context=5)|All the time.  Sometimes I think of walking into work with speakers playing that around me.
[What's the best way to get rid of a body?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkn6s?context=5)|Pig farm is what the movies say.
[What made you want to go into crime scene investigating? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catj4uy?context=5)|It is something that I have always had an interest in.  It may have initially evolved from watching the TV shows actually, the same ones that I now laugh at.
[Is there really always seminal fluid everywhere like on TV? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catl4a1?context=5)|Not always.  Tends to be a fair amount in hotel rooms though, beware.
[Is it hard to enjoy yourself on vacation knowing that? :(](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/cauo0ql?context=5)|Not really, just take a blacklight with you on vacation and show things to the manager of the hotel.  Free upgrades. :)
[Does it frighten you how jaded you can become to things that should terrify you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catk0ur?context=5)|Good question.  It really does sometimes.  People who are around death and other normally terrifying things (Police, EMTs, Doctors, etc.) develop a condition called ""Gallow's Humor""  where we try to make light of certain situations my turning to joking about it.  Really weirds normal people out.
[I am planning to go into investigative psychology.  Do you happen to have any sort of advice or resources that would be helpful?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkffq?context=5)|Do internships if at all possible.  Yes you will probably be getting a lot of coffee for people, but it will make you seem more committed.  No pun intended.
[Well, assuming were friends, me having hairs at his/her house wouldn't be proof. I could pull my car in the garage, so no one would see me moving the body from the house to my car, and well, there isn't much more to go on besides that. :p.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catjqwx?context=5)|I haven't seen all the evidence of the case.  It sounds like a terrible situation where people made some unfortunate decisions and bad things happened.  With so few witnesses it will be hard to know what will happen.
[I do have another side question for you. What is your opinion on the Treyvon Martin case? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catjqwx?context=5)|Plus, I haven't been following it all that closely.  
[Where should someone go to see about an internship? the local police department?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/caubydj?context=5)|Police Departments, Sheriff, if you are near a big city you might check out federal agencies as well.
[So if i just go to the local police department and say ""hey i was interested in doing an internship for crime scene investigation, can you tell me who to talk to?"" would work? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/cauxjzb?context=5)|That's definitely a good way to start.
[How likely is it that our DNA is stored in a database somewhere? Do you need to collect DNA from a suspect directly to match it to the crime scene? What if a person just randomly killed a complete stranger with no other witnesses or cameras etc. and happened to have a hair on the victim, would they be able to track them down? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catki02?context=5)|There has to be a sample to match the DNA to.  A lot of times we may not have the suspect DNA on file, but if there is enough probable cause, a judge can grant a search warrant to collect a blood or saliva sample from the suspect in a case.
[Is it true that DNA can't be taken from hair if the bulb isn't intact? That's what I was told when I was little, don't know if techniques have advanced since then. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catjuwo?context=5)|Hair strands contain mitochondrial DNA, or mDNA.  It can be used, but it only provides a maternal match to the person being tested.  So if the police think they know who they are searching for and have an mDNA sample, if possible they can get a sample from the mother and match the person, or their sibling.
[What was the most difficult crime you had to solve?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkdk4?context=5)|The REALLY involved ones I don't work by myself.  All of our CSIs work together on those ones.  But, we have had a few homicides that were tricky. 
[What percent of crimes you've worked on go unsolved?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkwve?context=5)|I think I answered this already.  Sorry.
[Do you focus in any particular aspect of the investigation? I tend to regard Dexter and Breaking Bad as two of the more ""realistic"" crime centric shows.  In your experience, are the forensic aspects of these shows, particularly Dexter, even remotely realistic or just what tv audiences have come to accept as fact?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkrku?context=5)|I haven't actually seen as much Dexter as I'd like to, but I have seen quite a bit of Breaking Bad since one of the actors is from my hometown.  The bloodspatter aspect of Dexter is pretty spot on from what I've seen though.
[I used to watch Forensic Files with my roommate all the time.  I loved the show, but he said he was scared after watching it.  While forensics can help point evidence to a suspect, framing someone seems that much easier.  One episode, for example, a guy got convicted for the murder of his wife.  His hair and footprint was found at the scene, as well as a leaf of a unique tree in his truck bed.  He was convicted, of course.  But what if there was a ""friend"" that grabbed a few stray hairs in the bathroom, took an old pair of his shoes, and chucked a leaf in his truck bed?  Imagine all these innocent people going to jail because the evidence against them is so verifiable scientifically.  What are your thoughts on that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkxcl?context=5)|Many, many times physical evidence is not the only thing that a conviction goes off of.  Unfortunately there have been instances where the wrong people have gone to jail, but in terms of my job I just make sure that I do my job to the best of my abilities and provide it to the detectives and prosecutors.
[Where do cases with the least amount of evidence usually occur? (Rural?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catk5p1?context=5)|I'm not sure about the least amount of evidence.  All (most) crime scenes are pretty different.  Just being able to notice what is and what isn't evidence is the hard part a lot of the time.
[Do you ever feel burn out from your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catk5p1?context=5)|Nope, no burnout for me.
[Did you do well in science to get this job or was it more of a ""trained-on-the-job""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkyc8?context=5)|Nothing medical school level, but I did pretty well.  There is a lot of ""On the job training"" though.
[What about amish places? do they send cops/csi there ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/cau7h4m?context=5)|I'm not sure.  I live in the Northwest, not a lot of Amish here.
[Thoughts on shows like CSI and all of that? Is any of that true? Seems like not but would like to hear your opinions. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkhah?context=5)|I think I answered this one already, sorry.  There are some things they do that are pretty accurate, but still a lot of dramatic license is taken.  I don't chase the bad guys with a gun.
[Have you ever looked at evidence or analysis from older cases that would not be accepted by todays standards? What is an example?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catl4qd?context=5)|I haven't, sorry.
[What is the first instinct of what to look for at a crime scene? Is there any one thing that could tip the scales one way or another if you see it early on in the investigation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catk6c3?context=5)|When we first get to a scene we try to take it all it, then break it down from there.  Drugs, guns, money, and alcohol are usually pretty big clues though. 
[About how many hours a week do you work? Do you have regular hours, or is it mostly on call?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catk2pa?context=5)|I have regular 8-5 hours, with a rotating on-call schedule where I'm on-call for a week.  In fact, I'm on-call now.
[Off the top of your head, what percent of the time is there jizz found at a crime scene?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkhen?context=5)|Depends on the scene.  Sex crimes probably 90%.  Home burglaries maybe 1%?
[How often does an agent (from any government crime-related agency\) ""go rogue"" and get involved in a major crime?  Certain TV shows make it seem like it happens every other day.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catj6sw?context=5)|The only time I've been witness to it was the drug analyst from Massachusetts that got busted about a year ago.  Other than that I don't think it is a very common occurrence.
[What is the most inconvenient or unique scene you've had to attend?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catknmd?context=5)|Guy shot himself after a police chase that ended on the side of the road.  It was -10 F  outside.  Brrr.
[What is a normal day for you like? What do you do specifically?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catkfl6?context=5)|I do a lot of evidence processing in our lab. Looking for fingerprints on items that have been submitted by our officers. I also am responsible for the majority of drug analysis for our office, mostly marijuana, meth, and cocaine. When we are called out to scenes we do all the processing and evidence collection there as well.
[Is your home spot clean? no finger prints/dust? ;\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/cau7i38?context=5)|No spot clean by any means.  Being a bachelor I try to keep it tidy, just in case.
[Have you read any Jeffrey reaver books; specifically the Lincoln rhyme series? I wonder if the things he describes in forensics are as accurate as he makes them seem.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catl379?context=5)|I have not, sorry.
[How unrealistic/realistic are the shows such as CSI: Miami, and all the other CSI's?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/caupsul?context=5)|Pretty unrealistic in general.  There are some things they get right though.
[So how much has the genetics field impacted working at a crime scene? I'm studying genetics right now, and this interests me. Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catk3i1?context=5)|DNA evidence deals mostly with the genetics aspect of CSI work.  Most of the newer techniques deal with mDNA and how we are able to get profiles are suspects that we were not able to before.
[Don't know if you've answered this but, how exactly did you get in like what does it take? And what inspired you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hef4q/i_am_a_crime_scene_investigator_ama/catku9v?context=5)|Helping serve my community is what inspired me.  I never really had a desire to serve in the military, but this is my own way of giving back.

I just began learning VBA in Excel because of a short-term internship I'm doing. I've been doing well but I've hit a roadblock and need a little boost. I don't have sample code to offer cause it's all at the office, but basically I run it and it adds a new worksheet with the name like ""Updated List"" and puts some information in there that it grabs from another worksheet, but then when i try to run it again it gives me an error because there is already a worksheet with the name ""Updated List"". I tried googling the problem and have come across some answers but I couldn't get any of them to work. I know its hard without sample code, but if anyone knows of a solution to where it might just make a new one named ""Updated List 2"" or any other ways around it I would much appreciate it!"

Any 300$ PC or smartphone could easily outspeed my current electronic abacus. I'm willing to spend more than double that on a new PC. My absolute maximum budget is [€700](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=convert+700+EUR+to+USD&amp;dataset=) ($908), preferably less.

Huh, you sneaky US citizens can snatch some seriously good discounts... but in return I can get an awesome Sharkoon case and you can't. :P I'm doing an internship at a local PC shop right now and we often build with these cases, they are sturdy and easy to work with.

I'll look for better prices later. PCPartPicker Germany doesn't have many stores right now so I still have to do some manual search.

---

Since I'd like to keep some cash for unexpected expenses I plan to buy more stuff later. I'm used to bad graphics so I can endure some more weeks, that means the video card isn't top priority - I'd much rather get a new monitor because mine is a 17'' 1024x768 TFT and I need more screen real estate. The video card will probably be something along the lines of GTX 660. Any thoughts on which card I should get? (Should be nVidia because I often use Linux, nVidia has much better Linux drivers than AMD)

Maybe I should also get an SSD - I could still afford a 120GB drive and I'd rather do it now than later so I don't have to install OSes on an HDD first and then reinstall on an SSD. I really want one because they are *fast*. I'm not too sure though.

I chose the 3570K because I plan to overclock in the future. The boxed fan is good enough for now - my current PC produces tornado sounds so anything is more silent. Will buy a better fan and OC later.

Oh, and before anyone asks - I actually need a DVD drive and I need a new one because mine are all IDE.

I still have Windows 7 so I won't buy W8 to keep the price low.

1hisem,2,2013-07-02,"Win, win, win!",koryisma,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1hisem/win_win_win/,"I think I am a testament to how people with ADHD need to love what they do and then, sometimes, they can be unstoppable. 

First of all, I haven't started grad school yet, so I know that I'll probably eventually get bored and burnout on that eventually. I'm just trying to stay positive and focus on small wins. 

I've always wanted to go into international education. I was able to do it for two years while abroad and it was my favorite job ever. Unfortunately, in order to make a career of it, you pretty much need to have experience in a university office and a MA. 

Long story short: for the last two years, I have been in a job that sucks the life out of me. To make things worse, the processes I have to do are in direct contradiction to how I think. I have deadlines for every little thing. There are processes that involve multiple steps to get them done (when one won't work, it's easy for me to say ""I'll do it later"" and never do it.). 

This job is what finally pushed me to get diagnosed for ADHD. This job has stolen my voice and made me feel like shit about myself. I've never been in trouble so much at work. I've never been so bad at a job. The shit of it is that there are some things I excel at-- and some things that take me so out of my comfort zone that I don't even know where to start. It's caused anxiety, stress, nightmares, etc. 

Well. I finally just said screw it and applied to grad school at the last minute. It was a lot of WORK to apply, a lot of doing things that I didn't want to or that are challenging for me with ADHD, but because I WANTED it, I was able to do it. 

And now? I am working it. I've applied for 4 internships and have found 5-6 more. I KILLED it at an interview-- really nailed it. I met up with someone who just graduated and picked her brain. I've met with professors (not in the department, but people I have connections to) to ask them the best way to make grad school work. I have the parking pass-mad-scramble-date on my google calendar and haven't missed it yet! 

And I am working it. Because I love it. I've found my voice again. I've found something I am confident in. I am building up my confidence in myself again. I don't feel like as much shit about myself right now because I feel like I can be good at this. 

Again-- lesson learned. Do what you love. Do what you are passionate about. Do what makes you come alive. I hope and pray and am sending good thoughts to myself that things will fall into place because I will hustle to make it happen! :) "

So I'm 20 years old and live in the Philippines right now (Filipino Citizen) and I don't see any bright future if I stay here. Fresh grad Software Developers here are paid something around U.S. $450-$700 per month if converted, so I am really desperate to relocate to any country that on average pays fresh grads competitively. The problem is relocation is rarely offered for fresh grads. It makes sense for them though, if they can hire a student who lives just down the street, why bother hiring one living hundreds of kilometers away?

Now, I am not saying that I am a very very good Software Developer, but when I graduate this March 2014, I will be the only one to graduate with honors (Magna Cum Laude). There are no other Computer Science students that will graduate Summa or regular Cum Laude. Experience-wise, I had my internship already and was able to work on a real-world project for a medium-sized company where I experienced activities like code reviews, stand-up meetings, using git to actually collaborate, even learning new languages and frameworks and implementing something in it in a short amount of time.
I have my own Android App at the Google Play store with around 20,000 downloads and a 4.9-star rating. Also, I have made some simple games on mobile and desktop platforms. Lastly, I am VERY active in my local developer groups, even winning several hackathons. I'm planning to start heavily contributing to open source projects before I graduate as well since I got a lot of advice regarding that. I'm aware I'm not the best, far from it actually, but I think of myself as notable.

I didn't mention all this to boast, but so that you guys can judge me if you think I am competitive as a fresh grad on a global level (you can be as harsh as you like, I will take it). If you think I am indeed competitive, what advice or insights can you give regarding my predicament of being constrained to the Philippines right after I graduate?"
1hh82r,1,2013-07-02,Did anyone read the Bob Lawblaw's Law Blog Dog Law article?,beleriand,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hh82r/did_anyone_read_the_bob_lawblaws_law_blog_dog_law/,"Seriously though.  About three years ago, I moved to Florida because my girlfriend of 5-6 years, at the time, had the opportunity to intern as a chef at a prestigious resort.  Now, I didn't want to move, but she didn't give me any choice.  She didn't want to talk about it.  She was moving to Florida, no matter what.  She didn't even bother to ask how I felt about it, and she'd get upset when I would suggest she stay in our home town.  It was take it or leave it, except she didn't even have the courtesy to lay it out that clearly.  Well, it was a pretty simple decision, I just moved.  But, I work from home, and she was working 80-100 hours a week in the ridiculous chef industry.  She gave it up after less than a year, by the way.  She gave it up completely.  So, that's how important it was to her.  Anyway, it was one of those retirement communities, full of old people, so it was hard to meet people, and there was nothing to do.  I was lonely as fuck.  I'm not exaggerating, she really worked 80-100 hours a week.

So, I got a dog.  I picked her out.  I picked her up from the pound, and drove her home.  I even told my ex ""It's really important that this dog likes me.""  I told her that several times.  So, for a year, all I did was take care of this dog, Rowen.  I played with her, took her for long ass walks.  I took her to the dog park every day because I literally had nothing else to do.

Now, when we moved back home.  There was a period of a few months when my ex didn't have a job, and took care of Rowen along with me.  She did a lot of intense training, on a really long leash so that Rowen could learn to be off leash.  But, that ended, and my ex started working 60-80 hours a week again at some stupid dead-end job because she's a workaholic and can't say ""no"" to her bosses.  Well, I was back to taking care of Rowen most of the time.

To cut this short before it gets out-of-hand, we had Rowen for 3 years.  I spent much more time with her than my ex did, but somehow she convinced herself that Rowen was her dog.  We broke up after 9 years together, and she just didn't want to talk about it.  I was forced to move somewhere where I couldn't have two dogs.  We had two dogs.  I got Freya, who we had for a year.  Then, my ex packed her bags and moved to a different state.  This all happened really quickly.  Too quickly for me to get a handle on what was going on.  I was devastated by the break up, and my ex just completely severed communication, immediately.  And, the thing is, as long as she feels fine about things, it doesn't matter how another person feels.  In her head, Rowen was hers because she had spent that time training her.  I don't know if she's just incapable of imagining how much time I spent with Rowen, or if she just doesn't care.  And, I kept telling her that she was stealing my dog and she'd just get pissed.  She said something like:  ""would you really take her?""  Like, because I couldn't take her at the time, that justified her taking her and moving out of state.

So, I want my dog back, but I feel like she probably had her registered in her name.  What can I do?  What's legal?  I feel like my only option is to just sneak up, grab Rowen, and get the fuck out of Kentucky.

**TL;DR: I feel like my ex stole my dog.  She moved to a different state.  She probably registered the dog in her name in that state.   I want my dog back.  What can I do to get the dog back?**"
1hgryt,0,2013-07-01,Germany --&gt; USA,[deleted],IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/1hgryt/germany_usa/,"Hello,
I want to move to the US sometime. It's not going to be in the next years, because I want to study here, but I want to prepare as soon as possible. I probably will study computer science at a university of applied science. I don't know yet if I'm just going to do a bachlor or a master as well. I start university in two years if I don't fail my exams.

I have this dream since 8th grade and it helped me through a difficult time of my life. 

I informed myself over the years and know some requirements. I either have the option to go into the lottery or through a hb1 visa. I have relatives over in the USA, but they are just my greatcousins (if something like this exists), so no options there. Over the years I read an awful lot about how hard it is and it's always a big bummer, because I then think I'm never going to make it.

When I study I want to try to get an internship in the US, just to get a feel and stuff. Or should I attend a college for one year abroad?

Any advice? Any info you need, feel free to ask!

I hope my grammar is alright."

Currently I'm working as a web developer in a small company. Working with PHP,HTML, CSS, Jquery, Oracle, SQL, MySQL and Zend Framework. To be honest this is my first full-time job (I have been there for almost two and a half years), I did some internships before this one, but as you can see I'm not very experienced.

I'm looking at countries that have a high human development index where you can lead a pretty decent life in general and have better opportunities. I work with IT so it has to have a good job market in that field. 
I'd like to go to Australia, Canada or the USA, but I really don't know much about how hard it is for foreigners to be able to live and work in these countries and if it is possible to find some job as soon as I get there (I have some money saved up, around 11k USD, but I think that wouldn't last much).

I have no criminal convictions, not even a speeding ticket.

I come here to ask you if it's possible to nurture such dream or if I'm not wasting my time overthinking about this. 
Also I'd like to know which skills and knowledge do you think I should develop and hone if I want to go work abroad in those countries I mentioned before. You can also suggest other countries where you think a person with my profile would fit.

First some background information. I'm doing an internship in a big company. The internship went quite well and at the end of 3/5 months they already offered me a job for after around 36k/year (which is normal here in France for a junior). I'll be working as a C# developer (windows mobile 6.5) in the beginning (to finish the project im working on) and later on probably with every thing into the mobile world, android, windows 8, iOS etc. and SAP as well (Sybase Unwired Platform and other SAP modules).

I have another option which is offering me 38k/year, and they do mostly work in Finance, Bancs and also Media. I'll go there as a .NET developer (might do ASP.NEt and Javascript on client side probably, angularJS etc.).

The first one is a very big company (69 000 people)  and the second one 300 people. 

The first one respects emplyers less and the second one more.

I've heard from employers here that SAP pays really well (in less than 5 years of experience you go to 50k/year if you are good).

I wanted to know your idea on this, your suggestions, and what should i be lookin in the first job.

Background information: the payments are in euros :)

1hkw24,12,2013-07-03,"Started QA internship, got bored quickly, got told to have a day off and check in the day after tomorrow",thatchaplin,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1hkw24/started_qa_internship_got_bored_quickly_got_told/,"Hi Reddit,

The first three days of my internship leaves me puzzled. 

Formerly I was a lawyer, but I decided that I want a career switch and slightly more than a year ago, I started learning IT-related stuff (mainly coding). On Monday, I started a QA internship with the twist, that they expect me to continue working after doing a two month long internship. Just like any new employee, I am encouraged to order a PC to work on, paid by the company.

However, the wierd thing about my internship is that for the first three weeks of my internship, there are no testers in the office who could guide me. Some of them are on vacation and others are at clients' offices. And the programmers are too busy to make me feel included. The theme is, that there are no projects where they need a dedicated tester and they really don't seem to have time to bring me in projects for the sake of just letting me do something. 

I am told, that I should read about testing and the internal documents for the first three weeks. Well, before the internship started, I did read literature provided by the company and kind of got the idea, what testing is all about. Now, I just want to get my hands dirty.

So when today an administrative worker asked me, how was I doing, I told her, that I feel lonely and abandoned. She asks me what do I expect from third day at the office. I'm like... umm, if I were at home, I'd be coding hobby projects and this kind of internship is not fulfilling any of my personal goals. So we agree, that I go home and she discusses my issue with the programmers. I have not yet arrived at home, when the phone rings and I am told to show up on Friday.

Is my kind of grumpiness acceptable? Is the company's way of handling my internship acceptable? edit: ""reasonable"" seems to be a better word to use in either question.

tl;dr: Started internship with the promise of being hired by the company, found out, that for the first three weeks there is no one to guide me and nothing to do.

EDIT: Big thanks to all who responded. I enjoyed the discussion very much. On Friday, I will confidently walk into the office, see what they have me do, and just test like there was no tomorrow. "
1hkjla,9,2013-07-03,Brand recognition of internship,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1hkjla/brand_recognition_of_internship/,"I'm doing a Master's in computer science at a good public school in the US. I'm not American and I don't have any previous experience working in the software industry. My undergrad many years (8) ago was in Electrical Engineering. I'm currently doing a 6-month internship at a software consultancy. I'm working on Enterprise Java applications and Spring. At the end of the six months, I have the option to extend my internship for another (maximum) of 6 months (Internationals are not recommended to do more than 12 months of internships as it takes away from the amount of time we could potentially work here *after* graduation).

I'm currently debating whether to extend the internship for only *3* months and then try to get another internship with one of the big names (MS, Amazon, Google, VMWare), all of which recruit from my uni, for the 3 months of the Summer of 2014 (thereby hitting the limit of 12 months). This is slightly risky because there's no guarantee that I'll get into one of these big firms whereas the company I'm working at now has pretty much told me I can stay on for six months if I want to). So, I'm wondering how important the brand recognition of the internship company is. If it doesn't make too much of a difference, I'd rather stick with the known than risk the unknown. What do you guys think?

For anyone wondering why I'm doing a year of internships:

A. No past industry experience in software

B. The money's good

C. I'm doing online courses for my program at the same time.

I also have the option of doing a research-heavy independent study course with a professor in my uni in Summer 14 instead of doing an internship (I'm thinking data mining because I find it interesting and it has industry applications). I'm not sure I'm research material though and I sure as hell don't want to end up in academia."

1hjlb0,1,2013-07-02,I need help growing up.,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hjlb0/i_need_help_growing_up/,"I am 20 years old and I live with my parents. I am attending a 4 year University and I am an English major. I am financially bound by my parents but it's a very sticky situation. My parents are highly sensitive to me trying to be independent which caused me to be kicked out for a week at the beginning of the summer with no money. My point is that they are very extreme in their discipline which is why I need help.
I do not have my license and I have been trying to get it. I have not taken the test yet because my mom wants to buy me this $100 program that shows you the route to the test and then sends me off to the test. However she keeps saying she doesn't have the money and ignores me when I say that the $100 program is not necessary. 
This summer I have found it useless to apply to internships because my parents find it inconvenient for them to take me to the locations of these internships. (No matter where they are it is inconvenient)
I have been spending my summer in my room trying to fill out scholarships but I just can't take it anymore. I have told them that I want to get a job and my mother says no and to appreciate being with the family. Note that they are at work the entire week. I can't stand it anymore I just can't. I calmly tried to explain my dilemma to my mother today and she ended up yelling at me so I walked away. 
Once again, I am an English major and knowing that it's difficult to get a decent job out of college without experience causes me to fear that I am going to have to move back in with my parents. I feel like I'm in a trap and it's hard for me to see any open doors right now. I would like to move out but I do not want to cause anymore family problems.
Also, on top of all this I have an ACL and meniscus surgery that I am trying to get covered by their insurance and they are prolonging the whole process. I know that they do not want to lose me but I fell like I can't breath and I had a mini mental break down the other day. I can't stand feeling that I am not growing up it's frustrating me so much."
1hjdvj,2,2013-07-02,Help with classroom management!,[deleted],Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1hjdvj/help_with_classroom_management/,"Hi everyone. I sought out this subreddit to get some advice for a teaching job that I have this summer. I'm 18 years old, an art student in college, I am teaching art class for 3rd through 6th graders at an academic summer camp. I'm relatively new to teaching -- most of my experience comes from an internship with a young childrens' Art Camp last summer, but the experience doesn't translate well as the circumstances are very different.

It's especially difficult for my situation because I'm teaching 6 different classes in one day, and for only 25 minutes at a time. Art class is more of a break for the teachers than anything else. I can't really ask for the students to bring any special materials and mostly have to stick to pencil, paper, and whatever they may have on hand. It's hard for me to remember everyone's names or really get to know them, and I also don't have much I can use as consequences like sitting in quiet, taking away time to draw, etc as I have limited time already. I can try to plan some more open-ended projects so the students can tailor it to their own interests, but some of them seem to only be interested in drawing guns and violence... For more academic lessons, like figure drawing, I try to make it fun by making it a group-based class, and having students model their own poses for each other, but I'm not sure how interesting the material actually is to them.

I think my biggest issue is having enough presence to have everyone in a given class be willing to quiet down and listen to me -- I'm finding myself having to constantly shout for everyone's attention and getting certain students to be quiet. Clapping sequences sometimes work with the younger students but not the older ones. I'm thinking part of it might be that I'm a much younger teacher than they're used to and am more like a sibling than an adult relative to their ages. And there are also certain students, mostly in the younger classes, that constantly try to test my patience, talking back, avoiding the lesson, and being generally uncooperative.

Besides the generally rambunctious younger kids and the generally mean and eager-to-bully older kids, some problem students that stand out are:

* A group of three 4th grade boys intent on putting no or very little effort into learning the materials I teach, drawing inappropriate things like guns or fat classmates, questioning my instructions, saying ""no"" when I ask them to do things. There isn't much I can threaten them with besides making them sit away from their friends, or perhaps giving them a ""time out"" in a corner by themselves (but there isn't really anything stopping them from joining back in if I am busy with another student).
* A 5th grader who is very vocal about his dissatisfaction with having to have art class, groaning aloud and trying to make inappropriate jokes when I try to give lessons. I might have to talk with him one on one in the hallway if he keeps this up.
* Very excitable 6th grade boys who just love being obnoxious, though aren't directly disrespectful to me. A 6th grade girl in the same class who is intent on insulting as many boys as she can.

I would appreciate any advice on what to do and strategies I can take to efficiently quiet a class down, without losing my voice. I'm thinking I might pick random days to bring candy or some sort of treat to class (fruit snacks?) to give to the well-behaved children unannounced at the end of class, and just tell the troublemakers too bad. I don't want to antagonize anyone but I also don't want to stand to be bullied and pushed around by my students. Thanks in advance!

*Edit to add that I have been teaching for about a week so far. This session of camp lasts for another 3 weeks, then another session starts for a full 4 weeks."

1hnv3o,0,2013-07-04,I'm having second thoughts about mechanical/automotive engineering. Looking for real advice on how to proceed with my life.,[deleted],AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1hnv3o/im_having_second_thoughts_about/,"Firstly I want to start out by saying a lot of what I am going to say may be unfair stereotypes but that's why I'm here in the first place. 

I just did one year at a community college with mechanical engineering as my major. I was sure I wanted to do it when I started a year ago but I'm turning 19 later this month and feel like I've matured a whole lot in this last year. I'm also starting to get doubts about whether I want to be sitting at a desk for the rest of my professional life. 

So my first year started off successful with almost straight A's but it had a lot of gen eds. My second semester I failed my calculus 1 class and that has strongly discouraged me. I am going to retake it and should get a B if not an A because I understood all the major concepts but the little rules and exceptions to the concepts threw me off. So I want to know how important calculus and high level mathematics in general is. I also took a drafting class which I greatly enjoyed especially working with autocad. But I don't want to be making autocad models of Camry transmission casings for the next 40 years. I say that because I am very passionate about cars and would want to go into automotive engineering. I have moderate experience working on cars and know how most everything works. And I'm am just astonished by the amount of engineering put into great hyper cars by Pagani or Koenigsegg. So how hard would it be to secure a job like that here in the us or an English speaking job in Europe? Or maybe how hard would it be to pair up with a successful racing team? Because an applied desk job like that I wouldn't have much of a problem with. 

Also I was thinking of maybe doing the same thing with software or computer engineering if there are more opportunities in that field seeing as how that won't ever see a decline in jobs if everyone switches to hybrid/ electric cars or some other alternative fuel. 

I don't know I'm glad I decided to go to community college and save some money instead of thinking about changing majors at a 40k school or such. I want to transfer after another year at cc though and maybe go to Detroit where there would be internship opportunities but a good school here in California (to avoid out of state costs) would also be ok if there are good internship opportunities. What would a mechanical/automotive engineer recommend? I am going to talk to my counselor soon and see what they have to say but they don't know experience in the field like some of you guys do. 

I'm sure even though this is long I'm missing a lot of information so feel free to ask me. I just want to see how many engineers actually found an interesting job that they love going to everyday.

Worse, I am unsure of my interests, and I don't particularly care.",shaymin492,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1hnq9x/i_have_many_acquaintances_but_i_am_a_fringe/,"I am in my mid-twenties and I have been living at home in the suburbs of a large city since graduation. I have been working at a very diverse scientific institution in said large city (~2,000 employees and many volunteers) for just over three years now (I've worked my way up from an intern in one department to a part-time employee in a different department).  
  
Anyway, I have many acquaintances, not only from work, but also from those who have gravitated to this city from my old high school and college. I even have some 1st, 2nd, and 3rd cousins nearby.  
  
I often see my social circles from work at work-hosted events and I socialize with them and catch up with them and maybe even go out to bars with them afterwards. There are a handful of people from school/family/work that I have one-on-one coffee or lunch with every couple of months to catch up. I will, once a year or so, get invited to bachelor parties or weddings and meet the extended networks of these friends (some living far away, some relatively close by).  
  
At all of these events, I feel that I am very sociable. I constantly get compliments on the way that I dress. Some people are very impressed with how many people I say hello to at the bigger events (""You know so many people; how popular you must be!""). A girl that I had met who was associated with a bachelor party that I was at recently was shocked, *shocked*, to hear that I was single (I chose not to mention that I haven't been on a date in 4 years). I take the time to chat with as many people around me as I can at these events, and there is definitely a mutual enjoyment of company.  
  
Something is missing, though. I don't have any co-workers to eat lunch with or whose office I am compelled to drop by on a regular basis to see what's going on (or vice versa). I don't have anyone to call on the weekends to suggest we go out and do any of the countless activities in our city. I don't feel like I fill in any appreciable social role in any of the circles that I interact with.  
  
I *think* the reason is that I don't know what areas of knowledge or culture I am passionate about, or what hobbies I want to do on a regular basis. I *say* I like certain things. Take hiking for example. I always *say* that I'm interested in taking a walk up a mountain or exploring a national park, but I haven't actually done that in a long time, and no one has invited me out to do so. I don't particularly care, though; do I actually enjoy it, then? Same with photography (which I *say* I love pairing with hiking). Well, aside from Instagram snapshots from my daily life (which garner plenty of likes and comments from everyone), I haven't done much of that, either. Maybe I just like the *idea* of these things. Nonetheless, the role of these and other hobbies play in my life hasn't been much more than me talking to people about how I enjoy and want to do these things. My lack of interest is, I think, causing me to [secretly want nothing to do with culture at all](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJ2w6L4YHnI&amp;t=132)! I think everyone who sees me as some sort of social mastermind would be surprised to hear that, though.  
  
I was compelled to write this after failing to suss out any group to hang out with for the 4th of July. I've been sitting at home in the suburbs all day listening to music, and watching tennis and baseball (and the hot-dog eating contest, of course). I will undoubtedly play down the fact that I didn't leave the house with my acquaintances, of course (like on Saturday, when I will be having coffee and catching up with someone who I haven't seen since January).  
  
I don't think there was a question there. What should I do in order to gain interests and/or form closer friendships like I see among my peers at work/in life?  
  
Happy 4th, everyone!"
1hmktj,1,2013-07-04,35 w/o career - push through anyways or start over?,jata1978,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hmktj/35_wo_career_push_through_anyways_or_start_over/,"(ok, this is gonna be complicated, since there probably are no ""good"" solutions, just less bad ones... )

i'm in my mid-30s, have finished a masters degree in communications 7 years ago, and got stuck while trying to get a phd. 7 years ago, i got offers from IBM and top companies (had some great internships during my studies). Since then, i've worked part-time for a pr agency/in marketing to finance my phd, but there have been no great achievements to sell to prospective employers in those years. The phd was a great miscalculation on my part, i got lost in a million interesting theoretical detours, and am still as far away from finishing as i was in the beginning. Before someone feels compelled to add it, i know how that looks to possible employers (in general, i've sobered up about my prospects in the last months. So please, give me tough talk if you feel like it, but I've probably said the same to myself quite a few times). 

So there are two options: The first one is, quit the phd (and try finishing it on the weekends) and start the career that should've begun 7 years ago. The thing is, where i live anyone can apply for a pr job (regardless of what they studied), so the salaries ain't great, the competition is insane, and there way to few real advancement opportunities (cause there are so many people in the pipeline). Realistically, i feel like I've got a talent for PR, but it's not like i'm Neo. 

And option 2: I've recently started to learn coding, and it comes to me pretty easily (logical/abstract thinking was never really hard for me). So, since I didn't get anywhere with my first career, i wonder whether i should just scrap it and start again, study computer science and focus all my energy on learning to code, thus acquiring skills that aren't as ubiquitous as PR skills. I'd be 40 when i'd finish my studies, so i don't expect to get crazy rich (like i said, i'm pretty down to earth about my prospects). I'd be studying with people half my age, working for people ten years younger... would be pretty humbling. I've never coded before, because i never thought about it - there was always something else to do, and i seriously overestimated the difficulty (now that i've taken the first steps, i'd say there are parts that are crazy difficult, but others that are just like math, difficult but manageable). 

So let's say i'm equally talented at PR and Coding. Do i continue down the path i'm on, just cause i got a degree, even if the career doesn't look so good? Or do i start over without having started at my first one, in a career that looks more promising? I'm not adverse to working my ass off, i just don't like to waste more of my time - which i kinda feel like i would if i got a entry-level job at some PR agency - just getting to a point where i can shine (and then advance to better positions) would take 2-3 years, with meagre pay. And since i've coded, i know that it can be tedious, but if my next years and decades are gonna be filled with tedious, humbling and hard work, I somehow feel like i should choose the career that pays better, offers better advancement opportunities and less competition. It's not about passion, i've found i'm passionate about both for different reasons.

-The company is switching to a new software as a base for work and they are paying formation for their employees, I on the other hand know how to use this software already so they don't have to form me (The problem is that I didn't work with this software during the internship so they can doubt about my competence with this software)

-I can communicate in 5 languages (it can be usefull in our job but not that much)


Negative stuff that can play against me :

-Apart from internship I don't have professional experience (I'm young and just finishing school).

-There is a lot of unemployed people looking for job in our industry.

-A lot of people want a chance to work for our firm and accept any type of contract and the bosses know that and know that the employees knows that (so if you don't like something there is always people ready to replace you).

-I'm a foreigner so the administrative procedure is a lot heavier, (this is how I know they really want me for now but can discourge them if I ask for too much).

1hpqh3,10,2013-07-05,Feeling very lost after an interesting turn of events regarding school,comradewilson,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1hpqh3/feeling_very_lost_after_an_interesting_turn_of/,"Long story, going to try and shorten it. 

I am a student living in San Francisco. Two days ago it was announced that following this school year the college I am attending, a two year university, will be losing its accreditation. I have a minimum of 1 1/2 years left before I can transfer, so you can see where the problem begins. 

Currently my school is the only option within San Francisco, as far as I know. There are other two year schools but they usually have their students transfer to my college and then to a four year after that. 

I am somewhat hesitant to transfer to another two year institution and lose my current progress, but not totally turned away by the idea or sure that I WOULD lose the progress. That is just a worst case scenario. 

My current school still has the option to appeal the loss of accreditation and I will be working hard with everyone at my school to make sure that we stay open and I can avoid all of this. However, I'm making a contingency plan.

If my school were to close, would it be practical, with enough experience, to begin working internships in San Francisco instead of transferring to an out-of-city school? I'm willing and eager to self-teach programming and would prefer to not have to restart my college education. The problems that I've heard on this subreddit, concerning no degree, is that it will probably bite me in the ass somewhere down the line. 

Working internships while transitioning into a job at any of the companies would be a dream, but I understand that it may not be practical or the best option. I am willing to hear other opinions/suggestions/experiences similar to this before deciding and I still have an entire year before the school (possibly) closes. 

Thank you for your time and apologies if all of this was slightly incoherent.

edit: going to add my experience since I figured someone might ask. I'm currently self-teaching Python and am decent with it. Last semester I took and into to C++ and struggled, but am moving on and hope to understand it much better this coming semester. I'd like to teach myself Java soon after I finish Python and get a better grip on C++."

1hnyuf,8,2013-07-04,Just wrote this Cover Letter. I'm putting in for a position that is expected to have more experience than I have but I know I am perfect for it. Would love some feedback on my Cover Letter. Thanks!,_Lloyd_,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1hnyuf/just_wrote_this_cover_letter_im_putting_in_for_a/,"Dear Hiring Agent,

I have never seen a job posting that had me as instantly excited as your posting for an External Affairs Representative. It was as if every line was tailored for me, and that I was tailored for your needs. I fell in love with the 'Company Name' culture &amp; way during my first internship with the company and jumped at the first opportunity to begin a career with 'Company Name.' While my current position, Title of Position, is an excellent job, I have been waiting eagerly for a position that would better leverage my skills, aptitude, and drive to maximize my value for 'Company Name;' I am confident this is the role to do just that.

While I must address that I only have one year of experience with 'Company Name,' I ask that you will not rule me out just yet. As you can see from my resume I have been polishing myself for this type of role. 

First, my education has me positioned perfectly to hit the ground running as 'Comany Name's' External Affairs Representative. With two Bachelor’s degrees, in Political Science, and Peace, War, &amp; Defense, I thoroughly understand the intricate interworking of government, public policy, and our valued customers, as well as the communications necessary to bring these stakeholders together for the best interest of everyone involved. Being fresh out of school, working multiple internships, as well as beginning a full time career with 'Company Name' has allowed me to sharpen my personal and professional networking skills that are invaluable in a role of this caliber; I fully understand the importance of creating lasting relationships and know how to leverage these relationships to represent 'Company Name' in the best possible light.

My abilities to research, investigate, and inform myself on important issues quickly and effectively have been honed throughout my time at the University of North Carolina. These are powerful tools when advising community officials and leaders on constantly changing problems and concerns.  As well as practicing how to inform myself I have been given unique opportunities to share my knowledge which has allowed me  extensive practice conveying ideas in concise and easily understandable terms; a crucial asset when building positive public perception. 

Spending my time with 'Company Name' on the Nuclear side has given me a inimitable opportunity to witness just how important public perception and stakeholder’s opinions can be for the operation of the utility. I have witnessed firsthand just how misunderstood the industry can be and have used various opportunities to advocate for the nuclear industry. 

My internships with 'Company Name' and 'other gov't agency' provided notable experiences working through mock disasters (storms, radiological releases, terrorist attacks, etc) and the importance of all stakeholders coming together for these events to be properly mitigated. These opportunities also put me in front of Senior Staff on a multitude of occasions briefing them on events, explaining complex scenarios, and training them on updates or new programs; situations I am comfortable and confident in.

With the company searching for places to save money around every corner I think I provide an excellent opportunity to fill this role with a capable, motivated individual full of fresh ideas at a lower price than someone with your preferred five years with 'Company Name.'

I thank you for the opportunity to display some of my skills and experiences with you and I look forward to the opportunity to discuss further the strengths I can bring to the role. I am confident you will not be disappointed. Thank you, once again.

Most Respectfully,

My Name"

I thought to myself ""Well, I'll just take these full time jobs, and then I'll go to full time college at an online college as well"". However, I'd gotten quite a bit of negative feedback about that plan from my family, so I decided that I would let the ""big dogs"" of the tech industry help me out a little bit. I sent out emails to recruiters at apple and microsoft (I also meant to send one to google, sony, and facebook) regarding my dilemma. I didn't get a response back from apple, but I got one from a microsoft recruiter (which helped solve my crisis a bit), and he suggested I take a look at their internship program (which I'd of course already seen before and took very much into consideration applying). I sent him a few questions that I had from looking over it once again as a now high school graduate, and recently got his response to his questions.

My question: Can I capitalize on this in a way that will significantly help my chances of being admitted to their internship program (such as forming a strong relationship with the recruiter) ? If so, what are some actions I can take, ideas/tips you all have?

Just graduated with a business degree from a no-name state university.  My GPA was neither good nor bad.  I didn't work nearly as hard as many of my classmates. 

When I started my job search in April, I was terrified that I wouldn't find a job because of all the horror stories I've heard here. Also, I live in a state that [ranks top 5 for WORST unemployment](http://www.bls.gov/web/laus/laumstrk.htm). 

But by the end of June, I got multiple job offers and interview invites (I also got a handful of rejections, but you take the good with the bad).  Meanwhile, a lot of my classmates are struggling to find a job or can only find part-time, temp, or contract work.  And I suspect that I am getting paid significantly more than most of the them.

So what did I do differently in college that my more hard-working classmates didn't do? *Network.*

I occasionally sent emails to professors and TAs who I took classes with.  Some of them didn't respond so I left them alone. A few, I kept a pretty good relationship with. When I started looking for a job, I leveraged those connections to help find job openings.

I did a co-op/internship (required by my school). I'm glad I was required to do it because I was able to make more connections from the inside. The company extended an offer when I graduated, but I eventually declined.

I went to club meetings.  This actually didn't help that much even though business club meetings were almost always networking events.  Too much ""competition"" so I couldn't develop a meaningful relationship with anybody except upper-classmates.

I went to professional meetups.  This was tremendously helpful and ultimately the most fruitful. Particularly the tech meetups. Even though I'm not a computer science major, I figured the tech industry was almost always hiring, so I figured, why not.

Alumni association was a bust. At least at my school. No leads there.

If I had to do it over again, I would probably skip the club meetings and spend more of my efforts with professors and meetups.  I think one internship is enough, but more couldn't hurt. But really, you never know which professional relationship could come up with a lead.

So I hope this helps."

I've posted here infrequently before, and I'm back again for some guidance and tough love. 

**Background**

Graduated this may with a degree in Political Science, minors in Economics and Computer Science. I left school a year shy of finishing my BS in Computer Science because, well, I ran out of money and the ability to borrow more. During school I worked remotely through a campus program doing QA work for one of the big guys, writing and running test scripts for hardware automation. Despite this, I had no luck finding an IT job so before graduation, I took a job as an IT recruiter in a fairly active market where companies struggle more than in larger areas to attract talent. However, there are some pretty large, prestigious enterprise-level shops here.

**Fast forward three months**

While I enjoy my job, I'd ultimately like to be on a close-knit development team in an agile environment where I can meet my love of programming and personality need to interact heavily with other people. I'm confident that I won't be here in a year or two and I've recently been considering enrolling at a technical college for an AAS in software engineering. The only reason I see this as a viable option is because the program they are offering is the #1 skill-set in my area, where my fiancee and I would like to remain long term. The program itself is heavily rooted in the .NET framework, with a lot of C# coursework as well as niche courses in ASP.NET, SQL, and some web technologies (PHP and JS, primarily). Based on my experiences recruiting IT talent, this is the exact skill-set that companies here are seeking.

**So, what?**

I guess first, I'd like to know if anyone else has taken a similar path, BA first and then a technical AAS? If not, what is the realistic viability of this as a means to finding a full-time development job? Unfortunately, I learn far better in a classroom setting where I can collaborate with my peers on software projects than sitting at home alone trying to watch YouTube videos. I still do some hobbyist programming in my spare time though, mostly in Java. 

Also, what kind of success can one expect using referrals and ""cold-calling"" to land an internship at a large company? I have a pretty decent network of folks I've met in my current role and I'm confident that I could at least hit some leads, as companies will train up the right candidate.

Finally, if anyone has any advice on what the best way to pursue this goal without putting a neon sign over my desk that says ""I'm out in 12-24 months,"" that would be helpful.


PS: I'm sorry for all the dog shit recruiters y'all have no doubt been hounded by your entire careers. I promise we don't all suck.

Check out previous posts for details on [setting your career goal](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1giewv/breaking_into_game_design_part_1_find_your/), [building your portfolio](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1gsj06/breaking_into_game_design_part_2_build_your/) and [learning how to sell your experiences](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1h6bzh/breaking_into_game_design_part_3_learn_to_sell/).*

Now that I’m devoting my energies to [Enhanced Wars](http://www.enhancedwars.com), I do not see nearly the quantity of resumes as when I was part of the hiring process at BioWare’s San Francisco office. But I still review the occasional resume for someone who has reached out on Reddit or forums, or for a former colleague asking me to pass it on to someone in my network. If you have read my earlier post about [how to build your portfolio](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1gsj06/breaking_into_game_design_part_2_build_your/), you should have plenty of meaningful material to put on your resume even if you are trying to land your first full time job (or internship) in game design. But learning how to write that resume is a skill unto itself.

**The 4 hurdles**

Before writing a resume, it is important to understand the purpose of the document beyond the high level goal of getting hired. A resume passes through many hands and must be targeted at a number of different audiences within a single team or organization. For the purposes of this post, imagine that you are applying for a job at a larger company like EA or Ubisoft that will have a dedicated HR department. Although each studio’s processes are different, the general principles outlined below will be a rough guide regardless of if you are trying to join the Battlefield 4 team or a 3 man start up like [Quarter Spiral](http://quarterspiral.com) making its first hire.

When you apply for a job your resume will be screened by someone on the HR side. This person has probably had a conversation with the hiring manager or members of the team about what they are looking for in the position and in team members in general. This screener probably does not have hands on game development experience and will be reviewing you at a “keyword” level. If you look like a good prospect, the screener may call you up to verify your potential, or may pass you directly on to the hiring manager to ask “would you like to phone screen this person?” This is your first hurdle.

The next step will be convincing the hiring manager (who is probably your prospective boss) that you are worth talking to. She will review your resume and [portfolio](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1gsj06/breaking_into_game_design_part_2_build_your/) to determine if your skills match the position. She will almost definitely look at your LinkedIn profile, and if you have any common contacts may do preliminary checkups on you. Assuming you seem like a good prospect, she will set up a phone interview. This is your second hurdle.

Once you get on the phone, your resume will frame the conversation with the person on the other end. She will likely ask a mixture of questions about your experiences, as well as hypothetical questions about various job scenarios, to get a feel for your working style and thought processes. You may have one phone interview or several, depending on geography, seniority of position and dev team process.

All steps up till now have been fairly low cost for the company, but from here on out it will get more expensive. In the phone interview your resume must help guide a conversation that convinces the interviewer you are worth bringing in for a half to full day worth of interviews. This may or may not involve flying you in and putting you up in hotel depending on geography. In-person interviews will definitely involve diverting the attention of a number of team members which is very expensive from a development perspective. Convincing the interviewer she should bring you in to the studio for a full interview is the third hurdle.

Once you get to the studio, you will interview a range people on the team. This will probably include the hiring manager who was the first to phone screen you, peers of hers in leadership roles in other departments, people on the team who report to her and potentially the people she reports to. In most instances these interviewers will have spent 5 minutes or less looking at your resume and portfolio before stepping in to the room. It is safe to assume that they have not read the job description you are applying for. It is likely that these interviewers will simply pick a bullet point or position on your resume and ask you to tell them about it.

This series of interviews are to determine if you are the right candidate for the job. The team is trying to determine not only if you have the skills and experience to fulfill the role, but also if your personality and temperament will be a good fit for the team. If you have the skills to do the job but no one wants to work with you because of the attitude you give off in the interview, you will not get the job. This is the fourth hurdle.

In all these instances, your resume guides a conversation with an interviewer who has varying degrees of knowledge about you, the position you are trying to fill, the team and the project. The resume is a conversation starter.

**The razor**

Your goal with a resume is to have a single page which frames a conversation around why you are the best candidate for the job. There is no need to clutter it with details of summer jobs in unrelated industries, leadership positions in social clubs from college or lists of obscure programming languages you kind of used for one semester. With each element you put on the resume you should consider if you can talk about it in a meaningful way. If not, cut it.

For instance, in college I wrote electronic music. I had a DJ show on the college radio. I was the co-president of the swing dance club. One time I (technically) opened for the Black Eyed Peas. If I was applying for a job as a designer at Harmonix, all of these are valid points that help me explain my lifelong love of music and why I am the right mixture of designer and musician for their studio. If I am applying as a multiplayer systems designer on the [Enhanced Wars](http://www.enhancedwars.com) team, these points are meaningless.

In my opinion, you need your name and contact information, a link to your portfolio site and possibly social presence like twitter, a section on education and a section on work. Everything else is optional.

**Hero stories**

If you read my last post [on selling yourself](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1h6bzh/breaking_into_game_design_part_3_learn_to_sell/), you should already have a good idea of the content of your resume. Assuming you are trying to get your first full time game job, you may not have “job titles” or company roles to list. But you should have a number of pieces of tangible design work you can list and explain your role on.

Instead of grouping bullet points by job, group them by project or course. Each “job” should have two to three bullet points that highlight a different hero story about your experience. For instance, in college I made a game called Refuse of Space that won a game design competition. If I was applying for my first job, I would list Refuse of Space and dates worked on it as though it were a job on my resume, then include one bullet point highlighting its award and one highlighting that I did all the design, programming and art myself. If I were to rewrite my resume today, I do not think this project would be included in my one pager.

**Avoid title inflation**

A common effect I have seen on resumes for those early in a career (and one I have been guilty of in the past) is title inflation. On one hand, there is nothing to say that you cannot list yourself as Executive Producer of your semester long game project that resulted in an unpolished demo. On the other hand, when a hiring manager works somewhere like Electronic Arts – with Executive Producers like Casey Hudson who is responsible for all things Mass Effect – it is hard to take this title seriously and may count against you.

Instead of giving yourself lofty titles (or multiple titles per project) go with a more humble approach. Instead of Executive Producer just say Team Lead. Instead of Lead Designer just say Designer. Being aware of the size of your team and the scope of your role within it will go much further than a flashy but ultimately overblown title.  

**Miscellaneous sections**

Depending on the online template you started with, you may feel the need to include a mission statement, skills section, hobbies &amp; interests, coursework or some other type of section on your resume. In my opinion, more is not always better and you should take a minimalist approach when it comes to your resume. Go back to your razor: is this something you want to be asked about? Does it allow for you to discuss a unique aspect of your past and why you are an ideal candidate? If not, cut it.

When it comes to a mission statement, I generally advise against them. Unless your mission statement is tailored for the specific job you are applying for, it is probably meaningless. The fact that you want to use your wide range of skills to create compelling experiences for players was implied when you sent in your resume.

For skills, do not list them unless you can intelligently answer a question about them. I know I used to list Fortran and Lua on my resume because of some college coursework. If anyone had asked me a meaningful question about either language while I was interviewing, it would have tanked me as a candidate. Remember that the goal of your resume is to frame a positive conversation about yourself, so avoid anything that will detract from the overall impression that you are the best possible candidate for a specific role.

**The cover letter**

I am a bit torn on cover letters. Speaking from my experience on hiring teams, I can comfortably say that a cover letter has never meaningfully impacted my decision on a candidate. But even if I expect that no one on the other end is reading your cover letter, I still believe it is worth writing.

Part of applying for a job is applying for that specific job, and not just any job with the word designer in the title. So writing a cover letter (or intro email) will force you to take your abstract resume and weave a compelling story about why you are the right candidate for a specific job with a specific company.

With that in mind, I believe it is a worthwhile exercise to write a two to three paragraph “cover letter” style email tailored specifically for each job you apply for.

**Exotic portfolios**

Since you are a game designer you are likely compelled to create an exotic portfolio or resume. You might think it is a good idea to create a 3d level in Unity that is itself the resume. This is not a good or bad idea, it is an interesting one. If you can build an exotic portfolio that actually goes above and beyond a piece of paper to show why you deserve a job, then by all means go ahead. But too often these exotic portfolios detract from your application. Only invest in an exotic presentation of your resume if it is truly impressive to a professional game designer.

If you take all this into account when crafting your resume, you will likely jump over the first few hurdles and land several interviews. I will cover preparation for these interviews in my next article in the series."
1htn9e,10,2013-07-07,I'm an underpaid applications programmer/system analyst for a small hospital -- HELP!,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1htn9e/im_an_underpaid_applications_programmersystem/,"I'm a 25 year old veteran with a AS in Comp Sci. Before my job at the hospital, I was a sysadmin for a large agricultural company (internship) for about a year, then jumped ship to become a software engineer at a small nuclear education company as a temporary employee.

After working as a softprog temp, I was getting fed up with them not offering me a full-time job, and the commute was 2 hours. So I accepted a job at a local hospital in my hometown as a software applications programmer.

I currently make 31,000/yr and live in California.

After seeing many of my less qualified techie friends get jobs at 3X as much, I started questioning my employment.

How do I go about changing this? I know this is a very stupid question, but I just really need some advice. Our HR department has set up a very strict promotion schedule (7% a year) which defuses the opportunity to ask for a raise.

Help a fellow techie out?

Current job duties include: Interfacing/implementing new hardware with existing network, program scripts and handshakes between said interfaces, designing and implementing new applications/interfaces to meet doctor's requests, maintain EMR translators and communications between said interfaces.

I also routinely assist the network specialists that I work with, and they are constantly querying me for advice."
1ht58j,9,2013-07-07,SDE internship as non-technical major,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ht58j/sde_internship_as_nontechnical_major/,"I am a political science major at a top school (by US News rankings; meaningless, I know). However, I am extremely technically inclined and have fallen in love with programming and computer science. As a rising junior, it's too late for me to switch majors without incurring a 5th year, which I would really love to avoid.

Is it possible for me to get an SDE internship for Summer 2014? I don't mean a developer internship at a young startup; I know that is very possible. I'm talking about typical ""brand name"" internships. Can I compete for the positions that are usually sought after by CS majors? What can I do in the next 8 months to get me to that level as quickly as possible?

I am currently working through Heineman, et al.'s Algorithms in a Nutshell. What else do I need?

edit: Also, do I need to learn Java/C++ or is Ruby enough (esp. for algorithm implementations)? Javascript? Would building in, say, Meteor.js be a cool thing to show off?"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Could you briefly explain what the illness does and what those rods are doing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/cax7zot?context=5)|The easy to understand version of this is: my chest cavity would not grow, and over time, my organs would be crushed to death by the rib cage. The rods are serving as prosthetic ribs, and the doctors would expand them as my body grew, growing my rib cage and chest cavity.
[So I assume most of the surgeries were to expand the rods? It looks like they have notches you could set. Anyway glad everything worked out and hope youl be able to do more physical things in the future.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/cax8akb?context=5)|Pretty much, I'd say every 5ish times was either a replacement, or when they put in the 2nd or 3rd one.
[WOW Can you tell me how often the doctors have to expand the rods?I mean does this require surgery to expand them everytime they do?Also is this painfull to you,can you feel the rods in your chest,thanks for your answers and I wish you the very best in your life.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/cax94c5?context=5)|Usually it was between four to six months apart, and it'd be a full surgery. I'd spend a week down in Texas each time, Monday would be pre-op (bloodwork, x-rays, CT, lung tests, etc), Tuesday was surgery, Wed-Friday I'd be healing up. I can't really feel them, but I know the scars are very visible on my back.
[Holy shit. That would be horrible.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxmjh5?context=5)|Agreed.
[Titanium is ok, was there an adamantium option?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxdfz7?context=5)|I wish; I actually used to think I was a little like Wolverine, just didn't have the metal in the right place.
[I reckon given you're alive and thriving you have metal in all the right places.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxe252?context=5)|Well said, but I couldn't hurt to have some extra. Throw in an arc reactor while you're at it too.
[What is management like with this disease?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/cax80bw?context=5)|1) There is no real management at this point, just seeing a doctor once a year and being x-rayed to make sure everything is holding steady. During my growing years, I would fly down to Texas twice a year (length of time between surgeries co-relates with how fast I grew), and they would expand the devices. They may also need replacement when they get to the end of the expansion length.
[What kind of restrictions are there with physical activity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/cax80bw?context=5)|2) The main restrictions are no heavy physical activity, no contact sports, and nothing very upper-back related (ex. I cannot do a single pull-up and its very difficult to do a crunch)
[Why would this syndrome contribute to Mental deficiency?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/cax80bw?context=5)|3) This was 92, when they weren't positive about too much with genetics still. They weren't even positive on the diagnosed disorder, since they knew very little about it.
[*no contact sports.*  So no using your titanium chest to win bar bets?  ""i bet you can hit me as hard as you want in the chest and you'll get hurt""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxgy3j?context=5)|Sadly no, because it'd be very possible for them to either move around in my body, or even come out.
[So you are like Wolverine...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxm178?context=5)|By come out, I mean stab through my chest or back, so not really.
[You mentioned you have strong religious reviews. What did you mean by this? I'm often confused by people thanking God for fixing their afflictions, when their beliefs imply God caused their affliction in the first place.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxb9kc?context=5)|First off, I am a practicing Catholic. I am aware this means God caused all of my conditions, but I believe he wouldn't give me anything I couldn't handle. Prayer was a coping mechanism for me throughout all of the surgeries, and I felt as if I would be rewarded, in a sense, for enduring this. 
[Do you have any trouble breathing? Do you have to use other muscles to breathe? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/cax90bu?context=5)|My lung capacity is about 45% of what it should be for my height/age. That's also a reason why I have problems with exercise, since I can't keep enough air in my system.
[Have you considered a musical instrument? The reason I ask is a boy in my high school band evaded respiratory therapy because he was in band therefore exercised his lungs daily and this is what it took to bring his lungs back to capacity. I just thought this may have helped. Best of luck!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxds95?context=5)|I actually play the Euphonium, and even though I shouldn't have, did four years of marching band.
[Now that you have titanium rods in you, what's keeping you from fighting crime?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxef0p?context=5)|Money, and working to get a college degree. Once I become a billionaire, I will fight crime. 
[Are you Adam Jensen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/cax9ubs?context=5)|No, and I have no idea who that is.
[Will you ever be able to have the rods removed? Are they physically acting as your ribs, our are they there to keep them from collapsing (our something along those lines\)?  Do you have ""baby sized"" ribs in your chest, since they would never grow, or have they just grown really slowly?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxh103?context=5)|The usual procedure is removing them at the end of growing, and then performing a spinal fusion. However, the main doctor, who was also one of the two inventors, felt that in my case, it would be better to just leave them in. As to the baby size ribs, I don't believe so, I think the implanted ones helped to coax the others to grow, somehow.
[Does it suck trying to go through security at airports and stuff?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxaika?context=5)|Nope, never had a problem with it, even with full body scanners.
[Do you feel pain sometimes because of these rods?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/cax8pmt?context=5)|Every so often, I get random back pain which I attribute to them, and if I bend or stretch in a certain way, I can get some pain. Nothing too major though.
[Do they ever feel cold or hot? Like in the winter or in a hot shower?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxixaz?context=5)|Nope, and if they did, I could never live in Arizona like I am now.
[I know someone with metal rods attached to his spine and he can't breathe well in the cold because they contract, which fucks things up. Do you have this problem or know why you don't?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxnaqo?context=5)|I have some slight breathing problems in the cold, and I also tend to get sick in the winter.
[Bitch please!  All women have iron rods in their backs.  But seriously, what do they do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxeiex?context=5)|At this point, they're just holding everything in place as is. However, they were to stretch my chest / rib cage as the rest of my body grew.
[Do you like the song ""Titanium"" by David Guetta?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxgtfs?context=5)|NO! He is NOT Titanium!
[You have three rods in your chest... *could it be?*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxnbig?context=5)|HL3 confirmed by my body? OMG.
[What are the costs like for having to do surgeries/scans every 4-6 months? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxkud5?context=5)|A lot more now than they used to be. It was about $400 for airfare (200 for myself and my mom), staying at a hotel, rental car, food, and then all the hospital care. I know my parents paid quite a lot for me over the years. Heck, my mother actually fought the insurance companies when I was 2-3 trying to get it covered. Back more on topic, I'd say each trip was around 750-1000 total.
[I read that this is hereditary, so my question is do you plan on having children when the time comes? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxl08w?context=5)|There's a lot of questions regarding the genetics of it. I do have a girlfriend, and I definitely plan on having children with her.  
[Are you an organ donor? Will the titanium rods be donated to future space craft?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxlf32?context=5)|I am not, and I don't see them being able to reuse the titanium rods. The structural integrity wouldn't be as great after sitting inside me for hopefully at least 90 years.
[My cousin had a cavity in his chest and it was compressing his heart and lungs. He went out to Arizona to have titanium u shaped rods put into his chest which were then flipped around to essentially ""pop"" his chest cavity out. Is this something similar to what you have?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/cax90jt?context=5)|It very well could be, I'm not very sure. 
[Do you feel that you can be active in what you do, for example your hobbies, sports or at work? Or is everything too exerting?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxkreg?context=5)|A lot of stuff is very exerting, and that's actually why I'm in IT. When I was little, with all my restrictions, the one thing I could do is sit in front of a computer. That's what I grew up doing, and is my way to feel like I can do something.
[I'm sorry if this question is too personal, but do you think you'll ever have kids or are you too scared of passing on your disorder?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxmxm5?context=5)|I do plan on having kids, however, I realize the unknown chance about passing this on.
[What's your favourite dinosaur? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxke0r?context=5)|Velociraptor, just because.
[What does math have to do with network security? (Not being a dick, honestly interested\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxp6xy?context=5)|Network Security is usually a ""sub-major or emphasis"" within a Computer Science program. Those tend to require Calc 2 or Calc 3. One school I looked at required Calc 2 before you even did any classes in your major, because they were mainly an engineering school.
[Gotcha. So it's more of a school requirement thing rather than something needed for the actual job? I was confused because network security in practice, in my experience, doesn't require high level math.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxr4ga?context=5)|Only if I want to hack the Gibson, then I need some high level math.
[So you dont have any ribs at all?  Your chest and sides are all, gooey, like your stomache?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caydxiv?context=5)|I actually have most of them, just missing a few.
[I have a question - how on earth do you get through airport security?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxi1se?context=5)|They are non-magnetic, thankfully.
[Was there any physical accidents or injuries caused by your titanium ribs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxlsuz?context=5)|No, but they once did some nerve damage to my left arm during surgery. 
[Sup wolverine! Appreciate the AMA! Why did your last movie blow nuts and when will you return to singing and dancing on Broadway?  P.s. You're tough as nails, titanium nails. Don't ever forget that, even if you're not the real wolverine, just a realer tougher human.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxtfo9?context=5)|I really appreciate the humor, and thank you for the kind words.
[How painful is this, and how do you cope with pain?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxso1z?context=5)|Only hurts when I do something stupid :D.
[Can you have some titanium rods put into your arms, for claw effect?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxhwr9?context=5)|I wish! As far as I know, its never been tested though.
[The courses you have to take for IT majors is beyond retarded. I have no college degree and my job title is systems/network/software engineer.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hrphc/i_was_born_with_a_rare_genetic_disorder_jarcho/caxmyo1?context=5)|Want to get me an internship? lol.
[No questions but best of luck with your life.

I want to apply for internships next summer because I know that most learning is from job experience and not school. Since companies usually start hiring for internships during fall/spring and I will basically have an empty resume (other than 2 semester of basic CS classes), and only about 50% of freshman land an internship, how can I make myself stand out among other applicants when I am going in knowing nothing? 

I plan to start teaching myself Java or Python, along with data structures. I'm not sure how far I will get with learning, but other than self-projects, what else can I do to increase the chances of getting hired somewhere? Am I being too unrealistic in expecting to get an internship as a freshman with no previous programming knowledge/experience? Should I just focus on research for the first summer?"

My leg was in a cast for almost three months. And it itched something fierce. During the time I was in it, Mr S had me do what Lou used to do, match the assignments to the agents. He said that he would be able to sort out a permaneant replacement for Lou by the time the cast is off.

I saw assignments I have never seen. There was one that required the agent to 'carve pentagrams into the skulls of freshly skinned victims and then arrange the skulls around the victims'. And for Halloween, they had to 'sacrifice three virgins on an altar'. How they found three virgins in this day and age, I have no idea.

It wasn't all bad though. Amber was still my secretary and she would visit often. I enjoyed her visits. More than a recently widowed man should I would admit.

The burnt man visited too. He was moved back into the field as an agent in my place. He told me Reap Co had backed off, but he still wore his kevlar vest. He doesn't have a secretary though. He told me he doesn't want one, not after what Mr Black did to his last one.

Anyway the day that the cast came off was a bitter sweet day. It was sweet because now I can take care of that itch. But bitter because I would miss staying away from the murder and mayhem this job comes with. It does grow on you, but even now it still unsettles me.

I turned up to the office at around 8. Amber's car was already there. I smiled. No one else was there. Unless they all carpooled with Amber.

I parked my car next to hers and went inside quickly. I hate the cold as much as I hated the snow. The blizzard last night didn't help my hatred of the white cold stuff at all.

Inside it was warm. It was always warm inside. I took the elevator up to the offices. As soon as I stepped off, Amber stood up and opened the door to my office. She winked at me.

I went into my office and she was sitting on my desk smiling at me. 'Welcome back, Mr Smith.' She picked up the files and walked over to me. 'These are for you.' There was three of them. 'I'll be at my desk if you need, assistance.' She whispered that last word in my ear. I smiled.

I sat down at my desk and opened up a file.

Name: James Connelly// Age: 66// Sex: M// Marital Status: Divorced// Dependants: 0// Debt Due By: 17 January 2013// Debt Owed: 1 Soul.

Note: Head must be removed and body placed in a seated posistion. Agent must then proceed to fill the neck with maggots and the head placed back on.

Oh great. My first assignment is one of the twisted ones I had to sign off on. My stomach already felt sick.

I stood up and opened the office door. Burnt man had arrived. Good, the team was all here. 'Grab your coats,' I said. 'We're going to uptown.'

Amber smiled, 'The Connelly assignment?' I nodded. 'Good.' She opened her desk and took out a small white plastic container. 'I already have the maggots.' 

We exited the building and got into my car. My last car, the Chrysler 300, got totaled when Lou rammed into me. Mr S was feeling generous towards me, for the work I did and for expsoing the mole, and gave me the car of my choosing. There was only one car for me. A 1965 Ford Mustang Shelby. It came in pitch black with tinted windows. I loved it.

We drove to uptown to Mr Connelly's house. It was a small estate. Obviously he came from money.

We got out of the car and I popped the trunk. Johny had outfitted me with a variety of arms and ammunition, all placed in the back. I picked up an axe. My pistol was already in its holster. Amber chose a shotgun and the burnt man went with an M4. I hid the axe under my trench coat.

I knocked on the door. Mr Connelly opened the door. 'Hello?'

'Hi Mr Connelly, I'm Mr Smith from S and Co Debt Collections and these are my interns. May we come in.'

Mr Connelly opened the door wider. 'Why of course! Come in, I have been expecting you.'

I looked at Amber and burnt man. They looked just as confused as me. But we went inside.

'Can I offer any of you coffee? Tea? Hot chocolate perhaps?' Why was he being so polite?

'No thanks, I rather just get to.business.' I said reaching in my coat.

The smile drained from Mr Connelly's face. He grabbed a fire poker and swung it at me. 'You won't be taking my soul!' He shouted.

I grabbed the fire poker and pulled it away. So he knew why we were there. Amber pushed him down and held him. I took my axe out and stood by his head. 'Thank you for choosing S and Co Debt Collections. Have a nice da-'

'Go to hell cunt!' He shouted. I smiled and brought the axe down, severing his head in one blow. His neck started squirting blood like a fountain. It got all over my shoes.

The burnt man watched the door. Me and Amber grabbed the body and out it in a chair. She then took out the white plastic container from her purse and opened it. The maggots were squirming and moving about. She tipped the entire container into the neck of Mr Connelly. I picked up the head and placed it on the body.

I put my axe away and we went back to the car. I popped the trunk and we put the weapons back. The drive back to the office took 20 minutes.

When we arrived there was a black Porcshe that I have never notices outside. We went inside the building and to my office.

Inside was a woman. She was about 5' 8'', black hair, blue eyes and a perfect hour glass figure. She was waiting for me. She said 'Hello Mr Smith. I'm Mary. I'm your new co-worker.'

'Nice to meet you Mary. But I'm sorry I already have a secretary.'

She laughed. 'Oh Mr Smith, I'm not a secretary. I'm the new assignment manager.' She walked past me out of the office. I could feel her eyes undressing me. 'I look forward to working with you,' she said as she walked past.

Amber slammed the door and said, 'I don't like her.'

Me and the burnt man looked at each other and laughed. I picked up the next file. My laughing immediately stopped.

The file had been switched. The stack Amber gave me did not have this file.

I know. This file is black. A Reap Co file.

The burnt man gave me a worried look. I returned it. The assignment had to be done. I had picked up the file.

'Another mole?' I asked the burnt man.

'I don't think so. Shes a transfer from the East Coast. They keep a close eye on their assignment managers.'

'So this must be from Mr S.'

'Has to be, hes the only one authorized to hand out black files.'

I walked to the window and looked out over the harbour. I could feel Amber and the burnt man watching me. I sighed. 'There is no other choice,' I said. I walked over to the desk. 'Lets try to do this safe.'

I opened the file.

WARNING: Reap Co File

Mutiple Souls: 5

Names: James McClary, Alex Rodgers, Jesus Rodriguez, Tyron Johnson, Micheal Mason// Age: 21, 34, 23, 22, 30// All Single// All Male// No Dependants// Debt Due By: At Agents Convience// Debt Owed: 1 Each.

Note: All are members of Reap Co and are considered Highly Dangerous. Proceed with caution. They roam together near the docks.

'Fuck!'

'What is it?' asked Amber.

'We have to kill five of them.'

'So we pick them off one by one,' said the burnt man.

'We can't, they are a team.'

'For fucks sake! This can't be done! One or two of them by themselves. But five? What the fuck is Mr S thinking?'

'We killed Reap Co agents before,' Amber said.

'Yeah, when there was one or two of them. And that was because we ambushed them.' He turned to me and said, 'or threw a body at them.' I smiled. I almost forgot about that.

'So what do we do?' asked Amber.

'We make a plan,' I said. I opened up one of the desk drawers and took out a detailed map of the docks. 

I picked up the file. 'There is a note here,'I pointed at a document in the file, 'that details their patrol.' I marked their route on the map. 'If we can ambush them here,' I marked part of their route with an X, 'at this choke point, we may have a chance. What do you think?' I asked the burnt man.

'Maybe, but we would need some heavy fire power. Reap Co started issuing full body armour last month.'

'Why?'

'Oh something about how they kept getting riddled with bullets,' he smiled devlishly.

We discussed all the details of the plan before we were statisfied.

'Right, now lets go see Johny about some heavy ordinance.'"

The classes havent really gripped me, and my lack of interest lead to bad grades. I've decided that if I change my major, it would be to CS. I took an intro class last semester, and really liked the material, plus I've been learning/using Linux for the past year and love it. I pay for my tuition via Stafford loans (hooray for the fucking interest increase), but I live off campus. I would have all but one social science course and a math course to complete the core requirements, so I could focus on the major classes for the rest of my time at tech (however long that is). Ideally, I want to be a declared CS major in the fall and try to land an internship in the spring (after taking 1331) to start gaining experience. I am qualified to switch my major, and I plan to have a few github/bitbucket projects going by the start of the fall term. I think it's a sound decision, and my family does as well, but I want my peers opinions. So, am I about to be a total fucktard or save myself from a fruitless degree?

One of my big questions is: should I put my work in production on my resume?  While it's not directly related to the industry, it does show that I've been working extensively while still in school.  I have one or two small projects/tools that I've developed to make my work in the theater easier, but nothing in terms of real development internships since 2010.  


I have a whole host of reasons that my education and experience are valuable towards other work environments, I just have to get to the interview, and that's where I feel like I have a slight disadvantage.

1hvyxc,4,2013-07-08,Pathways into CS/tech from a maths degree,cs1123,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1hvyxc/pathways_into_cstech_from_a_maths_degree/,"So in September I'm going to go into the final year of my 4 year undergraduate (MMath) mathematics degree. 
My career plan throughout uni has been to just worry about the maths at the moment and figure out a career before my final year. Well my final year is looming ahead of my now and I'm still none the wiser about what I'm going to do. 

So I've been seriously looking around these past few days, considering all the options, when 
Computers &amp; IT took my eye. I've had a bit of experience programming -- last summer I had an internship and I spent most of it VBA coding through Excel and Access. I've also done a bit of Matlab script writing during my time at uni. Not much compared to a computer science graduate, but I feel, enough for me to know that I enjoy the problem solving aspects of programming, and certainly would like to work in tech. 

Now if I am to believe these maths careers websites, I, a soon to be graduate with zero experience with C or Java or even Html, am just as employable as a Computer Science BSc. Apparently, tech companies are to be awed by my problem solving and transferable skills, and be willing to give me all necessary training (a lot) and a job, for free. 

[**TL;DR** Thinking of going into IT/tech after maths degree with minimal programming experience. Wanting to know if possible, and how.]

So questions:

* Is this true? Would I be employable into the tech industry with an MMath degree? 

* If so, where in the industry would look for maths grads? (programming/'software engineer' or not)

* If not (or as a backup if above doesn't work out), could/should I do a computer-y masters/course to help CS-ify my CV. What would I do it in, would I struggle, and where would I stand with respect to careers afterwards. I would much rather build on what I have (MMath) than starting afresh (e.g. CS BSc)


P.S. Sorry for the butchered (lack of) distinctions between tech, computer science, software engineering. If you could also broadly give an overview of how the industry runs and what jobs go where, that would be great too. "
1hvv0u,34,2013-07-08,I am not doing well academically and I need advice.,[deleted],gatech,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1hvv0u/i_am_not_doing_well_academically_and_i_need_advice/,"In the Fall, I will be entering my 4th year in the undergraduate computer engineering program.  I was originally planning on graduating in Spring 2014, but that isn't going to happen.  Thankfully, paying tuition is not a big issue for me.  However, my issue is that I am performing poorly academically and I think it's too late to turn things around.  I'm afraid that I'm not going to graduate or I'm not going to have a chance at a job when I do graduate.  I have a cumulative GPA of 2.26 and I was placed on academic warning.  I have had to retake more classes than I can remember.  Nonetheless, I have learned quite a bit and am performing well at my internship.  I am doing the internship this summer and was told I should do 3 terms of it and make it a co-op.  I do not know if this term of internship will count though since I was placed on academic warning after I registered for the co-op permit.  I enjoy the internship and I enjoy the material related to computer engineering, but because I didn't seek help and I made poor decisions, I'm doing pretty bad.  I don't want to switch majors, I don't want to give up, and I don't want to waste my parents' money.  What should I do?  What things should I consider?  Or am I just blowing things out of proportion or letting my depression take a hold of me?  I'd appreciate it if you were respectful in your posts, I know how some of these threads turn out... Thanks for reading, and I hope you're enjoying your summers.

1hvtar,4,2013-07-08,How varied should my references be?,diamondsfrost,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1hvtar/how_varied_should_my_references_be/,"To keep it brief, I have been at my present job for 3 years and before that, worked 1-2 internships. I was lucky to find this job so quickly, but I'm also looking to stay open to better opportunities.

As it stands, I can get two references from my present job. One is retired, the other is a present staff who has been very mentoring and encouraging. Neither were/are my direct supervisor. Would it look good or bad if I used them both? 

I have 1-2 good references from my last internship. No issues there. I intend on listing at least one of them.

The internship *prior* to that, I am iffy about. The field is completely different to my current one and I didn't get along very well with the person who agreed to provide a reference (so..not sure how many good things that person will have to say). The big boss is too busy and my other direct supervisor there has left and won't give references. And honestly, I feel like i have grown a lot since I worked there that what they can say would no longer represent me accurately. 

University references are a little stretched, since it was a few years ago.

So... would it be ok if I listed multiple references from my present job? Would it look unusual? I work with many people on different projects, but I feel like what they have to say is more 'up-to-date' than old internship references."

Columbus, OH July 14th and 15th. Super Interns is seeking interns for two days during The Association of Horticulture Professionals OFA Short Course Expo. Being the Largest Horticulture trade show in North America the audience is expected to be fairly substantial and interns will work side-by–side with Co-Founder and 1/2 of the Dynamic Duo of Super Interns, Super Julie Braun.

Interns chosen for this event will have the title of “Event Planning Enthusiast” and will assist Super Julie, the key note speakers, and the audience. Other opportunities will be creating the social media posts while gaining a career building experience.

“This event is going to be big!” Braun enthusiastically stated. “We will need Event Planning Enthusiast at the top of their game – who are driven and are ready to learn.”

Braun will be conducting an interview with Jeni Britton Bauer and Ryan Lang.

Bauer is the owner of Jeni’s Splendid Ice Creams and author of The New York Times best-selling “Jeni’s Splendid Ice Creams at Home” and James Beard Award winner. Lang is the founder, co-owner and master distiller from Middle West Spirits, the first distillery in Columbus since prohibition and is also the founder and president of the Ohio Distillery Guild, Ohio’s first governing body for distillery operation in nearly 100 years.

“I have been with Super Interns for a few months now and have been working alongside Super Julie throughout.” stated PR Agent Morgan Masse. “Believe me when I say you will learn a lot very quickly and have fun doing it!”

The Dynamic Duo of Super Interns (www.SuperInterns.com), Super Julie Braun and Super Michelle Demers, have worked with well over 2000 virtual interns all across the country for a variety of businesses and non-profit organizations. They are the thought leaders in the field of virtual internships and are able to train both employers and interns on working effectively in a virtual environment.

###

[Would you prefer they not check for crashes/bugs/etc and just let you do the testing yourselves? Or do you think it's a useful service that has helped in the past?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caycyaz?context=5)|I like the fact that they at least some basic testing. It forces the developers not to be lazy and let the users QA for them when it is live. It makes sure that when people buy a game, they know that it will at the very least boot without a crash :)
[Hum... Microsoft did it well with FEZ. *If you know what i mean.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayj9mo?context=5)|Haha, yes Microsoft has an ""interesting"" policy when it comes to updates. Luckily we can update TT2 on the Wii U as many times as we want to, without being charged ridiculous amounts of money. At this point I don't know Sony's update policy on the PS4, but please let it be as far away from the XBLA update policy as possible. 
[I made an alpha version and posted on newgrounds, it received very good comments from people who are able to play it and enjoyed it. But I also noticed there is a huge number of people who ignored the game. I hope its not offensive to plug it here, in case you were interested. Link to www.newgrounds.com.  So here is where I need advice from you guys, how do you play test certain genre of games? How to reach the right audience for it? Because I believe especially for inexperienced indie game developers like me, play testing really helps improve a game. Or Am I wrong? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caycya9?context=5)|We don't playtest genres to test which genre we should develop for: we simply make games that we feel are fun to play. That's why, most probably, we haven't made a FPS or an RTS. Most designers here don't like those type of games. I think it is very important to make a game that you would enjoy yourself as well.
[What do you consider an indie game? With minecraft reaching epic proportions lately and now under fire whether it is an indie game or not, I'd love to hear your opinion/definition on what an indie game is. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caycudp?context=5)|Personally I'm not too fond of the word ""indie"". It has been used too much now and I think people tend to use it as some kind of measure. ""You are indie? You are cool and make awesome games! You are not indie? The hell with you. Your games probably suck""
 |In the traditional sense, an indie developer is a developer that can independently create his own games. And independently means: without a publisher. But let's be honest; (almost) every indie developer needs to have a platform like Steam or PSN or App Store or whatever to distribute their games. In that sense I think Valve, Nintendo, Sony etc have become the new publishers. So unless you sell your own games on your website (like Mojang does), how indie are you really?
 |Question is: does it really matter? Does it matter if you're backed by a publisher or investor, by Kickstarter or by money you made from previous games? No! What matters are the games; their quality and the amount fun.
 |End of rant ;)
[Do you think releasing your game on the day the Steam Summer Sale starts is a good idea?  It could be easily overlooked.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayadxm?context=5)|Perhaps it is a stupid idea, perhaps it is not. We don't have any experience with it.
[What do you get on your pizza?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caycddm?context=5)|It's a veggie pizza! Well... it *was* a veggie pizza :D.
[You went out, purchased, and consumed an entire veggie pizza in 51 minutes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caycu8h?context=5)|No, I think I managed to do all that in under 15 minutes :)
[Edge is super creative and fun, how did you guys come up with the idea for it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caya6ki?context=5)|Credit is given where credit is due: we only did the Steam (PC/Mac/Linux) version of EDGE. The original game was made by Mobigame.
[How was it like to work on a 'port' of a game to other platforms, then? What challenges did you guys face?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayab1d?context=5)|A LOT! The original game was fake 2D. The Steam version is completely 3D. So apart from the game-logic, we had to rewrite the rest.
[There is a EDGE Port for Steam4Linux? I still miss it in my Library. Mostly i play it on my Tablet ... Adding another Game to my Linux Library is always welcome ;\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayalkt?context=5)|We're working on a Linux Steam version of EDGE/RUSH and Toki Tori 1!
[You mean 2D, fake 3D not fake 2D :P.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayazsl?context=5)|You're sharp! Correct, it was 2D (Fake 3D)
[I I got EDGE on iOS way back in 2008 when it came out. It's still my favorite iOS game!  How was it fake 3D?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caydfqt?context=5)|The game only used sprites. There wasn't a single 3D rendered object in the game :)
[How was the Potato Sack ARG set up? Was the overall structure (logo + 16 word phrase + letter for each game for phase one, then password-protected .zip files for phase 2, ""play all the games"" for phase 3\) of the game done by Valve, or did you guys contribute to that too?  What was it like making puzzles for an ARG?  Was there anything we missed? =\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayexl2?context=5)|All the ARG developers were invited by Valve to come over to come up with these ideas. So the ARG was the result of several meetings and a gazilion emails.  Working on the ARG has been the most fun for me in years!  I think there were a couple of missed clues, but we implemented fail-safe mechanisms for that, to ensure you didn't get stuck.
[As someone who developed for the GBC, what do you think of chiptune artists and others who continue to make art using those older systems?  I picked up Toki Tori in a previous Humble Bundle but I'll be buying this one as well because I enjoyed the game so much! Thanks for the cool games! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayagvx?context=5)|I don't think chiptunes and 8-bit art will ever go away. As a matter of fact, we added the EDGE and Toki Tori GBC chiptunes to this humble bundle!
[Ever went to Eindbaas in Utrecht? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayelly?context=5)|Nope. Is het wat?
[When you get an idea for a game. Do you target a specific audience? Such as age, gender,play style? I played tokitori 1 and edge and they are very different 'feels'. Edge is more mature and precision where as tokitori is just playful ad childish.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caybvoz?context=5)|TT1 just happened; we were very young when we made it and I don't think we ever heard about ""target audience"" before. I'm sure we didn't, otherwise we didn't make an overly cute puzzle game with devilish hardcore levels :)
[What engine do you use to port/create/develop your games? If multiple, which do you prefer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caybvoz?context=5)|We use our internal engine.
[Finally, would you take interns? I am greatly interested in getting my hands dirty as many other friends of mine in college. And thankfully I don't have the necessity of a full fledged salary as of yet. Win win as they say.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caybvoz?context=5)|We do take interns yes. Check out our site: [Two Tribes Jobs](http://twotribes.com/overview/cat/jobs/) So feel free to apply, but do note that we hardly hire interns from abroad. But thanks a lot for your interest!
[I haven't played your games yet, but which is your favorite from the ones you guys have developed? :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caya4lt?context=5)|Good question, for me it would be Toki Tori 2+. And I'm being honest now :)
[Hi there. Congrats on the latest Toki Tori 2, played it on the WiiU, great game. I'm a developer myself and I'm interested in knowing a couple of things. How many people worked on it?  Also what kind of tools and languages do you guys use? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayapqn?context=5)|Hi there  co-developer! :D Our core team has about 10 persons, excluding 4 audio peeps and 1 story telling guy. We write everything in C++ and use Squirrel as scripting language. But I'm sure Eelke can detail more on the tech-side!
[Hi Martin, thanks for replying.  I've been playing around with some scripting languages too and am inclined to use AngelScript. Maybe Eelke can tell more about that choice, maybe because Squirrel has no GC, but I'm just making assumptions. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayb2rb?context=5)|There is GC in Squirrel, but you can do it manually. I believe we don't use it since we're using weakrefs as much as possible. But Eelke can detail on all that stuff :D Squirrel is nice, but unfortunately it isn't as well supported as compared to other languages such as LUA or even JavaScript.
[Are any of the changes from Toki Tori 2+ going to end up back in the Wii U version? I heard Nintendo allows updates on digital games much more easily now than they did with the Wii.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caydlij?context=5)|Yes, we'll do our best to put all changes in the Wii U version as well!
[I'm referring to the player character being awfully slow, and seemingly puzzles being built around that. like the birds that grasp on to you and bring you to higher places. was very tedious for me and my sister. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caye1fw?context=5)|Too bad too hear. We always love to hear feedback and I do understand your position on this. In Toki 1 the character runs around like crazy. In Toki 2 this changed. But we did this intentionally because T2 is not the type of game to be running around like a headless chicken. It requires you to absorb your environment. Look around you. Watch the animal behavior etc. The game is much more about thinking than it is about acting. That's why we strongly felt that a fast moving protagonist was inappropriate for this type of game. 
[How did you guys get into the business of developing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayab5s?context=5)|We started working on Toki Tori GBC when Collin and I we're still living at our parents. We developed on homebrew GBC hardware in our spare time. Over 13 years ago. I'm getting old :D.
[Changing the pace here, what do you think of the new consoles that are coming out soon?  Also, what's your favorite food? Haha.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayb7qc?context=5)|I personally like the Wii U and are really interested in the PS4, mainly because I already played with the dev-kit. Food: authentic italian and asian. But right now I need a pizza! :D.
[I have toki tori gbc! sorry to say i have it used. but i did purchase toki tori for steam.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caycjd3?context=5)|To be honest; back then it was all new and super exciting; there was a new world opening for us. Suddenly people played a game that we'd been working on for years. It was awesome!
[What was the vibe of making a game for gbc at the time vs. making one for anything being released now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caycjd3?context=5)|These days it is still super exciting (and sometimes scary) to create something that will be played by thousands of others, but it also tends to be more business oriented as well. We ask ourselves question such as what is our metacritic score, why isn't Kotaku covering our game, do we make enough money, what are our medium and long term goals, is our staff still happy etc. That's all part of business I guess, but personally I sometimes wish I could go back to 1999/2000 :)
[Other than Toki Tori franchise, what you guys' plan in the long run?  Will you be developing games outside your comfort zone such as non-platformer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayagmx?context=5)|We created some non-platform games in the past: Rubik's, RUSH, Swap This!, Worms Open Warfare 2. So we're always open to new ideas. But we only have one focus, which is Toki Tori 2+. Once we released that, we'll take a long deep breath and see what's next...
[Do you have any plans to create a sandbox game?  Minecraft will be a good example.  I believe any open world challenges/puzzels/adventures will be a fantastic addition to Two Tribes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayawqf?context=5)|Well, we are shipping a level-editor with Toki Tori 2+, so you are able to create your own levels. Perhaps in the (near) future we'll enable people to write their own mods/custom scripts for the game, allowing them to create their own (mini) game within the Toki Tori 2+ world. Other than that, we currently don't have any plans for a sandbox game.
[Why don't you have more tribes? Are you some kind of casual? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caybm2j?context=5)|More tribes? Well, when we started 13/14 years ago the original members were part of two demo groups. Hence the name :)
[But yeah, where do I go? I went to a club and rocked out with a bird for a little bit, that was unique, and fun.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayc20z?context=5)|Thanks for all the kudos :D After you left the club, where did you go? Are you playing a review copy?
[I think I just went back to the overworld with the bird, and yeah I'm playing a review copy.  D: Never seen Grease?! Well, after Toki Tori 2+ launches you should all celebrate by watching it :P.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caycjob?context=5)|Have you seen any golden frogs yet? Thanks for the movie tip, I'll give it a thought :)
[Don't think I have, but I'll keep an eye out for them, thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caycnwv?context=5)|No problem! If you need more help, feel free to ask!
[I really like the look of Toki Tori, and considered getting it on the Humble Bundle Weekly, but realistically I know I probably won't get chance to play it, and my wife is complaining that I'm buying too many games.  My question is... I would buy the game for about £0.40 (or $0.70\), but I'd feel guilty doing that, like it's abusing the system. Would you still want my sale, or are people that would only play this much a scourge to the system?  Also, whats the process of getting on the Humble Bundle? Do they approach you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caye8is?context=5)|It is pay what YOU want. If you think it is worth that amount or if you don't have more money to spend: no problem. You decide! We won't flame you if you buy it at a low price: it's the other way around, we're happy that you are interested in us and our games! So pay whatever you want! And I hope your wife will love our games as well :)
[Hey, will Toki Tori 2 see a Linux release (incl. Steam\) ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayaddu?context=5)|I would say: yes, but it might take some time to port.
[As an independent developer, what do you think is the hardest part of developing a game, whether it be coming up with a concept or actually following through?  What would you describe your development process as being like, as far as when you focus on gameplay, graphics, sound, etc. or do you tend to flow more naturally with each project?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caya7y2?context=5)|The hardest part? Staying within the projected timeframe! We tend to 'go with the flow'; sound/gfx/gameplay etc all flow naturally from the design.
[Thank you for the positive answer ;\) i played Toki Tori 1 and really liked it so i hope i can the second part someday to my library. (hopefully on steam ;\) \)  Is there a status on TokiTori 1 for Steam4Linux?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayak0w?context=5)|Working on it! Hopefully it'll be live in a matter of weeks (perhaps even this week!)
[When will you update TT2 for the Wii U to include the level editor? Will Wii U owners be able to share levels? Will PC owners?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayd9mz?context=5)|The Steam version will have Steam Workshop integration for level sharing from day 1. The Wii U version will follow later this year.
[Did you feel the use of Indie Bundles aided the sales of your games, not just during the period of the bundle, but afterwards as well?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayaf41?context=5)|The bundles definitely aided in terms of direct sales. I'm not sure what the long term effect is though.
[I hear Nintendo is making a serious effort with the Wii U to be more developer-friendly, especially to indie developers, than other consoles. Does this match your experience?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayai7t?context=5)|It is definitely more developer friendly than the Wii was. They have Visual Studio integration and an awesome profiler, which really helped the development of TT2.  But from what I've seen, my bet is on the PS4 development environment. They seem to be *really* dev friendly. But... I only touched it briefly so far.
[Why are you releasing Toki Tori 2+ on the first day of the Steam Summer Sale?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caybndo?context=5)|Ha! A trick question! Sorry, cannot comment on anything related to the Steam Summer Sale. It's all up to Valve.
[Aside from your own games, what are your favorite games?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caydckl?context=5)|Monkey Island(!!!), Day of the Tentacle (Maniac Mansion), Zelda Windwaker, GTA series, Resident Evil... and probably a whole bunch of other OLD games :)
[So, what's coming after Toki 2? Do you guys have anything already in the works, or is your guy's focus solely on Toki 2 right now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caycm36?context=5)|At the moment: Toki 2+. Up next (probably): Two Tribes classics (TT1, EDGE and RUSH) for Wii U and Toki Tori 2+ for PS4. We have been working on TT2+ for almost 2 years now, so we can't simply release it and move on to a next project. First we need to make sure everyone is able to enjoy TT2+ on his favorite platform.
[What system is the hardest to make games for, and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caya6xr?context=5)|The systems with the lowest specs are always the hardest to develop for in terms of technical challenges. So I've to go for the GBC 
[Does that mean the PC/Wii version was a bit easier to make than the GBC version? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayafne?context=5)|Yes.. But! If you have a system with hardly any boundaries, it is easy to keep on adding until eventually you'll hit that boundary. And then you still need to profile, tweak, optimize etc...
[What is your opinion on the Oculus Rift and do you own one? As a fellow dutchman I enjoy my Oculus Rift, but I do not have the skills to make anything with it :P.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayfcea?context=5)|I would love to play with it, but unfortunately we don't have one. 
[How would you describe the atmosphere of your office?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caybu5u?context=5)|Relaxed with a lot of humor, especially during lunch.
[A technical artist contractor from the netherlands that I used to be a roommate of spoke very fondly of his time at Two Tribes. His initials are H.H. I've heard all about the late nights, it sounds pretty satisfying to work at your studio.  So anyway, my question is how many fulltime employee's do you have and how much do you have contracted out? How many of the founders are still at the studio? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayjbho?context=5)|Hajo! Awesome, please send him my regards. We miss his weird sense of humor every day :) We have 10 people working for us, 9 FT. And we outsource all audio and Linux/Android/3DS porting work. Two of the original founders are still at Two Tribes.
[Hello, fellow game developer here.  How did you guys get started on making new IPs, as opposed to do contracted work/projects for larger companies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayafsu?context=5)|Hi there co-developer! We were kinda forced into it. Back in 2008 we finished our last work-for-hire project (Rubik's) and then it became very difficult to find new WFH projects. That's when we decided to take matters into our own hands.
[Thanks for the awesome games! Will Toki Tori be made available through the Google Play store in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caya5hi?context=5)|Toki Tori 1: yes!

And Toki 1 is now part of the [Humble Weekly Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/weekly) and Toki Tori 2+ will be launching on July 11th with a massive discount! So now you know why :)

But first I think Nintendo should release some of their system sellers to attract a bigger audience. I am really fond of the Wii U as well and I'd love to see it succeed.

Find someone that can make cool art (or do it yourself). Make something original (no, another angry birds is not original). Be creative and have a lot of fun when you create the game. That's a start :)
[How many people were working at Two Tribes when you started the original Toki Tori for GBC?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/cayalm9?context=5)|Two Tribes didn't even exist when we started working on it.

[Even if you don't have it on a Humble Bundle, I always like to get games my kids can play too.  How about this: Can you load off of the .exe, or will you have to be logged in to Steam to run it?

[Have you guys ever tried using Unity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hvdpl/we_are_two_tribes_creators_of_toki_tori_2_ama/caye3qc?context=5)|Some at the office have, but we never made a game with it.

1hvg1h,1,2013-07-08,Advice for a young teacher looking to switch her occupation.,yolo_ipso_facto,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1hvg1h/advice_for_a_young_teacher_looking_to_switch_her/,"I am 25 years old--I just finished my first year as a high school English teacher and I want out! I've been transferred to another school for the fall because I am a part-timer and I was hired after the start of the school year last fall. The idea of starting over again at a new school, in a field that I don't even want to be in anymore, is doubly depressing. There are a multitude of reasons that I want to leave teaching, mostly I feel like an inauthentic asshole every day because I have to ""teach to the test"" and I am mentally/emotionally exhausted all the time. I am done with being sick and sleep-deprived. I am a decent teacher and my students and coworkers like me, but I just can't do it anymore. 

I have been on several interviews (mostly through networking) for non-teaching jobs in the past 4 months, but nothing has come of it. Part of the problem is that I have a masters of teaching, which seems to disqualify me for every other job in this type of economy. In each of my past three interviews, I was asked, ""Now, *why* would you want to *leave teaching*?"" in a super antagonistic manner and I didn't have any idea how to respond! In one interview, an interviewer commented snidely, ""Wow, you have had a lot of *different* work experiences."" I am at the point where I don't get nervous for interviews anymore, but I have a hard time dealing with these two issues in particular when looking for jobs. 

Prior to this, I held an odd assortment of of part-time and temp jobs throughout high school and college--ranging from food service, to driving a ""drunk bus,"" to desk jobs involving writing. I've never been fired or anything like that--I just seem to get bored and move on, or the position gets cut. I have been working since I was 15, but I've never had a full time position. The job that gave me the most satisfaction was working as an intern at my college's art gallery, but jobs like that are pretty hard to come by these days.

Are there any former teachers out there who could give me guidance? Can anyone in general give me guidance about how to address the interview questions? Thanks!

**TL;DR** - I am a first-year teacher and desperately want to find a non-teaching job. Can you offer any advice or describe your travails as teacher/education major job-seeker?"

After next spring I will have completed most of the core CS curriculum at my school including Intro Programming, Discrete Math, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Computer Systems, along with electives such as Theory of Computation and Linear Algebra. I do enjoy a lot of the CS theory that I have learned thus far, and so I have thought a lot about grad school (master's at least) along with the caveats that come along with continuing education over looking for full time positions after graduating. Since I'll only be a sophomore next year, I assume an internship is not as essential, so I was thinking it will be alright to research with one of my professors next summer. However, what about junior or senior summer? If I decide I definitely want to get my master's, should I do as much research as possible, or still try and get internship positions? Does having research help or hurt when applying to internships and or full time positions as opposed to work experience? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. "

There are some things that I've established as being the very basics of my company. 

So far, I've come up with two things:
(1) 1% of the companies profits goes to opensource projects. This is due to the main reason that I am using mostly (almost only) opensource software. So I think it's a good way to give back. 

(2) All internships are paid. All my competing companies are using a crazy amount of unpaid internships but, considering I've been on one, I know that a paid internship is profitable either for the worker and for the company. However, I'm afraid that this takes competitiveness to my company, specially in the very beginning.

The point is too see how far I can go with a different level of ethics. I'm far from being a Buddhist monk - in the end, money is obviously important.

I was offered a decent salary and benefits, but want to make and do more.  I'm 24 right now and my goal is to have the architect title by the time I'm 30 - I think that's attainable.  That's really all the further I want to go in IT because any further and the hands-on aspect dwindles far too quickly.  

Anyhow, I've been eyeballing some certs that I'd like to attain relatively soon.  Specifically, the MCSA.  I believe that's going to be a great stepping stone to certs for me.  I have a couple questions regarding the MCSA and certification in general:

* MCSA 2008 or MCSA 2012?  I've never even looked at 2012, so I don't really know what's different.  Is it going to be that much of a gamechanger if I get the 2008 and not the 2012?

* What material should I use to study for the MCSA?  I already have a pretty strong grasp on the majority of the Windows Server 2008 R2 fundamentals, but brushing up on everything in an organized and structured fashion will do me some good.

* A pretty broad question here: what exactly is required of an Infrastructure Architect?  I've done some reading and, due to the title being relatively new, the specifics haven't been nailed down.  I kind of figured them to be along the lines of a system admin with average/above average development knowledge in applicable languages as well as average networking fundamentals and storage understanding.  So a mix of several things with a focus on making it work well together.  Any advice here would be appreciated."
1hu122,2,2013-07-07,"Got dumped, notice of deportation and the most painful throat infection this week.",[deleted],rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1hu122/got_dumped_notice_of_deportation_and_the_most/,"Out of all these things, getting dumped is the biggest thing. I met, what I thought (and still think), my soulmate last year. She is perfect. Just everything about her is amazing. Before I met her I was pretty cynical and would've never committed to a long-distance relationship. I never believed in soulmates. I had never been in love. 

I met her last summer, weeks before I was due to emigrate to another country for a fantastic job. Honestly, I was sad to see her go but I knew I had bigger fish to fry and kinda forgot about her. But she didn't forget about me and constantly pestered me to Skype and keep in contact. I had the impression she was in love with me which I thought was crazy as I had only spent a tiny amount of time with her. Anyway, through a bit of back-and-forth via Skype and email, it turns out this girl is amazing. We couldn't be more compatible. She loves the same music, holds the same values, has the same tastes, passions and interests. Just everything about her ticks all of my boxes.

She comes to visit me this Winter and holy fuck, is there fire works! Everything just fits so perfectly. The chemistry, the bond, the compatibility. Everything was there. And the passion too! I didn't think I was ever capable of having the sex that we had. It was just amazing. Unfortunately, this came to an end. She had to leave and I had to stay. So just like before, but now we've committed ourselves to a monogamous relationship. 

Everything is going great as it was before her visit; long Skypes, daily messaging, dirty talk. That is until she has to complete an internship as part of her degree. This requires her to move to another city where she'll live with an ex. An ex that she was with for 3 years and they had only ended weeks before I met her. She's also sharing a bed with this ex but assures me nothing is going on. And I honestly do believe her because I saw how stressed she was when he was trying to get back with her. She lost all physical attraction to him before they ended it and apparently that was a big contributor to their demise.

While living with the ex, we can't Skype as much as we want. They live in a tiny bachelor so we were constantly being interrupted and sometimes he'd want to sleep when she'd be Skyping with me so we'd have to rush goodbyes etc. This just piled on so much stress that wasn't necessary. Fast forward a few weeks and with her bachelor thesis due and the culmination of her placement, we have no time to Skype. This upsets me and I try to hammer it home that with a long-distant relationship, communication is the only thing that we have. We eventually get past it and all is rosey again.

Then... she goes on holidays to visit an old friend. Apparently they aren't as close as they once were and she's really upset about that and wants nothing more than to leave. One day, she casually mentions that he doesn't even know about me. When I make an issue of that she gets upset and says I always have to pick something to fight over. This was the big fight and the result of this was 2 weeks of tortuous silent treatment that ended up with a phone call telling me that she doesn't want to be in relationship. 

True to my belief, I beg her for a Skype as I know that communication is the key and 2 weeks of no contact allowed her to build some distance from me and forget what we have. We Skyped last Sunday. It was so nice, so perfect. As it always was. Like I knew would happen, she was reminded of all the things that makes us good. How compatible we are and how well we fit together. She says she still wants her space but she really loves the good morning messages that I continue to send her etc. She talked of visiting me this August though she did ask ""what then?"" after she visited. That it would be back to where we always were, apart. 

Fast forward to midweek and I have an awfully sore throat. I put it down to my new air conditioner and forget about it. But on Thursday, it's so bad I call in sick to work. On Friday when I come in, the HR woman comes to my desk and tells me that my visa renewal has been denied over a tiny technicality and there's nothing that can be done. I have to stop working at my fantastic job in 3 weeks. So massive kick in he balls number 2. But I do see the silver lining of being able to be with my now ex. I text her the good news but I get nothing. I tried to make it sound a bit non-chalant but I think it may have come across very intense if picked up incorrectly. It was along the lines of ""Oh and my visa was declined. Free to see the world now, you're free to join."" I text her today asking would she be free to Skype and if not, let me know so I'm not waiting around. I got no reply and it's way too late where she is to be expecting anything now. So yeah... I'm at a loss of what to feel.

And to make matters worse, the sore throat from the air conditioner is actually a pretty severe case of a staph infection and I've spent the last 3 nights in and out of delirious dreams, wimpering in pain to myself and sweating my own weight in ice cold, greasy slime. I feel awful.

Here's to another sleepless night tonight, followed by another day no eating and painfully slow meetings in work. I can't even talk... or at least without it sounding as if I'm gagging on a pair of balls. I thought I had something to look forward to when I got home but now I'm right back to severe recession, no prospects and a broken heart.

Whinge, whinge, whinge... I know. But I think I can feel sorry for myself for a little while."
1htygp,6,2013-07-07,Accident prone summer student - venting,CapillarianCrest,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1htygp/accident_prone_summer_student_venting/,"I'm a second year Mechanical Engineering student, at the University of Saskatchewan. Prior to starting school, i worked for a local heavy equipment machine shop as an assistant machinist. I've returned there for summer work the past two summers. 

I have a propensity for making mistakes. Last summer I was grinding lugs off a large carrier frame when the grinder i was using (the guard had been removed. It was my responsibility to either not use it or to find and reattach the guard. I didn't think of this, instead thinking of getting the job done as quickly as possible to impress my superiors) caught and kicked back and dug into my leg, requiring 10 stitches. Later that same summer, while moving around large (around 12 foot diameter) brake arms with a forklift, i knocked one over causing some dings and marring the paint. 

This summer, while lifting a large pinion from on top of a large gear (around 1000 lbs a piece) i incorrectly rigged the pinion, causing it to flip over while lifting and hitting tooth-to-tooth with the gear. Minor damage to both, to be repaired.

After this incident, i was brought into the safety manager's office, sat down with the production manager and he, and told that they don't think i belong in a production environment. I was told that if i hadn't been remorseful, or given them any lip, they likely would've fired me on the spot. Tomorrow, i go in to talk to those two as well as my direct supervisor about what they'll be doing with me. They flat out told me I may be fired.

I have a history with this company. I love working there (or i did up until now, i'm close to throwing up from the stress/guilt). They both said they like me as a person, they just can't afford to have me in the shop being such a liability. I don't know what's going to happen. 

This is why i went back to school in the first place. I'm clumsy and accident prone. I just want to sit at a desk, to perform analysis, calculations, work out equations, create drawings and design. I don't want to be operating cranes and forklifts, because i know i'm likely to cause accidents, and i don't know how to help it. Sometimes while working with the cranes i'm so nervous something will go wrong i'm literally shaking. 

I requested at the beginning of the summer to work in the engineering department, not on the shop floor, but i was told they had no positions there and was placed in the heat treatment department. It's a dangerous environment, but I find materials science so fascinating that i was thrilled when i found out. Now i don't know what to do. 

Does anyone have advice?

I was just offered an internship for next year earlier this week. Now i don't know if that's still on the table. 

Some have advised me to be bold and state that i don't appreciate their attitude toward me and won't be seeking the internship if this is how i'm going to be treated. It was a mistake after all. But i don't think i have the footing to do that. My managers are right. I made a stupid mistake and my history makes me a liability. I probably don't belong in a production environment. 

God i just don't know what to do. The thought of jumping off a bridge crosses my mind from time to time, but it wouldn't do any good. I just want to prove that i'm useful. "
1hyypa,2,2013-07-09,[need advice] What did I do wrong?,throwaway_loser1,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1hyypa/need_advice_what_did_i_do_wrong/,"A few months ago, I was hired at a local animal clinic to tech/ intern with a local vet. This vet Dr X owns the clinic and agreed to mentor me, to improve my clinical skills, to help me prepare for my clinical boards. I am a foreign vet that has been out of practice for more than 10yrs. 
From what I understood and discussed with Dr X, my job was working with Dr X on all X
's cases, and helping out with clinic chores during my downtime. Dr X worked at two locations and most days were half days. So I was not able to establish a routine with clinic chores at either location, although I did take over reception/ pharmacy during breaks, helped clean up rooms between visits etc. 
A daughter of Dr X (lets call her Y) was also working at the clinic as a tech but was supposed to be leaving soon to go to vet school. Anyhow, things were really great for the first 2 months and then suddenly got weird.
Y started coming to the clinic and taking over the cases I had been working on, with Dr X. She would discuss the case with Dr X, conveniently leaving me out of the loop, try to 'diagnose' a case and propose treatments. She would do so, without paying attention to the past history or lab work, or even what the owner wanted/ could afford. She would make changes to the chart or do follow-ups but not document it or would incorrectly document it. 
Since the chart was not updated correctly, it was hard for me to determine the progress of the animal during the most recent visit and do a proper and thorough followup. 
Her mother preferred to ignore Y's changes and basically turned a blind eye towards her behavior.
Y's behavior towards me got increasingly bizarre. If we were working together, she would follow me around trying to correct or question every move I made. She would be rude or stand-offish if I asked her for her help or opinion. Being a shy, non-confrontational dummy that I am, I just let her act this way, since all I wanted was to gain enough clinical experience to pass my boards and had no intention of competing with her. I did my best to work with Dr X and the only thing I can see is, our line of communication got increasingly strained as Y kept making in roads into our cases.
Yesterday, I was called into the office with Dr X and the practice manager (who is less manager and more ass kisser) and told that Dr X did not want to work with me. I asked Dr X what the problem was, and she said, I wasn't progressing as she wanted me to. I explained to her, that she had not indicated that I had any problems, nor did she discuss if I made mistakes. I told her, I welcomed positive feedback/ criticism as my job was to learn as much as I could from her. We had this discussion at the time of my hire, and I also explained my personality traits especially my shyness that tends to passivity in situations I don't have any active role in. 
She contended that she had not been able to mentor me the way I needed, and had not been vocal about her expectations of me. 
The practice manager then spoke up and said that other techs were complaining about me. This was curious since I got along with all of them, except Y. I asked specifically what was wrong since I prefer understanding my shortcomings and improving on them. He then gave me these reasons-
* I was giving a slightly belligerant cat some fluids and told it to 'shut up' in an exasperated manner while it was growling and hissing at me. He and Dr X both called it abusive language. 
* I called an obese animal 'overweight' and said it needed to lose weight (not in the owner's presence) and they told me, this could hurt the owner's feelings. Dr X told me a previous colleague was being sued for throwing an animal against the wall angrily. I said that while that was outright abuse, how was my name calling related, since they are two totally different instances.
* I 'rolled' my eyes when someone asked me if I entered treatment protocols into the documenting system. No date or time was given or any context. 
* I was not helping with tech chores like vacuuming or sweeping. 
* I was not following up on cases (the ones that Y made undocumented changes to!!)
These seemed really bizarre reasons to me, and the only person who I can think is responsible, is Y. 
Am I wrong in assuming that? This has made me feel really sad as I had a lot of respect for Dr X and know she is a good person at heart. I can't imagine that she would encourage her daughter Y, to act in this manner. 
Please give me some perspective.

TL;dr- Boss's daughter undermining me for past month resulting in my job loss.

 * I've taken an Intro to Finance course (purely for myself) and an Excel course.
 *  Really worked on my financial literacy and have studied what the industry is generally like.

* What are some things you wished you did as a freshman?
* What classes should I take?
* What are some things I can do to get my foot in the door?
* Any exams I could attempt or internships I could get?
* Any thing you wish you could scream at incoming employees or students?

Here's the back story: I started out at a small business college in south FL studying marketing, hated it there, transferred to a huge tech school in upstate NY, loved it there so I changed my major to information security &amp; forensics and held a 3.6 GPA. I was sexually assaulted by an RA and then sucked into an abusive relationship which also sucked me into a pretty bad bout of PTSD, depression, anxiety and pretty much screwed up my academic life. I was then suspended for poor academics and went home for a bit. I then transferred to a small Catholic school closer to home, in Philly. I hated it there, got into fights with the professors and students and ended up dropping out before they kicked me out academically because I just couldn't concentrate and focus due to the mental health issues I was having. I spotted a summer internship in DC for a computer science internship and grabbed it. I loved it. Except my PTSD did not. I ended up being admitted into Georgetown hospital for a bit at the end of my internship. So I decided I'd go home and try to get things calmed down and such, so I transferred to University of MD's online program which hasn't been very successful to me either, I just came out of Johns Hopkins hospital after more than a month's stay due to problems with depression and PTSD.

My concern here is that I seem to be spinning wheels and crashing continually, obviously wasting time and a lot of money, while I am in classes. I do very well teaching myself programming and other IT things. I was wondering if I shouldn't just drop to one or two classes a semester or just drop out, take some certifications, and search for a job that will get my foot in the door doing something I love. I have been feeling that college isn't right for me for the past year or so but everyone keeps telling me that's depression talking. What is everyone's view on this?"

I've worked at IBM for 3 years as a test engineer and have 2 years of intern experience at Oracle while in college.

I've got both an Electrical and Computer Engineering BA and basic conversational Spanish.

However, most of my experience is in hardware testing.  Throughout the testing I was involved with a good bit of software, but it was always written to 'good enough' standards (as it was automating hardware tests).

I'd be willing to move over to software, though I'd still need to overcome the learning curve of a pure software environment.

Are there hardware opportunities in Argentina that anyone knows of. Or, How willing would a tech company there be to allow me to overcome the learning curve?

Thanks"

I’m currently halfway done completing an internship for my post-graduate program, and I cannot say that I am finding any passion in what I am doing. I feel like I’m living out every day just to get to the end and sleep. Like every day is just a chore, and something that I have to do; going through the motions and feeling helpless and trapped.


I am 22 and currently moved back to my parents’ house (dads side) for the time being after feeling intense depression at my apartment alone. I cannot say that I feel much better at home. Everything I do is constantly scrutinized. I feel like I am a 13 year old living at home. My brothers now avoid me since they know about my mental illness. My mom and I have not spoken in 8 months because my step father screamed at me in December in front of my whole family to “just fucking eat” “you’re disgusting” “stop causing your mother grief” and basically told me to get out of the house because I had anorexia and it ‘made my mom sad’. 


So now I feel faint, exhausted, depressed, and alone every day. I want to just get up and leave, but so many things are preventing that. I have a long term boyfriend who is the only positive part of my life. I don’t have enough money to be able to move or pack up and leave. I can’t do this anymore. I just need a way out of this endless cycle of pain. I don’t know what else to do.

Oh, and I've tried therapy. It's done nothing, and it's absolutely exhausting emotionally to have to retell my story to a new therapist constantly. I just can't do this. "
1hxsut,17,2013-07-09,Fulltime job but only a student...,omeganemesis28,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1hxsut/fulltime_job_but_only_a_student/,"So, from my understanding, it isn't a full offer yet but I had reached out to a studio for possible internships months back. 
An HR rep sent an email the other day out of the blue saying I would be a good fit for a programming role, and asking if I was interested.

After clarifying, it is indeed a full time role and it would start immediately if I were to start.

This is insane opportunity for me, but I'm still in college. I'm actually in an internship currently with a non-game development related company for another month.

I'm just unsure of how to approach the situation I guess. I obviously am not in a position to say yes but this is a huge opportunity. This is something I've wanted more than anything.

Should I explain how I'm still a student in college and if there is anything I can do part time or something intern-like?  Whats the best approach for me?

EDIT:
How does this sound?

&gt;Hello again,

&gt;So before I answer the questions because I am very interested, I just wanted to inform you that I am still a student in college with 2 years until graduation.

&gt;I would be free Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday all day but I'm afraid Monday and Thursdays I would have classes starting in late August. Would I still be accommodated if I am chosen for this position? I would hate to waste your time if [company] would not accept these constraints. 

&gt;If not, would there possibly be any other part-time or internship roles available, one that might even support this QA Engineer position?

**UPDATE**:
Got a response, hopes crushed momentarily. :P
It was a mistake on their part after I sent the above message, they didn't realize from the stuff I gave them I wasn't a graduate yet. Not sure how though.

However on the other hand, the fact that they found my resume and CV at least somewhat qualified for the position gives me high hopes for next summer when I go for a second round of internship hunting. Cheers everyone who assisted and offered advice. Now if only more people got back to me when I was looking haha"
1hxrcy,12,2013-07-09,Trying to gain first-hand experience - setting up first Domain Controller,anotherpoorboy,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1hxrcy/trying_to_gain_firsthand_experience_setting_up/,"I've frequently lurked this subreddit and have picked up several useful tips, and today I've decided to finally join reddit to ask for help. I'm working a summer internship at a pretty good company as their PC Systems Specialist, but I want to learn even more during my off hours. I have access to decent hardware in my apartment and I've decided that the best way to learn about domain administration is to set up my own domain controller. However, I'm running into some issues.

Mainly, I'm getting the following warning in the Event Log from the DNS Service:


    The DNS server is waiting for Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) to signal that the initial 
    synchronization of the directory has been completed. The DNS server service cannot start until the initial 
    synchronization is complete because critical DNS data might not yet be replicated onto this domain controller.
    If events in the AD DS event log indicate that there is a problem with DNS name resolution, consider adding
    the IP address of another DNS server for this domain to the DNS server list in the Internet Protocol 
    properties of this computer. This event will be logged every two minutes until AD DS has signaled that
    the initial synchronization has successfully completed.

I've only got one server, from my understanding during setup, the DNS services and Active Directory services are all running from this single server. Active Directory is not reporting any issues, only DNS. When I try to join a virtual machine (using Hyper-V) to the domain, it cannot find it. I can, however, ping both ways (virtual to physical, physical to virtual). 

For additional information, for whatever it is worth, I only have one NIC on the server. Does this have any implications for DNS functioning? I don't have this computer connected to any networks, the NIC goes entirely unused physically, so are there any settings I need to change in the properties?

Have any of you ever set up a domain controller from scratch? I have access to Server 2008, 2008 R2, and 2012. I would personally prefer using 2008 R2 since that's what I've seen used most in the environments I've been at, but if you have more experience in something else, I'd still like to hear about it. 

....I know that is a lot of questions. But I'd love to learn more about domain administration, so any assistance that can be offered would be most appreciated. I don't expect anyone to want to hold my hand through this, but a nudge or even a semi-gentle shove in the right direction wouldn't be met begrudgingly. Thanks. :)

**Edit**
I got it working. Thanks for listening to my questions. In retrospect, this should have been a simple thing to do. I think my main issue was my misunderstanding of how virtual network adapters should be configured and how they're managed by Hyper-V, and over-complicating things (especially with DHCP, thanks for that hint, /u/ashdrewness

In the end, what it took was giving the virtual adapter on the physical machine a 10.0.2. address, and making sure that the VM had an address on the same subnet, and assigning DNS manually. 'Cause, you know, no DHCP. This was a good exercise in logic. Thanks for helping me out! I'll be sure to check out the 70-640 materials. I recently got a copy of what I think has been hailed as the bible (AKA, The Practice of System and Network Administration, Second Edition) and I'll be giving that a read during my hours not filled with sleep, work, or domain testing. If you have any suggestions for me in my endeavors, please let me know. I love learning about this stuff, and I love the challenge even if I have to ask for help once in a while. 

Thanks again, all. :)"

I've considered getting help from family, but I know once you are committed to rehab it makes buying certain supplies impossible while that history is on your record. I don't have an exact time frame of when I plan to do it, but I like the idea of at least having the option when the time comes, because my medical and criminal history is otherwise perfectly clean.

I'll just say a little bit about my situation. I'm a 21 year old male that was raised in a middle-class family and I've had a pretty good life. I've had steady jobs since I was 16, and I'm now on my junior year of university in electrical engineering, and I have a paid internship at a respected company doing software engineering. (The only thing I have going for me) I don't actually do well in school, I've failed some very important classes and fucked up my GPA, but honestly that doesn't bother me much since I don't enjoy school. I like learning about things at my own pace at home...Since I have no friends I use my money to buy electrical lab equipment and I entertain myself by building amplifiers, messing with microcontrollers, etc. So the only positive I can think of, is my loneliness has led to me spending some of my time learning about electronics, which allows me to make a pretty decent amount of money for my age.

That isn't to say I haven't wasted most of my life so far. I've spent thousands of hours playing computer games, as I've always been somewhat of a loner. I haven't even been playing games lately though, because I've been so depressed that I just go to sleep when I get off work. I recently moved into an apartment with the one friend I have and it's been going pretty well, we manage to pay rent on time and there is food in the fridge.

So I guess you could say those are the positives in my life, but let me just list a few of the negatives. I've never even touched a girl. When I see people on here bitching about breaking up with their girlfriend, I dream of even having a girlfriend to break up with. Ever since I was 13 I had kept thinking, ""next year will be it, and things will change!""....well it's 8 years later now and nothing has changed. I'm still pretty young but at this point I've accepted that if I do continue to keep living, I'll be the dreaded 40-year-old-virgin. It takes so much effort for me to even do the most simple tasks. I'm pretty much late for work every single day and some days I end up just sleeping and not even going in. I have no doubt I'll end up losing this internship soon.

What point is there in working and going to school when there is nothing else to look forward to? I've finally reached the point in my life where I can say I fucking despise electronics. I've wasted 10 years of my life playing games and busying myself with dumb bullshit on the internet, never developing relationships with anyone. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm scared to get help for reasons mentioned above....my free will would be taken away, in sense. The only thing that gives me any happiness is driving around at night by myself listening to music, dreaming of smashing my car into a brick wall...but unfortunately I never have the balls to go through with it.

1hwyi7,1,2013-07-09,Preparation for post-Junior year summer internship,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1hwyi7/preparation_for_postjunior_year_summer_internship/,"I'll be a junior year Computer Science major starting this semester. I plan to start applying and interviewing for an internship this upcoming Fall. I have a relatively strong overall GPA of 3.6, and a major specific GPA of 3.9. Having just completed my Data Structures / Algorithms course, I recently learned many new useful programming tools and concepts; as well as putting them into practice with the class programming projects (albeit, the projects were relatively basic and we were guided towards which data structures were needed to complete each task). 

While I consider myself to be an average programmer in comparison to the majority of peers in my Comp Sci courses, I'd like to really strengthen my knowledge and programming skills for the next two remaining months of summer. Not only in preparation for upcoming classes, but also for potential internship interviews.

What are some exercises or concepts I should focus on learning for the internship? I'd like to put many of the programming data structures I learned about into practice, and understand when and why they are necessary. For every five structures or methodologies, we would maybe get to program one or two of these for assignments. And to be fair, that was all we really had time for with the time allotted. My next two Comp Sci courses this semester will be Assembly Language and Software Engineering Concepts. 

TL;DR Any advice for post-Sophomore year exercises and internship preparations?

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[What is something about working at NASA that the average person  (someone who doesn't work at NASA\) wouldn't know?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/cayjnr2?context=5)|That we only get less than half a cent of the federal dollar but still make it work.
 |That the work we are doing is for the benefit of all and not just for the government or military.
 |That there are a lot more women working for NASA than you would think.
 |This list could get pretty big.
[How does it feel to be on the cutting-edge of science and have 98% of the public think you get too much money? For the record, I'd like to see us quadruple NASA funding. It would just get to me after a while. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/cayjrri?context=5)|It makes me kinda sad. We get less than half a cent of the federal dollar in funding.
 |I could only imagine what would happen if funding was quadrupled. So many projects coming back to life ... so many jobs.
[As a follow-up, what would you like to see happen if that were to occur?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/cayjydx?context=5)|More funding for manned space missions. I think it is silly that we haven't gone back to the moon in over 40 years. This would then be followed by more research in future propulsion systems, because they are needed if we ever plan on exploring the rest of the solar system.
 |I would also like to see more funding for alternative energy b/c yay environment! It would be great time for breakthroughs. If only we had said funding!
[How was the interview for the internship?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/cayhxv6?context=5)|There was no interview (surprisingly), although I've heard that NASA interviews can be intense. As in, they are not allowed to so emotion and its just a simple back and forth. No jokes, no conversation.
 |The internship is 10 weeks long.
[Is there a lot of Naruto fans at NASA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/cayib62?context=5)|Believe it.
[How old are you (if you do not mind me asking\) and which college did you attend as well as what discipline did you study in?  Sounds like a NASA internship is a fantastic way to start your career.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/cayhypx?context=5)|21, Case Western Reserve University. I am finishing my BS in Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering.
 |I'm really happy I got an opportunity at NASA and I plan to stay with them.
[Do you have an interest in space and the moon or just advanced scientific practices?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/cayj0bn?context=5)|I would love to work on designing future moon mission, and deep space exploration is one of my greatest passions. If anything, it would be awesome to work with future propulsion systems. That's where my interests truly are. 
[Future propulsion systems like new fuels, nuclear reactor engines? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/caynf7r?context=5)|Fission/fusion engines (nuclear) are basically the only things left to create. There are also electric propulsion but they have been around for years.
[What are some of the other jobs they put you to do as an intern? Also, how does it feel to be an intern at an important agency?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/cayib8g?context=5)|Interns are assigned a project by a mentor (NASA employee doing actual research) from the get go. Usually the project is related to or part of the mentors project. Some people work in wind tunnels, some with rover stuff, some with re-entry materials. The list is huge.
 |""Research and Development for the Benefit of All.""
 |It makes you feel important.
[Do the permanent employees make you get coffee for them? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/cayhxgp?context=5)|No, you are treated like a person with a purpose. This is why I enjoy this internship, but it can also add pressure since you feel like you have to do something important.
[Is your project related to engines what work in zero gravity? I know that fighter jets engines are capable of starting and running in 0g?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/cayi06f?context=5)|My project is related to regular combustion engines. Working in micro just allows us to see the effects of the electric field much clearer. Fighter jets are capable of starting in 0g, thats how that start back up when they stall out.
 |Up in space the velocities of gas in rocket nozzles are so high that E-fields will have virtually no effect on the reactions.
[How do you simulate micro-gravity in lab?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/cayipd4?context=5)|Micro-gravity is essentially the same as falling without the wind rushing past you. Its like being in an elevator and having the elevator fall down the shaft. The elevator blocks the rushing wind, and you are simply floating inside ... well until the eventual crash.
 |Anyway ... we simulate micro-gravity the same way, but with a drag shield instead of an elevator, and with cameras watching the test rig inside the drag shield.
 |We used to do simulations in the [vomit comet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_gravity_aircraft), but that gets expensive. 
[How tall is the air shaft?  Are there cameras onboard or something? At first I was picturing some kind of tiny rig, but I suppose it could be bigger than a breadbox?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/cayig4f?context=5)|There are two shafts at GRC. One is a 500 ft deep (yes, it goes underground) shaft that is vacuumed out for a 5 second drop. The test rig is then pressurized and setup in a bus (looks like a crayon) and dropped. The bus is pretty big, 3 ft at the widest and 8 ft tall?  The other shaft is 80 ft tall for a 2.2 second drop. The rigs for this are setup in a drag shield that looks like a rounded wedge. It prevent the air from rushing in and blowing at the flame while the flame just uses the static air around it to burn. Here is a picture I found of one on google: [Link to facilities.grc.nasa.gov](http://facilities.grc.nasa.gov/drop/images/1994_05818_M.jpg) 
[Wow! That's really nifty. How does it stop without obliterating itself? 5 second free fall might be fun if you don't take massive damage at the bottom, no?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/cayiwca?context=5)|Haha, silly me. I forgot to mention it's cushioned by a 20 ft deep pool of Styrofoam beads.
 |The shorter one uses an airbag.
[How long does it take to evacuate the shaft? Or is there some sort of airlock so that not the whole thing hast to be evacuated after inserting the rig?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/caz4isv?context=5)|The bus is loaded at the top of the shaft and then it is evacuated. It takes about an hour to take out the air.
[EDIT: Are the shafts only used for experiments with flames or also for other kinds of zero gravity experiments?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/caz4isv?context=5)|As far as I know, it has only been used for flame experiments.
[What is the most interesting project currently being worked on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/cayj0hm?context=5)|Well, there is talk about an asteroid capture mission in the works. Hopefully the funding for it holds.
 |There is also the [James Webb Telescope](http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/) looks like its gonna be freaking cool. 
[How difficult to get an internship or job at NASA? I've always dreamed of working there eventually but I'm scared of not being smart enough. Are they very prestigious?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/caylf11?context=5)|They don't just look for academics, but also look for passion and ability to work with others. If you are persistent your chances for getting in increase.
 |They accept people from a range of years from high school students to past 4th year undergrad seniors. Just apply, show that you are really interested and don't get yourself down. If you don't get in the first time just keep trying, heck it took me multiple tries.
[Any room for social scientists? I'd love to contribute but as a social scientist, it's tough to find opportunities to work there, even as an intern.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/cays3wi?context=5)|If you are interested it is always a good idea to apply. Don't even worry about your major. Just find something interesting and that seems like something you can handle and apply.
[Is NASA very selective with their interns? What qualifications did they look for? Do you have to be at least a junior in an undergrad program to apply? Thanks for doing the AMA, I've had a lot of questions about NASA internships for a while and wasn't able to ask them.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/cayjgi8?context=5)|I feel as though they look for decent academics, willingness to reach out, your passion for your interests, and ability to communicate/work with a team. SHOW that you are interested!
 |I've met several high school students currently interning and many sophomores/juniors. If you are interested you should apply regardless of your undergraduate status. If you don't get it the first time, just try again. I applied to many different programs and got denied from a few until I got selected so don't get bummed if you don't get it the first time.
[How's the pay?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/cayirbh?context=5)|Great, but the experience is amazing.
[What is the most bizarre part of working at NASA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/caylfmr?context=5)|I was taken aback on how the center is like its own entire campus. Also, you can basically walk around the center and just learn about stuff if you have free time. 
[How does the living situation work, especially if you are still in college? Do you just happen to live near your internship site? May be a dumb question, but oh well. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/cayk228?context=5)|Not a dumb question at all. I was lucky enough to attend college nearby and just got summer housing there.  People are very helping in helping you find a place to live and NASA sent out a lot of open apartment information. They also ask about living preferences when filling out your acceptance IIRC.
[I dont think you underst...should we tell him?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/cayiysj?context=5)|Its the whole ""geraffe"" situation all over again.
[Computer Science major here; I've always wondered, how many programmers work at NASA? How easy/hard would it be to get a job (or internship\) writing code for a NASA project? I imagine there is a lot of scrutiny for potential programmers, since they need to develop code that runs on very expensive equipment.  There was a post on the front page recently where a little boy wrote in to NASA and they sent him some stuff back, including a NASA sticker. I thought the sticker was really cool and I would love to have one, do you know where I could get one?

CS is a huge field that basically everyone is looking for so I'm sure you wouldn't have trouble finding something here.
[What is the future of space exploration?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/cayotue?context=5)|NASA is currently developing ORION which will be the new Multi-Purpose crew vehicle that will lead to future human missions. Hopefully to the moon, then to mars and beyond.
 |To go to Mars and beyond, we would need to develop nuclear rockets (fission/fusion). I dunno, there is so much we could still do but these are the immediate things we could do.
[Any goals for when you graduate / full time job? I interned w/ Boeing at NASA's Redstone Arsenal in the Saturn V first stage assembly building working on the space station back when I was in college. Lots fun, but working under NASA's umbrella was pretty tough sometimes. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/cayjl62?context=5)|I want to get into a fellowship program or a part-time situation while I continue with graduate school. If I really like the project I work on at that time then I would consider a full time job.
 |It would be awesome if I got to work on propulsion research.
 |That internship sounds pretty awesome. Saturn V is a monster, such a cool rocket. I'm pretty jealous.  
[What is the coolest thing you have seen/done an how does one get an internship at NASA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/caylxcg?context=5)|You can get an internship from here: [Link to intern.nasa.gov](http://intern.nasa.gov)
 |I've seen some wind tunnel tests and some microgravity tests. I've also worked with dangerously large amounts of voltage. I dunno what the coolest thing is though ...

Propulsion is one of my favorite topics. I'm pretty sure Johnson has some research, they have the Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science (ARES). Not sure how big they are with interns.
[Why was the letter dated today if the project started June 3rd? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/caym9la?context=5)|Interesting, i didnt notice that. I pulled up the letter on word and took a snapshot when I was posting this, maybe word edited it to today's date?  
[That seems pretty unprofessional of NASA. Surely they would of sent a PDF. I know Word is janky but I've never seen it change anything on a document. Especially when it should of been opened as ""view only."" ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1hw549/i_ama_intern_at_nasa_ask_away/caymldl?context=5)|Most of the documents I actually had to sign came in pdf's through mail.

Mech engineers do a whole bunch of stuff here at GRC.
 |They can do research, testing, analysis, code work in a diverse range of categories. You could work in wind tunnels, engine work, flame analysis, re-entry vehicles, rover research. It's a really big list.

1i14jw,2,2013-07-10,OpenCV Problems; strange behaviour of a simple gradient program.,Channukah_Boy,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1i14jw/opencv_problems_strange_behaviour_of_a_simple/,"Hello programming gurus out there! I just started messing around with OpenCV as part of an internship I am doing, and I am falling pretty hard. Part of my program involves taking the simple x-oriented gradient of an image. My code is as follows:


int main() {

 Mat A;

  string filename;

  cin&gt;&gt;filename;

  A = imread(""/home/boyang/""+filename, CV_64F); //read in image into matrix

  int r = A.rows;

  int c = A.cols;

  cout&lt;&lt;r &lt;&lt;"" ""&lt;&lt;c;

  Mat gradx(r,c,CV_64F);

  for (int i = 0; i &lt; r-1; i++) {

    for (int j = 0; j &lt; c-1; j++) {

      gradx.at&lt;double&gt;(i,j) = A.at&lt;double&gt;(i,j+1)-A.at&lt;double&gt;(i,j); //take gradient

    }

  }

  namedWindow(""windowname"",CV_WINDOW_AUTOSIZE); //print image to screen

  imshow(""windowname"",gradx);

  waitKey(0);

  cvDestroyWindow(""windowname"");

}

This code will print a strange image that seems to have 3 of the originial image, but all loosely connected and in black and white. 

I know the problem is somewhere in the ""CV_64F"" part of the matrix initialization, because this code works with ""CV_8U"" and unsigned characters; however, I need my numbers to be doubles. 

I guess most of my problem is that I don't understand what the ""CV_64F"" represents. The OpenCV documentation wasn't really clear.

[Here's an original image](http://i.imgur.com/LUmfmkr.jpg)

[Here's what the above code does to that image](http://i.imgur.com/KwGD04j.jpg)

[Here's what the above code does if all the CV_64F and doubles are replaced with CV_8U and unsigned char, respectively](http://i.imgur.com/oZT0tqV.jpg)

Ultimately, my question is: Why does CV_64F squish and screw up my gradient image, and CV_8U does not?

Thanks for your time and help!"
1i11ud,3,2013-07-10,Help||Advice on seeking entry level job,pegleg2060,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1i11ud/helpadvice_on_seeking_entry_level_job/,"**TLDR; Just a blurb about me, look at my resume and project list what can I improve. I have plenty of time to build a project so what should I build to stand out.**

I am about to graduate and I need to know how to get a job in the CS field. I applied for internships this summer and never heard anything back. The one phone interview I had was with someone who was a recruiter and didn't understand a thing I was taking about.I feel like I struggle to present myself on a piece of paper

I ended up taking a job overseas to get some work experience because I didn't want to sit around all summer.It turned out to be more like system admin work so far rather than programming. I had to setup an SFTP server so far, not exactly the most exciting thing in the world. I did learn some bash scripting and feel more comfortable in linux because of it. VIM included lol that thing's learning curve is rough. 

Anyways my strongest languages(In order) are Java, Basic C, Python. I have dabbled in some c++, html, javascript not enough to say I know it though. I am teaching myself Haskell at the moment so I can learn more about functional programming, and I am working on my first android app. Haskell is pretty fucking cool if you haven't tried it out yet you should.

All criticism is good even if it's hurtful. I know I am doing something wrong and I really just need help. I love programming and I really just want to work already. I don't even mind relocating(Clearly I'm in Kuwait). Maybe you could give me some ideas on how to stand out above others as well. I don't mind getting my hands dirty with code and I have what feels like a bottomless amount of time at the moment this summer. There is nothing to do here lol. 

Anyway here is the link for my resume- https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s_slN9DUxQ624_9JBcDzksgykaHHEfYv8gRpT5ELMOo/edit?usp=sharing

:--|:--
[As an adoring ice cream fan I naturally have three chest freezers large enough to hold a human body filled with ice cream. These cause large drains on my electricity bill and must be damaging my carbon footprint.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazrh4o?context=5)|Okay, so here's the deal. Those freezers are using the [refrigeration cycle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_pump_and_refrigeration_cycle) to cool off the inside of those chests. If you live in a cold environment then it heats up your house which is fine, but if you live in a warm climate then you're essentially heating up your home then using the same cycle (!) to then remove that heat given off again using your AC unit.  Second fix - can these chests be located in an unconditioned area like a garage so that they don't heat up your house in the summer?  Third (unrealistic) fix - you use hot water right? Why can't that hot coil (the condenser coil) on the back of your fridge be used to heat incoming water? It'd make the fridge more efficient and lower your cooling and water heating bills all in one. The problem is that marketable solutions for this sort of thing would be complex and you'd need skilled installers. All of which costs money, so typically we just plug stuff in and deal with it.  EDIT: someone mentioned below that additional insualtion could cause a fire. If you can see the condensing coil then it shouldn't be a problem. If you have a chest freezer where the condensing coil is below the exterior sheathing then you can't add additional foam as it would cover the coils and keep the coils from dissipating heat. Basically, you'd have a bad time.
[What can I do to more efficiently store my ice cream? Is there an easy solution or should I completely rebuild? I am happy to do either. Complete blue sky thinking.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazrh4o?context=5)|This is fantastic. Man, I wish there were more products out there to deal with this sort of thing. I mean, everyone owns a refrigerator right?
[So what are some design elements that help to make a house more energy efficient. Assuming you are building a new house. What's the top there things that make a difference. And can they be implemented in existing homes (built 15-20 years ago\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazrln5?context=5)|Air sealing.
 |Properly insulated walls with minimal [thermal bridging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_bridge)
 |Solar orientation in relation to location of windows.
 |Shape of building (long and thin vs. compact with no bump-outs)
 |Air sealing is probably the easiest way to retrofit older homes. Additional insulation can sometimes be added but it can be expensive if it's not in the attic or easily accessible. Upgrading your AC/heater is another good option (heat pumps, high efficiency water heaters, etc.).
[Have you used non-conventional material like treated straw or mud for construction?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazt1fv?context=5)|I have not personally but I have seen successful projects from high design firms with those materials. Rural studio does some of this. It's possible, not really my cup of tea although I do like the look of rammed earth walls.
[Are there any real energy savings from building a house out of poured concrete?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazt5b4?context=5)|It would be more airtight so yes.
[When designing a new house, how do you find a good design firm?  Any reliable rating/review systems out there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazt5b4?context=5)|Ugh, it's difficult. Find recently built buildings in your area and find out who built them. I often find these people through blogs.
[When building a house, how do you find good construction companies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazt5b4?context=5)|Usually same deal but to a lesser extent on the blog front. Also, most architects have people they like to work with and trust.
[Most importantly, how do you make a really energy efficient house that is also zombie proof.  Note: Walking dead type zombies.  Not the Running dead type zombies in World War Z.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazt5b4?context=5)|I would do an ICF wall house with additional exterior insulation, and if you're serious about the zombies just get impact resistant glazing (they make them for FL) make the openings high enough or narrow enough that they can't get through. Also, shotguns. Or just hire me. I used to shoot people professionally.
[I've done that somewhat.  I can find a lot of places that ""look"" good, but since I'm a computer geek, I don't know if it's built and designed well.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazw653?context=5)|Air tightness is really tricky to gauge and measure. There are standards (ACH50) but it's trickier than that. You can typically find before and after studies from retrofits though.
[What is your opinion of ICF (insulated concrete form\) homes?  The cost to build seems to be about 15% higher in my area (US midwest\), but the long term heating and cooling costs are really appealing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazss3h?context=5)|ICF's are great. I mentioned this elsewhere but my only beef with them is the interior foam. I want more foam on the exterior. ICF's typically do not have a higher R value than a typical stud wall. What they do is mitigate thermal bridges and leaky cavities. This combined with the reduced noise, won't rot, and increased protection (tornadoes, cars, bullets - I'm in Chicago) is what makes them better.
[Would you recommend ICF for a desert environment?  I'm in Yuma, Arizona, where it'll climb over 115 degrees F in the summer.  ICF's R ratings are very attractive, but will it do well in extreme sun and heat?  Will the foam break down?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cb01vq1?context=5)|ICF's should be fine in that environment. Actually, some types of insulation perform better at different temperatures so there may be some slight advantage or disadvantage. I can't remember off the top of my head which ones do which.
 |As to the breakdown. So long as you keep the UV off it with brick, stucco, a rainscreen, whatever - it should last far longer than either of us. The stuff they use, EPS, is the same stuff used to make styrofoam cups that environmentalists hate because they never break down...
[I'm actually an architecture student going into my sophomore year (undergrad\) and I was wondering what you might recommend doing to get maybe an advantage over my classmates? Or just planning for the future? (I.e. getting an internship\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazrzms?context=5)|Talk to your professors and find the ones who you share an interest with. Offer to help them and work with them. You'll learn stuff and meet people. Same goes for your classmates. One day you'll be working with them and relying on one another. Meet people, talk to them, don't be shy. My whole class helps each other get jobs. I've gotten jobs for three people I went to school with and another one got me my current job. Document your work. *Document your fucking work*. Make your portfolio now. Carry a resume with you everywhere you go. Update your resume constantly. You're in the design world, your resume should look like it.
[When designing a house, how much thought is given to the construction with regard to fire safety?  From what I understand, modern construction techniques (using manufactured wood products, gusset plates, adhesives instead of 'real' wood, screws, nails\) makes modern houses much more prone to catastrophic collapse during a fire.  Do you have any insights as to how these problems may be solved while also keeping costs down, or is the only solution to throw more money into the build and use better materials?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazs162?context=5)|First off, buildings aren't designed to be fireproof. They're designed so that you have enough time to get out.
 |Fire safety is an issue that is addressed literally everyday where I work. All the codes are built around it, especially in commercial construction (which I work in). It's so pervasive that you really don't think about it because it's just built into everything.
 |2x material (2x4's, 2x6's) is combustible but the sheet rock (gypsum board, drywall) it's covered in has a fire rating of 1 hour. Gyp is really really cheap. Two layers gets you two hours, etc. This is the cheapest way to fireproof just about anything and a major reason why every house is drywalled in the US.
 |The manufactured timbers you're talking (~~TJI's~~, glulams, paralams, etc.) about are actually considered heavy timber*. Heavy timber is actually very fire resistant and all those products are tested extensively.
 |When they're at least 8x8 or bigger! Thanks /u/nac126 for the reminder.
 |Edit: I misspoke.
[I'm an architecture student in the UK who is 1 year away from finishing my university masters, with intention to come over to the US or Canada to see how the process and industry as a whole is different.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazrvt6?context=5)|All the firms I like are in the NW and NE US - Seattle, San Francisco, Portland, Vermont, New Hampshire, etc. Canada is way ahead of us in general when it comes to quality energy efficient homes.
[I'd love to get me a passivhaus.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazt2e7?context=5)|You and me both. None built in Chicago yet...would love to help someone out.
[What's your opinion on the LEED system?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazt811?context=5)|I view it as something that makes buildings more habitable. As far an energy efficiency goes it's kind of a joke. I do have to give props to LEED for bringing awareness to the masses though. It's evolving so we'll see. Right now it seems like they just want my money. Fees, fees everywhere.
[Do you trust the people building your house to properly install the resilient channels? From what I've heard, it's not hard to fuck up and when you're trying to get a house up quickly to stay on schedule, it might get forgotten.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazxobo?context=5)|You have to explain what you're trying to accomplish and make them understand. Most people who are building things want it done right and if they understand the end goal they'll be more likely to accomplish it.
[Why concrete floors? Acoustics?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazxobo?context=5)|I like concrete and it has no maintenance. You could round the corners at the wall, use a reveal by setting the wall out and use light...or put a hose bib on the wall with a floor drain. Cleaning time just got fun.
[That green roof idea looks badass. How exactly does it work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazxobo?context=5)|That is a really long conversation. Multiple layers of products.
[Where would you construct something like this? I live in Nebraska, it would look really out of place in any of the neighborhoods around here I think.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazxobo?context=5)|Yeah, that's a problem with modern design, but not insurmountable. Modern homes can have pitched roofs and what not. I feel like a building should reflect its time, place, and construction. Typical homes in the US fake it and add features that cause maintenance problems and add cost just so they can look like they were built is 1880. Why? What is the point? Is it aesthetically pleasing...I don't think so. It's just the way things are done.
[What's your opinion on autoclaved aerated concrete blocks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazur0i?context=5)|They're fantastic. I wish they sold them in the US.
 |They're pretty decent on R-value. A little bit of foam and stucco and you have a fantastic easy to build wall.
[Yup, you definitely went to IIT.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazxwhp?context=5)|I was like this before I went there. FWIW.
[How do you feel about ""earthships""? Do you think it would ever be possible for these to become commercial homes? I realize some commercial prefab ""tiny houses"" have already adapted some principles but most use new and synthetic materials.  Link to en.wikipedia.org.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazt11h?context=5)|This was really the first wave of buildings that attempted to be more energy conscious, so I see them as sort of a V1.0 of green buildings. I've personally learned a lot by the mistakes and failures of these types of buildings.
 |In the US we're on something like V2.0 now whereas in Germany, Austria, etc. they're on V3.0.
 |As far as commercially viability - probably not as they're portrayed in the given link. In function, yes. Labor is the biggest factor in a buildings construction cost. Odd angles, curves, anything not standard and square adds cost. It may sound boring but shaving 1% or 2% off a construction budget can be a few thousand dollars. Also, the general public has a certain reticence to anything that looks different.
[How hard is the maintenance if this houses? I once killed a cactus for not caring it enough.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazsz3n?context=5)|If designed well they should require less maintenance than a typical home.
[Also, is it a good idea to live underground?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazsz3n?context=5)|Living underground poses a lot of challenges. For starters banks often hate the idea because of resale. There's also the fact that moving earth is very expensive. Foundations are typically the largest cost associated with a home her in the Midwestern US. There's also moisture issue. All of this can be dealt with if you find someone who knows their stuff. Instead of going that route I would opt for [ICF walls](https://www.google.com/search?q=icf+wall&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=h5ndUareMeeEygH6_IHwCA&amp;ved=0CAkQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1026&amp;bih=1064) (concrete walls with rigid insulation on both sides) with additional insulation on the outside.
[Do ICF walls make sense in seismically active areas, like California? If not, what's the best alternative?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazumap?context=5)|I'm probably not qualified to answer this, but lighter buildings perform better in seismic areas. Wood framed structures tend to be better than concrete, but the scale/size of the building is going to make a huge difference too. If it's only 1-2 stories ICF's are probably fine.
 |You also want a structure that can deflect and bend a bit while keeping itself laterally stable. Concrete tends to be rather rigid whereas steel and concrete can both be designed to give a bit more. Anyways, yeah, question for a structural engineer.
[What do you see are the trends for the green building movement?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazt6zo?context=5)|So far it's market dominated. Businesses and people are doing it for the financial incentives more than anything. It seems like a fairly logical path. I think the increase in comfort and other aspects are being undervalued though. Am I right to guess that your house never feels drafty? What's that worth? How does a contractor/bank/real estate agent quantify that?
[Is it ramping up quickly?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazt6zo?context=5)|Kind of. It's becoming more integrated and standard. More or less all government buildings are required to be LEED certified now and while I take issue with LEED it is a step in the right direction.
[What do you think is the future of the Passive House standard in particular?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazt6zo?context=5)|I don't want to speculate too much. It took off in Europe but they have a more temperate climate with less variability than the US and North America. I think Passive House will remain somewhat of a niche for a while. The people who seem to be adopting it are builders and one day I think a few bigger builders are going to get a hold of it and figure out how to make the energy savings work for their bottom line. After that? Who knows. I've heard of talk that PH would become the energy part of the requirement for LEED.
 |EDIT: I want to hear more about your house.
[Do you find that people who are looking for small affordable houses turn to an architect when a general contractor can design homes himself?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazsaiz?context=5)|To be honest I'm not really sure. I feel like it's an unmet need. I work for a medium formerly large firm so the only houses we deal with are large and high end.
 |Most homes are built without an architect and I can't say I blame anyone for the situation. The vast majority of homes are very formulaic and often times an architect's ideas are shot down by the contractor because of cost. To add to this a contractor typically knows where to cut costs and what to include to hit a certain price point in that market. It really comes down to a financial equation. The average price for a home in the US is about $200,000. A typical architects fee is about 10%, so $20,000 on a project of this size. A licensed architect with 20-30 years experience is going to be charging something like $100-$200/hour (for billable work). Let's use $150/hour. That's 133 hours, so about 4 weeks of billable time. For anyone who's ever designed and built a house that's not much. Basically, it's too small of a job for most architects to tackle. The way to get around this is to make the design over and over, refine it, build a relationship with a contractor, etc. I'm still trying to figure this out myself as it's what I, one day, would like to do. You need to be able to offer something they can't otherwise get like accurate energy modeling, finding the rights products, convincing the bank it will work, etc.
 |My firm is actually kind of dying right now so I doubt we'll be hiring any more interns. Sorry.
[Would you say this ""dying"" is typical of Chicago firms, besides the never die mega firms? I'm looking to relocate to a large city in the next few years.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cb0az7e?context=5)|Not really, firms come and go. I am noticing that medium sized firms are going away. Get big or stay small - there isn't much in between.
[What is the typical budget for a home? Sometimes high efficiency doesn't mean cheap. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazrf51?context=5)|It depends mostly on the area of the country you live in (I'm assuming US). A typical residential construction budget is around $140-160/square foot (SF). $200/SF is a nice home with better finishes (FFE) and $250/SF is premium. Here's a [cheat sheet](http://blog.buildllc.com/2009/02/residential-construction-cost-cheat-sheet/) from one of my favorite blogs.
 |High efficiency certainly doesn't mean cheap. However, I have seen it done. Advanced framing to minimize thermal bridging, 2x6 studs on 24"" centers to deepen the insulation cavity, cellulose insulation because it's cheap and stops air infiltration and installation issues, frost protected shallow foundations, compact home designs without bump-outs, and solar orientation are all ways to maximize thermal efficiency that actually save money.
 |Many of the methods contractors employ are utilized because they're methods that have worked for decades. The more thermally efficient you make a building the more potential problems you run into. Basically, if you don't know your shit you're going to have some seriously expensive failures, and this happens a lot. I think that's where a lot of the fear surrounding a change in construction methods comes from.
[I'm an Architect in Los Angeles. I have a fair amount of experience with residential design. In my experience, new, high-end modern homes are usually in the $400-600/sf range. I have a hard time finding contractors to build simple additions for under $200/sf. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazxqja?context=5)|Woah! The last hospital my firm built was $410/SF. A hospital built with union labor.
 |LA is more expensive but damn. That's... I need to be a builder in LA. What are you designing? Ebony inlaid mahogany?
 |Also, don't forget that you have to deal with earthquake stuff whereas we don't (for a few more years, they're changing seismic codes) and we have a favorable shipping location in the center of the country with lots of manufacturing.
[That's actually not that bad of a price. I was expecting more. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazrrx1?context=5)|That's construction budget too. You still need land, architects fees is you go that route, etc.
 |The most expensive solution to any problem is generally to build a building.
[You are an architect (ok, intern\). Architects work 5 typical work days a week. You are responding to these items in the middle of the day. Shouldn't you be working? Maybe if architects worked more and billed more hours they would make more money? Or is that not how fee is generated?  Jim &lt;3.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazvpeu?context=5)|This is either my coworking trolling me or really bad. I showed him /r/dataisbeautiful yesterday...
[Since we're also in the realm of energy efficiency, do you incorporate solar water heating in the homes you design?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazur8t?context=5)|The MEP firm I worked at did. It can make sense in some applications but the main problem is, as usual, money. The systems required to do it right are fairly complex. I think photovoltaics will slowly displace the need for solar hot water systems over time.
[What are some improvements you'd recommend for improving the efficiency of *existing* houses? I'm talking ""best bang for your buck"" kind of improvements.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazsoa8?context=5)|Typically it's air sealing. It solves so many problems for almost nothing. If you want to do it really well you can do a blower door smoke test and find the leaks then plug them up.
[I realize this depends on the age of the house and the quality of the build, so it may be better to ask what the biggest variables in efficiency would be in an existing house.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazsoa8?context=5)|Your next best bet is efficient appliances.
[What is a common thing that home owners can do/buy to make their homes more efficient?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazsz5n?context=5)|Air sealing is #1 followed by thick well designed walls. Efficient appliances and HVAC equipment is up there too. Minimizing [thermal bridging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_bridge) is often overlooked by just about everyone. Also, most insulation (batt in particular) is installed improperly.
[How much should this cost, but also how much is this saving me over time??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazxmje?context=5)|Depends if you hire someone or do it yourself, how old your house is, how big your house is, what area of the country you're in, how in depth you go, etc. so I feel like any numbers I throw out would be at best a guess. At the very low end you can walk around your house on a cold/hot day and check for drafts and seal them. At the other end you can hire a professional to do a thorough inspection and do all necessary work. The first one might cost $30 while the second could be a few thousand dollars.
[Do you think grey water reclamation and other water waste features should be part of future energy and sustainability standards?  I think its silly and wasteful that so many people are flushing toilets with potable water.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazt13x?context=5)|However, dealing with waste water is very expensive and moving water around is somewhat energy intensive. A lot of the cost of water is subsidized through sewage fees and other municipal taxes. It's the same issue that stands out with so many issues with our built environment - unaligned incentives. Those who pay the money have little incentive because they do not personally stand to realize the positive benefits of their expenditures. Builders don't put extra insulation on a house for the same reason that people don't install gray water systems in their house. Who benefits? Someone else.  To me, this is something that needs to be addressed legally with building codes. If everyone did it it could save your water reclamation district a lot of money which may have a positive ROI. I think with time and more evidence this sort of thing will become quite common. In Chicago we already have retention codes that make buildings store a certain amount of water after a rain event so as not to flood our (combined, ugh) sewage system.
[ps. I have got an idea stuck in my mind; could you use the excess heat produced by cooking in restaurants in an mall to circulate air through the building. Is this a stupid idea?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazxr44?context=5)|The issue is smell and grease. You could run a closed loop system though with a heat exchanger...
[, why on earth aren't these things more common?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/caztjji?context=5)|Money, maintainability, finding people who can install them, owner/contractor/architect/engineer's ignorance.
[Our current western building standards are abysmal](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/caztjji?context=5)|More or less yeah. They are fairly safe and affordable though. I have to give them that.
[Would you ever build a home using vacuum insulation panels?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/caztdza?context=5)|When the price comes down yes.
[I've heard you mention bump-outs as no-gos multiple times.  What makes them so bad?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/caztdza?context=5)|It's fundamental. More surface area means more contact with outside air with means more energy transfer. It also makes construction more complex with leads to increased costs and more problematic details. If you have air and water leaks they tend to occur at corners and joints.
[How do you like to solve household water heating requirements?  Solar thermal + a heatpump water heater?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/caztdza?context=5)|Good question. This is evolving a lot right now. Point of source water heaters, heat pump water heaters, etc. I think the future (10 or 20 years from now) will be dominated by photovoltaic, so electric powered water heaters will be the way to go. That said, natural gas is cheap in the US and is generally the best bang for your buck.
[Thoughts on using alternative energy sources like wood pellets for heating?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/caztdza?context=5)|If you live in a wooded area with access to firewood it's one of the most sustainable things you can do. I've seen some really promising products come out in that area in the last few years. If you're buyng firewood somewhere then it makes a lot less sense.
[Are you looking to get LEED certified at all? Are these the types of building you are looking to design?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/caztfjp?context=5)|I will probably get LEED certified in the future. I have issues with LEED though.
[What about Passive Homes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/caztfjp?context=5)|Passivhaus/Passive House US is an extreme interest of mine, yes. Even if the homes I eventually build aren't passive house certified I will bring the lessons learned from studying them will me. Tight wall assemblies, deep insulation, controlled ventilation, solar orientation, etc.
[What are your thoughts about Rammed Earth buildings? (I was going to work for a company that does this in Canada at one point, but I wasn't going to be moving soon enough to get the job\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/caztfjp?context=5)|Rammed earth is interesting but its labor intensive and thus expensive. It makes more sense in arid climates with DIY labor.
[are you content with your salary, if you don't mind my asking?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazwnro?context=5)|No not at all, but it's early in my career. The thing that bothers me more is that you're expected to work yourself to the bone and job security is completely remiss.
[Have you ever thought about going into any of the IT architectural professions](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazwnro?context=5)|To add to this schooling is long and expensive. You more or less need a masters if you're just starting out now so that's 4+2 or 5+1 years or 4+3 in my case since I went to undergrad for econ and psych.
 |I got to work on a project for Jeanne Gang. I did the geothermal system and some of the mechanicals for her upcoming Clark Park Boat House in Chicago. It's been fun to watch it all come together. Public buildings are very gratifying.
 |The least would be high end commercial stuff. A mall in Qatar. Not fixing anything but renovating it to make it more blingy. What a waste of my life.
 |Like what? Information architecture, etc.? Is there really much crossover? Or do you mean Revit techs who sit on jobsites?
[No one mentioned steel container homes yet. What do you think ? My case; Northern California, been welding a long time, could add one every other year, some partially in the earth, they're cheap, and the ""cool"" factor seems high for my opinion. What do you know or think of making one of these ? What or how would you do it ? Do's and dont's ? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazwgkj?context=5)|I'm actually making a woodshop right now out of a container. There are some photos of it on my [blog](http://www.alltheclevernamesweretaken.blogspot.com/search/label/woodshop) and [Tumblr](http://logantreed.tumblr.com/).
 |Otherwise, I'm not entirely sure. They're cheap, but not by much compared to 2x4's. If you weld then great, but the moment you start cutting holes in them they lose a lot of their strength, so you have to reinforce.
 |Overall, if it's DIY and you're a welder it's far more viable than most people. Just make sure you insulate it properly. I'd use the exterior of container as the exterior skin then make a stud wall of 2x3's or steel channel held back from the wall and sprayed with open cell spray foam (icynene). Also, try to get containers that are made of cor-ten so you don't have to grind and paint all the time - if you can.
[I could go on about this for hours, but since I'm late to the party (and I'll probably get buried\), I'll cut it off here. My question to you: have you noticed much of an actual change in sustainable initiatives here in the US, or am I the only one that feels like it's still just used for marketing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazumpg?context=5)|Sometimes it makes financial sense. When it's obvious owners go for it.
[Sorry for the vagueness but I once read about an architect that in the ?70s? came up with some affordable home designs but was plagued by the inability for the homes to be altered. Even the furniture was ""static."" Do you know who I am talking about? Have you address some of the reasons his ideas did not take off? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazte4v?context=5)|I don't know whom you speak of, but the other commentor was actually on to something. It's the Usonian Homes by Wright. They were meant to be inexpensive and afforable but they always went over budget. They are some of his more interesting designs though and I commend him on his efforts. I've studied those houses quite a bit and most of them have had additions in years that followed.
 |FWIW well built affordable housing is elusive. More or less everyone who tries fails. The lower middle class and poor have few advocates so it's hard to really get stuff done.
 |Sorry I couldn't be of more help.
[1\) What are your thoughts on methane digestors for creating usable methane for heating/cooking? (Will this be viable in the near future, or is it here?\) 2\) Do you have any means like earthships (www.earthship.com\) to help with cutting down on water consumption? 3\) Have you found it easier to have on-site electrical storage(like a battery bank\) or trying to sell back to the utility companies? 4\) Why aren't people using the waste heat from the attic on summer days to vent through the clothes dryer, to help dry clothes instead of using the heating element from the drier?  It would reduce costs in two different ways wouldn't it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazwmxg?context=5)|I've built these when I worked with my dad. They're entirely viable but only at large scales. People make them all the time.
 |I view earthships as a useful first step in energy efficient/green construction that taught us a lot of lessons. I believe there are better ways to proceed now.
 |It's all about net metering unless you're off grid. Batteries are expensive and have a rather short life span. Not to mention hydrogen off gassing.
 |Sure, but then you'd need a fan and an insulated duct and a way of switching it over in winter and summer. Conversely you could just hang dry your clothes outside and use the sun directly.
[What is the most important aspect of energy-efficient or 'green' home?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazt01c?context=5)|This is a bit of a loaded question since all the systems have to work together and be designed for your climate, but I would say the enclosure system. Your walls, roof, and foundation all need to work together to keep heat in/out while also staying dry and still being relatively inexpensive to construct. The enclosure needs to be as airtight as possible and as thermally non-conductive as possible (high R value) while reducing thermal bridges. Most walls and roofs in the US are actually insulated fairly okay, but they tend to be leaky and have thermal bridges everywhere. Taping or caulking all the seams plus a layer of exterior insulation would help to mitigate this. For some reason lots of foundations aren't insulated or it's done poorly. Which is strange because concrete is about the worst insulator on earth (aerated concrete is a different story).
[Given your position as an ""Intern Architect"", do you usually adapt existing building designs to your more energy efficient criteria, or do you design from scratch more?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/cazuj5i?context=5)|Both really. Now that I think of it the buildings we retrofit are generally in some sort of moisture decay, hence requiring our work, so energy efficient upgrades are almost always part of the package. Vapor barrier issues and drying out of wall assemblies leads to almost every retrofit we get. Of course building new offers much better opportunities for sitting, orientation, etc. which is huge. Retrofitting may be ""greener"" but building new makes for more efficient buildings (assuming you do it right).

Alright guys.. Let me start off by saying what I am going to be using this build for. First off, I am planning on playing SC2:HOTs and PlanetSide 2 with this PC. The only reason why I do not have any other games in my mind is because I have never played any on any consoles or anything like that.. so I might be interested in playing higher end games as I get used to this PC. Other than that.. I'll be getting Photoshop and video editing software as I make more money later.

**Secondly**, I want to say some things about my budget.. Luckily, I got a summer internship that gives me approx 20 hours a week. Thus, I think I can pay off this build as I get my paychecks. I am trying to keep it around the $1700-$2000 range.

**My goal is to build a pc based on longetivity.** Also, I want to say that this PC will be turned off at night (it is NOT going to be on 24/7). So, if that changes anything.. please tell me.

**Next**, I am going to give a breakdown of my rational behind each parts and some of the missing parts:

**Processor:** This is purely just bias.. I just want one of the best processors out there right now and it has been my dream to get an i7. Do I plan on overclocking? Right now.. NO. I heard that overclocking substantially reduces the life of the processor so I am scared. But, as I get comfortable with the setup.. I might overclock! Who knows? :D

**CPU Cooler**: I just saw this on sale today. Even though I am not leaning towards overclocking right now, the reason I am getting liquid cooling is because I hate the look of the big huge perpendicular fan. I think these types of cooling looks much better. I was planning on buying an H100i but since this was on sale and H100i will be overkill.. i just chose this.

**MoBo**: I just absolutely love the armor. I've heard that it traps dust but since they have little fans inside now.. I think it is better. Also, it has caps for every single port on the board so it keeps them safe. I am open to other thoughts

**Memory**: The only reason I am buying this is because of [THIS](http://promotions.newegg.com/combo/13-2908/index.html?SID=0cbsoOj9EeKifh40xRvYTA0_av9d3_0_0_0&amp;AID=10440897&amp;PID=1225267&amp;nm_mc=AFC-C8Junction&amp;cm_mmc=AFC-C8Junction-_-cables-_-na-_-na&amp;cm_sp=Homepage_MidRight-_-combo%2f13-2908-_-http://promotions.newegg.com/combo/13-2908/300_250.jpg) deal. I am basically getting it for around $50 dollars.

**Storage**: No explanations needed. SSD for OS and HDD for storage.

**GPU**: I think this is the card I need because it is low priced and at new. I'm open to other suggestions. I might buy other brands of this card like the Windforce but I'm not sure.

**Case**: I love the look.. and it is on sale.. impulse buying ftw!!

**PSU**: I don't have a preference.. I'm just waiting for one to go on sale. Right now, I'm thinking about getting this because it exceeds my needs and is on a good sale.

**Monitor**: I just chose a popular monitor. My question is.. does the resolution work? This is my first time building and thus.. I don't know much about resolutions.

**OS**: I am not getting an OS yet because I'm pretty sure I am going to get Windows 8 for free next year for some classes I am taking.

**Peripherals**: I prefer these 2.

**Conclusion**: What do you think? I'm open to any suggestions. Please keep in mind that this is my first time building and I have given it all ~8 months of research.

**I live 1hr away from a MicroCenter btw**

E, should I put free online courses on my resume?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1hze73/as_an_elec_e_should_i_put_free_online_courses_on/,"I'm an electrical engineer, and I really want to switch into software development. I'm wondering if it would be beneficial for me to put free online CS courses I have taken on my resume?

I want to portray to people who come across my resume on-line or my LinkedIn profile that I am actively working towards switching careers. 

My idea is that a hiring manager may come across my resume and either offer me an internship or full-time position based on the knowledge that I am engineer who wants to transition into programing but isn't an expert level programmer yet.

1hzdx6,3,2013-07-09,"IT field Redditors, how would you approach finding an entry level tech job with only A+/Net+ certifications and 8 years of unrelated experience?",AshenCrow,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1hzdx6/it_field_redditors_how_would_you_approach_finding/,"How should I go about finding an entry level IT job with the wrong kind of experience, aside from just putting in my application everywhere and hoping for the best? I couldn't find a previous question about this, amazingly enough.

Twenty four years old, currently unemployed. I have been in the work force since 2005, started with a crappy job washing dishes at Denny's and some retail management after, followed by owning my own business selling e-cigarettes for over a year, a pick up job, and more retail management and sales.

I am sick of retail. I was always unhappy and unfulfilled and unchallenged in my previous jobs after only 6 months. I have had too many jobs in those eight years. I got A+ and Net+ in high school, and never used them to get a job. Part of this was due to psychological reasons, which I am now finally happily medicated for. The condition also allowed me to not value myself and feel I wasn't worth a $30k+ a year salary because I have lived on $8400/yr without government assistance, but I am finally past that. I am fixing my job problems, right fucking now. =)  

The problem now is that I have a lot of experience in the wrong types of jobs, because I let my insecurities stop me from getting a challenging and rewarding and well-paying job. Over and over. On my resume I narrowed it down to five jobs, all management except for my own business and the cashier job. There are no gaps of employment.

I have finally written a resume that I feel is extremely presentable and have included my other experience in a separate section. It is as follows:

-----

Personal Experience
- Vast experience over nine years in diagnosis, repair, and solution implementation in personal computers, laptops, and other devices for clients and associates
- Over fifty machines built for clients suited to their needs, including personal, server, and high power (gaming) machines
- Experience over seven years in the implementation and repair of networks, both LAN and WAN, in both home and office environments
- Three years of experience administrating and moderating webservers and dedicated servers using appropriate practices to maintain maximum uptime

-----

Most IT jobs, even Tier 1/help desk, require 1-3 years experience from what I can find. If you were looking at my resume, would you consider my personal experience relevant enough? I do, that is why I included it, but I don't want to appear foolish to hiring managers. The computers built were never a taxable thing because the amount I earned wasn't enough to list as an independent contractor. Over the years I realized I had built quite a few though. The WAN implementation was from classroom and personal use of CISCO routing, among other small things, but it sounds great.

I have talked to everyone I can think of that might know some one or know of a position open and put in a good word for me. All four of them. I used to be extremely bad at accepting hand outs, but I'm finally forcing myself to get over it because I will never get a good job otherwise.

I understand that there are intern positions open sometimes but they are always snatched up immediately.  I'm willing to work part time some where and also work an unpaid internship, but I can't freaking find them! Where should I be looking? I'm checking out LinkedIn tonight, I've never used it."

1hz23g,1,2013-07-09,I make too much money at my internship to ask for more from an actual job?,narett,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1hz23g/i_make_too_much_money_at_my_internship_to_ask_for/,"This is such a first-world problem, but I wish I saw it as a joke.

In a nutshell, I am currently a software engineering intern at a Fortune 500 company making 25/hr or basically 52K annually before taxes.  However, my internship only lasts for six months.

I'm looking for jobs in my field around where I live (near Raleigh, North Carolina).  Recently I was asked in a phone screening about what sort of salary I'm interested in for an associate/entry-level position.  I said roughly about what I'm being paid now or a little more.  This particular company said they could not pay that much for the particular position.

It was quite embarrassing to be put in that situation.  I'm usually afraid of shooting too high.

Call me presumptuous, but in case I am indeed asking for too much salary, should I go lower?  I was taught to never do that but I want to be realistic.  I'm only 23 and, honestly, I'm confused despite how fortunate I am."

[I've been waiting for this AMA forever!  I wonder how long you've been working with Conan, and how you managed to get that job. Was it more of you always trying to be a personal assistant or was it just trying to work with him?  What was it like being his assistant when the whole Tonight Show ordeal happened?  Also, how long did it take for you to get used to his jibes?  Edit:spelling ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i39pf/i_am_sona_movsesian_conan_obriens_assistant_ama/cb0joyt?context=5)|I've been working for conan for over 4 years. i applied and interviewed - it was a very normal process. i never planned on being a personal assistant...it just happened and i'm happy it did. being his assistant during the Tonight Show ordeal was one of the most educational and exciting experiences i've ever had. i had to drive him to work because the paparazzi was all over the place. it was pretty intense. i think we were trying to be mature with each other for the first few months, and then he said it sounded like i was arguing with dracula when i was talking to my grandma one day and everything went to shit. since then, he's been like the second older brother i never wanted and never asked for. -sona.

1i3dph,3,2013-07-11,Is it too late for me?,[deleted],AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1i3dph/is_it_too_late_for_me/,"Hello all,

I am heading into me senior year of undergrad studying computer engineering. Up until this Summer I was *positive* I wanted to avoid post-undergrad school and wanted to enter the workforce as soon as possible.

During the spring I applied and got accepted to my ""dream"" internship. I was sure that I would love the work, obtain a full-time position and be set for life. As my internship draws to a close, I'm finding its not everything I expected it to be and although I believe my performance will lead to a full-time offer, I am not sure if I want to accept it.

I'm finding myself far more interested in my education in the past few months than I ever was before, becoming far more interested in the problems I had previously seen as a means to a grade which where a means to a career. Now I'm staying up late reading papers and books and finding the things I am really interested in.

I'm beginning to think that I would like to pursue a phd but I am not sure how plausible that is. I have very good grades, but have not done any research and as I have previously seen class as just something to get through, I don't really have relationships with professors that could lead to letters of recommendation.

Applications for grad programs are due in the winter so I guess that gives me one semester to get involved in research and show my aptitude for it to other professors. Is that possible or am I kidding myself?

Also as I am just now getting interested in this, I am not really sure how a Masters degree works in relation to getting a phd. Is it recommended to get a Masters before going onto the phd? I imagine in my case that is probably the best solution as I getting into the Masters program will likely be a little easier and I could build more of a ""research portfolio"" there, but ultimately I don't really know.

Any advice or reassurance would be appreciated, thanks guys!"

Am I picking the right field? I know cyber security jobs will be very big when I need a job, but I just want to know, what should I do?

Also, I want to move out west, preferably Seattle, or California. I'm currently living in Maryland, so which would be the best for me? I will most likely live alone, so what kind of job should I get? I'll also do a summer internship at Cisco, so I want to stay with them for when I need a job.

The company has treated this as true internship: she runs tickets about half the time and then spends her remaining time shadowing more experienced IT folks, taking online IT-type classes (paid for by the department) and generally just learning.  She has been told by the IT manager that he would love to have her as a full time employee once she graduates HS and he would provide a real apprenticeship opportunity.  I always assumed she would go to college; but, it seems like this may be the way to go.  She gets to learn on the job, has time to expand her knowledge and also mature as an employee.

1i1p73,4,2013-07-10,Refreshing my excel knowledge,ludwis,excel,https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/1i1p73/refreshing_my_excel_knowledge/,"Hey everyone, 

I used to do work with excel in a very basic way during some internships and summer jobs while in university. Well now I'm done with uni and I'm starting a job where I'm going to be working with excel quite heavily. 

I studied economics, so while I'm very comfortable with stata and matlab, I realized that I'm not very good with Excel.

After a rather long time searching jobs I scored quite a good job (which I'm very, very happy about, because now a days it isn't that easy in the region I'm living), which will require a lot of Excel work, especially in the first years. So getting ready to start my job in September, I want to get up to date with the program. 

Are there any good online courses or books (was thinking ""excel for dummies"" or something similar), with which I can relearn the basics of the program? I'm going to be working with bigger spread sheets. I'm tight on cash (guess that isn't surprising coming out of university), so any education free of charge would be great. 


I'm going to start my first job, for which I searched rather long, and any help would be appreciated."

1i64ny,19,2013-07-12,Other intern stole from me and I'm so pissed off but have to have patience,WolfBro,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1i64ny/other_intern_stole_from_me_and_im_so_pissed_off/,"The intern that sits in the cube next to me made a copy of a Staples giftcard that I had on my desk for a few hours between receiving it and printing it and the end of the day. It was a card to replace a chair I had under warranty for $300. I know 100% she did it, but my evidence isn't 100% conclusive in the eyes of the law (as far as I know).

Staples was able to track the usage of my gift card and pull up the receipt and then bring up a picture of her from their security footage. Unfortunately it only shows the back of her but the description the employees gave matches her perfectly and the clothing she is wearing in the picture matches what she was wearing. She is also only 1 of 2 people I told about it, and the other is my room mate who doesn't even own a Mac (all three products bought were Mac related) plus he wouldn't do that to me since we've been friends for awhile now and this other intern has only been here about a month.

Since I don't have an image of her face, I'm waiting for our building's security to get back to me. Hopefully they have an image showing at least what she was wearing that day and hopefully that's enough for the police to check her apartment where they will definitely find the stuff she bought.

Plus, one of the things bought was a wireless keyboard, and coincidentally the day after the purchases were made she brought her own keyboard in from work since our keyboards are crap. It's so interesting that the day after the purchase, she doesn't need her keyboard at home. 

Regardless of security's response I'm going to the police during my lunch break today. Tried last night but they were closed.

I am so fucking pissed off. I don't understand why anyone would risk their $24.20 an hour job with Sony for a $300 gift card. I mean, that's two days of work...

I guess she thought it would be untraceable. I can't wait to get her fired and arrested.

Thanks for reading, just so hard to be patient when my blood is boiling."

[I've always felt that it is such a *huge* bureaucracy that it would be frustrating to work there. Also, I've felt that it is an organization that has quite a bit of bark but not bite in real world terms.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb16zky?context=5)|There is a LOT of corruption. I've heard stories of high-level UN staff with huge titles misusing money, making travel plans that are not justified, and using the money allocated for hotels (during their travel) to pocket in cases where they don't stay in a hotel but stay with a friend. Those are just some examples that my seniors have told me about.   DEFINITELY way removed from the ""real world"", or as we call it, the ""field"". For example, there are often resolutions put forward advocating for safe&amp;legal abortions, access to free contraceptives, etc. I agree with these, and that it is arguably part of every individuals human rights to have access to these. However, you cannot impose these measures (or expect countries to adopt them) in countries that are religious or conservative. Not sure if that's a good example?  Long story short, I've learned that the UN isn't as prestigious as I had originally dreamed it would be as a student. I've learned that after I finish graduate school, I probably don't want to work at headquarter level, for all the reasons listed above. Maybe the country offices are better, since they are closer to the on-the-ground realities.
[What did you study? how did you get such a nice internship?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb14xpg?context=5)|I did a Bachelor degree from Canada with a major in International Relations. Right now I am doing my Masters in the same topic. During both degrees I was active in student life, made an effort to get to know my profs (that's where the reference letters come from, it helps to have known a prof for longer, and helps if you did well or were in a leadership position there, such as a class representative), and took part in research projects and clubs.
 |I got the internship by stalking names of directors of UN offices I wanted to work at, and emailing them my resume, cover letter, a one-page description of the program I am in (it is a new program), and a formal 500 word Personal Statement type essay describing why I want to work at that office in particular. I would reference specific names, projects, branches, wherever possible - personalized it as much as I could. When I didn't get a reply, I would call (it's worth the cost in international charges), and I faxed many offices my application as well.
 |In about two months or so, I had four offers from UN agencies for a summer internship. Two in Bangkok, one in Jordan, and one in Geneva, which I accepted. I had another informal offer in Vietnam as well, but by then I had decided I would be in Geneva in the summer.
 |*Edit - spelling.
[Do you speak French? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb18x5m?context=5)|A little bit.  I can understand most things, and speak enough to get by. English translation is available at all meetings/conferences, so there isn't too much pressure to know French. I know I should work on it though.
[U of T, Trinity College? I'm assuming Trin cause you did IR and ESL. Hello fellow Trinny :\)!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb1a2uh?context=5)|University College actually :) But I was in Trinity programs, yes. 
[Have you seen any change in behavior from any countries towards the US after the Snowden leaks happened?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb16ocy?context=5)|I'm in Geneva, so the General Assembly is not here. It is in New York :) The only time countries interact with each other here is during international conferences. I've been covering one recently, and there has been no talk about Snowden, or any coded political language by the USA on this topic either. The reason for this is probably because the conference I'm attending has a theme of sustainable development and science/technology.
[Snowden used to work for the CIA in Geneva. Do you have any fear that the same station he worked at, are actively spying on your offices?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb193dk?context=5)|I didn't know that! The CIA is some creepy shit. I wouldn't be surprised. Good thing that if they spied on me, all they would find is my reddit history. Hehehehheee...
[Any particular reason why you chose the Geneva internship rather than the ones offered at Bangkok and Jordan?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb156eq?context=5)|The offers at all other locations were focused on research, whereas the duties for this one included attending inter-agency meetings, major international conferences, and liaison with country offices around the world. Research is cool, but it's something that I can do from my laptop anywhere. Geneva has 22 international organizations here. The networking opportunities, and opportunities for exposure to the ""real world"" of international relations just didn't compare to the other offers that I had. 
[Interns aren't paid, right? So how are you supporting yourself? Savings or parents?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb15am5?context=5)|Yes, the UN does not pay any of its interns, pretty much anywhere in the world. My school gave me some money to cover like 40% of the cost of living here. I also had some savings. 
[The ""real world"" of international relations. This is the story of  representatives from 192 countries, picked to live in a small European city and have their lives taped. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb19n0l?context=5)|I know. Definitely does not represent the real world at all, I agree!
[Goddamit I hate unpaid internships. It's a great opportunity, don't get me wrong, but you ought to get paid for work you do, full stop.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb18z8v?context=5)|Yeah, this idea is gaining a lot of traction/attention these days! I think a local newspaper in Geneva recently wrote about this as well. And there's an official petition going around too.
[So you're on some sort of scholarship, that's cool. How expensive is it to live in Geneva, and what happens if you run out of money - are you allowed to take paid work over there without a work permit? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb15kqa?context=5)|I'm actually not sure! I came here with enough money, so that I wouldn't be in a situation where I run out of money :P It's VERY EXPENSIVE to live here. It's honestly ridiculous. A meal at a restaurant averages around $20. Cheapest coffee is $2.50 (McDonalds). Big mac meal is $15. They charge you for everything here. Even ketchup at McDonalds and tap water at restaurants. 
[Not true - I was an intern at the IAEA in Vienna, and it pays 1000 Euro a month. As far as I know, it's the only UN agency that pays it's interns. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb1ad3k?context=5)|Yup, there are a couple of exceptions. I think the Global Fund also pays their interns.
[Yes, I know it's expensive other there, that's why I asked. I'm surprised really that the UN offices don't have canteens where interns can eat cheaply. I trust you're in some sort of student accommodation? Btw, how long is your internship for and do you plan on travelling a bit while you're in Europe?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb15zg0?context=5)|It is 4 months. I have travelled a lot within Switzerland, and been to London and Prague. Next week I'll be going to Rome and Paris :)
[Do you think the U.N. is still relevant or is it more of a barrier to a country's sovereignty?  Wouldn't the incredible amount of money wasted in this organization be put to better use by directly helping countries in need, rather than spending 85% or more of its budget on administrative costs?  Have you been to a lavish party on a mega yacht?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb198ri?context=5)|Haha! I thinkk the admin costs are actually about 14-16%, somewhere around there. Which is really high. I've heard of UN staff not using the money properly, pocketing money given to them for hotels when they stay with a friend while travelling, and other similar stories. I have been to some VERY fancy receptions, but they are always hosted by countries, and not the UN. Still, I don't think it's right - that money can obviously used to save many, many lives. Also, funny you mention a yacht  - there was a reception on a boat last week :/ Again, it wasn't hosted by the UN. But still. It's a goddamn boat. 
[Thanks for doing this! I'm an IS major as well and I would love to work for the UN someday.  What do you plan to do after your internship is over? If its a job at the UN, do you have a specific position you desire?  Also, how essential is foreign language proficiency? The UN careers page requires it, but I was just curious how often it is used in an internship position? I assume its more important for individuals working in the field?  Are many of the people you encounter career UN workers or people doing a few years and going back to their lives at home?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb198uc?context=5)|Hey I've answered the first two! Read the thread :) As for the third question, most I've met are career UN workers, since this is Geneva. If you go in the field, you'll probably meet more staff that are on contracts and will go back home when they are done (or start a new assignment)
[On a related note, what do you know about prior experience for jobs both at the major offices like Geneva as well as the field offices? What type of work experience or volunteer experience would make someone a good candidate for a field office?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb19gpa?context=5)|Honestly, for some field offices sometimes it can be very easy. For the dangerous areas, it's hard for them to get people. But I'm talking about internships. To be honest I can't say much about actually getting hired, except that it seems that most staff get hired after already being in the system. As for work/volunteer experience for a field office - I imagine it would be things like community work or studying related to the issues that the agency you are applying for deals with. As long as in your cover letter you can make a strong connection between your experience and why you want to work there, it should be fine. That's what I did. 
[How long is your internship for?  Do you think unpaid internships are morally correct at places like the UN?  Don't unpaid positions act as a final barrier to poorer candidates, or a final advantage to those who can afford to work without pay? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb18eiv?context=5)|It's for four months. I completely, completely agree with you. It's very unfair. Most of the people who are able to do it are from well-off families. After talking to most people, it turns out most interns come from rich families, have parents in the UN, etc. Most interns I've met are from the USA or Europe. Very few are actually from developing countries. How can the UN serve developing countries if they don't even have proper representation? Those who are from developing countries are from the elite class. In a place like Geneva, only the well-off can afford to live here. It's very unfair, and there is a petition going on to pay UN interns: [Link to www.change.org](http://www.change.org/petitions/make-youth-a-priority-pay-un-interns-a-fair-wage)
[Now that you've got your foot in the door, whats your goal with the internship?  Where do you see yourself in 5 years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb17exx?context=5)|I have no idea! I wish I knew. As explained above, I've kind of come to the conclusion that I don't think I want to work at the UN, at least not headquarter level (i.e. Geneva or NY). I've been considering working for an NGO after I graduate. I think it will allow me to see actual results, and will directly help someone. Here, I feel way too disconnected from the people we are helping. 
[What's the working language or languages there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb17cvy?context=5)|English and French are the main ones. In Geneva there is a lot of French, but almost everyone speaks English as well. For every meeting/conference, there is almost always translation available for English, French, Spanish, and Arabic. I've seen Russian and Chinese translation as well.
[What is your nationality?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb17aus?context=5)|I was born and raised in Canada. 
[Have you ever been ""starstruck"" or stunned/captivated by any of the politicians that have come through your office?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb185hq?context=5)|At the start yes. But now I don't. Whenever I attend a conference, I'm usually surrounded by literally the world's most senior people in their field. It's actually made me a little bit more confident. Titles don't intimidate me anymore, and I'm comfortable just walking up to someone and starting a conversation with them. I've also met people with fancy titles who really don't know much about what they are talking about. It's actually pretty disappointing. So yeah, I don't get starstruck anymore. They're all just normal people. I sat next to the Executive Director of my organization (a major UN organization) and had lunch with him the other day. When he first sat down, I was a bit nervous. But it was chill. As for 'captivated'...I honestly can't say I have felt that way about anyone. 
[How tight are the air ducts? Could a moderately sized person crawl through?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb19pzz?context=5)|It's Friday here and I'm home. I can get back to you Monday afternoon on that. Also just a side note - everyone in Europe is moderately-sized. 
[What are you doing to protect political activists like Snowden?  What are doing to protect the rights of sovereign leaders from being forced out of the air?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb18nm9?context=5)|I'm just an intern, so the direct answer to that question is ""nothing"". And I haven't heard much talk about Snowden here these days. But again, as I mentioned in another post, the General Assembly is in NY, not Geneva. So this isn't the forum where these things would get discussed. In Geneva, Snowden may get discussed at the Human Rights Council, but it is not in session until September. 
[What language(s\) is most business carried out in?  Is working at the UN as cool as you though it would be (seems like a dream job even though you're just an intern\)?  What type of experience do your bosses/colleagues have?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb196pf?context=5)|English and French. I've answered about if UN is as cool as I thought it'd be, read the thread :):) My colleagues/bosses have worked at various other UN agencies before this. Many colleagues start off in the JPO program, which is where your home government pays you and sends you to the UN to get x years experience (contract position). Then the UN hires you (hopefully). 
[What does your job consist of?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb176ky?context=5)|I cover international conferences, inter-agency meetings, and sometimes phone meetings with country offices. I take notes and report back. I've also attended several high level debates on the Syrian conflict. I've recently started working on a research project related to reproductive rights. 
[Where are you originally from?  What languages do you speak?  What is your favorite salad dressing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb1abid?context=5)|Born and raised in Canada. I speak English  and a little bit of French (but not enough). Balsamic Vinaigrette. 
[Do you wish to stay at the un and live in switzerland?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb1amf8?context=5)|[This]( http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb18jdd) is my answer to that question!
[Ever read the comic DMZ? You should, it portrays something like the UN in a similar fashion.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb1avdt?context=5)|Nope, link?
[Have you watched Shake Hands with the Devil. How did you feel about UN then and how do you feel about it now - in the same context?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb18mla?context=5)|I actually have not watched or read the book! I did meet Romeo Dallaire though (not at the UN). 
[How did you get this internship? This would be my dream. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb18h7b?context=5)|[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb151gi) is how I got my internship. 
[I know you have already wrote something about unpaid internships issue, but I have similar question.  Why do you think UN internships are unpaid? What's the reason?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb1bzp0?context=5)|That is a great question! I guess the UN has such a big name to it, that almost anyone is ready to do an unpaid internship there, for the obvious resume boost it will give you. I've also always heard that the only way to get a real job at the UN is to ""get into the system"", and the only way to do that is through an internship. I am not sure how true this is, I guess time will tell when I see if my colleagues/classmates end up getting hired by the UN. Also, it majorly, majorly cuts costs for the UN! There is one agency in the building I am at that has THIRTY interns. Imagine that! Thirty, qualified (likely graduate students), individuals doing work 9am-5pm. Unpaid.  In a way, I guess the UN is saving money which could be better spent elsewhere. But still, it really is not fair and disadvantages qualified candidates who cannot afford to do an unpaid internship for months. 
[Thanks for the reply. How much an ordinary UN official makes after 5 years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb1cd79?context=5)|I have absolutely no idea, and it's an awkward question to ask colleagues!
[Who is the most ""powerful"" person you've met while working there?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb19dm7?context=5)|The head of the agency I work for. And some ""Special Rapporteurs"", who are really, really important people.
[What qualifications do you need for that position? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb18bnh?context=5)|You have to be enrolled in a Masters program, and usually they want you to be studying in a relevant field. 
[Sorry I don't mean to negate what you're saying, but I did an internship at the U.N. in Vienna headquarters and neither I nor many of my intern colleagues had a masters.. while it is true that you have to have a masters to work at the UN, in order to intern there that's not the case. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb1afpe?context=5)|I heard that they made a new rule a few years ago that all interns have to be graduate students at least. Almost everyone I've met is a grad student. I've met a couple others, but they got their internships in a very informal way (ex. one knew the office director). That's interesting though, when was your internship?
[Why you work for an evil organization?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb19e3r?context=5)|I ask myself that sometimes too.
[What do you think the over/under is on how many countries are spying on each other in the UN?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb19j0h?context=5)|I'm in Geneva, not New York where the General Assembly is. So I don't have any exciting gossip on that. Geneva is mostly international conferences. Countries interact here too, but its not as political as it is in NY.
[How did you get the internship? I heard that you really have to know people to get into a lot of the UN internships. Did you know someone? Know 20 languages? Bribes? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb19cq3?context=5)|[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb151gi) is how I got the internship. One thing I didn't mention though is that I've met quite a few people who did get an internship through knowing someone or having parents that work in the UN or politics.

[How do you like Geneva? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb18xel?context=5)|I don't like living here, mostly because I am from a big city. I find it too quiet! And way too expensive to live as a student. It's nice to be in Europe and be able to travel easily though. 
[Is the UN doing anything to deal with those sex slavery scandals which UN officials were involved?

I haven't heard about this. Also, I work for a UN agency, so my work involves repping that agency and doing work related to them. So I wouldn't come across this in my everyday work.

[How much do you spend for a living in Geneva?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb1d6jl?context=5)|Rent per month costs around $700-1100, depending where you live. If you want to live comfortably, it's around $900-$1000? A bus pass per month for anyone under 25 is $45. Food is VERY expensive. Like, I'm talking a dollar an orange, sometimes. There are some budget brands that are cheaper though. Meat is seriously expensive. A meal at a restaurant is minimum $18, at least. A nice restaurant, you're looking at $40 for a plate of food. At restaurants, a little bottle of coke costs around $4.75. If you order tap water, they act like they don't understand what you are asking for and bring you bottled water instead, or they charge you money for the tap water. Main point: it is unaffordable.  
[How old are you? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb19707?context=5)|I'm 22, and a graduate student.

I personally haven't met any over 30. 
[Quick question. Is Geneva sort of the secondary headquarters of the UN or is just the European hub? I've always felt Geneva would be a better choice of HQ then New York (not sure why, like due to Science Fiction putting a world HQ there\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb1b9hf?context=5)|It's kind of treated like a secondary headquarters, although the main headquarters is in New York. Basically, NY is where the General Assembly and Security Council are, and Geneva is where all the major international conferences happen. I think it would also be a better choice for HQ! The main UN building (Palais des Nations) used to be the headquarters of the League of Nations.

It is in New York :) The only time countries interact with each other here is during international conferences. I've been covering one recently, and there has been no talk about Snowden, or any coded political language by the USA on this topic either. The reason for this is probably because the conference I'm attending has a theme of sustainable development and science/technology. 
[What are the salaries like? Who is paying for these salaries?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i5e3t/im_an_intern_at_the_un_in_geneva_switzerland_ama/cb1ai5y?context=5)|I'm an intern so I don't know how much salaries are. I guess the UN pays for salaries? Unless you are a Junior Professional Officer, in which case your home country pays your salary for a contract of x years, and sends you to the UN.

I figured the former has better job security, better pay, how fascinating it was, and more mentally challenging so I chose that over my 'hobby'.

I couldn't even get an internship so I missed the opportunity to get a real-world feel of the field and gain some experience (I have none whatsoever). 


So great, I have a degree in a field that gives me anxiety (I actually have work related anxiety but thats another story). I could always fall back on my hobby right? Well, I have 0 interest in drawing, painting, anything art related anymore.


So there's nothing left. I have no other interests or hobbies believe it or not, most died off while I was in college. I do not experience that same satisfaction like I did pre-college.


So now what do I do if I cannot enjoy anything? Do I still seek a CS position even though I feel incompetent and lack creativity?

So, stated simply, I don't know if I have the stamina to continue schooling. 
I just finished with a double B.S. (Geology/Geophysics, and Anthropology). I worked my ass off the past 3 years to get from a 2.9 GPA to a 3.6 (with about 215 hrs total). I overloaded each semester (15 - 22 hrs) and was intently focused on getting into a good grad program, pursuing a PhD and becoming a research professor at a large university. 

Well, without explaining the job outlooks for that direction, I just got done with an internship with a research professor and while I didn't hate it, I can't see myself enjoying that future. First off, way too much desktime, and programming, secondly, so little comes of all this effort. We had Wednesday ""learning"" days, and the researchers, grad students, and profs would bash all these recently published papers. Not sinisterly, but just, ""well, they're methods should be better explained here,"" ""What are they trying to say at all?"" You know, just making me wonder what the point of publishing is, if it's not even taken seriously. 
So, I am in a PhD program (starting in the Fall). And part of me just wants to fuck it all and go work at a coffee shop in a mtn town. Live for fun, and enjoyment. 
Another part says to get the masters, opt out early, and go teach at a community college in a mtn town. 
Third part says, I should finish what I got myself into, maybe I'll enjoy it after all. 

But the bottom lines are, the research prof route leads to stress, living in a place that is dependent upon job opening and your very specific field of study. And just seems so meaningless, so much research just never gets seen or talked about. 


Does anyone else share these thoughts? 

Can I actually drop out before starting? 

What is the experience with all of this for you people?

Thanks"

1i7gww,2,2013-07-13,Accepting first job offer and still applying to other companies?,tragichero24,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1i7gww/accepting_first_job_offer_and_still_applying_to/,"I just graduated as an EE last month and currently have a follow up interview that I feel confident about. The four big problems are that it is an Applications Engineer Position, it got a lot of bad ratings on glassdoor, it may be the only offer I get in my area (Southern California) and looking like a job hopper if I look for and find another job. Here's a little more on each problem:

**Applications Engineer**: From what I gathered from the first interview, this position requires a lot of talking with customers on the phone and is more on the ""sales"" side of engineering. Coming out of school I expected to be doing more on the design or testing side of engineering. Also, would going down the Applications Engineering road set me up to only do that type of work in the future? My top choice would be something in RF and communication systems. I do not want to be too picky on my first job but at the same time don't want to hinder my career advancement.

**Reviews**: A great majority of reviews on this company on glassdoor, pretty much says it is a terrible place to work. If I have to prioritize what I'm looking for in a job it is that I want to be happy working. However alot also say the pay is good which is another factor. Lastly, I understand that most people that write reviews are either terribly angry or extremely pleased with what they are reviewing so I take it with a grain of salt. It is just tough to shake off as there way A LOT of negative reviews. How accurate would you guys say glassdoor is?

**Location**: There is not a lot of engineering positions near Los Angeles so I know my pickings are thin. Staying in LA is honestly a top priority as it is my home town. The problem is I only graduated with a 3.06 GPA and no internship experience (only tutoring and grading some engineering courses, and customer service as working experience). I feel the competition is tough and I will only have a limited amount (if not the only) shot at getting a position here.

**Job Hopping**: Based on the position itself and the bad reviews, it seems like it will not be an enjoyable job. Would it be okay to continue searching for positions while working there and switch jobs as soon as I get another offer? I feel as if this will make me look like a job hopper to other companies. 

**TL;DR**: App engineer not my top choice as a position, bad reviews on glassdoor but great location. Continue to search for work while working there?

Any suggestions?

1i8zjh,12,2013-07-13,BS or BA for Computer Science does it really matter?,rjd89,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1i8zjh/bs_or_ba_for_computer_science_does_it_really/,"To put this into prospective I am ready to be done with school as the computer science degree I am working on now will be my second (first one was a AAS in police science which I did not enjoy, but looking back I was not ready to take a computer science degree seriously as I was immature coming out of high school).

I am thinking of switching into a BA degree which will be a semester less of classes (2 semesters left instead of 3). I am currently working as a internship in a job related field reporting off databases and will continue on as part time during the school year and from what I hear they usually hire on the interns when the finish their degree. Will the year and a half of experience be enough to make up for getting a BA in computer science over a BS?

I should note the major differences between the BA and BS are 5 classes. (2 math classes and 2 CS classes) however I will still be specializing my degree in the Database systems course as I would with a BS I just wouldn't have to take as many general CS degrees for other specialized fields (1 instead of 2).

Either way I plan to continue on as normal next semester as I am not forced to make a decision until then as up until then all classes taken will not overlap, but I would like to start thinking about it now. Also I am not %100 sure but I am fairly certain my gen ed/classes for other degree will cover the extra elective hours needed for a BA.

Some nice, some angry, some crazy, and some just plain pathetic.  As an intern in DC not only do you pass these people every day but they call to your office to complain to you about the state of the nation.  You’re all smart people and I assume you know yelling, “abortion is bad,” or, “Republicans hate me because I’m poor,” don’t really get your thoughts anywhere in the office except on a piece of paper next to my phone.  

Having said that, we do receive calls from level headed people but for every level headed, intelligent call I receive, I receive 5 irrational calls.  Normally these calls are limited to the caller being angry about what my boss voted on or what the House and Senate are doing and end at that, but sometimes they go to far.  Now obviously we have protocols for dangerous people who threaten things and it’s quite easy to scare them off once they are aware of that but sometimes they skirt the line between psychopath and angry citizen that the protocols don’t regulate.  

Now, I’ve never been afraid in DC.  I’m from the midwest and while the people might be a little shorter with you, being polite to them usually wins them over.  I give money to the  few homeless people I pass on my way to work every day and they seem to recognize me and appreciate that having talked to me and knowing I’m an unpaid intern.  But there was a new face on the street yesterday.  

There was nothing immediately off-putting about this guy.  I gave him some change on my way to the office and he thanked me.  That was about it.  The next day I did the same thing and even chatted with the guy.  He asked me where I worked and I said what office, he said he’d never heard of the guy but was pulling for him since he had, “Such a nice young man on his staff.”  

That was when the phone calls started.

The first one was non-alarming.  “Congressman ********’s office this is ******** how can I help you?”  On the other end of the line there was just shallow breathing.  Again I receive tons of phone calls all the time.  I asked again how I could help and with no response, hung up the phone, just relieved I didn’t have to get yelled at again.

These phone calls became a regular thing and honestly, I didn’t mind the little break.  Not doing paperwork, not getting yelled at, whatever.  

Then one day I noticed that the new guy wasn’t on the street that morning.  At first I jumped to the worst conclusions thinking maybe something happened to him but then I got hopeful thinking maybe he found something to get him out of his bad luck.

That day I received a phone call at the office. “Congressman ********’s office this is ******** how can I help you?”  “You’ll never find me...” * click *

The line went dead and that was that.  Okay... this guy is unstable and running around DC thinking me or anybody else has it out for him and is looking for him.  Whatever, he’ll move on, he’ll forget this office, he’ll forget me, and nothing will happen.
 On the way home I asked the other homeless guys if they’d heard anything about him, out of curiosity, and they said he just disappeared but that they’d keep an eye out for him. 

The next day at the office I received a call, “Congressman ********’s office this is ******** how can I help you?”  “But I can find youuuuu.....”  * click *

Ok. What the fuck.  

I mentioned it to my supervisor and they said it’s probably nothing to worry about but if it happens again let them know. 

I talked to the homeless guys again and said I was kind of freaked out.  One of them mentioned they saw the guy using a pay phone earlier in the day.  I may have jumped to conclusions but I figured it must be him calling me from these phones and he must be messed up on something.

The next call was the most disturbing.  I received a call, ““Congressman ********’s office this is ******** how can I help you?”  “******** office how can I help YOU?”  “I’m sorry what?”  “You heard me you little fuck.”  * click *

Now I’d had enough.  I talked to my supervisor again and he said go into the caller i.d. and write down the number.  He’d pass the number along to find the pay phone and my description of the guy so they can take him in.

I went into the caller i.d. and started writing down the number when I realized I was writing my own number down.  He was in my house.  I told my supervisor and we immediately phoned the police.  I’m hanging out at the office typing this while the police search my house and canvass the area.  They’re giving me a lift home.  I’ll let you guys know how everything goes.   "

However, there is a job role at her new company that I'm qualified for and think I would enjoy doing, and us both starting jobs in the same location, would wipe away most of the logistics issues. 

Has anyone worked with/for their spouse and made it work? Is it a recipe for certain doom? If you made it work, what advice do you have for us?

---

Here's the stupidly long explanation I dumped on the poor bastards in /r/relationships. I'm bolding what I feel like is the important stuff, I know you guys have shit to do. 

**History:** 
My GF and I have been dating for about 3 years. We met in December of 2009 at a college party, started dating in April casually, and I broke it off before the summer because I was 19 and didn't want to try the long distance thing. I was immediately plunged into deep, deep regret which made me realize that I was, in fact, crazy about the girl, and we started dating again in the fall, going from 0-serious pretty quickly. 

She drove out to see me every weekend for the rest of the school year, and when I graduated and got a job she came up to see me twice a week and every weekend. In March of '12 she got a job near my apartment and we ""officially"" started living together. 

**She is the absolute love of my life, I believe I'm the love of hers, we both want to get married when we reach that point in our lives. (""That point"" is largely a financial one for me, I just want to be able to afford an engagement ring I'm proud to give her)**

**Sure, we have our share of spats, squabbles and arguments, but hardly ever have a fight we can't solve before we fall asleep.**

**Situation:** Right now she is a Proposal Coordinator for an IT contracting firm that is slowly in the process of going belly up, and I could write reams on how poorly her boss treats her. I am a ""Product Specialist"" (whatever the hell that means) for a very large internet company, while I enjoy the work, I do not enjoy the environment of a  Fortune-Fuck-You sized company that places little to no value on its workforce as people. 

A colleague from the BD department of her old company contacted her a few weeks ago, saying he was exploring a job opportunity with a company that does aviation contracting where he would go in and basically build a BD department and Proposal shop, and wanted to bring her on as his Proposal Manager. 

It is a phenomenal, practically once in a lifetime opportunity for her. It's far more responsibility than she has in her current position, and would give her the opportunity to set up and run a Proposal Department exactly the way she wants to. She would have a technical writer/graphic designer in her department immediately, and they would bring in writing interns from the nearby school. 

**He offered her a 50% bump from her current salary, and the company is located in an area with a cost of living that is at least 50% lower than where we currently are, so we're talking about a *significant* lifestyle improvement. We've always wanted to get out of this high-cost area we're currently in, and this new job is also closer to both of our parents'. All of this stuff is very, very good. We've been planning on doing this in a rough 5-year plan, never expected an opportunity to do it right the hell now to fall in our laps.**

**The only downside? It's a 2+ hour drive from my current job, and located in a pretty rural area. I've already applied for *the* job within 75 miles of her new office that I'm qualified for. Also, we're stuck in our current townhouse lease until next June, so we'll have to find new tenants to take our places.**

This leaves us with a handful of options, from easiest to most difficult: 

**1.)** I hear back from that job I applied for, get it, we find new tenants, find a place down there, move and live happily ever after.

**2.)** She telecommutes until we find new tenants, we find a place to rent exactly at the halfway point between our two offices, and we each have a 1 to 1.5 hour commute each way to our respective jobs. We live there for a year, which I spend combing the area for a job, and then once that lease is up we buy or rent a place closer to her job. Our biggest concerns with this are burning ourselves out on the commutes.

**3.)** She moves down and gets a 1br student apartment, and either finds a replacement or continues to pay her rent up here. I continue working up here until I can find a job close to her. This seems like the most practical solution, but I absolutely hate the thought of separating again and only seeing each other on weekends.

**4.)** I quit my job and move down with her, as soon as we find replacement tenants. Her income would be more than enough to maintain a comfortable lifestyle for us in that area, indefinitely. However, given the glacial rate of the job market down there, I'm scared that I would end up unemployed for several months and going stir-crazy, or just becoming irrelevant.

**5.)** The crazy fuckin' idea. 

I'm actually reasonably well qualified for the tech writer/graphic designer they want to hire to work in the Proposal Department. My bachelors degree is actually in tech writing, I have workplace experience writing requirements documents which is a similar type of work, and I have experience with, and enjoy doing graphic design work. If we both had new jobs starting at the same time in the same location, pretty much all the moving pains are absolved.

However, we would be working together on a daily basis. I would take my assignments from her, and she would review all of my writing (as well as the technical subject matter experts and executive team). 

I feel comfortable with this, but I'm sure I would be fooling myself to say its not going to place any additional strain on our relationship, or to think there's no chance of impacting our workplace performance or relationship at home.

Does anyone work with their spouse, that could share some words of wisdom? Is it a guaranteed recipe for disaster? If not, how could we set ourselves up to approach from the best possible way? Maybe we could set up rules about how we interact in the office, what we do and do not bring home from the office, etc, etc. Maybe we could structure our workplace relationship so that I also report directly to her new boss.

I'm pretty good at compartmentalizing what goes on in my work life from what goes on in my home life, and I think if we approached it correctly, we could keep that line clearly defined.

**Assuming the company was actually open to the idea, we'd be open to having some check-in sessions with a relationship counselor, and/or contacting my old career coach, to make sure we have all the tools we need to make it work.**"

So, today I get a call from the reception desk saying that someone needs help saving a document uploaded with a network scanner I moved to a Windows 7 machine a few weeks ago.  When I get there, the woman explains that she can't find the share drive (to save the scanned document) in Windows Explorer because it doesn't appear in the drop down menu, regardless of the fact that the icon was 2 inches away under ""Computer"". 

Honestly, I was glad it was an easy (and somewhat understandable for older users) issue, and my cube mates and I got a decent chuckle out of it.

TL;DR I taught someone how to use Windows Explorer today."
1icsdb,52,2013-07-15,The other person in the meeting room,Dimitri1033,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1icsdb/the_other_person_in_the_meeting_room/,"I've lived a pretty normal life so far for a 21 year old person. I've been attending college, pursuing a degree in compsci. I only have one more year left, so I decided to get an internship. I applied, and got it, and moved 3 hours away from home to work for the summer.

I won't give out too many details about the job, but right now I'm basically sitting at a cubicle and working on the occasional small programming projects. Sometimes my employers need time to come up with projects for me and the other interns, so I occasionally have a bit of downtime throughout the day.

This can become a bit boring, so small things like phone meetings are pretty exciting for me because I see them as a means to kill some time. The other day, I get an email for a team meeting to be held at 1pm. 

The way meetings work, is that we call in using the meeting code attached in the email. We're prompted to speak our name, then join the room where our name is repeated by a recording. Then the meeting starts when all the necessary people have joined the call.

Excited for the meeting, I called in at 12:55, knowing I might be the first person on the phone. I said my name, got switched to the meeting, and I was right. After saying a couple of ""hellos"", no one responded. Oh well. 

After two minutes of waiting, the automatic voice chimed in. ""Now joining: ...""

Usually the person's name is stated after the ""now joining"", but instead of a name there was just a pause. The automatic voice also sounded a bit distorted. I didn't think much of it and just continued waiting for other people to join.

I looked across the office and saw that other people were just sitting at their desks doing other busy work. I began to wonder when they would join the meeting.

I sat back down, and start rocking back in my chair. I start hearing a strange noise, like someone puffing air out of their nose rapidly. I took off my headset, thinking the noise was coming from my chair. Nope, it wasn't. I thought nothing more of it and put the headset back on my ear. It was one of those weird headsets that wraps around your ear. I'm still getting used to it and often have trouble putting it on and taking it off.

The puffing noise stopped. I look at the clock and saw that it was 12:57. Still no one else has joined the meeting room. They should've be coming in by now. 

The puffing noise started again, this time faster, sounding like someone just got done running and is breathing through their nose instead of their mouth. I just sat there, listening to the noise, not thinking much of it at all. The puffing noise turned into a low grunt, and the grunt slowly built up to a light laughter.

I was a bit put off by this, thinking it might just be another worker who forgot to mute their microphone. The laughter got louder, almost painful in my ear. I rolled over to the controls and turned the volume down on my headset. But as I lowered the volume, the laughter just got louder and more beast-like. 

Now was the time for me to start freaking out. I stood up and tried to take off the headset. My fingers fumbled with it, and I couldn't get the damn thing off. I obviously made a loud ruckus. I finally got the headset off and threw it onto the table. I could still hear the laughter coming from the headset. A coworker came by and asked me what was wrong, I pointed to the headset. The laughter had stopped though.

I asked him if he had gotten the meeting invite in an email, and he said no, that there wasn't any scheduled meetings at 1pm. I got goosebumps, and decided not to tell him or anyone else about what I had heard. I put the headset back onto its stand and just sat down, and the coworker just went back to his cubicle.

I had broke out in a sweat, and was shooken up. I got up to go get a drink from the breakroom, and when I got back, I saw I had an email. I checked it and saw that it was another meeting invite for 1pm the next day. I walked over and asked my coworker if he got an invite, and he said no. I showed him the email and he just scratched his head. We checked who sent it, but the sender field was blank. 

I haven't called into that meeting again, but I'm still getting the invites. I've just been deleting them."

So, I have an internship at a small IT company, and I'm working with asp.net in VB. During the first month, I've been getting used to the whole asp.net framework and learning vb (i thought it was pretty similar to java), doing simple string substitutions, querystring, etc. Then last week, my mentor challenged me to implement the Google Speech Recognition API to facilitate users when they have to input something in the textbox! The API is at 

https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/speech-api/raw-file/tip/speechapi.html

and once i took a look at it. I was instantly lost. Is this normal?

Anyways, today, he said for me to hold off the speech recognition, and to look into how we could import linkedin profiles to our database. I took a look at the developers page, and I think it doesnt let you simply just extract files with the API. Could someone help me understand the whole concept?  I really want to learn, but I feel like I dont even have a grasp of anything here!

I'm currently working as a [different positon] for [my department], where I've had the opportunity to worked closely with our [supervisor], [Name].

1ibord,6,2013-07-15,MS structural engineering student in need of some serious advice. Strongly considering quitting,[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1ibord/ms_structural_engineering_student_in_need_of_some/,"Hi,

I've been doing a lot of soul searching, and I am slowly formulating a decision on whether I should remain in grad school or not. I am a PhD student in civil engineering (structural emphasis), but I believe that a PhD is out of the question completely for me at this point.  

I just completed my second year at an ""average, nothing exceptional"" institution. I think it will take me at least one year to get my masters.

I got super depressed and burnt out after my second year. I had been feeling it for some time, and I tried to push through, but ultimately I lost all energy, passion, and motivation to go on. My adviser was very demanding, and additionally required me to take many courses outside of my major. In reality, I only have taken 2 structural engineering courses. The remainder of my courses have been EE and ME. This was particularly due to my research area, which is structural health monitoring, but honestly, in hindsight, I don't think it does me much good for a job in structural design. I would mind a ""structural health monitoring"" job, but I don't know if there is even a solid industry for that.

I don't want to complain about the classes I'm taking, because I think they're very interesting, its just that there is a HUGE learning curve for me to overcome in order for me to excel in those classes.

Last semester, I literally bombed both of my classes. I had to take an undergraduate mechanical engineering class (yeah I've taken two undergrad classes), and a graduate level EE class. I mean, don't get me wrong, I love the ME and EE subjects, its not like I wasn't interested in the material. It was just that I had no fucking way of dealing with all the stress at that point. 

The professor of the grad class that I bombed told me I have until Aug. 8th to take a final, comprehensive exam that would dictate my grade. I have barely studied. I can't bring myself to focus.

I also started smoking weed heavily to cope with the depression and stress. I don't see weed as a negative thing, but I do believe it is unhealthy for me to be smoking this much. I smoked through my first cigarette pack as well. So it doesn't seem like I'm headed in a good direction.

Its honestly come to a point where I can't even take care of myself properly. The notion of getting out of bed has become stressful, and simple tasks such as checking the mail have caused high amounts of stress. I've been on depression medication, and have not yet gone to therapy, though whether I quit or stay, I think therapy will be my next choice.

Although I am potentially close to a thesis masters, I honestly do not have the urge to continue.  I tried taking a break over the summer, but honestly, it hasn't helped much. I've been flirting with the idea for some time, and would really like to hear other peoples perspectives on what they would do in my situation.

 Let me tell you some of my credentials...this is engineering specific:

**Current Status**


* ~3 classes short for MS in Structural Engineering

* BS in Civil Engineering

* Previous internship experience

* FE license

* One 2nd author published journal paper

* Several conference papers/presentations

My idea is, I can't handle any grad school right now because I'm so burnt out and over it, so quit, take a break for a semester/look for an engineering job. Finish my MS (perhaps non-thesis) after I get a job. 


I really just want to know what other people think of my situation. Do you think I need to suck it up, or is quitting right before a MS thesis degree taking a step back. If you guys can please give me some advice, I'd greatly appreciate it.

The internship I want to apply for requires a background in statistics, Excel and a statistics computer program. I'm a math major who hasn't taken any statistics other than a survey class. I've never used Excel or the computer program. But from the very start of the summer, my intention was to learn to use Excel/Access, the computer program and a database program in order to become employable in this field. I haven't started yet, so right now I know nothing. The internship won't start until September so I will have plenty of time to learn. 

But I really don't think I should lie on my resume and the application and say that I have experience using Excel and the computer program, right? Technically I would have some experience by the time the internship starts, but I don't think it is right to outright lie.

I just feel really shitty about this. This internship would be perfect for me if I had taken my education and career more seriously. But since I procrastinated learning what I need to know, I won't get this internship and I won't be able to get one next summer either because I have no references or experience (this one doesn't require references).

I am living with a woman temporarily over the summer while I am doing an internship with a government agency. The only other people who come into the house regularly besides the two of us are her pet sitter, we'll call her Stacy, and her handyman, we'll call him Bob. 

Once I moved in, she started noticing jewelry missing. When she confronted me, I was genuinely shocked and told her, after she opaquely accused me of stealing from her, that she was free to look around my room. Of course, she didn't find anything because I didn't steal anything. She is now - I think - suspecting Stacy, the pet sitter. She's been reluctant to set up a Nanny cam or anything like that (though I wish she would because I moved all my jewelry to my office because I don't want shit stolen, either). Not to mention that for my internship with the agency, I had a full background check done, including criminal background check.

It has made my living situation... uncomfortable. I've looked for another place to live but I'd rather stay where I'm at since I already paid her for the month and I'm going home at the end of the month.

Now my landlady is talking about filing a police report. She had an officer come out last night and they just chatted. I'm fine with her filing a police report, since her stuff is missing, but I have some questions.

If she does file a police report, am I obligated to talk to the police? Do I have to let them search my room? Should I have a lawyer present when I talk to the police? I have watched way too much Law and Order, so I am all worried. I also worry that once this all becomes public, Stacy might be very eager to plant something in my room. I don't have a lock on my door but I've been searching my room every night since I was semi-accused to make sure there isn't anything that shouldn't be there.

Nothing has really changed -except I can now remove the word Junior from my Manager title. 

I was wondering if anyone has any ideas how to approach this on my CV and Linkedin.

Do people usually list the company they are working at when they are consultants?

Linkedin is another issue, I want to update my profile to show that I now have a ""real"" job and not an internship, the company I actually spend all my time at looks better than the consulting firm, which is relatively small, but if I add my new position as the ""old"" company the consulting firm may not be too happy about that, and they are my real bosses when it comes down it.

Apparently the socket that the other cord was plugged into was dead, and this server was running off one power supply. I plugged them both in to working outlets, and ran to my boss. The first words out of my mouth were, ""Sorry James, I killed Odin.""

Luckily, Odin was hosting some VM's that no one was using at the time."

1if2lc,13,2013-07-16,Doing freelance while going to school?,inaft,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1if2lc/doing_freelance_while_going_to_school/,"I've been doing a part-time ""programming"" internship since last November. It's been good, but it's not exactly an ideal job or even internship. The positives are that I can basically make my own schedule (although I can only work 20-30 hours/week, even during the summer), which is good during the school year. They've basically said that they are willing to keep us on as permanent part-time. The pay is decent, better then most part time college jobs ($14.00/hour).

However, there have been a lot of crappy parts of the job as well. We've gotten hardly any training or mentorship. The company scores about a 2 on the Joel Test. I've got an awful computer that makes it hard to do any work. (A Pentium IV running Windows XP, single monitor setup. Even when I worked in tech support for a cheap company I get better hardware.) The extent of the programming involved is a few Perl scripts here and there. The majority of the job is mixed between data entry and letter composition.

When this next semester starts I'm thinking of leaving the internship and focusing mainly on school, in hopes of finishing sooner. I have enough in savings that I could live off of for about two semesters, and I plan on getting a good internship next summer. (One company in particular I think I have a pretty good chance at, since I've been working towards applying there for nearly a year!)

In order to make this work, I would still need to bring in around $200 a month. I was thinking of doing some freelance work, possible on freelancer.com. I've been browsing the jobs posted there for awhile, and there's a lot of them that I know I have the skills to do.

For those of you that have done freelance work, how hard do you think it would be to make about $200 a month? I have experience with web app development (and web design, although I prefer working on the backend), most aspects of web hosting, have a lot of scripting experience in Perl and Python, as well as some C++/Java. I'm thinking that maybe taking a handful of the smaller jobs each month would be the best, rather then the larger developments.

I'm thinking this would really help my portfolio/resume as well - moreso then staying here for another two semesters.

**tl/dr** - Kind of sick of a subpar internship, but still need to make at least $200 a month to supplement my savings in order to live off of for the next two semesters of school. Thinking of doing some freelance work. Wondering if people with experience with freelance think that's a good idea, or have any advice."

I'm am looking for some guidance, and mostly see what you guys are doing in-terms of improving yourself in the job-marketability. 
Here is what I have so far:

* Mechanical Engineering Technology Student at Central Michigan University. (Going into forth year, five year program.)

* Slightly active member of ASME.

* This Summer I am employed as an intern in the Mechanical Department of Instrumentation (Gauge Clusters) at Yazaki North America. 


I feel like what I am doing is pretty common, and not on a bad track. I was wondering what other things I could do to make me a better, more marketable employee when I graduate. 

Also, if you have any questions for me, please feel free to ask whatever. "

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[How do you recommend students approach you for letters of recommendations and things like that?  How do you deal with students who seem superficial in making professor-student relationships?  And lastly, how do you recommend students make prof-student relationships?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3gmb5?context=5)|Great question, I was waiting for someone to ask this!!!
 |Here's the important thing -- for me to write you a recommendation, then I need to know you outside of class.  Come to office hours, engage over email, work on a project w/ me.
 |If I only know you from the classroom, all I can really write is Jane/John Doe attended my class and got an A.  The transcript provides the exact same information, so writing a recommendation is redundant.
[As a followup, how do you expect students to express interest in starting or working in a project with you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3htz6?context=5)|Another good question.  Simply come to office hours, or email me.  Tell me what interests you, ask what I'm working-on, and see if there are any projects with which you can get involved.  This is also a great way to get your foot in the door for internships, etc.
[I'm pretty shy, and hesitated to speak up even in my high school classes. Do you think this will be detrimental in college classes? If so, are there ways around that cycle of not wanting to ask a dumb question/not understanding something? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3apqk?context=5)|Ask the professor to explain something in more detail.
 |Try to make a connection between the current topic and something you've previously covered in class.
 |Try to relate the discussion to a real-world example.
[Is attendance a big deal? Do you have to penalize absenteeism? I mean, if a student missed class, its their responsibility to catch up and if they do...I think they did a good job. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3gc33?context=5)|I think attendance is a two way street.  If an instructor requires it, then he/she should provide experiences in the classroom that cannot be replicated elsewhere.
[Have you even been offered sex to change grades- or do something of the sort.  Have you ever been offered sex from a colleague or a student not in your class?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3a1yt?context=5)|Yes.  No.
[Did you agree? Or do you know anyone who has changed grades for sex, money or anything? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3a8fn?context=5)|I have been offered sex by a student directly after returning midterm exams.  
[Did you report them? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3aeye?context=5)|No I didn't.  It was a surreal experience.  The student came to my office, dressed very sexily, closed the door, and started suggesting things we could do.  It was sorta like a scene from a bad movie...
 |EDIT: meant to write ""student"", not ""students""!
[*The students.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3anx9?context=5)|Haha, I just caught that.  It was one student.  He started undressing in my office.  I stopped that in a hurry!
[It was more than 1? How do you turn that down? Does your college have material about this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3anx9?context=5)|Yes, I'm sure my school has policies, but I don't know them.  My policy -- don't have sex with students!
[*He started undressing in my office.*  Ahhh that is hilarious! Did not see *him* coming! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3bd8e?context=5)|)
[Are you a male or female?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3b3g3?context=5)|Male.
[Have you ever had to deal with anyone plagiarizing? What happened? If not do you know any other plagiarizing stories at your school?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3et7o?context=5)|Luckily no.  I mostly teach innovation, so the course work would be very difficult to plagiarize.  That said, I have zero sympathy for academic dishonesty -- anyone caught cheating on an exam or other assignment gets an automatic zero, and possible referral to disciplinary action.  If you want the grade, you do the work.
[What's your opinion about most of the classes that students need to take to graduate?  What is the best way for a student to Get on your good side and be a favorite?  Have you ever given a student a grade that earned but not necessarly earned on paper?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3a3od?context=5)|In many programs, years 1 and 2 are mostly ""filler.""  Almost every major needs to take a stats class.  Why?  Most successful working professionals I know don't remember a thing about stats class and couldn't define mean, median or mode.
[What made you want to become a professor?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3a58t?context=5)|Great teachers gave me a great education, and I wanted to try to continue the cycle.  My students give me very high marks on course feedback, and alums say they learned important skills/information, so I keep at it.
[Back in the day a college education was affordable and there was little federal available for grants and student loans. Now students can get all the money they need  from the feds to pay their tuition and the price is sky high. Is there a connection between high college tuition costs and the availability of federal handouts to pay that bill? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3bddb?context=5)|Yes!  I think it's immoral.  Stafford loans are easy to get, and schools jack-up tuition.  No one really needs a climbing wall in the student rec center or fancy dorms.  But now students graduate with loads of debt, and they don't really understand how much that will limit their choices later.
[I just finished my first year at berkeley, and i've taken some classes where by the middle of the semester, 3/4th of the class does not attend and just show up for midterms/finals. i feel pretty bad for the professor, who has to continue to lecture as if nothing happens. has this ever happened to you? how do professors feel about it, and how do they deal with it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3dgqt?context=5)|I require students to attend class, and at the same time require from myself that we actually do interesting things with that time!
[I am really apprehensive about asking my professors for letters of recommendation for grad school, even though I know that they get asked by many students. Does it annoy you when students ask you for LORs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3i3n2?context=5)|Don't feel apprehensive, it's part of our job.  But first, you must make sure the professor knows you -- see my previous answer about establishing contact outside the classroom...
[Thanks for replying. I've taken 2 classes with the professor I'm going to ask and have done research with her. I met with her every week for 2 hrs with just her and I in her office. That was last fall. Hope she remembers me :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3ibtf?context=5)|She sounds highly qualified to give you a great rec -- and believe me, the people reading that letter will appreciate it -- good luck!
[Do you care about teaching or research more?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3a42q?context=5)|I really enjoy teaching and think it's meaningful work, so that's where I focus.
[Hello thanks for doing an AMA! couple of questions here!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb39zmp?context=5)|I mainly teach innovation related classes to CS majors and engineers, and also get many business students.  
[What type of courses do you teach.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb39zmp?context=5)|At my school, the professor has wide latitude in assigning grades...no one would be referred to a Dean for a grade change.
[To get the grade changed why is it always the professor says ""you have to go speak to the dean"", and the dean says ""I cant do anything about it, you have to go speak to the professor"". 3.how can  you convince a professor to change your grade from a C- to a C?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb39zmp?context=5)|You should compare your work to the requirements stated on the syllabus.  Make your case that you met the standard for a C or whatever grade your work merits.  Be polite and persistent. 
[As a computer science student, I am interested in which courses/major I should narrow my degree down to. I'm taking IT and CSC courses, and would like to get into programming. I was hoping to program with a masters degree, but my backup career is networking. What courses should I take to maximize my potential in both areas? Is my current IT-COM double major the right choice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3atc0?context=5)|First you need to choose what skills are most important to you -- Ruby, Python, whatever.
 |Second, and even more importantly, find a few classes to help you translate your technical skills into something commercially useful.  Specifically, how can you help create a revenue generating product?
 |Does your school offer courses in product management, product marketing, etc.?
[I'm currently going to a community college with relatively few options. In the spring, I am transferring to a state U which will most likely offer such courses. If I was wanting to be more technically oriented, would you still recommend taking these seemingly business oriented classes? Also, unrelated, but should I consider independently getting CISCO certified?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3b11p?context=5)|Generally you should use CC to fill as many requirements as you can, and then spend your time at the larger school taking more specialized courses.
 |I don't know the answer about certification -- that's more applied than what most of my students typically do.
[What do you think about the student debt interest rate doubling? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3bjfi?context=5)|Transfer less expensive credits from CC.
 |Work and save in HS and during college.
 |Go after every scholarship/grant possible.
 |Don't buy every iDevice.
 |The last point is especially important.  So many students have expensive iDevices.  You really don't need a MacBook Pro, iPhone, and/or iPad.  And don't go into debt to buy these things!
[This is exactly what I did and suggest to younger people all the time.   GO TO CC - You can really figure out what you want to do or if you already know that save a ton of money on the same units as UNI.  WORK - Don't expect mommy and daddy to handle evertyhing   Apply - Its paperwork and a process but get off your ass.   IPad - IS USELESS AT SCHOOL. If you want to be like everyone else, you may need a macbook. haha.  Back to interest rates - Do you think it is fair to pass on debt from the country onto its college students? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3bvd7?context=5)|Does anyone think it's fair that banks can borrow at 0.5%, while students pay 6.8%?
[Do you think a lot of students are majoring in subjects that will be of virtually no help to them in the job market because they buy into that college B.S. about studying whatever you love?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb39w82?context=5)|This is a major problem.  Students really need to investigate and understand how their field of study will advance their career.  The days are long gone when you can follow your passion into a non remunerative field.  Unless you have a large trust fund.
 |EDIT: grammar.
[In your opinion, are there any practical Bachelor's degrees that aren't related to Engineering or Business?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3a6ni?context=5)|Nursing seems to be in high demand.  STEM fields generally are pretty desirable.  Unfortunately, if you want to major in Drama or Comp Lit, it's pretty slim pickings.
[What do you think about science majors? i.e. chemistry, biology, physics.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3b5qh?context=5)|They're a great foundation, but you will generally need to pursue a terminal degree.
[I've heard that while nursing is in demand, it's only for crappy positions at old folks homes and the like, and only a very small percentage get to work in hospitals. Truth to that?  Source: Lots of med school people.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3bjp0?context=5)|I think it depends on geography.  I have friends in nursing who work 12 days a month and make $150K-$200K per year.  You need to pay your dues the first few years, and position yourself for a specialty.
[Do you deal with admissions much? If so, what would you say is the absolute most important thing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3e6r7?context=5)|I don't do much w/ undergrad.  Grades, tests scores and extracurriculars are most important.  Grad is a different story.
[To what extent do you think the (typically\) higher costs of prestigious universities are worthwhile for students on a budget?  Under what circumstances would you recommend a student take out loans to attend your school, and under what circumstances (if any\) might you encourage a student to save money by attending community colleges or state schools?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3n4g8?context=5)|I think you should start by understanding what you can afford on your budget, and then seek the the highest quality (quality, not prestige) education you can find.  There are many very high quality state schools, so certainly consider them.
[Probably way too banal... I just am that way. Which writing software do you work with every day?  Word.  Open-/LibreOffice.  LaTeX.  What do you want to work with every day? Why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3n3kn?context=5)|I seek the path of least resistance -- Word is far from perfect, but I've been using it so long that I can usually find a way to make it work.
[As I'm not a U.S. citizen, one thing that always strikes me is the cost associated with going to college/university. Which is why I found this article quite interesting. =&gt;  What do you think of the costs going to university, getting a ""proper"" degree and the actual worth of it?  Do you ""experience"" repercussions/consequences of it, i.e. what people pay and what your school provides in return?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3pa6l?context=5)|I think it's easy for a billionaire with two Stanford degrees to encourage young people to skip college and work with him for a few years.  It's great if your start-up hits the jackpot.  But what happens otherwise?
[Do you teach large introductory classes with tons of students, or do you focus on smaller upper-division classes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3kpt2?context=5)|I mostly teach JR/SR and grad students.
[I'd definitely be interested in knowing more. I know that the computer science department at my school deliberately sets the average GPA of most lower division classes to ~2.7. Also, wouldn't a B be ""off the charts""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3kzmp?context=5)|I know more than a handful of CS folks who advocate not wasting your time in school.  Not sure I completely agree with them, but some make it work.
[Cs get degrees though, and if you're a computer science or engineering major that's all you need in this job market :P.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3kzmp?context=5)|Depending on your skills and location, you don't need a degree to get a six figure CS job in this market.
[Hello I am a recent high school graduate, my question to you is what tips do you have when meeting or interacting with my professors for the first time? I am planning to attend a big university and I want to stand out from the crowd of 100+ students in class.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3an1n?context=5)|Be genuine, read the assignments, go to office hours and ask questions.  Don't kiss-ass, but if you're really interested in the material you'll find that many/most professors will be very generous with their time and want to work with you.
[Do you think the students at your school are just paying for the name on the diploma or do you think they genuinely have a better grasp on what they're studying than grads of less reputable schools? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3ae95?context=5)|Good question.  Most incoming students are already highly accomplished -- admissions are very competitive.  I know a few who decide to drop-out and just start working -- they seem to do fine -- though their parents aren't so comfortable. 
[What courses do you teach? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3aa9k?context=5)|Answered above -- mostly innovation related classes.
[If I have a so-so GRE score but I already have a masters should I even bother applying to a Ph.D. program?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3aa9k?context=5)|Why do you want to pursue a PhD?  The degree costs a great deal, and in most professions you won't see a great benefit w/ having the credential.
[I go to College in Ontario ( the equivalent to a community college in the US\) and I am on a first name basic with almost all my professors. Do you think when it comes down to grading, this makes any sort of a difference, and do you you grade any different to students who you are familiar with, and who you know are active participants in your lectures? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3g5jw?context=5)|Most students call me by my first name, and I try to learn something about them.  It helps me tailor the class to their interests/needs.
 |I grade assignments objectively -- don't even look at the names until recording grades.
 |As for active participants, yes that does help increase a student's grade if they're trying to say something constructive, and not just get brownie points.
[How do you feel about tenure? I want professors to have job security of course, but I feel like it can be abused. I've had a rather lazy professor (often cancelled class without warning and wasted our time showing us cat pictures on the internet\) who, when passing out surveys for us to rate the class and professor, sort of implied that it didn't matter what we said because he had tenure. Also, I don't completely understand how tenure works, I know the professor is not completely protected from discipline. What are the pros and cons?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3bbkc?context=5)|Personally I do not believe in tenure.  The ""pro"" arguments typically focus on academic freedom.  That's important, though I rarely see a sincere academic penalized for pursuing rigorous, thoughtful work -- popular or not.
 |On the ""con"" side, yes I agree it can produce laziness and lack of accountability.
 |Look at it from the perspective of most faculty.  They take perhaps 7 years to get their PhD, another 7 to gain tenure.  By that point they're tired, and think they've ""earned"" the right to relax for a while.
 |I strongly believe that tenure, as we know it today, should be abolished.
[Do you have any past students that still stand out in your memory?  How many students do you still keep in contact with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3bivq?context=5)|Yes, I certainly remember past students, and keep in contact with several dozen (maybe 100?).
[Do you eat the food on campus or do you go off campus and grab food?  Or do you just bring your own?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3bivq?context=5)|I grab my lunch from a little sandwich shop.  Follow me after class on the way to office hours, and I'll probably buy you a sandwich too!
[Do you have external (eg grant\) funding?  If so, when is the last time you thanked the people in your SRO? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1id49r/iama_professor_at_a_wellknown_university_i_teach/cb3k8mv?context=5)|Yes, I have a bunch of funding, but as mentioned before, I focus on innovation.  I don't do traditional PI work -- much more applied.
[Is graduate school worth the extra stretch?

I just finished up my 3rd year as a computer science student. I currently work in advertising doing some email development and website development with HTML, CSS and javascript. The job started out kind of interesting as I was doing some python and some work with MySQL, but now web development is all i seem to be doing. The pay is decent, $15 an hour, and mainly took it because it was my first industry-related job that i had a chance at last year which was worlds better than my service job I had had previously.

I had a different job lined up that was going to be mobile development, which seemed a little more interesting, that I was thinking about doing this summer, but I ended up not doing it because the pay wasn't a huge improvement and as apposed to this job I wouldn't have had benefits like medical after I had completely converted to full time. Now I'm wondering if i actually ended up screwing myself over. I'm still not completely sure what I want to do, but I'm not sure I want to develop email campaigns for the rest of my life. I almost feel like i'm wasting my degree here. 

But will I have almost typecasted myself into web development by doing this internship as my only professional experience? How far will my own personal projects take me when I apply for a different job? Should I bother trying to find a different job before I graduate?"

My boyfriend and I live together, both have full time jobs, and are also supporting his younger brother while he has an unpaid internship. Overall, we are doing pretty well for ourselves.


However, his father has been out of a job for the past two years, and his mother has been out of a job since Christmas. They have been looking desperately for something, to no avail, and now their unemployment is running out. His younger sister also can't find a job (though I can't speak for how thoroughly she is searching.)

We are considering trying to rent a house for them to stay with us for a year until they get a job. There are obviously SO many things wrong with this option, not to mention that there are literally no houses in the area that my boyfriend and I can afford. 


His parents and sister are currently living in an RV park, but even that is now too expensive. I offered us downgrading to a cheaper apartment and using the resulting extra money to help them out, but even that is only enough to pay basic rent (not even including food, gas for getting to interviews- there is NO public transit where they live). 


My mother thinks my boyfriend and I shouldn't be having to deal with this, but both sides of his extended family are psychopaths, so the only option here is us, and maybe welfare, though the welfare may not be approved in time for it to even matter. (oh, they also can't make money via blood donations, because they lived in a country with potentially unfiltered water for several years.)


I don't know what to do, the stress and anxiety this is causing has even caused me to miss a couple days of work. I'm sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, I honestly don't know what to do.

**Edit/Update:**

I'd like to thank everyone for their advice, all of the different perspectives have helped me think about this with a clearer mind. 


I know a lot of people have just told me to drop it and walk away, unfortunately I can't do that. I know I only said he was my boyfriend, but I suppose I should have pointed out that we have been together for a very long time, and are practically married (we just haven't had time for ceremony and such, and are not big on marriage anyway.) I suppose my wording made it sound like we weren't as close as that? That walking away from him and his family was an option at all? If I had said that he was my fiance, or my husband, would that have changed anyone's advice?


I'm going to email his mom directly, as when talking to my boyfriend, the only apparent option, to him, is to have them move in with us. We can't afford that, and I (and I know his mother agrees with me) don't think it will actually help them in the way he thinks it will. I'm going to ask them what kind of help they have searched for (welfare, stamps, etc.) and encourage them to take those routes while we can help them with any extra emergencies (car breaks down, need emergency gas for an interview, etc.) I'm also going to ask her to try and push her daughter harder in terms of getting a job, and will even offer to help find job postings close to where they live (I understand where her daughter is: just graduated high school. In the generation that has almost no clue how to do anything for themselves because her parents or older siblings did everything for her.) Hopefully, between his mother and I, we can convince him to look to alternate solutions that won't completely bankrupt us. "

What should I do? I was just planning on making a single repository called ""Basic Java"" and throwing all of the school-related java programs that I've done into that. Ranging from simpler ones that might have been 5 minute homework problems to the larger, more complicated assignments. Would employers look fondly upon that or are they only looking for massive, collaborative projects on GitHub?

I'm a fairly recent mechanical engineering graduate that's currently got an unsavory job situation. I'm making about the same as most of the teachers I know, and my job satisfaction is practically nil. During school, I did exceptionally well in terms of grades and internships and activities, but I had to shoe-horn myself into the role.

I'm already planning on heading to grad school in the fall of 2014. So, a change is going to happen. It's just a question of what. I think my best choice would probably just be to continue my education and look for a better job.

I'm also currently considering making the switch to teaching STEM classes at the high school level. I have, by no means, decided this is my only course of action, but I'm simply investigating it as a potential path forward.

**My questions are as follows:**

**1. Does anyone have any experience with this sort of thing? Would you do it again?**

**2. Do jobs get better with more education?** Since I'm already looking at more education, I figured a TA position would be an excellent way to see if this sort of thing is for me. I'm also curious as to whether it would possibly change my outlook on the field.

**3. Would it be better to simply look for a new job?** I've only been at the workplace seven months now, but I've not enjoyed any of my time at the office. That said, the job sites are fairly neat. My company does industrial controls, and traveling for months at a time just isn't appealing to me.


*TL;DR: My current job situation as an engineer is a serious drain. What would it take to make the switch to teaching math and science at the high school level?*"

I'll get things started with a couple of ideas off the top of my head:  

* In at least some jobs it seems that a P.E. certification can impact salary.
 
* Leading a project of substantial value ($ amount varies depending on job and company) seems like another good one.  
* As my experience is with R&amp;D, published patents that give real market differentiation are very big.  I can imagine equally substantial items for manufacturing, quality, and other engineering specialties.

I'm particularly interested in software design. The past couple of years I have been unable to find paid work anywhere, and next year I'd really like to find a paid internship in my field--might as well make some money as well as do something that's going to help me down the road. 

I've been searching my college's website for internship opportunities, but there's nothing particularly dedicated to computer science. However, I figured pretty much any company would have use for someone who is good with computers if I just look in the right places. My college is close to a medical/engineering/sciences research park, so there should be plenty of opportunities. 

So I guess my main questions are:

How did you get your internship? Who did you talk to, where did you look? What kinds of companies did you inquire at? 

What should I be learning/preparing for in the meantime? I'm shooting for summer 2014 (as a rising junior) if possible. I have experience with Python, Java, and HTML/CSS so far, and will continue to practice and learn whatever other languages I should know.

I have been tasked with the creation of an, albeit simple, web page for a student organization I'm involved with. I'd like to leverage my experience in these new .NET technologies to make this website, but I have zero web dev experience up to this point. I've done a bit of research, and it has left me with some questions. 

If I were to make a WBA through WPF and C#, would it be natively compatible with chrome and Firefox? The msdn article I read cited the necessity of a Microsoft Web Browser Control in any compatible browser, but a stackoverflow comment from '09 said that IE exclusivity in WBA's was a thing of the past. If I want to work with xaml and C# to create a site, is a WBA a solid option?

My first instinct says to avoid Silverlight, because I know the clientele of this website will not necessarily be the most tech savvy and therefore possibly needing to make a download would deter visitors. I also know nothing about ASP.NET and would prefer to use technologies that I'm already familiar with (WPF, C#) due to the time table that I'm on. 

My understanding is that ASP.NET is traditionally the way to go for web development in .NET. My final question comes down to this, is it wise at this juncture to move forward with a WBA for this website, or should I instead take the plunge and learn ASP.NET? Simply, will a WBA provide a widely accessible product which will meet simple requirements (about pages, hosting a calendar, etc) or is ASP an unavoidable eventuality?

I very much appreciate any insight that you guys can provide. Thanks in advance!"

I am thinking about pursuing a career in either **chemical engineering or software engineering**, but I’d love to hear from anyone.  The first 6 questions below are ones that we were given to get answers to.  The last two I came up with because they may provide some guidance for my future.  Just a little about me I am going to be a senior in high school.  Thanks in advance if any of you are willing to take the time.

1. What did you study in college?

2. What type of projects did you have to complete at a college?

3. Were you expected to do an internship?  was it a requirement?   During the school year?  Pay tuition during the internship? Did you get paid for the internship?  Was an internship recommended? Did you do it during the summer?  Which academic year did you do it? (Soph. Jr. Sr.)

4. After graduating with a baccalaureate degree did you go to graduate school?  Was/Would it be beneficial for you to do so? In what ways?   Were/Will your graduate school studies a continuation of your undergraduate studies? More specific? Less?

5. What type of schooling does a high tech industry manager’s job need?  How do management jobs get filled in your company?   How does one climb the management ladder?

6. Are there trends, cycles, or swings that drive your industry?  What causes these swings?  What is the long term expected trend in your company?

7. If you were given the chance to go back through college would you change anything? what you studied? what career you got into?

8. Do you have any recommendations for someone who is thinking about getting into your field? education, skills etc?

This one took place less than a decade ago, (2000's) when web conferencing or remote desktop's popularity was still starting to pick up. Our business was still growing and we hired co-op students/interns back then to fill in the tech support void. Our 2 offices were separated by a road, because leasing another office was the most feasible solution for our booming employee base. As such, we had two server rooms --- one for each building.

We had a task for our intern one day: to take some backup tapes out from the server room across the street. He may have done so begrudgingly, as he trundled along to the other office. I was doing some routine maintenance on the servers back then, and heard our IT manager wondering where our intern was after a little while. I did not mind it much, as we know our intern was a bit on the lazy side.

I was working on the servers across the street, and VNC'ed on one of them when I noticed something strange: one of our servers who had a monitor, keyboard, and mouse hooked up on a KVM switch was displaying porn sites on it. Since I was on VNC, I can see that the session is still being controlled by the user who was there locally. I motioned our manager to come see my screen and asked him what course of action we should take next as I let him drive on my workstation. He chuckled a bit, took control of the session, opened Notepad and typed 'Big Brother is watching you.' We saw the mouse cursor move to close the open windows in a panicked motion.

Nonetheless, when the newbie came back from his task, he was a little red-faced. We also replaced our mouse and keyboard for that KVM switch...

I graduated with a Bachelors Degree in Communication Design - My gf fails to understand that people with degrees in design require a stunning portfolio in order to land work.

The problem with me taking lower paying job is that I've had one in the past and was barely able to concentrate on design itself. Therefore, the quality of my school projects suffered. And in my final semester I dedicated 120% of my time to improve the quality of my work. Right now I just freelance, but I'm looking for something steady in my field.
I can't be assed with internships and volunteer work. (Done like 3-4 of those already before I graduated.)

I refuse to take lower paying jobs because in the end my skills will stagnate if I get too lazy or too comfortable. Especially from working 40 hours a week.

What should I do reddit? Take the lower paying job? or just keep fighting my way to my career job by improving my portfolio. Also my student loans is at 9k at the moment.

&gt; * You get paid way more in the states than you do in Vancouver. Then again, all jobs in Vancouver have shitty pay.

&gt; * The pay is almost 40-50% less than the states and will never match what they have. But it does raise fairly quickly if your good. Starting you can expect 40-50k, but after 5 years or so, you can easily hit 75k or so. In the states, you start from 60-70 and go into 6 figure easily. From my friends' experience, there's an abundance of poorly paid contract jobs here in Vancouver, so I'm surprised to hear about the generous benefits. Contracts have no benefits at all.

&gt; * One particular company I can think of pays its CS devs roughly 40k as a co-op, but that doesn't go up by much once you're out of school and working for them as an intern. Full-timers get paid around 60k+, sure, but that's nothing if you're comparing to the states. If you're talking about the big silicon valley giants, you'll be making 60k as a co-op/intern and I have a few friends making 100k+ once they went back to the company full-time which apparently isn't hard as long as you don't fuck up. One took a pay cut when he requested to work out of the Vancouver office (it's hard to beat living in this city).

&gt;* From friends that work in the industry, all CS graduates. One in particular has 2 years worth of co-op and just got out of a 1-year contract paying 60k. He had offers from 4 different companies, all of them refused to match and would only offer 40-45k. He's now a dev at a consultant company making a little less than 50k.

I can go through the info in the sidebar, particularly the power level stuff, but I'd like to know what some of you ( particularly the younger sysadmins who just got their foot in the door, are in internships, can relate to my scenario etc ) have found the to be the most beneficial and sought after skills you have brought to your employer, as a day 1 mentored n00b.

I'm hammering into Zed A. Shaw's (the absolute legend from Learn Code The Hard Way)  CMD Line Crash Course [Powershell]. 

I have a particular interest in privacy and security. I like to keep up to date on privacy tools at least, and loved the bolstering interest that Snowden brought with his revelations.

Essentially, my question is ""What is the most relevant information I can give them, as a newb, and how can I present myself in the best light?"" 

Also, it'd be real damn cool if some IT HR/ Hiring Managers could throw their two cents in. In this hypothetical scenario, you can potentially hire a sysadmin intern which your business makes money from because of government schemes etc. (cost isn't an issue with them, essentially). What **exactly** are you looking for in them? What are the key words you'd look for in their cover letter and CV, from someone with no experience and a few certs?

I really have a lot of other options so I'm allowed to be picky (I'm 100% sure I will get other job offers later in the year, and if I don't get any I like, I'm just going to go get my master's). Sorry if that sounds arrogant, but I'm one of the best candidates at a great school with a highly in-demand major.

My main concerns are working hours. The story I hear from others is kind of inconsistent. Some people seem to work 80 hour weeks non-stop, others seem to usually work a more normal 40-50 hour week. I have no desire whatsoever to work 80 hour weeks consistently. Occasionally would be fine, but not all the time. I don't care about the pay as long as I'm getting a ""good"" salary for my major (i.e. I wouldn't mind being paid much less than this company offers).

My concern is with the inconsistency. It seems to really vary depending on the team and manager you are hired on. I'm also not sure if I'm ""allowed"" to ask what the expected working hours are?

India has very little in opportunities for my field, which is far more advanced than call centers. I have lived in the USA all my life, in silicon valley, where such opportunities abound. Recently I completed an internship in Australia, where I could go toe-to-toe with people with 15+ years of experience. I loved it, and judging by the number of letters of recommendation, they did too. My friends in the US now are accumulating massive resumes, due to the culture there, whereas I feel I am stagnating, falling behind the curve.

 
---------------------


Onto the non TL;DR. Ever since I was a child I have loved technology, and recently have delved into aspects far beyond a normal 16y/o's reach. I found that tech is what I want to do when I finished an internship in australia, and was told I was a natural, perfectly suited to this field. Now, I'm pretty confident that is the reception I would get if I was living in the USA again, as some of the people I worked with set me up with google and Microsoft, back in the bay area. I'm incredibly enthusiastic about this, and i'm going to do them soon, but one thing gets me. I live in india, not in the US, so the opportunities are much more limited here. I hate it and feel that I'm really falling behind my peers in the professional aspect. It's really difficult to get internships of this caliber, if one is not living in the USA. I actually fit the prerequisites for many google programs, but I cannot accept them due to my current location.

The part that saddens me however, is my fathers response. Many lectures were to be had and the eventual conclusion to them all was ""tough luck. I work here, and don't feel like moving. You want this? do it yourself."" 

I'm not deluded enough to think that I can support myself at my current age, so that pretty much shuts off that avenue of doing things. I *really* want to do more. I love working, and I love talking with people that share my passions, but for now, all of those people are in the USA.

You see, none of this would be a problem, if I didn't want to go to a top-tier college and to a top tier job. But I do, not just for money, but for the chance to have some really intellectually stimulating conversation with some very smart people. I could just sit on my haunches and bide my time, but the chances of me getting what I want become less with each passing day, as I cannot accept opportunities that I would otherwise like to, putting me behind the curve, when I think I can be ahead of it.

So what do I do? how do I explain this to my parents?"

1iujs6,0,2013-07-22,"Reddit , how do you handle personal favoritism happens your in lab.",[deleted],AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1iujs6/reddit_how_do_you_handle_personal_favoritism/,"throwaway obviously because i don't want to be known.

Here is the thing - i work in a lab with two grad students and a PHD. The PHd seems to be very close with my advisor (also supervisor of the lab). My advisor herself is 30+ but below 40 ,has 2 very young kids and was hired as assistant professor in 2011.

The PHd guy lives near her home and does all personal work for my adviser. Like he goes and moves her stuff  when she is changing homes,she brings kids to lab when her husband is not there and he babysits them. He also helped her husband mow his lawn and gives her greeting cards at  9AM in her office ,when it is her birthday. 

Now ,me and other grads in lab don't like this behavior of his . I always thought if we like someone ,we should  help them professionally by spending more time on their projects so that they are more successful.

She is a new prof. and gets very less funding ,so she initially approaches sponsors and offers them to develop products voluntarily. We always have done exceptional work -sometimes spending multiple nights in lab and this has resulted in her getting more funding from them.

So far we 3 grad students  have got her 4 projects purely based on the work we did . The Phd guy is working on project which is funded by college .But whenever we screw up things or deliver anything late by 1-2 days , we get scathing emails from her but this guy always seems to get a free pass when he does the same. 
He is almost 2.5 years into program ,has published 1 journal paper in some shit journal( not ieee or acm , some recently launched journal in singapore),hasnt written his proposal yet but my advisor seems ok with that. 

Whenever we ask advisor to recommend us to internships to our sponsors ,she says we should first ask ourselves .But my advisor gleefully recommended this phd guy to her previous employer( a large corporate) without any qualms.

What is the best way to deal with this situation,which is turning out to be really depressing?

[Peter im working on a column would love 2 know your take- if you were 2 make a NFL team of dog breeds what positions would they be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7xvla?context=5)|QB: Corgi. Thoughtful. WR: Greyhound. Well, of course. TE: Pitbull. Tough but agile. OL: Newfoundlands. Big horses. Pass-rusher: Golden retriever. Dying to get the ball. 
[Hi, Peter. I love your coffee column but what I want to know is why you spend so much of it talking about football?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7xrfx?context=5)|Well, when they pay me to write about Peet's Major Dickason's Blend, maybe I'll change my focus.
[I read you for years (I don't currently but that is more to do with how much I read about football period.\)  Anyways, I often thought about it would be interesting for you to do a piece on workplace relationships in the NFL. Between the salaries and the bravado there is so much an anonymous piece could tell. I am not talking about sensationalism I am talking about the little things. Whats it like to have a guy beating you out of a job? Whats it like to have a coworker make 10x as much as you? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7yo31?context=5)|An excellent idea. I like it a lot. I will consider that, and we'll discuss at a story meeting soon. Thank you.
[Do you ever read what they post on Deadspin and Kissing Suzy Kolber about you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7xwfx?context=5)|Deadspin, all the time. SKS, used to. Too depressing.
[Hi Peter! What would say is a prediction you got absolutely wrong? (i.e thinking Jamarcus Russell or Brady Quinn would be great\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7ynja?context=5)|I get 20 predictions a year horribly wrong. Hard to keep track of them all. I picked the Browns to get to the Super Bowl one year. Is that bad enough for you?
[Hi Peter, I was wondering if you could tell us who you think the loftiest player in the NFL is?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7y0p6?context=5)|I don't know what that means. I would if I could.
[Why did you steal that foul ball from that kid?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7y193?context=5)|Childhood issues I never got over, I guess.
[True or false (or MAYBE\)? Charles Tillman is one of the top 3 underrated defenders in the NFL.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7xvte?context=5)|Not anymore. Two years ago Peanut was.
[Aren't you just repeating Grantland?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7xtht?context=5)|No. But I understand the comparisons. Bill covers all sports and pop culture. We cover football. 
[Will you go visit Aaron Hernandez in prison? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7y0br?context=5)|I would if I could interview him. But seeing as I don't know him, I doubt that will happen.
[Do you like IPAs on the heavier malted side, or a lighter, more citrusy note?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7xug2?context=5)|I like white beers on the lighter sides, IPAs heavier.
[As online reporting grows and print slowly dies, what's roughly the current revenue split between SI's online and print side?  Related, outside of the SI network, what sports blogs do you read regularly? Deadspin, SBNation, Grantland?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7y3vh?context=5)|I know nothing about the revenue at SI. Sorry. Re the blogs, I read them all at various times. I love the job Florio does at PFT; he's not only become the wire service for the sport, but he's got a great, irreverent take I appreciate.
[Why did you go with TheMMQB?  I suspect that ""Kinglandia"" was already taken. There was a not-insubstantial portion of your readership who were really hoping for Kinglandia.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7xyxa?context=5)|There wasn't a lot of deep thinking that went into it. It was never going to be Kinglandia. We all agreed that the MMQB name was pretty recognizable, and just added ""The"" to it. 
[Where is Royal Baby on the depth chart? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7y1wf?context=5)|Fighting for a spot on special teams.
[Peter - big fan of SI, and have always had an admiration for the mag. With that said, the sports journalism (and everything journalism\) scene has changed rapidly, with sites like the hilarious Deadspin and terrible Bleacher Report popping up; where you you picture your new project landing?  EDIT:  Formatting.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7y3kk?context=5)|Thank you. I hope we provide a different look at pro football. Read Greg Bedard's story this week about the read-option, and going to Stanford to learn how to defend it from the defensive coordinator there, Derrick Mason. Read our long piece Thursday on what it's like to be cut. We have Jason Garrett's 35-minute pre-training-camp speech to him Cowboys up on the site right now. I hope we can find a niche in what I'd call experiential coverage.
[Peter, are you intimidated by the mustache of Shad Khan?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7yoiu?context=5)|I think it weighs more than I do.
[What's the more ""walkable"" city, New York or Boston? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7y9p2?context=5)|Boston. Can get anywhere in 30 minutes on foot.
[How do you think the Saints will rebound after all the drama and mess of last season?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7y3gl?context=5)|Quite well. Sean Payton is doing the right thing--treating the 2013 season as thought it's his first year with the Saints. He'll be tough on them. Biggest issue is whether Rob Ryan can find a pass-rush.
[How will Percy Harvin do in Seattle?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7xugy?context=5)|If he stays on the field for 16 games, which is always an issue with him, he'll be one of the most dangerous three or four weapons in football.
[, Thank you for doing this.  I'm sure you've met a lot of interesting public figures through your sports dealings. Could you list some of the people outside of sports that you never would have thought you'd have met?  Who were/are your favorites?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7xvae?context=5)|Richard Nixon. Saw him as an intern at the Cincinnati Enquirer in Hyden, Ky., when he was trying to make a public comeback from Watergate. And I met him the Giants' locker room in 1986. ""Wish I had your job,'' said Nixon. Said he always wanted to be a sports writer.
[If you weren't covering the NFL, what sport would you want to focus your column around?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7yns0?context=5)|Baseball. Big baseball fan. Have the MLB app. Watch a lot of games on the road.
[What is the motive behind the new MMQB website? Is it SI.com's attempt to capture the sincere sport follower like Grantland.com has? I like the simple format you have followed for a few years now. You should know that the attention span of an internet user is more comparable to a five year old.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7yc10?context=5)|The motive was pretty simple. My contract was up, I had some options, this is something I've wanted to do, I thought it could bring a different media voice to the game, and SI agreed. I am lucky they did.
[Who has been your favorite interview and why? (can be non-football related\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7y33l?context=5)|Probably the three days I spent in a bus riding from Cal to NYC with John Madden. Never thought I'd talk Steinbeck with John madden, or go smell wildflowers, but both happened.
[You are one of the voters of the NFL Hall of Fame. If you had the ability to add one player and remove one player from the Hall of Fame today, who would you choose?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7xy7n?context=5)|Mick Tingelhoff, center, Vikings. Starter every preseason, regular-season and post-season game for 18 years (I think it's 18) and played at a very high level. Out because he was shaky in a Super Bowl game once. He absolutely belongs. Re the ones who I'd want out, I don't do that. Don't think it's fair to the guys who got in for a voter to say, ""He doesn't deserve it.""
[What was it like getting to cover the Parcells-led Giants back in the '80s? Had to be one of the more interesting teams to cover, no?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7yegw?context=5)|Incredibly fortunate. The Giants were a good combination of great skill, really smart coaches, and some great stories.
[With the Pats, isnt it likely that Brady will make one of these younger underdeveloped WRs into a great target? Did it with guys like Branch, Welker and even Gronk/Hernandez.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7yokg?context=5)|Yes, or Shane Vereen will become the kind of weapon we haven't seen in him yet.
[Every single year we hear talk about an NFL team in London. Do you believe the mechanics/logistics of a European team would be workable in the current league set-up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7y4nz?context=5)|Workable? Yes. Practical and conducive to winning, no.
[Why has it taken you so long to answer a question?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7y0gw?context=5)|I am 56, after all.
[Thoughts on the Cardinals training camp being moved from Flagstaff? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7y4qg?context=5)|Don't like it at all. I love Flagstaff. Loved making that trip. Beautiful place.
[Who wins a Super Bowl first: the Chiefs or Eagles? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7y6eg?context=5)|Eagles.
[Hello Peter. Can the St. Louis Rams surprise everyone this year?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7y4uv?context=5)|Maybe it's just me, but I wouldn't be surprised to see them win 10 games. Les Snead and Jeff Fisher have taken a bunch of chances in team architecture, but if Tavon Austin plays well this year, 10 wins is defnitely possible.
[Do you listen to Howard Stern?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7yemv?context=5)|I have often in the past, but I don't have Sirius in my apartment. So not right now.
[Who will win the Jadeveon sweepstakes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7y0gv?context=5)|Now there's a good question. My guess, today, is Jacksonville.
[Who do you see having a better career? Ryan Tannehill or Andy Dalton.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7xw7t?context=5)|Tannehill. Dalton, at least for now, hasn't risen to the occasion.
[I want the Jets to play well &amp; win games this year.  What's the chances of that actually happening and how do they go about doing it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7y5gu?context=5)|If you told me they'd get C+ quarterback play, I'd say they'd win eight games. But I am dubious.
[Hi Peter, what do you think the Texans chances of going to the SuperBowl this year are?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7xvsl?context=5)|They're in the top six or eight in football right now. It all comes down to Schaub, I think.
[Peter - Nice MMQB t-shirt.  Gonna sell those?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7ybrq?context=5)|Not now. I only have a small supply.
[More football, less reality crap.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7y1r5?context=5)|Well, okay. I hear that a lot. All the time, really. When I tell people my average off-season column is about 4,000 words on football and maybe 600 words on non-football stuff, it never seems to help. Don't know why.
[Picture this: Johnny Football goes to the Titans and starts best feud ever in football against Andrew Luck and the Colts!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1itqoc/i_am_peter_king_sports_illustrateds_senior_nfl/cb7y40m?context=5)|He'll play in the NFL, and for a long time if he can keep his life in order.

[Has Wayne Brady choked you at any point? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb7vblf?context=5)|Why, is Wayne known to choke a bitch?

[I have to say, I've seen you on Improvaganza and the last Whose Line episode and I hope that you become one of the regulars. I'd be perfectly content with a cast of Heather, Ryan, Colin and Wayne.  Really I just wanted to tell you that I think you're great. But to throw a question in here. How does Colin Mochrie smell?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb7v9wi?context=5)|Like a follicle holocaust.
[How much fun was it to work on Drew Carey's improv-a-ganza and how different is it from Whose Line Is It Anyway?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb7vbpj?context=5)|Las Vegas crowds are drunker than studio crowds and thus the atmosphere was looser. The people in the WLIIA audience were screaming like banshees, and the atmosphere was HYPE.
 |I owe both shows in some way to Drew Carey. If he hadn't cast me in Improv-a-Ganza, I doubt I would have had the confidence I had in my Whose Line audition. It changes your life when someone believes in you. I probably would have thrown up if I'd known how much that one afternoon audition for IaG was going to mean.
[Favourite Whose Line performer? Be honest! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb7v9q6?context=5)|I think that big plastic tube did some phenomenal work in Prop Tag.
[Heather, always enjoyed your game journalism. I saw you mentioned to my friend Myles on Twitter that a piece you wrote on The Last of Us was the first thing you've done since Play. Any plans on getting back in to that field? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb7v652?context=5)|If I write about games, it's only going to be when one really strikes me. It was soul destroying to play terrible games to completion and then write an article about the few good things I could find in an otherwise terrible RPG or whatever.
 |I think the last two games I've written about were Dark Souls and The Last of Us. So I'll write about games as often as game companies can produce content of that caliber. 
[How did you get into improv and performing in the first place?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb7v5cv?context=5)|I went to a religious school that didn't have a theater program, but we did after an after-school club that would play in the cafeteria. The director, Ian Gerber, introduced us to short-form. I had watched Whose Line on TV, so I knew the basic idea of how the games worked. One night, Gerber took us to iO (then Improv Olympic) in Chicago, and introduced us to Long Form improv. Insanely enough, Miles Stroth was in the first show I saw at the theater, I believe in a group called Monster Island. After that, I kept coming back to the open set called The Jam, until the theater owner suggested I get into classes and start really young as a sort of experiment.

[Hey I really loved your performance on the series premiere on CW. What was it like being up there with the seasoned veterans. Were you intimidated at all or was everything hunky dory?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb7v8ey?context=5)|I'd actually performed with everyone except Wayne before; Drew Carey's Improv-a-Ganza was where I really had to deal with the shock of performing with improvisers that I grew up watching on TV. And we did DCIAG in front of a Vegas crowd, too, at the MGM. After that, Whose Line felt like a reunion of sorts.
 |Truth be told, the set itself was the most intimidating part of being on Whose Line. When you grow up watching SNL, and imagine yourself on the show, you imagine it'll be with the people you're watching on TV right then. Like Will Farrell or Jimmy Fallon or whatever. But when you get there, it's all strangers and the set looks a little different, because SNL changes all the time. With Whose Line, I ran onto the stage of my childhood, and the same people were sitting there. That was when it hit me. So insane. Really a dream come true.
 |Intimidating isn't the right word. It was awesome, in the moon-walking sense. I felt awed. 
[Hey Heather. I'm a big fan and think your performances with Miles Stroth at UCB are really great. I've been doing improv through high school and now through college.  My questions is what advice can you give someone like me who's about to be thrown into the real world and wants to continue doing improv professionally? Do you suggest UCB? iO? LA? Chicago?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb7v43n?context=5)|Well, if you want to make improv a part of your life, you have to live somewhere that has a robust community. Chicago, LA, and New York are home to big improv theatres and active indie groups; in any of those cities, you have the opportunity to perform every single night of the week. I'm a fan of both UCB and iO, but am theater agnostic -- I think the best work is done by people who've gone through every program available.
 |The thing about improv is there's no real way to be professional at it. You can do it all the time, but that doesn't make you a pro. Heck, none of the improv theaters pay the performers -- you have to do it because you like the work. You'll need a real job. I'd suggest monetizing your leisure time; that's part of why I decided to become a games journalist.

[Ultimately, which of the following do you think factors in most if you want to be successful in a creative field such as yours?  Level of passion? Constant hard work and action?  Luck?  Talent?  Networking and/or knowing the right people?  Nepotism?  Personality?  Likability?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb7x0ru?context=5)|HA!
 |What is success? Is it money? Is it fame?
 |I think success is how proud you are of a thing you've made. If you're proud of a thing, then a show for 10 people feels like a show for a million. If you're embarrassed, and a million people watch it, then you wish only one person had seen it.
 |As far as employment, I think you get work if you've worked on something you're proud of. Sure, it's easier if you have [Rich Parents](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nloyQuxpFTg) than if you have to [deliver groceries](http://www.yummy.com/) in your spare time -- who knows how much faster I could have gotten representation if I wasn't spending all my free moments delivering eggs and liquor to rich people in the hills. But I ended up in the same place as people who were born to be there. And that comes from one thing: Not Quitting.
 |Everyone I know who has made it has simply not quit. Eventually, they work. 
[""...success is how proud of a thing you've made.""  I have felt this definition of success, and it has been a source of happiness and purpose, which causes me to make more things to be proud of in order to feel that level of success again.  So let's say the definition of success in this case is happiness, which then leads to having the goal of earning a living making ""more things to be proud of"" because this means that most of the time in your life is devoted to what generates happiness and purpose.  But even if I'm proud of the things I make, this doesn't factor in if the things I make could suck, which likely means I will never make money from it and won't be able to devote all of my time to it.

[I'm majoring in broadcasting and am hoping to get into the TV part of it (not as an actor unless I turned out to be good at it, but in the production/writing side of it, do you have any advice on breaking into it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb7v7g4?context=5)|The best advice I have is probably kinda obvious: YouTube. Self-published material is the best business card you could have in the industry. And it doesn't go away. If you make something good on the internet, people will see it, and eventually that will lead to work. All phones can shoot in 1080p, so your stuff can look as good as you want it to, for a minimal initial investment. I've gotten a lot of work from my involvement with [The Midnight Show](http://www.youtube.com/theucbmidnightshow); some of the rooms I've sat in were with executives who didn't even know I wrote for SNL -- instead, I'm there because they saw a video we made. As soon as you can, start putting shit out there. Work attracts work.
[Thank you for the reply! I appreciate the advice, and with a follow-up question: what about getting people to watch my videos? I've assumed it is a lot about timing; getting a video up when that subject is hot, of course. Obviously a Harlem shake video now wouldn't do anything. But what about other ways? Are there certain websites you recommend posting to? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb7vzus?context=5)|Write something topical, or write parody to start. That way, the Big Advertising Agencies are doing your leg work for you. If your idea is clear, then your take on it will naturally come from your point of view. One of the first viral videos I wrote was Twilight With Cheeseburgers. I had no interest in Twilight, but watched it because I wanted to write about it. Subject yourself to stuff you're not interested in, but is popular, and it will be easier to defamiliarize. And post to YouTube and FunnyorDie. Just keep making them, one will pop.
[Are you still writing for SNL?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb85ohv?context=5)|No, I'm back in gorgeous Los Angeles, writing for FOX's ADHD. Which goes up against SNL starting NEXT SATURDAY NIGHT.
[Your Whose Line episode was amazing and I hope you come back if they do a second season. :\)  Also, do you prefer improv or standup?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb7v9da?context=5)|I prefer Improv, but more than improv I prefer sketch. The strength of both of them comes from live relationships on stage. Talking about a relationship isn't as active as seeing one unfold, which is why both sketch and improv appeal to me. And I'm not talking about romance when I say relationships; I'm talking about the relationship between a doctor and a dog he's about to put down, or two co-workers who are fighting off zombies, or a little girl who is smarter than an astronaut. That stuff is great, and you explore it best with sketch or improv.
[Now for the question: What advice can you give to an amateur improver?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb7v9da?context=5)|My advice would be: Move to a big city, start taking classes at as many theaters as you can afford (join internships to get free classes if need be), and perform perform perform. The best work is done by the people who are working all the time. Meaning, it's more likely that a great scene will happen if someone is doing 100 scenes a week than if that person is only doing one scene a week. So play at every theater, even the less popular ones. Do open-improv sets, like The Jam. Just keep performing!
[G'day from Australia, and thanks for doing the AMA! Just a couple of questions, out of curiosity.

I write almost all of the shorts there, like [Scientifically Accurate Spider-Man](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnE3uyj9Grg) -- and do a bunch of the voices and singing, too. The reason I plug this isn't just because my bosses would want me to, but because I believe that good games journalism means really playing a game to completion, digesting it, and trying to figure out how it fits into the larger body of work of the developer as well as the industry. It's not something you can do on the side if you're going to do it professionally. I don't have the time I'd want to dedicate to games if I was to work with them again.

[Can you give us a postmortem on the epic, record-breaking, sure-to-be-legendary Heather and Miles run at the UCB LA Cagematch? How did you feel going through that year? How do you feel about it now, a few months after it ended? What did you take away from it? Any thoughts.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb7xk5s?context=5)|For those not from Los Angeles, the Cagematch is a competitive improv show where two teams do twenty minutes and the audience votes one of the shows back for the next week. I did a two man show with Miles Stroth that lasted 50 weeks, which with breaks was more than a year of shows.
 |Here's the thing: the shows themselves are some of the best improv work I've ever been a part of. I love performing with Miles and found some real moments of serendipity, responsibility, and mirth in those shows.
 |But there was some real ugly shit that happened around the periphery of those nights, from the kinds of things I heard about the theater wanting us gone, to links people would send me of blogs that were trashing the shows, to formerly respected friends calling our work shallow or pandering -- honestly, we went into each night just wanting to perform with each other. That's it.
 |Miles and I were trying to do a show in that moment. We weren't making Facebook events and trying to pack the house -- hell, Miles school had 25% of the students it has now when we started, so it wasn't an audience full of his students, because they didn't exist yet. But we were accused of fraud and all sorts of weird shit. It was theatre drama at its worst. And considering that Miles and I did the exact same show for one or two person houses at another theater, the evidence wasn't there that we were trying to be dishonest. I work with Miles because of the work. Cagematch was amazing, but it would be amazing to have anywhere to perform with Miles.
 |I guess it's a side effect of the very concept of competition that will bring out spite in people you knew and loved, but I was grossly shocked by how quickly the community devolved as a result of us showing up to do twenty minutes of improv.
 |The people who were there out of love and joy have become some of my trusted friends. Months later, that sticks with me. But so does the alacrity with which the ugliness came out.
 |EDIT: I loved it. To be clear, it's going to be one of the things that flashes before my eyes if I'm ever dying.
[Hi Heather!

Immortal Dog feels like a sketch from the world of Robocop. Like, it's what a sketch comedy show in Neo Detroit would be. So, thank you. Thank you very much.
 |I also like that so many of my friends french kissed animals because I wrote it down on a piece of paper. That's like the sketch version of the [Stanford Prison Experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment).
[What is the best improv class or workshop you have ever taken? and Why? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb7va8k?context=5)|I don't think any one improv class has been ""the best,"" because if a teacher is good, they're probably very different from everyone else. Improv is basically one person's point of view on how to attack a void. I've learned a lot from different teachers, but the ones that gave me the most interesting things to work with were the ones that had the most specific points of view.
 |JD Walsh at Ultimate Improv had some very interesting ideas and workshops, which were often based on how frustrating he found improv to be; he wanted the work to be faster, more fearless, and without the awkward ""where-are-we-whats-going-on"" moments that plague the beginning of scenes.
 |Miles Stroth taught me one class a million years ago that stuck with me, which was exceptionally mathematical.
 |Pep Rosenfeld at Boom Chicago was about the showmanship of an improv scene, and how to present yourself in the best possible light; I also had a week of workshops with Tom Gianas there, and that was enlightening. Gianas taught us about the piece, as opposed to the individual moments.
 |I really liked learning from Jerris Donnovan, who directed a show I was in for years and loved pulling emotional play out of her performers.
 |And then there was the weird two years I spent in the cult of Chris Barnes, who teaches a RADICALLY different version of improv based on the enneagram.
 |All of the best classes came from anchored points of view. A great teacher has a single idea on how improv works, and they give you that tool.
[You do so much work! Do you have a system for getting it all done? Do you wake up early in the morning? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb7wxjc?context=5)|I don't wake up early! And the system is: every minute, you can work. When it's time to relax, and I'm watching VICE or something, I keep a Google Doc open to write down sketch ideas inspired by what I'm watching. If I'm listening to the radio, or playing a video game, it's the same. If I hear something funny said in a deathmatch, I'll write it down. It's not really a lot of work at once; it's work spread out over every minute. Much easier that way. This last hour and forty five minutes is probably the least I've worked in weeks, because I can't type these answers and write other stuff at the same time.

And that's not the political answer, either. What I learn from Ryan, Colin, and Wayne is totally different from what I've learned from Miles Stroth or the things I take away from Last Day of School (my weekly LA show). I learned things with my college team that I haven't replaced, and I learned things from people like Colton Dunn, Jordan Peele, and Jim Woods (who is working as a sort of director at Boom Chicago in Amsterdam) that I couldn't get from anyone else.
 |Everyone improvises differently, so I feel like you have to evolve every time you get on stage. To say someone is the best implies that everyone is improvising the same way, and that one man or woman is better at it than everyone else. It's just not true.

Thank you for doing this AMA — Like you said in an earlier answer: ""Improv is basically one person's point of view on how to attack a void."" It's the best explanation of improv teaching I've heard.  Thing is, life is full of voids if you think about it — you're always venturing into the unknown. Do you feel that your improv skill set has helped you outside of performing and writing, in personal or other professional situations? If so, do you have any anecdotes you could tell us about how your improv skills helped in an unexpected or unlikely situation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb82lvm?context=5)|Yes. My first paid gig as a video-game journalist came from basically playing the character of a video-game journalist. I got into E3 because of pieces I wrote for The Gamer's Quarter, and went with one goal: writing for Edge magazine. Knowing that my last name is Campbell, and that one of the editors of Edge was named Campbell, I walked into the Edge on-site office and played the character of someone who should be there.
 |I came back at three and had an appointment because of the way I said my name, and the way I acted -- like I was supposed to be there. Colin sat down with me, confused; he asked, ""What was this meeting about?"" Again, improvising, I said, ""You were meeting with me to hire me as a writer."" Which is what I would say in a scene if I was playing the plucky young journalist.  Colin realized what was up and looked frustrated. So I handed him my portfolio and said, ""If you read this, I guarantee you'll give me a job. I promise, because it's that good.""  I didn't hear anything for a while, and then they called me and asked me to be a Los Angeles correspondent. As soon as I wrote a single article for Edge, I immediately set a meeting with Play Magazine. And that's the story of how I improvised my way from grocery delivery into Games Journalism. It starts with the work: If my portfolio was empty, that would have been the end of it. But I had something to show once I got in the meeting.
 |""Can you tell him Heather stopped by? Heather *Campbell*.""
[What was the hardest part of improv to get a handle on? i.e. justifying your ideas, confidence in your moves, commitment to a character?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ith8p/i_am_whose_line_is_it_anyway_improviser_and_tv/cb7vgws?context=5)|The most basic element of improv is commitment. Commitment to the reality of a world, an idea, or a character. Nothing kills a scene faster than someone who is winking to the audience, or ""performing"" a scene as opposed to being **in** a place or **being** a person. Justification comes naturally if you're committed, because you're just saying what the person would say if they were in that position. And you don't have to have any confidence if you're committed; you're not doing anything, the person you've become is making those choices. If you can commit completely, improv happens on its own. Improv is a random encounter, commitment is the Limit Break.

1itiss,5,2013-07-22,I'm really starting to hate this. [rant?],TotalJester,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1itiss/im_really_starting_to_hate_this_rant/,"Just some background, I'm sixteen and I've been having a lot of trouble with school the past few years, especially after hitting high school. Got diagnosed with ADHD (inattentive) a couple of months ago right as school was letting out, and recently I upped my dosage from 27mg to 36mg because it was wearing off too fast.

At first, I was actually really glad to get diagnosed. I finally had a real reason for the sudden drop in my academic performance other than sheer laziness, and I was going to be medicated, which was even better, since I felt like I could finally fix it. And for a while after I started taking the meds (Concerta), I really did feel better and felt like my future was going to be brighter now that I had something to help me.

But the side effects are fucking killing me. Every day, as soon as the meds wear off in the afternoon/evening, I get so pissy and reclusive that I can't even stand sitting down to dinner with my family or talking to my friends. And when the meds are active, I'm boring, I get headaches, and I can't even drive normally because I constantly zone out and look over minor details that I was able to take in before.

But it's even worse when I DON'T take the meds. Before I started up on my prescription, I was lazy and couldn't focus, sure, but I was friendly, mostly happy aside from episodes of severe depression, and I could socialize without slowly going insane. But now, whenever I don't take my meds, I feel like a completely different person, and not in a good way. For example, this weekend was my first break in three weeks (work's a bitch), so I thought, hey, I don't need to take my meds, I can finally relax. But over the course of the weekend, I started having really abnormal surges of anger. Little things ticked me off so bad that I would go upstairs and throw stuff around just to vent. I stuck to cardboard boxes and unbreakable things like that, but another day and I feel like I would've really started causing some damage, considering how many times I had to physically restrain myself from punching a hole in the wall. I even managed to get into a fight with my dad (who also has ADHD) simply because I was frustrated that my internship hasn't been going the way I hoped it would. I never fight with my dad.

I hate this. I hate this so fucking much. I hate that I have to take a goddamn pill just to feel normal now. I hate that without a fucking pill I'm intolerable and lose my mind, and with it I'm dull and perpetually tired. Before I got this fucking diagnosis I was fun, I was energetic, and even though I did terribly in school I was at least happy. But now I'm depressed half the time and feel like I'm going crazy whenever I'm not taking my medicine. I actually had a bit of a freakout a month or two ago when I was first starting to get adjusted to my meds, when I didn't take them first thing in the morning and went for a run instead. I ended up three miles away from home in the middle of some neighborhood, storming up and down the street just about ready to attack the first pedestrian I saw. Took my mom a solid fifteen minutes to find me after I called her, and I'm afraid that if I was left alone for much longer I could've done something really bad. I'm scared that something like that will happen again.

How do you guys deal with this sort of thing? Or am I the only one who reacts like this? Should I talk to my doctor about getting a new prescription? Does it get any better after a while? The last thing I want to do is go back to school in a month and freak out there where everyone can see me. But I don't know if there's enough time at this point for me to get adjusted enough that I can be normal on and off of my meds.

Edit: Forgot to mention this, but another thing I'm really hating is that my mom keeps blaming my mood swings and all that shit on my ADHD. I mean, she's probably right, but I still resent that it feels like she's basing all of my behavior on this stupid disorder. Maybe it's just me, but it sometimes feels like my entire identity is being based on one problem in my head, and that just makes me angrier."
1itfx5,1,2013-07-22,Applied for a gov't IT job and got a rejection email for having the wrong TYPE of experience... should I submit a written request to be re-evaluated?,jshrlzwrld02,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1itfx5/applied_for_a_govt_it_job_and_got_a_rejection/,"I applied for this job some time ago and just today got this email saying that I was rejected because I have the ""Incorrect TYPE of Experience.""

&gt; EXPERIENCE REQUIRED FOR LEVEL 1: Two years of full-time or equivalent part-time paid experience installing, supporting and troubleshooting computer hardware, software and/or network connectivity. 

&gt; EXPERIENCE REQUIRED FOR LEVEL 2: Four years as described above. 

The email states that if I don't believe my qualifications have been correctly evaluated that I have fifteen days to submit a written request to request a review. I realize that several months ago when I applied for these positions that I was not prepared as far as the resume department and had a couple different resumes and only changed my education experience to tailor each resume to the position.

The above being said, I have more than two years of practical experience that I am quite sure would qualify me for government IT work. I did a 480 hour internship at a major ski resort on the east coast that had me performing the IT duties like answering the help-desk line, switching out hardware in busted PCs, and setting up networking and A/V stuff for big conference groups.

I've also built my own PCs several times since high school, set up my own home networks (printers, wifi, etc), troubleshooting the IT stuff for my mothers family businesses since 2004, and built custom PCs and cluster PCs during my networking classes in college including a machine submerged in mineral oil and a 5-node cluster PC also submerged in mineral oil for cooling.

So I'm wondering if I should bother requesting a review and maybe sending them an updated resume that showcases these experiences? Or at this point would it just seem like I was fabricating experience? I am more than confident that I could perform the work required, maybe needing a little bit of training with certain things, but for the most part I would be okay. I am beyond desperate for a real job right now and if there is a chance that I could land this I would be ecstatic."

Education

Work Experience (internships)

Personal Projects

Relevant Skills and Qualifications (which is  programming languages, dev. tools and processes etc.)

Awards and Leadership Experience

Activities and Interests




This is currently the order in which I list them on my resume, but I have seen some people advising that you should put Work Experience first and Education last.  I know that is definitely true for established professionals, but is that true for new grads as well?  I feel like as a new grad my school and GPA are a bit more relevant now then they will be twenty years down the line.


Also, should I move the Relevant Skills and Qualifications section to the top?  I don't know how important knowledge of different languages is for a new grad.

My name is Nathan, and I'm a senior at UCLA. My major is Linguistics and Computer Science (yes, that's one major).

I'm very passionate about programming. Outside of school projects, I'm currently working on a website coded in Python using Django. I am new to programming, but I would approach a programming internship with great zeal.

From July to December of the past three years, I worked as a freelancer for a company that produces multiple-choice tests and information packets. These materials were then used by students in preparation for an academic competition at the high school level. I excel at proofreading and other types of writing as well.

I'm also skilled as a tutor/teacher. I got my first paid tutoring job in sixth grade for math, and I still enjoy teaching, especially math, science, and writing. Right now I'm part of a UCLA student group that travels every week to schools in the area, where we help students conduct fun experiments to further their scientific knowledge.

I just graduated from Comp Engg and am applying to colleges in the US and Netherlands for my Masters in CS (Fall 14). My academics are strong, and I have done 2 internships, but they weren't 100% technical. The colleges I'm applying to are among the top 50's in the US, and one of the top 3 in Netherlands.

Now my questions- will it be easy for me to find a job there after graduating, assuming I keep up my grades? I know CS grads have loads of opportunities available to them, does this ring true for citizens of other countries? I'm a Sri Lankan national.

Are there certain states/cities that are better suited for CS students (California, New York, Washington etc)?

I am applying to those 2 countries as I believe they offer more scope for knowledge, research and career growth compared to my own country. Additionally, US education is a lot more expensive and I'd hate to be stuck with a student loan and no job prospects on graduating. Any advice is welcome.

Thanks!"

I'm at a rising senior at a top 3 cs university.  I'm interning for one of the big-name companies (Google/FB/MS/Amazon/Apple/etc) this summer and will be considering full-time options for after graduation soon. The only reason I mention this is that I'm curious if these facts make any difference to the negotiation potential.

1. Is it possible/realistic to negotiate starting salaries at the larger companies (MS/Amazon/Google)?

2. What if I my internship goes well and the company extends a full-time offer, would there be more room for negotiation then?

3. Is the situation any different for medium-size companies like FB/LinkedIn?

4. I'm assuming there is often more leeway for negotiation at small companies, but one also shouldn't necessarily expect the higher salary offers that the big names offer right off the bat anyway, right?

Unrelated Bonus: In terms of big-name companies, I know salaries tend to be higher by x% in Silicon Valley vs. Seattle because of cost of living, but with those higher salaries taken into consideration, which area is the better deal financially in your opinion?

I took AP CS (Java) and I went to a summer camp on computer science. I've been into computers all my life but I don't know what else. I don't know how to use Linux, I don't know anything other than Java, I don't hack anything in my free time... I'm just a good student who feels like her 4.0 is nothing. 

So I don't know anything more. I scored an interview at Microsoft but I didn't get the internship. Another internship passed me at Caradigm (another girl at my school got it). I didn't apply, thinking I needed to teach myself SQL... then the listing disappeared.

People think I'm on the right track, but I'm just not far enough.

She comes over and talks to me at the office and I do the same with her.  If I don't go over to her by lunch time she will call me out on it.  The other day we were talking and she was telling me how she doesn't have many friends here and never does anything on the weekends.

Was that a signal that I should have taken that she wanted to hang out with me?  Should I have pursued it?  How exactly would I ask her to hangout and maybe see if this can become a relationship?

Is any of this even a good idea considering the work situation?  I mean, I'm an intern and she's a full time employee.  If she says no and I got completely mixed signals, then this could be a real awkward experience and this job never works out.  If she says yes and we somehow start dating, then that could be a conflict of interest at work.  I'm just an intern though.  Would she even go for me?

[Hey sounds like a fantastic way to get rid of your debt. What type of issues do you repair/what are your limitations? Do you offer any warranty on the work? Finally, what is your screening process for employees? Work that puts people near personal data can be risky. Keep up the great work. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8mvof?context=5)|We repair absolutely everything that can be repaired. Believe it or not, even iPhones that have been run over (a surprisingly common occurrence) can be fixed most of the time. The biggest permanent killer is liquid damage where the phone had never been dried out.
 |We offer a 30 day warranty against defects with any repair.
 |As far as screening, I've only hired friends so far who I really trust. It's been a blast training them. As for the future when I hire non-friends, I will have to screen because data safety is super important and I think it isn't emphasized enough these days.

[How did you learn to fix the phones?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8nc4u?context=5)|Really the only way there is, taking one apart and putting it back together over and over. It all started when I was in high school and somebody gave me a broken iPod!  There's plenty of tutorials online, but many of them are TERRIBLE and skip crucial steps. However if you watch lots of them and have the phone in front of you, you'll get the hang of it.
[Very cool. To follow that up, can most of the phones be fixed without replacing parts, or do you have to find replacement parts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8pp0l?context=5)|I can usually fix buttons without replacing parts, but I need to find replacement parts for cracked screens and such. Finding reliable parts is terrible, by far the hardest part of the job. I have to stay up at like 3am to talk to suppliers in China who know English at a pre-school level. I got a Christmas card sent to me from a supplier in June.
[Nods- That makes sense. Have you ever tried buying broken phones online or anything for salvage?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8q7x3?context=5)|Yep, that's the plan with SellMyOldTech.com! The goal is to make it the easiest way to get money for old or broken devices by shipping pre-paid boxes with return labels. Buying phones on eBay to fix can be costly and unreliable since people lie a lot and there isn't much protection for people buying broken things.
[What would people lie about re: a broken device? Just wondering.  Any idea how hard a broken DSLR would be to fix, in general?

As far as mistakes, the biggest was trusting other people's opinions. People will always try to discourage you. I had so much self-doubt that slowed me down and should not have been there. You're not gonna accomplish anything until you believe that you can.
 |Also have receipts for selling things. Before I had receipts this one evil girl sold me a phone and then told me she was reporting it stolen so she could pay her sorority fees. I had to give it back and take a $100 hit because she her lawyer dad threatened to sue me and I would not have had time to deal with it.
[How do you make a profit? I was under the impression that the screens are quite expensive.

[What kind of prices did you charge? Did you experiment with pricing as your reputation increased or stay at a fixed cost the whole way through? How did you reach these prices?  Interesting story man!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8ok1g?context=5)|Thanks :D I made sure to have the absolute lowest prices around, I could afford to since the business model is kids on bikes picking up/dropping off the phones instead of a store location. Experimented with changing prices for a week, but realized business is best when it's a no-brainer, aka being the cheapest with genuine parts.
[This is totally awesome, congratulations! Do you think society (American society, college, what have you\) is changing to encourage this kind of behavior? Did you run into a lot of bullshit trying to do things unconventionally?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8qn6k?context=5)|Thank you! I do not think the government encourages this kind of behavior. The amount I need to pay in permits and taxes is INSANE.  Nor did my college initially. When I applied to the business school I had already repaired hundreds of iPhones and was making good money, yet the admissions people did not care AT ALL. It's all about GPA when you're in college. And it's hard to get straight A's when you're working all the time, so it's a double-edged sword. But I think society encourages small businesses. If I could thank anyone it would be my customers aka society, the people who trusted and supported me enough to make this happen. They helped pay my tuition and there's nothing I've ever been more grateful for.
[What kinds of permits do you need?  Whom do you pay taxes to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb963zd?context=5)|Postal service permits, pay taxes to the state and federal government.
[Can you explain the postal permit? Why do you need it and what does it allow you to do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb9bzbx?context=5)|It's a $835 permit that allows me to send a pre-paid label. It was HELL to acquire, took over a month to get. It's new so most post offices still don't know what it is.
[So this permit allows you to send prepaid labels all over the US and internationally?  Is this $985 cost in addition to the cost of paying the postage for the labels?  I don't understand why they make you pay for a permit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb9j6qf?context=5)|Only US. It's actually $835, brain fart on my end, still super expensive though. It doesn't cover postage, it's just so you can send out return labels. Technically you can't without it since USPS requires you declare the day you ship something before you ship it. That won't work if you send someone a label in the mail.
[So what's the best way to dry out a wet phone?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8or5d?context=5)|NOT RICE.  It has to be taken apart and submerged in alcohol immediately, then air dried. I cannot tell you how many people bring me phones they have had in rice for days, and then the inside is still soaking wet and corroded/destroyed. Especially bad when it is a sugary drink. Believe it or not if you powered off an iPhone, dropped it in water, then opened/dried it within an hour, it'll probably be fine and work for years to come. But don't try it haha.
[Would something like vodka or Everclear work in a pinch, or would you recommend sticking to a specific type (i.e. rubbing\) alcohol?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8qw7v?context=5)|RUBBING ALCOHOL! I should've clarified haha, do not use the kind that makes you drunk. I suppose it's kind of ironic most phones liquid damaged are beer/alcohol related, but it takes alcohol to fix them!
[What parts should be submerged? All?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb9465k?context=5)|I'd say everything but the screen, battery, and vibrator (lol yes they call it that)
[So where did you go to school and what was the value of the tuition? Did you have any scholarships, grants, etc.?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8oev6?context=5)|I go to University of Maryland. The only thing from classes that helped me was knowing basic math to make the algorithms on my site for pricing iPhones. Almost all other classes did not help at all. Intro marketing and Comm classes were the dumbest things I've ever seen.
 |UMD recently admitted me to their entrepreneurship program (it isn't a major, it's like extracurricular-ish) and it actually looks like it will be a great resource! UMD also published me in their official university publication for staff/alum, it was really cool to fix my professor's phones!

 |Hammer that into your head. I was devastated when I was rejected from my campus' business school. I applied for a business development program on campus, was rejected from that too and was even more depressed. I almost gave up entirely on business because nobody believed in me. Even my parents looked at me like I was nuts when I said I wanted to start one. So glad I did not give up, because now I have the highest grossing UMD student-run business of all time.
 |There wasn't much planning starting out, but when it started to take off it took A LOT of planning. It got to the point I was spending more time talking to customers and suppliers than fixing phones. Unfortunately I've had to pull all nighters working and then go to class many times.

[Thanks! I always undercut the competition and I tell my customers I'll price match and beat by 15%. My only issue is that I don't have any money right now to buy a stock of parts, that is making it harder to do business.

And they don't advertise they use counterfeits, so people will demand you match them because they don't understand. Only price match legitimate businesses.
[Did you ever mess up a customers phone? If so, what did you do to rectify it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8ra37?context=5)|One had a motherboard that started giving errors after a screen repair because it was liquid damaged and unplugging the connectors was enough to destroy it. I had to buy him a new iPhone the next day, it would have happened to whoever opened that phone, but it was my responsibility so I made right on it. Kinda sucked but it only happened once.
[If you encountered a customer whose phone had similar damage (i.e. whoever opens it to fix it is gonna be the one who breaks it,\) what would you do? Would you try to fix it anyway?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb966jf?context=5)|There's really know way to know how bad the inside of a phone is until it's opened.

[Any ideas of expanding your business after you graduate? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8njhl?context=5)|Yep! That is what the plan for SellMyOldTech.com is. If I expand just doing repairs to other campuses, I'd be afraid of hiring someone far away to do something that involves lots of room for error. So this way I can have the devices directly mailed to me and people don't need to wait to go without their phones, since they are old phones. Then we can do repairs all day!
[Well done, sounds like you things worked out pretty well for you! But did this not take up a lot of your time?

It took up ALOT of time, but you'll adapt to using a calendar religiously. I was never an organized person but it forced me to be. It's not hard to spare a few hours on friday and saturday night if you stick to a calendar. But there were many times I pulled all nighters fixing phones/doing management work and had to go to classes the next day.

Some open easy, but then there's the first gen iPhone, good luck opening that without leaving a mark. It would be hard to pry that sucker open even with a machete.
[Thanks for the reply!  Do you get your replacement parts off Ebay, or somewhere else?  Do people ever say that it's official but it turns into a cheap knockoff?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb8tn0r?context=5)|I get them from China. A lot of people say their stuff is official but it is cheap knockoffs. I may have to start offering the choice between knock offs and genuine parts because as someone using only genuine parts my price can't compete with people using knockoffs, and the people using knock-offs don't advertise they are knockoffs. A real iPhone 4S screen is 960x480 and many knockoffs are 480x320. It's dumb but most customers don't even care and aren't willing to pay more for a genuine ones, which is why unfortunately I must offer both.
[Do knockoffs usually break more often than official parts, or are they just generally not as good?  Also, do you go through a specific website or just pick and choose parts?  I wanted to fix a 2nd gen touch, but finding a replacement 8gb hard drive is impossible.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb99n4z?context=5)|Knockoffs break far more than original parts, there is actually no such thing as a 2nd gen iPod Touch hard drive.
[Thanks! So if the storage device on the 2nd gen isn't working, would I just replace the entire logic board?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb9c7n8?context=5)|That would work, but nobody ever does that because the logic board is the only thing in that device worth anything, so the cost of the board would be more than the cost of the device.

[ I'll try it at home. But a question before I go drenching my connector in alcohol. How should I do it so that the alcohol doesn't get to deep into the phone and mess other parts up? And then how do I dry the alcohol out after soaking?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iw7bh/im_a_college_student_who_paid_my_entire_4year/cb9lz4w?context=5)|Turn off the phone and use a toothbrush on the connector. I'd use canned air to dry it out. Try not to use too much alcohol, just enough to clean the connector. And if you're feeling brave, you can use an exacto knife to try to scrape grunge off the contacts.
[I've heard that if you have someone that isn't where you bought your ipod touch/phone from to fix your screen you lose your warranty.

As far as the website, I did 99% of it myself. Had to learn a little CSS, html, etc but there were also plugins that made it a bit easier. As far as the legal stuff, since law is based on precedent I can just use the legal section that all the other repair sites use. I'm no legal expert but I then ran it by one of the UMD legal advisors and they said it looked good. Currently a sole proprietor until my LLC form goes through.
 |The biggest legal worry I have is people trading in stolen phones, which I am using CheckMEND for (that is the gold standard currently). No stolen phones yet, but if one ever does come up as stolen, the customer won't get their money and it will either be returned to them or given to authorities, as per our legal section.

I don't really encourage people to fix their phones themselves, a lot of people bring me iPhones they tried to repair and have permanently damaged things. Or they tear cables, lose screws, etc. and it makes my job a lot harder. I suppose I wouldn't know if they have repaired them successfully though because they wouldn't come to me.

1iwucz,9,2013-07-23,"Struggling with School, can't motivate myself, medicine I've recently started taking is making things worse.",[deleted],ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1iwucz/struggling_with_school_cant_motivate_myself/,"Hey, r/ADHD. First post here after lurking the subreddit for a while. I need help, bad.

A little history:
I was diagnosed with ADHD-C when I was very, very young. Sometime during the 2nd or 3rd grade. I was immediately put on ritalin, and jumped back and forth between ritalin and adderall for several years until, between 9th and 10th grade, I had a major surgery on my back for scoliosis. I decided to take the rehab time to go off my meds and learn to be a productive human being without them. And it worked pretty well. High school rolls around and while it's a struggle at first I slowly managed to learn to harness all this nervous energy and bring my grades up (nothing amazing, mostly B's.). Then I take on a two-year internship, during which I start to develop some bad habits. Near the end of the two years I would find myself without any work to do and would spend hours browsing the internet and generally slacking off, and as a result got in the habit of doing this whenever I actually had real work to do. Internship ends, and I sign up for college. Just one class for now, to get the hang of things. During this time I had been taking an antibiotic to keep some acne I had around the still-sensitive scars on my back under control. Deciding it was time to start taking something to clear things up once and for all, I get a prescription for Isotretinoin(Accutane). Those of you who know about this stuff probably know, it's pretty hardcore. It has some serious side effects, and needs to be taken every single day for several months. Well, one of the side effects is 'Difficulty maintaining focus and concentrating'. Great thing for someone with ADHD, right?

It's been a few months, and I'm halfway through my Accutane treatments. I thought I could tough it out and just deal with it, but it's gotten to the point where I am constantly missing class because I don't have any of the homework done. I've started taking some vitamins that I've heard help with ADHD, and it is helping, but it's not enough. On top of that, when I finally manage to focus, I don't have the motivation to do anything with the focus. I'm at my wits end. I don't want to stop taking the Accutane when I'm so close to being done with it, but I don't want to fail this class. Has anyone who has been in this sort of situation give me some kind of advice to take control again?

**Tl;DR - Haven't been medicated for a long time. Was doing well until I took a drug for some painful acne that is making it harder to focus. Don't want to go off of it but I'm failing my college class.**"

We're trying to consolidate into one single WIKI engine and I'm struggling trying to get the business to understand the importance of consolidating this information. 

I've spent a few days trying to script the migration but the biggest WIKI is ancient and uses rich text and it's beyond my skill level to script it. The Dev department spent some time trying to script it as well and lost interest/backing after a few man days. We've determined that it will be easier/cheaper just to hire some intern style folks to do it manually. It's only going to cost like $3k so we're not talking huge money here. 

Frustrated with trying to find info, I spent a week setting up Sharepoint 2013 to crawl and index all of the intranet sources/wikis. This universal search engine is working pretty well but I see it as just a crutch to aid during the migration. People seem to be happy with the search engine and stopped complaining about WIKIs so I'm afraid I shot myself in the foot :-)

How do you guys gain support for consolidating knowledge into a single location? Am I just crazy and nobody cares? What tips do you guys have for calculating ROI on these things?"
1ivars,2,2013-07-23,"In over my head, not sure if this is the right place?",help_me_macro,excel,https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/1ivars/in_over_my_head_not_sure_if_this_is_the_right/,"Gonna preface this by saying I've never used excel before except for basic physics labs and whatnot and have 0 macro/vba experience whatsoever (although I do code in Python/VB6/Java/Scheme).  

First time posting here because I'm completely lost and need some help.  Basically I'm in the middle of an internship in the corporate division of a F500 and I've been handed the task of creating an excel macro to graph their sales forecasting.  Not sure if that made any sense but here's a basic run-down of what I (think) I'm doing for the few weeks left:

I am given a huge spreadsheet of data in excel (2007 if it matters).  This spreadsheet has about 55 columns and a little over 500 rows.  It is all given in a pivot table such that I can sort the data according to about 20 different criteria such as model #, customer, plant location, etc. and I have to make an area graph of the data sorted by each category (so one using model #, another using customer, etc).  What I've done for the first one is basically sort the ""supplier"" column alphabetically, and use the subtotal function.  Then I click the ""2"" on the top left corner so that it shows only the subtotal rows along with each row being ""[supplier] subtotal"".  This is where I encounter my first problem.  

Since I'm only adding the totals for certain columns (i.e.monthly revenue) and not for other columns (i.e. customer name and monthly volume) how can I hide all the ""empty"" columns so that I can just get one neat table of whatever data I'm sorting by on the left and subtotal for monthly revenue of each row?  What happens right now is that there is a ""monthly volume"" column between each ""monthly revenue"" column and I was wondering if there was a way I could get rid of that so I could just copy and paste all the monthly revenue at once into another sheet.  

Another question (maybe way out of my league) is how to completely automate this process for the 20 other columns.  How I have it planned in my head (never really used excel macros before) is that I would select/highlight one column, run the macro, and a sheet would show up with the graph of the data organized according to the data sorted in that column.  

Would appreciate any help or pointers in the right direction.  Thank you!"

I still wont use names to respect privacy, but I have witnessed a stimulant psychosis (we believe) episode that still freaks me out now 3 years later.
I was studying abroad in Switzerland and sharing a room with 3 other Americans from my program. There were about 25 of us total in the apartment complex that lived and took classes together. One of my roommates, we'll call him Dave, was an absolutely normal kid. Being 20 years old in a foreign country we did our fare share of drinking and messed around with some adderrall, but nothing harder than that. Most of our classes didnt start till around 7pm so kids could intern at NGO's (nongovernmental organizations) in Switzerland. One particular night we all sat down for an economics class. Dave seemed to be sweating profusely. As the professor went on, dave repeatedly interupted him with profound statements on faith, humanity and god. We all thought he was messing around until it got to a very awkward point. He was asked to leave. At some point we learned that that day while at his internship, dave had to be escorted out by security because he looked up ""jesus"" in their international database and could not find him, so he freaked out asking all the employees where he could find jesus. After being kicked out, dave continued this in the streets of switzerland, asking folks where he could find jesus. Someone, hoping to help, pointed him to a church where dave took a bible (not written in english) and he brought it back with him. The 2 of us in the class that lived with dave, myself and another, left when he got kicked out having known something was up. We walked back to our apartment and got him to calmly tell us the story about work, but in the sense that he was still looking for jesus, still obviously crazy. As the night continued we spoke with our advisors and pushed for the need to call an ambulance. The program didnt call, they wanted to wait out the situation, unaware of how seriously ill Dave was. My roommate and I stayed in our room with Dave, terrified as he preached about jesus. We attempted to sleep but were awoken by loud yelling and vomit. Dave was projecticle vomiting all over the room from his bed. My roommate and i sprang to action. He ran to wake the advisor telling him we HAD to call for an ambulance. Meanwhile I was left alone to try and calm Dave. He had run into the hallway yelling, ""I am God"" and preaching the need for everyone to forgive, yelling at the top of his lungs in the middle of the night, vomit still dripping from his mouth and his eyes wide open, dilated pupils staring me in the face. Its an image that I still cant get out of my head no matter how much i try to repress it. My roommate and the advisor come back and we are able to role play with Dave long enough to keep him calmed down. We ask him questions about faith etc. while we await the ambulance. When the paramedics arive we brace for an altercation but Dave seemed to understand he was sick. He went willingly, with a confused grin on his face, knowing something was wrong, but still believing he was god. He even told the paramedics he was god and that he would be fine.
Fast forward, dave stayed in the hospital for several days, i believe it started one morning and lasted between 2.5 -3 days. We had initially hoped it to be a small issue but it tool several days for him to come back to earth so to speak. He had come back to the apartment to apologize and say goodbye to us, the program was kicking him out, having suffered the embarassment of the issue at the NGO. They were really awful with the whole situation and it really made it weirder and worse for everyone. I havent spoken to dave or even about dave since he left. It was just so surreal at the time that I just burried it, but I think about it every few months, and while the sequence of events has gotten a little fuzzy, ill never forget that moment in the hallway. Just me and him, wide-eyed, yelling to me he that he was god."

I have been forced to take medical withdrawal from university four  times, for four semesters. In addition, I have not received credit in  over two years.

I am considering switching to an online degree program in computer  science, due to flexibility. I have to now receive unpleasant treatments  (immunosupression with chemotherapy) and attend doctor's appointments a  lot.

1iux25,84,2013-07-22,"IT Consultants, or, How I learned to love the Sysprep tool.",arkaniad,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1iux25/it_consultants_or_how_i_learned_to_love_the/,"This is my first post so bear with me.

**The Setting:**
I'm a young chap working as an intern at a medium-sized MSP. I shouldn't need to explain what that means here, right? :) Anyways, one of our clients requested an install of Microsoft Dynamics CRM on their PDC (Genius idea that we fought but the client insisted upon it.) They hired a local consulting company to do the installation, customization and training for it and they just needed us to supervise / provide access to the servers.

**Rising Action:** The consultant came in today and said she had a meeting with my coworker. I'd just been gone on vacation so I was still re-familiarizing myself with what was all going on. Coworker and consultant go into the conference room, I don't ask any questions. An hour or so later, I get a call from the client asking about the server being down, so I go poke my nose in. They had to restart the PDC to make some changes, not a huge deal. I go back on the horn with the guy and tell him it should be resolved soon and to just hang tight. 

You can almost taste the foreshadowing here.

**What Next?:** A few hours later, Coworker comes in and slams her hands down on the desk. I hear the front door open and someone shuffling out of the building.

""What was that all about?""

She turns to me, the fires of a thousand suns burns behind her eyes.

""That dumb b*%#&amp; ran sysprep /generalize on the production domain controller while I stepped out to get coffee, a page she found on google told her to do it for some reason.""

Whoops.

Five hours later, calls to her manager, the VP of the company, the client, Shadowprotect, we finally bring the production server back up as it was last night. The VP of the company was surprised my Coworker even picked up the phone. Apparently, the girl didn't even flinch or show remorse after making such a huge fuckup. 

""I just did what Google told me to do.""

**Questions for your thought:** Why don't you take ESX snapshots before every damn change? And since when is sysprep a viable tool for installing Microsoft Dynamics?"
1iunid,70,2013-07-22,What exactly do you talk about with friends on a daily basis?,FlyingCrabs,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1iunid/what_exactly_do_you_talk_about_with_friends_on_a/,"So I don't have a lot of friends, and I'm not particularly close with any of these friends. This shows because I only meet up with them individually maybe once every two months, and even then, with such a long time of not seeing each other, it's still a pain to keep the conversation going for an hour. Usually, without fail, the conversations cover the following, in no particular order:

1. School/work/general life - ""So how's your internship going?""
2. Current events - ""Did you hear about the plane crash at SFO?""
3. Common interest - (usually only NBA) ""How about them Lakers?"" Barring that, I try to talk about some interest I know that they have.
4. Activity/event where we met - ""Ready for the next volunteering event?""
5. Other experiences - When my friends sense the convo is starting to die, they restart it with all the other social experiences they've been having, eating at this place or doing that thing with some other friends. Of course I got nothing because the sitdown at that very moment is literally the only real socializing I've done the entire month.

I guess it follows the FORD topics to an extent, but I think they're best when you meet someone new and not as something to regurgitate with real friends after already knowing them. I guess the only topic I could see talking about on a daily basis is the common interest, but realistically I could maybe talk for 5 minutes about the Lakers each day before it gets real old. I don't have to be talking with every person every single day, but I know to develop close relationships I have to at least do that for the people who I want to get close to.

So instead of more conversation techniques that are general, I just want to ask you what specifically you talk about with someone who you converse very regularly/consider a real friend. How did you get to the point where you have inside jokes and are cracking insults at each other in good fun? I apologize if this question sounds stupid, I'm just woefully inept at socializing. I cannot imagine how some people are able to have 5+ hours of phone conversations with the same person several times a week. I have thought about taking someone's phone and just poring through and analyzing all their text conversations, but I'll have to settle for asking this question lol.


**TL;DR**: What *specifically* do you talk about with your closest friends or people who you talk almost daily with? I'd like to know because I have a terrible time keeping conversations fresh.  "

I've always thought I'd continue on to a molecular bio Ph.D , but recently I've starting losing interest in that route and started thinking about getting a masters instead (shorter commitment, no interest in becoming a PI, etc). I looked at various biotechnology masters programs, but bioinformatics/comp bio programs also caught my eye.

I've always been interested in genetics/genomics, especially in the context of microbio (metagenomics, microbiomes, etc). Problem is, I haven't taken any CS courses which are prereqs for all these programs. Right now I'm trying hard to learn programming concepts through Coursera and other sites, and I feel it's very challenging/fun so far.

I guess my question is: Would a master's in bioinformatics be a valid choice for me, and if so what would be a good way to gain CS and bioinformatics experience?

1iyfnr,24,2013-07-24,Financial independence is key!,apstories,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/1iyfnr/financial_independence_is_key/,"My mom is without a doubt the number one contributing factor to the problems I’ve had to go through growing up as an ABC. Luckily, my life does not seem anywhere as tough as some of the stories I’ve heard on here. My mom’s side along with my dad (his family stayed in China) fled to America pretty early, around their early 20s. My mom is the youngest out of her siblings so you could say our family is more open-minded than the rest. Relatively speaking. For example, I have never had a curfew. I could hang out with whoever I wanted, as long as I never dated Black or Hispanic girls, which I’m not going to obey if I do happen to meet someone of that race that is compatible. Grades were important but I never got my ass beat for getting some B’s now and then. 

I started school in Chinatown and was deeply ingrained in the typical Asian culture. Fortunately for me, I was naturally good at academics in elementary school, definitely not the case now in college lol. I enjoyed reading, played the piano, even picked up the violin. 

But, I was removed from this culturally sheltered life when I got accepted at the age of 10 into one of those academic program for “gifted” minorities. Now like most Asian parents, every other minority (not white people though) was inferior. In Cantonese, the word “monster” is attached to each race. So for example, “Black monster” or “Hispanic monster.” This program was like 30% Asian, with the rest being Black or Hispanic. Now I still hung out with other Asian kids but I was exposed to a completely different culture. I was no longer trapped in this exclusive mindset of Asians’ being superior. After that, I was placed into an independent school where the population was about 90% upper class whites. The school designated itself as “progressive” and was a very liberal school. That’s when I started having troubles at home.

Originally, I was like most other Asian kids who obeyed their parents without question, disregarding the logic, or lack thereof, behind the commands. Now having experienced two mind-opening environments, I started to see the ridiculousness of some of the things my parents said, most notably the manipulative passive aggressive statements my mom made that really just pisses me off. She is never wrong and when she realizes she is, she throws a huge tantrum. Lose lose for whoever opposes her. When I question my parents, they usually responded with “because.”

“What do you mean because?!”

“*Scoffs* What do you mean what do I mean because?”
And so on.

I could go on for days about the problems I encountered, mostly due to communication issues and a quick temper, but I eventually just zoned them out when we had such problems. The problems all culminated one day when I realized my mom had put all my birthday, Christmas, Chinese New Year, etc. money in her own bank account for safekeeping. 

I got extremely pissed off and came to really hate this “bullshit communist” attitude, as I called it, where everyone was expected to share everything. I opened my own bank account and credit card the first chance I got and just saved up from my internships and jobs. The main takeaway here is how financial independence allowed for me to separate from my parents’ overbearing control. It shows that you're an adult and that you control your path, whether they like it or not. I haven’t had to ask them for money in years and I never to plan to ever again. I see stories of people sharing housing payments with their parents and I will never do that in a billion years.

My relationship with my parents has gotten better as this financial dependence connection between us  has been severed. I’ve learned to control my temper and realize that saying nothing is usually better than arguing. I’ve learned to not bring up my somewhat liberal views in front of my parents and if I do, it’s in a reasonable way. All this being said, I’m very lucky to have such accepting (again, relatively) parents, despite my mom’s manipulative tendencies. I’ve had a pretty privileged life and I understand they love me. It’s just their methods can be very irritating sometimes. 

Sorry for the rant. Just discovered this subreddit.

TL;DR: I’ve had it pretty good with my parents. Financial independence was a huge turning point for me. Sometimes, it’s better to just be quiet than try to reason with them.

A few weeks ago I had lunch with a friend and asked her what kind of certification would be good, and she thought A+ wouldn't pay that much but that Sharepoint could be promising. I looked over Microsoft's page at https://www.microsoft.com/learning/en-us/sharepoint-certification.aspx If I do MCSD: SharePoint ApplicationsSolutions Developer I would have to brush up on HTML and learn Javascript and CSS3. And if I do MCSE: SharePointSolutions Expert I would have to learn how to install and configure servers. Which certification would take fewer hours and/or expenses to complete? Would it lead to a promising career?"
1ixpvq,4,2013-07-24,"High schooler with a decent (?) amount of programming experience, useful for college apps/internships?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1ixpvq/high_schooler_with_a_decent_amount_of_programming/,"I'm about to enter my senior year and college apps are coming up soon, and I'm wondering how my programming experience can add to it.

To give an idea of where I'm at, I started programming with Java at a summer camp when I was 11 or 12, though I can't say I learned very much (besides a hate for Java's syntax that exists to this day). My first real foray into programming was an incomplete platformer game around two years after that, with scrolling, gravity, physics, the basic stuff, made with Python and Pygame. I've made a few other projects with Pygame, in which I've learned to how to structure code and work with general design patterns (MVC, Observer, Singleton patterns, event managers). I would consider those to be my most challenging projects.

I've worked in C++ with WPILib for a robotics competition as the only programmer on my team. That was a very simple job - most of the problems I had were not software related, as WPIlib practically does everything for you.

I've also made a few web apps/websites for friends' businesses, so I'm familiar with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I've used Phonegap and Cordova to turn those into native mobile applications.

I've done other small stuff on the side, like using praw to make reddit bots (this account being one of them), a somewhat-functional Latin utility program (I'd like to have it work with an existing one but Ada looks terrifying), and tinkering with computer stuff in general. I'll also be taking AP Comp Sci this year.

Python is the language I'm most familiar with, though I'm comfortable with the syntax of most statically typed, C family languages. I'd love some kind of internship opportunity (southern california), either during the school year or in the interim before college, though my bigger priority right now is getting into a good one. I apologize if I sound too wordy or conceited, I'm not great at conveying tone in text."
1ixf8j,1,2013-07-23,Internship or go to Japan?,socialanxietymonster,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ixf8j/internship_or_go_to_japan/,"This summer I am working at an internship with a great company; however, I have just been offered a trip to go to Japan!

 All expenses for the trip will be paid, but I will have to take a week off of work at the internship. I will only be working there for about 4 weeks if I take the trip. I feel guilty that I'm skipping out on them for a whole week. That being said, I am not getting paid for this internship. 

Another factor to consider is that I've been studying Japanese for 6 years, and have never been to Japan. I really really really want to go, but I know it might not be the most responsible thing to do, to skip out on my work.

Advice? I plan on telling my boss about this, but how do I go about it? My social anxiety is really getting the best of me on this one. I need advice. "
1ixcxw,0,2013-07-23,"Would like advice on whether it would be good for me to study abroad or not, keep going back and forth on a decision",emberskye,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1ixcxw/would_like_advice_on_whether_it_would_be_good_for/,"This coming spring we (my class/year) have the option to study abroad in Italy for a semester as part of our academic program (architecture). Normally about 75% of the kids go, I would say. I don't know if I should go or not. There's a shit ton of factors that play into it, but I'll try to explain as best I can.

The semester would cost about $20,000 and I would have to take out loans to go. I am currently a year behind in my program, so after this coming academic year ('13/'14) I still have one more year, but my scholarships will run out - I'll have to pay the full cost of tuition for my final/5th year of college (academic year '14/'15).

Right now I have a good deal going for me with being a Resident Assistant (free room and board). If I study abroad I will lose the free room and board for spring semester, and would not be able to be an RA my 5th year (would not be eligible for rehire). However, if I don't go and stay here for spring semester I can continue to be an RA for the rest of this academic year AND for the following year, hugely decreasing my costs.

If I stayed, I would also be able to easily interview for summer internships and have a better chance of landing one. It would be much more difficult to try and land an internship while studying abroad. And having a summer internship would allow me to save more money that could be put towards my 5th year (since I'll be paying full price).

Also, I have no friends in my class. My boyfriend and the only friend I made in my program are both a year ahead of me in my original class, since I took a year off and am a year behind. I don't mind being on my own but I really don't want to be in a foreign country with absolutely not a single person I'm familiar with, no one I can even travel with.

Another thing is that I have already been to Italy twice before because I have close relatives there. So it's not like this is my only chance/reason to go.

Lastly, if I stayed for spring semester, I would be able to get ahead in my classes. Way ahead, enough ahead that I won't need to take more than 6 credit hours my final semester which would be amazing.

So there's all the info, I think? Might be thinking too far into it but I jsut can't reason myself into a decision. I would love to go but I think it makes more sense for me not to basically, I don't know.

Any advice appreciated - I apologize for the length. Can't really do a tl;dr."

Or this Link to 2.bp.blogspot.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cbagoil?context=5)|Fetish of yours? Interesting, I'll forward that.
[Are you hoping for this to become a full time job rather than an internship?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cbaayq0?context=5)|I am! I have so much fun working here, it's a super chill environment, and even though we deal with porn all day long we get to be creative on how we market and expose it to our Naughty America Fans. 
[You want a fan base?  Make a reddit POV series.  Have every girl do a POV fuck where she is talking to him like he's a redditor.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cbadhm9?context=5)|That's a fucking awesome idea. I'm definitely passing that along.
[Best porn movie? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cba7qys?context=5)|Not sure if I have a favorite. There are so many new ones coming out everyday, &amp; they just keep getting better &amp; better!
[Can your line of work make dating difficult? Even though you're not in scenes... has anyone ever gotten the 'wrong idea' or somehow misjudged you for the industry you've involved yourself in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cbah12l?context=5)|Not at all...I just don't tell anyone except my best friends where I work. Also, I've had a boyfriend the whole time I've worked here, and he knows all about what I do (which is only behind the scenes work/social media management!). We joke about the stuff I see all the time.
[What's the gender breakdown at the office? More men that work there? More women? About even?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cbah12l?context=5)|I'd say the gender breakdown is pretty 50/50. And all of the guys here are decent and funny - not at all sketchy like you may think.
[I know you said you're not a porn star and you'd never be, but have you dated or slept with any of the talent?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cbaeidy?context=5)|Nope. I'm good with just fantasizing about them. Plus I've only worked here a few months and I've had a bfrand the whole time.
[How many people in public actually recognize you when you're off the job for the while? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cba9m0o?context=5)|Only the people I work with...I work behind the scenes, not a porn star ;)
[How do you determine what to tweet? Is there like a certain amount of tweets you're supposed to do in a day or something.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cbaa5n8?context=5)|We tweet new scenes on a daily basis, and other than that I get to be as creative and naughty as I want! How sweet is that?! If you follow us on twitter @naughtyamerica you'll get to see exactly what I choose to tweet at whatever time I'd like! Love this company.
[What if your dad started following @naughtyamerica?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cbafhv4?context=5)|That would suck. Thankfully my dad doesn't even know what Twitter is. 
[Is there anyone at the office who you would never expect to be working there??? (i.e. religious types, old ladies, that sort of thing\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cbad90o?context=5)|There's quite a few ladies working here with families and children and whatnot. I find it funny that they got a job working for Naughty America, but hell I never thought I'd be working here either!
[Anything that stands out though?  There are plenty of Mormons down there ;\) (being an SD native myself I'd know..not Mormon though\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cbadu9e?context=5)|Not that I know of...but yeah there are a lot here aren't there. I'm an SD native as well ;)
[Has a star ever yelled cut themselves because they did not like how it was going or been like ""Man I really just fucked that up""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cbaau3u?context=5)|There was this one live show a while back when I just started interning...I can't remember the porn star. But all of a sudden she left the set to do something and everyone was like ""WTF?!"" I think she just badly had to go to the bathroom or something lol. When she got back she went right back to work. 
[How do you like your eggs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cba77c6?context=5)|Over-easy.
[The correct answer is ""anything but fertilized""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cbab67h?context=5)|You'd be surprised...some people eat fertilized eggs. Disgusting.
[I guess the only real question I have is, out of every possible internship that you could have gotten for yourself, what made you choose Naughty America out of everything else?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cba8qoc?context=5)|It seemed really interesting to me, and I guess there is a taboo aspect to it as well. Almost everyone watches porn, but most people try to hide it. I get paid to market it. I get to be creative and  have fun helping people find their sexual fantasies. It's all entertainment, and entertainment is fun!
[Do you take anything you see from the techniques you spy while filming into the bedroom with you? Do you find it as a source for inspiration in your own naughty life? Examples...please :D?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cbbr4ln?context=5)|Hmmm. I'm not sure how to respond to this. Let's just say I've learned a few things while working here at NA, and you can interpret that how you like haha!
[When you say you have a hand in every scene... Where typically do you enjoy placing ure hand? Do you wash between scenes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cba5zs4?context=5)|This was exactly the question I was expecting.
[You know how in the ""regular"" film industry, every scene is scripted and requires rehearsal and multiple takes? In porn, once the action starts, is everything just improvised? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cbbedd8?context=5)|I'm pretty sure both our girl and guy stars are very professional and know exactly how to act to get their audience ""off"". But I'm sure there is some improvisation in there - I mean, if they're feeling good, I doubt they can help keeping calm and collected...if ya know what I mean?
[How can I get an internship at Naughty America?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cba63hp?context=5)|Well, for one, you have to live in SD...
[Do you watch porn at home? if so, is it the stuff of your guys or something else (are you allowed to watch anything else? :D \)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cbazq18?context=5)|Haha I'm a free person, and whatever I watch outside of the office is for me to decide ;)
[1\) Most of the porn-stars i have ever watched on my lifetime are really beautiful and amazing girls. I was always amazed what brings them to this field..? Pls tell me if u know.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cban7yw?context=5)|To answer your first question, beautiful girls are the ones who get asked to be porn stars, and they are usually the ones who get paid the most. Makes sense right? So money is definitely what brings them to this field.
[2\) Most of porn i have ever watched on my life time have just 4 stages  a\)handshake b\)deep throat c\)bang bang bang d\)facial only scene changes. Why is it so..?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cban7yw?context=5)|For your second question, I can only assume that those 4 types of scenes are the most sought after ones, which is why there are so many of them. Whatever sells is what the industry will produce.
[What's one thing your learned about porn industry that you didn't know about before? Something that you were surprised to learn? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cbb062f?context=5)|Definitely the fact that there are different pussy types. First time I learned about that I just looked at my boss and was like ""ummm, what?"" I mean it's not like I've checked out anyone else's besides my own lmao.
[Who is the voice over girl that says ""Naughty America, the worlds best pornsite"".?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cbatuk7?context=5)|I actually don't know, I'm sure the voice over has been there for a while, way before I started working here. Good question though, I'll try and find out!
[Whats your favorite cartoon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cbafsdb?context=5)|South Park...but I haven't seen it in ages! ""maaam I want cheesypooofs!""
[I work in a similar field so I don't mean this with any judgment, do you ever feel bad for the performers, or guilty for doing your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cbaed1t?context=5)|Not really, it's what they've chosen to do, and they get paid VERY well. I think most of them love what they do anyways. If they don't, then yeah I feel bad because I think everyone should enjoy their jobs, even though not many can say they do.
[Wanna go to fluxx on saturday?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cbaegbn?context=5)|LOL thanks for the invite but I've got plans with my boyfriend. I do love fluxx though...fun club.
[Why isnt there a dildo on your desk?  Did you sit on the  'casting couch' when you were interviewed for the job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cbag5xh?context=5)|Hahaha that'd be funny if there were a dildo huh? But no, there's no reason to have any in the office, which is NOT where the scenes are filmed. We also don't cast models here in the office. So ""casting couch"" = non-existent.
[How are you going to add this to your resume? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cbbdbw5?context=5)|Good question HA. I think I'll manage to figure it out. Imagine any future job I apply for: ""worked as a social media specialist for major porn company Naughty America...because I'm American, and I'm naughty ;)""...with the winky face in the resume. Lmao doubt I'd be hired for that position.
[Is there a ton of sex noise coming from other rooms in the building that makes it hard to concentrate on your work? I assume it's all just done elsewhere.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cbawdar?context=5)|Yeah the filming takes place outside of the office, but sometimes when someone is editing a scene, us here in the office will be able to hear the scene running on their computer. Can you say AWKWARD? Kinda funny that they don't decide to use headphones...
[Will you give me a porn suggestion?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cbbjg7k?context=5)|Hell yeah. [Mia Malkova's Naughty Office scene\] (\[Link to natour.naughtyamerica.com](http://natour.naughtyamerica.com/track/seoteam.12.8.8.1.0.0.0.0/scenes/mia_malkova2/16175/) was quite a turn on for me...I love that bubble butt and her sweet voice, and Bill Bailey is quite the man candy.
[Any favourite male or female stars? What are the actors/actresses like behind the scenes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cba79na?context=5)|Lexi Belle for sure, such a hot petite natural chick. And OMG Johnny Castle is a sexy beast. Most of them are really nice and professional.
[Has a male porn star asked you out?  if not, would you go out with one if they asked you?  (i'm talking about a guy you thought was very attractive and you liked his personality\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cbah9fm?context=5)|Nope it hasn't happened yet, and at this point I am still in a relationship with my current boyfriend so I would decline.
[Thats fairly shocking considering you are a 21 year hottie.  (well your body anyway\).  lets assume you were single and were asked out.  would you date a male porn star?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cbata10?context=5)|Probably not. If I really like a guy both physically and mentally, I don't want to share him with anyone.
[So you're telling me there's a chance? (I'm not a porn star\).  :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cbaulql?context=5)|You never know where life is gonna take you. Are you sure you aren't a pornstar? Lol the denial makes me wonder...
[What's the funniest thing that's happened in the office?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cbb72ob?context=5)|My whole office watching [this\] (\[Link to efukt.com](http://efukt.com/21065_The_Creepiest_Motherfucker_in_Porn.html) together.

Is it one on one like usual or something else?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cbcv7p5?context=5)|Ugh libraries suck...go work in a Starbucks lol.

[Are you a film student by chance?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cbbiqa7?context=5)|I am not. Interesting question though...what made you think I were?
[Who is your favorite? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1j1kxn/i_am_a_21_year_old_girl_working_at_naughty/cbatmdj?context=5)|Lexi Belle - so cute and I love her natural look! Who's yours?!

It's true, I have no idea what I'm going to do, where am I going to be in 5 years, 10? I have no idea. He told me today to think of a place you want to be and make it happen.

I'll be going to university in September in an undergrad in Electrical Engineering. Maybe I'll be employed in a computer firm or an engineer for power systems. I can't be sure.

I am currently interning at a local company as a software developer so I have got some decent experience.

 I'm interested in getting a well-rounded internship. Ideally, I was thinking either Palo Alto, Austin, or any other area with a lot of tech companies. It appears that a lot of students apply to the big companies like Google/Facebook/Amazon so those seem quite competetive and possibly really hard to get in to, but what would be some good companies to apply for? What should I be looking for pay-wise? If you move far away, will companies typically provide housing?"

1j15zn,1,2013-07-25,Frustrated Intern,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1j15zn/frustrated_intern/,"So I'm a CS major that just transferred from a Community College to a nice 4 year University as a rising Junior. I was able to score an internship through family connections which I thought was great....at first. I'm being paid a measly amount as it's not a programming related internship. They have me doing regular office management duties (formatting word docs, distributing documents etc.) but on the CS related side I am being asked to eventually document an API that the development team is using on their project.

Problem is, being a very inexperienced and young CS major I found myself well behind on the terminology and architecture they are using. The API is a RESTful API so I've been doing a lot of research on that and I've finally got the hang of the concept. I just feel like even despite these little victories I'm getting no help from any of the technical guys! They're all pretty introverted and I find myself lost in a wealth of information. 

For example, I'm learning the console of our project now (to better familiarize myself with it) but I want to start actually looking at the API and playing with it myself but I don't even know how!!!! I am very frustrated with both myself and those around me. I know I should be able to research this on my own but its hard to swim in the ocean if you don't know which direction is up. 

Maybe someone can knock some sense in to me or help point me in the right direction."
1j10u1,6,2013-07-25,can being 5'10 415 pounds prevent someone from getting a job?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1j10u1/can_being_510_415_pounds_prevent_someone_from/,So I was talking to my old high school buddy who use to weight 250 back  in hs and now he's 415.  I ask him what's he up to he saids hes been trying to lose weight.  He's qualified for a lot of jobs and gets interviews but never gets the actual job offers because he thinks its his weight.  He's trying to get a job in IT because hes a computer science major.  He has internship experience that hes gotten through connections but his weight is preventing him from getting a job because he thinks employers will see him being overweight as a liability.  Hes trying to lose weight now.  Is he being realistic or just making up excuses?  I understand jobs like law enforcement or military wouldn't take him but for cs job i think experience is more important than a guys weight.  If he's being realistic about this how fat/skinny does a candidate have to be to not be discriminated against for their weight?
1j03fb,0,2013-07-24,How to organize a bidding war?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1j03fb/how_to_organize_a_bidding_war/,"Hello everyone.  I'm going to try to explain my situation as briefly as possible, but feel free to skip to the questions to get the gist of it.

I'm a CS major about to wrap up my final semester this fall.  I am currently interning for a local company making pretty decent money doing some moderately dull work.  I am fairly certain that this company would like to hire me upon graduation.

Before starting at this company, I worked at a different company making similar money, doing slightly more interesting work.  This company would also like to hire me upon graduation.

I was recently contacted by a recruiter for yet *another* company that I had expressed interest in at a job fair in the past year or so, and we have begun discussing the possibility of starting an internship (at similar pay) to move into a full time position upon graduation.

It feels a little early to be looking for full time positions.  I was only planning on reaching out to companies maybe half way through my last semester, so I would be interviewing as the semester came to an end.

**Questions Start Here**

How early is too early to start looking for full time positions?

And from a more devious standpoint, is it feasible to try to organize many interviews and negotiations in parallel such that I can bounce offers and counteroffers back and forth between potential employers?  I've heard of this technique being used to get a good deal on a car, by calling local dealerships and just asking everyone if they're willing to go lower than the current lowest offer.  Does the overhead of interviewing and going through the various motions mean this is unfeasible for a job search?

And finally, how much time do employers usually allow for a response before an offer expires?  Will a company be offended if they give me an offer and I say ""sounds decent, just give me a month or two to talk to a bunch of other companies before I give you an answer""?

Thanks in advance everyone, I always get good responses here."

1j4h96,2,2013-07-26,Girlfriend problems,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1j4h96/girlfriend_problems/,"I realize that this is really long, but if someone could take the time to read through all I've been through with this girl, and give me any kind of advice I would be SUPER grateful. I am truly lost. I have no idea what to do. 

**Part 1**

Ok. This is a really long story, but I will try and keep it short. I love my current gf to death. I would do anything for her. When we met we connected almost instantly. The trouble was she had a bf at the time (one who treated her very poorly), however we still became insanely close. Once I realized I had feelings for her I committed to waiting out her relationship. She eventually picked up on this, but it made no real difference. Just as she was about to break up with her old bf, he was in a bad automobile accident. This made her feel obligated to stay with him, which she did. For another 6 months. During this period she even told me that she loved me a couple of times. She eventually broke up with her bf, and it should have been the end, but it wasn't. She got back together with him a few months later. This carried on for another year almost. This was pure TORTURE to sit through AGAIN, but I was convinced she was worth it. Before I had her in my life, I was never happy, and super depressed all the time. Finally, her bf made a huge mistake , and she was able to end it for good. 

**Part 2**

One would think that almost 2 years of waiting would be enough hell to put someone you love through, but apparently not. I didn't pressure her at all after she broke up with her bf because I figured she would need a bit of grieving time, which she appreciated. However one night she kissed me and it led to things getting a little intense, followed by us sleeping together. So logically the next day, I figured I should probably bring it up. And she said that she felt like she needed more time... This was a pretty crushing blow, as it made me feel like I messed up. However, she continued to be extremely flirtatious with me and maintain her status of being single. But I eventually got wind of her leading another guy on, who had a crush on her in high school. When I asked her about it, she assured me that it was nothing, and that they have always had a playful relationship (even though the entire time she had a bf, that guy never talked to her, but the day after they broke up, he started texting her). This continued for about 7 months. It was pure and utter anguish. I have never felt so terrible in my entire life. Yet somehow, I kept waiting. 

**Part 3**

FINALLY, she wised up, and realized that she was slowly but surely killing my capacity to love and ended up asking me to be her boyfriend. I was elated. It had finally paid off. Things were amazing for a while. But then things started popping up. I was able to brush them off for a while, but they began to become problematic. I couldn't go anywhere without her, or she would get upset or sad. I basically had to give up my social life to avoid hurting her feelings. She began to stop spending time with any of her friends and wanted to be around me 100 percent of the time. This put a strain on me, because I was constantly having to drive between my place and hers. She never really came to my place. 

To solve this problem we ended up moving in together after about 6 months of dating. I figured that if we lived together, she would be more comfortable with me having some alone time, since all my free time would be at the apartment with her. WRONG. The problem got so much worse. She expected me to be available at all times, and stupid me obliged her. I don't blame her, because I should have had the balls to tell her straight up that I'm going to go hang out with people other than her, but I always put her happiness ahead of mine, so I never did. This began to lead to lots of arguments, which would always be resolved by the end of the day, however it was still bothersome. The trend I began noticing is that basically anytime I wanted to do something that clashed, even slightly, with her plans or wishes, she would guilt trip me by pouting. She was also clingy to the point of suffocation. It has become a huge issue. 

Well, she left to go to Italy mid-june to study abroad. I was hoping that would make her happy. Nope. She complains a lot about very small things, and lets the fact that she misses me ruin her day. I miss her too, but I try to make the best of it. I don't want her to be unhappy. But she has it great compared to me right now. I'm currently working 7 days a week for 8-12 hours a day at an apartment complex. I just finished an internship as well. I have had a non existent summer. But I manage to keep it positive for her, but she can't do the same. This has led to arguing on the phone as well. I feel bad, but I just can't find it in myself to have to make someone feel better every single day when they are fortunate enough to be doing something so amazing that I was never able to do. This leads to her getting mad and thus, the arguments. 

**Part 4**

Since she has been gone, I have been hanging out with a friend from high school who happens to live at the same complex. I used to hang with her all the time before my gf, but very rarely did I see her, aside from the occasional lunch, once I got with my gf. Well since my gf has gone for Italy, my friend from high school is basically the only close local friend I have, we started hanging out some. At first it was just every now and then, but the last few weeks it has been almost everyday. The sucky part is I feel like I have started developing feelings for her. I don't want too, but she is awesome in so many ways. For example, I don't even bottom playing video games with my gf, because I am very competitive, but in a joking manner. My girlfriend is SUPER sensitive, and it takes all the fun out of it. HS friend, however, trash talks right back to me. We stayed up for 4 hours the other night playing Mario Kart 64. It was the most fun I have had in AGES. Things like that. I feel absolutely horrible for developing feelings. I also feel horrible for wanting to break up with my gf. Because I truly do love her more than anything. I have given her all I had to give. Been patient, loving, and kind. But it just hasn't helped. The thought of her reaction and the hurt she will feel (as well as the hurt I will feel) if I break up with her almost brings me to tears. I don't know if I can (or should) go through with it. Am I the problem here? Or would it be best to end it? It breaks my heart to think about it, but I don't see too many more options. 

**Part 5**

Not sure what to do.,ineedajobthrowaway,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1j4au8/i_need_to_pay_bills_but_am_conscious_of_what_my/,"I am trying very hard to get out of the nanny industry and put my education to use in a more corporate setting.

I graduated in 2013, then spent 13 months abroad living and working as a nanny. I also nannied all through college. I have realized that no one is impressed at all with this experience. The pay was high compared to my friends making $9/hr or working unpaid internships, but I'm kind of in a panic right now.


 I've been searching for administrative positions but haven't found anything. I'm running out of money and will need to move in two months. I have an interview for a high paying nannying job that is only temporary, 3 months, while their current nanny is away.

I REALLY don't want to take a position like this, but it's kind of getting to the point where I need to. I need the money to stay afloat. What should my next steps be from here? The job would be 50 hours per week and leave a little time for volunteering, but there is a legal clinic I would love to volunteer with, and hopefully form some connections there.

Any advice or direction would be appreciated"
1j425p,26,2013-07-26,Supervising undergraduates: is he underperforming or are my standards too high?,[deleted],AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1j425p/supervising_undergraduates_is_he_underperforming/,"I've been here before asking for some advice with working with my summer (undergrad) student.  As of today, I am sort of at the end of my rope.  I don't know if I am being unreasonable (definitely possible) --  I went to college in the 90s and things were pretty different -- or if he is just not making the grade..  He goes to a very high ranked SLAC and upon interviewing him he greatly impressed me with his interests and focus in science, especially since they had everything to do with research and answering questions, and nothing to do with curing disease or going to medical school.  He is going into his senior year now and has no research experience at all.

He is working full-time and I have him on three projects (all connected) to keep him busy during the day.  One project is experiment-based, but he can only run one or two experiments a day at best, which take about an hour to prepare (but hours to run), so to fill the rest of the time I gave him a sort of literature review project and one where he edits some already-produced data of the type he is producing on the bench.

My experience with him as been as follows:

(1) There is almost nothing I can simply ask him to do, he must be shown and given very explicit directions about everything.  I don't mind this when it comes to the science, but it's also just basic research skills, he couldn't write an outline for a paper or do a literature search for a recent paper without me showing him exactly how to do, and essentially doing it for him.  For his literature research all he ever did was read the books I gave him and summarize the information, when I told him explicitly they were just to get him started.

(2) If he doesn't do something immediately after I teach/show/discuss it with him (even after repeated instruction), he completes it in a way that seems sort of half-assed.  I will show him how to do something, then I will watch him do it, then he will do it on his own and do very well.  However, when I repeat the same process with the same task, but I let him take a few days in complete the task on his own rather than immediately after we have done the teaching session, it is clear he has forgotten a lot of how to do things.  It isn't just the science either, it's even simple steps in data entry.  I've asked him to take notes when we talk and I give him my own directions, but I don't think he looks at them.

(3) He doesn't seem to want to troubleshoot/figure things out on his own (this may be related to (1) above).  I admit that when I give him things to do, sometimes I leave some information out hoping he will look it up on his own so gets the feeling he is learning and accomplishing something, not just connecting the dots.  I mean this is real research and the age of Google, there is someone on the internet somewhere who has had the same question.

We have a meetings every day for half an hour so I feel he has plenty of time to ask me questions and we can go over things, plus we work in the same office and he can talk to me any time other than that.

EDIT: Since this thread is still alive, I'll add some information.  First, thanks for such an interesting discussion.  The student is doing a summer internship, and he is almost completed it.  Midway we had a talk where I said it was good time to switch from ""school"" mode (I give him assignments, grade them, and then return them) to ""project"" mode, where he takes time to think about what needs to get done, how to do it, and how much time he thinks it will take (all with my counsel).  A lot of people are saying here that it is unreasonable to expect a student to be able to do a literature search, but when I taught freshman (at a university) they wrote papers with current literature, and when I was in college -- before the real internet, when it was much harder to do this type of search -- I wrote plenty of papers from year one using journal articles.  Thus none of my experience, on either side, ever indicated that doing a literature search would be so daunting as to be impossible, it seems this is a skill that is passed on very unevenly in undergrad education."

1j3e1m,54,2013-07-26,Intern Stories: Night rounds,tunatunayeah,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1j3e1m/intern_stories_night_rounds/,"I'm currently an intern in a hospital that I'm not gonna name anymore (confidentiality reasons) and being an intern in a place where deaths happen regularly..well, you better expect a lot of crazy shit to happen. Just for the heck of it, I'll share some of my intern stories.

So this crazy thing happened some weeks ago. I had a 12 hour duty from 7pm to 7am that night. Things were pretty chill at the lab, I only got called about twice by the clinical instructor to extract blood from two patients from the children's ward. Around about 12 am or 1, a patient suspected to have dengue fever was rushed in the emergency room. Once the boy's fever was managed, he was transferred to a room in the children's ward and I was ordered to extract blood from him for a complete blood and platelet count. So me and my clinical instructor went to extract blood from the boy, he was fairly calm and all. After the extraction my clinical instructor left me to take care of the labeling and shit because she was needed in another floor. I took my kit, placed the sample securely in my tube holder and then went on my way back to the laboratory. 

On my way, I noticed that one room's door was wide open, as if a patient was gonna be discharged from the room. This puzzled me. I'm still fairly new and I've never encountered patients being discharged at this time of the night (or morning's more like it), so I discreetly peeked in. I could easily see the patient's bed and the one occupying it. What I saw puzzled me even more because there was a lady lying on the bed. Her back was turned on the door so I couldn't see her face but it was easy to see that she didn't belong in the children's ward because she had long graying (almost silvery) hair and her paper gown exposed her wrinkly, liver-spotted back. he wasn't hooked up to any IV's or anything so I thought maybe she had memory problems and simply got lost. So I walked in the room with the intention of asking her if she's lost and at the same time, discreetly looking at her patient bracelet. I readied my gentlest, friendliest voice (that would've been the first non-blood extraction interaction I'd have with a patient, okay?) and tapped her shoulder. 
I said, ""Well hello there madam, I'm sorry but this is the children's ward. You seem to h-""

I didn't finish my sentence because the old lady slowly turned to gaze at me....well she would've gazed at me IF she had eyes. Her whole face was just blank. It was all jut wrinkly, graying and decaying skin. I didn't friggin' know what to do, my hand was still on the lady's shoulder and for the life of me, I couldn't move. I was snapped out of my trance when I saw the lady's left hand twitch and reach out for my paralyzed hand. That's when I flinched back and ran out.
I think it took me less than two minutes to run back to the ground floor, in the safety of the clinical laboratory. When I dashed in my clinical instructor and a bunch of the other interns who were having coffee looked at me. I was still shaking but I managed to tell them what happened. The other interns were terrified as shit but my clinical instructor was all smiles, saying ""Well, I guess you've met no face. So where's your kit and the blood sample?"". I realized in dismay that I'd left it in 'no face's' room. 
""Well, you better get it before no face herself give it back to you"", my clinical instructor said laughingly, but then she added ""Seriously though, demerits on your part if you don't get the sample back. Those platelets are very sensitive you know"".

I will graduate in May with a BS and MS from a top-10 US school with around a 3.7 GPA (probably).  I have about 3 years of development experience from before school, and I went back to get a formal CS education and hopefully find something that interests me. I love algorithms, CS theory, and math, but I found AI to be pretty interesting as well.  I've been focusing on it in school and these are some of the courses I've taken (along with the core CS stuff and several math classes):

* Machine Learning
* Data Mining
* NLP
* Information Retrieval
* Neural Networks
* Autonomous Robots
* Distributed Systems

Here's my situation:
I really want to apply what I've learned (in other words, I don't want to be a general code-monkey anymore -- hence why I'm getting the Masters).  However, in my internships I've always been given pretty boring, general development projects.  I have a very generous full-time offer to return to the place I'm currently at, but no guarantee of what I'll be working on or what team I'll be on.  I even have confirmation from my manager that the chances of working on AI/ML are pretty low. But...it is a good company with good work-life balance, and the potential to work in something interesting is possible, but not guaranteed.  I'm also not a huge fan of the company's location.

Given my profile and the current job market, what are my chances of obtaining a position in my area of interest (AI/ML/etc)? Is it realistic, or should I just give up and go with the offer I've got?

I would value any advice, especially from recruiters or hiring managers who know the market, or others who have been in similar situations or have a similar profile.

Thanks!"
1j2rlx,2,2013-07-25,Best plan for CS non-major/CS minor?,ftfthroway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1j2rlx/best_plan_for_cs_nonmajorcs_minor/,"I'll try to be as brief as possible, but I do have specific questions for my personal circumstances.

I just finished my first year of college at a large state school with a well known College of Engineering and CS department.  I came in majoring in electrical engineering, but quickly realized I did not want to pursue that as a career.  I took a visual basic course in community college while in high school (waste of time/ junk course which did not teach good programming habits or theory, but still somewhat interesting), and the final project for our ece class involved making programming and embedding an Arduino micro-controller(got over 100% on that project which helped save me from my test scores;). I then realized that I greatly enjoyed programming.

Second semester, I decided to transfer into CS, which requires the completion of a intro CS course in Java(covered OOP, recursion, and various sorts), and a discrete math course which I am about to complete.  Unfortunately, it seems everybody else and their grandmother is trying to transfer, and while I did well in the Java course, I don't think my discrete math grade will be high enough to get into the department.  This is a problem because a) I actually enjoyed both of these courses(yes even theory) and want to major in Computer Science because I am interested in the field on a personal level and b) aside from that, I want a career as a developer.

But can't just sit around and bitch and moan all day, especially considering my ambition to work as a developer is still totally achievable, which brings me to my options.  Let's assume I choose to major in physics, another subject which I feel personally interest while still within my school's engineering college and because I may yet wish to work in physics:

* I can obtain a minor in computer science, which will require a course in data structures as mandatory, and three other CS electives.  (I want to be clear here that I do **NOT** want to do this for a minor piece of paper).  The three electives I would consider taking would be any three of the following: *Algorithms*(relevant knowledge for anyone who wants to work in any form of development and a must for interviews), *Parallel Computing*(useful in physics research and the fact that most personal computing devices have multiple CPUs from what I have read few people seem to know well), *Numerical Analysis*(a must for any computational physics research), *Theory of Computation*(generally theoretical problem solving skills for computer science problems).  There are other courses I would be interested in such as systems programming, graphics, AI etc. that all sound interesting and fun to take, but I only get three and my university is very strict about its major/minor only policy.

* Needless to say, I plan to much more programming on my own,  I taught myself a limited amount of C/C++ at the beginning of the summer but never really did any projects, but I plan to start a portfolio and maybe start dabbling in C# .Net and also some scripting languages.

* Resume building, such as finding an internship for next summer is imperative to me.  However, does choosing between a straight developer internship vs doing computational based research limit me in the other respective field (i.e. how do i get the best of both worlds while keeping my future options open). I plan to hit up my college career center and start getting serious about my internship/research search.

All of this is based on what i have read online and the limited amount I have learned in a classroom thus far.  

**tl;dr** Unable to major in CS at my uni, will probably major in physics instead with CS minor, which electives to take to optimize my career and other general advice.

Your feedback is appreciated.

For personal reasons I want to move to Singapore after graduating, living there for at least a few years with open end.
I really want this to happen, which is why I'm currently evaluating my options so I could take action if necessary.

My first choice would have been to pursue another degree in Computer Science; a master's degree or a PhD. However, I can't afford to pay for university nor the living costs, so I would be needing a full scholarship. While I will still try and apply for some scholarships, I don't have high hopes to get accepted.

Another option would be to start working. I want to work in IT as software developer or something similar. However, I don't have any work experience. I know that these kinds of jobs might not be paid very well in Singapore, but that's no priority for me.

How would I go about finding a job in Singapore? I'm guessing that no employer would be willing to help me relocate, given my non-experience.

I know of one company in my area which also has an office in Singapore, so I could do an internship there and hope that they are willing to get me into Singapore after graduating. I'm not sure if employers usually do something like this?

I would appreciate any ideas/tips/input on this :)"

At work, i have taken on the responsibility of part time IT support to help with an employee ramp up. Basically my job is to help get our work software running properly with new employees. My job is entirely work from home, so i never see anyone face to face. I am working directly under the manager that interviewed me. When i saw the internal posting for the IT gig, i applied ASAP. The job description is basically exactly what i am doing right now for part of my work week.

The interview, i think, went well. I had no intentions to discuss salary, or any intentions to discuss other people that applied to the job. The manager bought up salary and said ""im sure this will come up later down the road, but salary will be between x range, we are not sure if it will be salary based or hourly yet, but we will let you know as soon as we know something""

this was kind of red flag number one for me, but i don't want to read much into it. The next one, he nonchalantly stated that they ""have to interview everyone else that applied and give them a chance, but will get back to me in a couple weeks"" when he gets off his vacation.

To me, these seem to be fairly decent indicators that im in the green to be hired for this position, but ya never know i suppose. I also figure with me helping out a couple days out of the week with exactly what i would be doing full time is a huuuuuuge leg up. (somehow, i landed this part time role with a recommendation from another manager)

There is a problem, however. I also have an oppertunity at a supervisor internship with the same company. Although not final, my chances of getting into it are extremely good, and i will know sooner about it than the IT gig.

The IT support role is really where i want to be, so it kind of puts me in a hard place. IF i actually make it into the supervisor intern thing, how would i let them know im more interested in the IT support without actually burning my bridge? if i flat out tell them i respectfully decline their offer, then im taking a leap of faith on getting the it support title, and if that falls through...well..i just burned both my chances for now, so i am not  entirely sure how to handle this situation.

thats assuming i even get selected for the supervisor intern thing, though. if i don't, the situation wont be nearly as complicated.

So, general things i should look for in a phone interview to gauge how my interview went would be the most important thing to answer, again my gut says i got this, so i guess thats usually the strongest indicator."

It's really frustrating and discouraging. Maybe I should redefine my blogging goals and make it simpler and manageable, and choose two channels to get focused on.

I chose to resign because I didn't want failure to pass probation to follow me around on my state employment record, in case I wanted to seek another government job in the future (I am still eligible to reinstate to another state job in CA).

I started applying to jobs before I left my previous position, and was able to get interviews at 2 different places. However, at the time I interviewed, I had only been out of work for a week or two. Now that it's been 5 weeks, I'm beginning to lose sleep over the fact that no one will want to hire me because I am unemployed. I've applied to about 25 jobs, half of which still have open application periods. For about the first 10-15, I was able to get those 2 interviews. But nothing else. The first place said I did well in the interview and on the test they gave me, but they most likely won't be making hiring decisions for a few months out. I'm still waiting to hear back from the second place.

I understand that my performance in my previous job wasn't stellar, but I've learned a lot and know I have it in me to do well in another career. I know that I interview well, but I also know that the fact that I'm currently unemployed will deter potential employers. 

Obviously, if I resigned, I accepted the fact that I'd be facing unemployment. I know better than to complain about my previous employer/job in an interview, and even if I state professionally that I'm looking for a career change or job with a different skill set, I know that the fact that I resigned raises a handful of red flags. 

I'm wondering if any of you have experience with such a situation, and how it panned out for you. I know that employers are wary of hiring the unemployed, and that it's easier to find a job when you already have one. I've been having trouble sleeping, and being out of work is the first thing I think about in the morning, and the last thing I think about at night. 

As for background, I'm a 26 y/o female with an MA in economics. I don't have much of a work history, since I spent 3 years in grad school, but I have a lot of internship experience.

tl;dr: I was forced to resigned from a job and am now losing sleep over the fact that I'm unemployed.

This summer two of my friends got internships (one at the CIA, other at NSA), and neither are necessarily impressive as CS students go....I am fairly certain one of them couldn't code his way out of a paper bag.

Their pay is relatively low (I believe they are both paid as GS-5, but I cannot recall exactly), and neither of them were given any sort of technical screen or interview.

As you can see there must be some sort of disconnect here. How can an agency with such low recruiting standards (Compared to top tech companies at least) have such success and be working on the bleeding edge?

So after 2 years of college, I decided that Computer Science was all programming and that got tedious quick, and I was told Computer Engineering was more hardware-oriented. I also decided that of all the computer technologies I see come and go, nothing excites me more than reading about a new CPU or GPU technology, the more technical the better.

I'm two semesters from finishing my BS, and then two years from finishing my MS with a minor in Business Administration. For expediency, I'm going to keep living like a monk while working as a TA (tuition waiver, apparently) and hopefully a paid internship at the campus IT department.
Presently, I'm looking around and trying to find job openings of the sort I'm hoping to get in 3 years.

What sort of job titles should I be looking for? Ideally, I'd like to work somewhere in the design and development process for CPUs or GPUs. I've scanned through listings at Intel, AMD, Nvidia, and ARM, but just about every position I find seems completely unrelated to processors. Mostly positions related to marketing, software/firmware programming, and, with curious consistency, Android programming.

Also, what other steps should I be taking? I've looked for internships vaguely related to the field, but there aren't any in my state.

1j789t,3,2013-07-28,Anna broke out of the mirror.,thesistergeek,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1j789t/anna_broke_out_of_the_mirror/,"According to my post history, it's been about 9 months since I originally posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1296gs/i_was_always_scared_of_mirrors_then_something/).  It feels like so much longer.  The nightmares just stretch everything out I guess.  If you have no idea who Anna is, or what's going on, [start at the beginning](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1296gs/i_was_always_scared_of_mirrors_then_something/).  The tl;dr version is that Anna has haunted me for years, and I see her in mirrors.

Several months ago, [I saw Anna again](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/18qnpq/i_should_never_have_posted_here/) for the first time in years.  It was quiet for a while after that, but I was paranoid nonetheless.  My small panic attacks when using the mirror to put on makeup returned.  I always felt like someone was watching me.  I was never sure if it was all in my head or not.

It all sort of fell by the wayside when my big move came up.  I got an internship, and I'm living in New England for the summer.  My fiance and I moved in together, and I forgot about Anna for a little while.

I'm interning at a museum.  The building is 170 years old, a big grey stone and brick holdover from a past era of commercial sea trade.  I have never felt anything but safe there, even during some of the worst storms of the summer.  It's right on the ocean, and when the wind blows in just right the whole place smells like the sea.  It's three stories, a basement, main floor, and top floor.  The gift shop, where I work, is on the main floor just inside the front doors.  I'm always there in the daylight, the place is only open 10AM - 4PM.

Earlier this week, my co-worker was sick, and I had to cover the gift shop for an evening event.  It was some big Coast Guard dinner, and all of those New Englander retirees loved my played up Southern accent.  I even got to have a glass of wine while on duty.  Overall, it was a pretty awesome evening.  I was relaxed and having a good time for the first time in a very long while.

Part of gift shop duty is turning the museum on and off.  That means turning on lights, opening doors, putting out signs, turning on fans, and opening shades, then reversing it all in the evening.  Because of the way the building was designed back in the day, as much natural light as possible filters in.  During the day, even in a decent rainstorm, turning on the lights makes almost no difference.  It's always bright inside.  I had never closed at night before, and my boss had left to take the rest of the food to the local homeless shelter, promising to be back in half an hour.

I started on the main floor, closing down the gift shop and counting out the money.  I hummed along with the sea shanties that were playing over the loudspeaker still hooked up upstairs.  I deposited the cash in the safe, and started with the front rooms.  That was when I first noticed the other voice humming along with me.  I turned around to see Anna staring back at me from a late 18th century silver mirror.  

Her face was cracked.  It looked like clay after it had been baking in the hot sun, but the cracks were oozing dark blood.  She smiled at me the lopsided smile she often gave when the chase was about to be on.  The blood dripped into her mouth and gave her teeth a pink sheen.

I'm still not sure why I didn't scream.  I guess I just didn't think it would do any good.  While the museum is made of shiny surfaces (glass cases, old pictures, etc), that was the only real mirror in the place.  I thought I could get away if I was smart and careful.  Or just lucky.

With my eyes mostly closed, I went through the final rooms, all six of them.  I hurt my ribs tripping over a raised brick, and scratched my palms catching myself.  But I kept running, and finished my job.  She was still humming along to the music, like she was right behind me, like she could reach out and touch me.  I was so close to escaping.

There is one window in the museum that is different from the rest, one that was meant to be different because it was for the main office in the building.  It's harder to get to than the rest, and the lock likes to stick.  Whoever closes has to move a table, get a chair to stand on, hop up on the marble windowsill, and stand on their tip toes to get to the shade.  This often leaves a nose print from the person doing it on the window, which we joke with guests is proof the place is haunted because it's so high up.

I had my nose pressed against the window when I opened my eyes.  It was a stupid mistake.  Anna was staring back at me.  I stumbled at bit, knowing if I fell it would be straight into a brick floor from 4 feet up.  I made a split second decision to fuck the window shade, I was getting out of here.  I took a small step back on to the chair I had used to get up, when I felt warm breath on my face.

What happened next is hard to explain, god knows I can barely comprehend what I saw.  But her face, her three dimensional, very much alive face, had emerged from the glass.  She was looking down at me with the most triumphant smile I've ever seen.  From day one, Anna has always been avoidable in my life because she's been trapped in mirrors.  I was actually seeing my childhood nightmare escape.

I scrambled backwards, half falling, half landing on my legs.  She was pushing herself out of the reflection, all the while making eye contact with me, the smile never leaving her face.  I really thought before this that I knew what fear was.  But my body was too scared to choose fight or flight.  So I was frozen, watching her hands emerge and pull herself out of the window glass using the walls.

Her feet landed on the marble windowsill, and she stood upright.  Her long red hair partially matted with the blood still oozing from her face.  I saw the rest of her body was also cracked and bleeding.

In two awkward steps, like a fawn learning to walk for the first time, she stepped down to the floor.  And then, Anna winked at me.

I don't remember standing up.  The next thing I remember is landing at the bottom of the steps, already at a full run.  All I had to do was close the back door, and I was out.  She would be locked in with the security system, the 4"" thick wooden front doors, and the iron back doors that held in millions of dollars of cargo a hundred years ago.  She would be trapped, and I would be safe.

My manager was at the back door, waiting on me.  He asked me what the hell was wrong, and I told him I had a family emergency and could he please finish locking the door.  I made it to my car, fully expecting her to be there, in the mirror.

That was Wednesday.  I went back for the first time today, and everything seemed normal.  The gallery and table were reset the next morning, and I told my manager it was a false alarm.  I haven't seen Anna since.  I'm not sleeping, and my fiance is starting to wonder why.  And I guess I just have to tell someone.  

I can't protect myself anymore.  I can't avoid her.  I don't know what she wants.  But to make all of this stop, I honestly might be willing to give it to her."

Is this reasonable? I'd much rather do my CS degree where I am now and avoid the stress and debt I would incur at the engineering school, I just don't know if I'd just end up with a degree and no job.

I should note that I have been unable to obtain any internships at my current school, but the other school supposedly has good connections with local companies.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

I am a junior at a public university, and recently my parents have not been able to help me with any finances. I really am trying to be frugal, and I only spend money on gas and food, but they act like I am a constant nuisance. I'm trying to point out to them that when I got a job last year, they freaked out about it taking away from my schooling and how I wasn't supposed to work in college and that they would support me financially like they did my brother and sister. I told my mom about this last week and she said ""We know its hard on you right now, but we don't want you to feel the burden of finances right now."" In the past year I made about $4000 which I used mainly for food although I did use a good portion of it to buy (craigslist) furniture for my apartment and clothes for work. 

All I want right now is to be independent, but I know that is not possible at all. My rent comes to around $720/month, and other living expenses usually around $250-300. My parents make over $150,000 combined so I do not qualify for any financial aid, despite the fact that they are in tons of debt and are barely paying for me. 

I'm willing to take out loans, and I've told them this, but they're just dragging their feet along telling me its going to be okay when I'm getting more and more behind. I'm starting an unpaid internship in the fall and will have to cut my hours at work even more, so I'm really looking to get some sort of financial support soon. 


Are there any private loans I can take out? Do I have to have a cosigner? (My parents have horrible credit so..) 


(Also would like to point out I offered to have my boyfriend move in with me to cut the rent in half as we've been dating for over two years and plan to get engaged within the next year, but they allow it while they're paying for it, so theoretically if I was paying for myself rent would be significantly lower.)

**TLDR: My parents make a lot of money, but are hesitant and in too much dept to actually support me right now so I'm looking for other options.** "

Idealy I would like a to make a search bar in my excel, where I can input the stock I want options data on, and use that search to query a web pull of options data going 6, 12 and 18 months out

I can get the current months options data, but I dont know how to also import data contracts with later expiris .... meaning I can import the table for July 2013 options (this month), but I really only want January 2014 and January 2015 options for this model. Currently I use web queries (where you check the box for which data you want), but would like a more automated process .... input stock symbol and it pulls the data in... I think this involves creating macros? I have a few weeks to learn and a few very smart interns to help with the heavy lifting

Any help or pointers welcome! 

Thanks!

I've just graduated from undergrad:

* with a 2.8 GPA
* some research experience, but no published papers
* one outside internship 
* computer science

I'm going to grad school in a few months for a masters:

* local state school, ranked much lower than my undergrad
* computer science


What should I do at this point, if I want to get into a good PhD program for either computer science or economics?
I'm thinking of:

* bonding with the professors more for recommendations (never talked to professors that much in undergrad)
* making sure to maintain a good GPA (i often took too many classes at once in undergrad)
* study hard for the GRE and get a good score on it

I know that my low undergrad GPA will probably hurt me.  Will a high masters GPA be able to ""offset"" a lower undergrad GPA?  Do I even have a chance of getting into a top school like Stanford?  What do admissions officers usually look at?  I'm interested in applying computer science concepts to economics, so I'd be happy getting into a PhD program for either of those fields, but will my lack of an undergraduate degree in the subject hurt my chances of getting into a good econ program?"

* My overall GPA is 3.0. My CompSci GPA is probably 2.25-2.5, I haven't calculated it. But it's low. 

* The short and sweet story is I have spent the past 4 years of college having severe depression / suicidal tendencies and substance abuse problems, and have basically skated by as much as possible. I have taken this summer to get professional help and sort out these issues, and I feel I am ready to enter my fifth and final year and do the best I possibly can.

* I have nothing CompSci related to put on my resume. I have no internships and no completed projects.

Basically, if I don't take this next year to buckle down and do well, I feel I will be in a severely bad place come graduation. I don't want that to happen. I know I have a lot of work ahead of me, but I want to make the most of my time and do my best I can with the bad situation that I am in.

* Should I focus on one language (say Java or C++) and look to make as much content as possible in those languages?
* Am I really as screwed as I think I am? On one hand I am an 'undesirable' candidate and I have no false hopes of working for someone like Google or Facebook. However, at the same time it seems the job market is in desperate need for programmers. Will I be 'okay'?"

I'm 21, I have a GED and I simply don't know how to progress forward anymore. I have't made any significant advancements towards my life and professional career. Four months ago, I left the only thing  going for me at the moment.

It was a program called Year Up, through a local community college. Where they train, pay and intern you on Desktop Support (A+). It's WAY much more in depth than that description, but it ultimately geared you towards getting a decent job. Before I got accepted, I was finishing my GED and I decided to follow this path thinking it's good enough for me.

I quickly concluded and followed my guts, I did not wanted to go into Networking or Desktop Support. I want to make my ideas come true, through software. But here I am now, no job and no training...

I want a career that I love, that field is technology; more importantly it's software. I want to join the Web and Mobile platforms as a developer. I want to make between $60k to $80k...

I understand these things take time, but damn it I want to do something about it now, before I forget the clock is ticking and notice I'm in my 30's and I still haven't done nothing. I understand that some people are lucky enough to not go through college and learn everything on their own, but I'm not that guy.

I feel like I have no sense of direction, I'm hungry for something much more but nothing seems to stand out for me. Don't know where to go from here...No mentors, no friends, nothing to pull ideas from. I've read as much as I could, but my mind feels cluttered with so many options. I just don't know.

The mudstone formed in an ancient river system or an intermittently wet lake bed that could have provided the chemical energy and other favorable conditions for microbial life, if life existed then. This ancient wet environment was not harshly oxidizing, acidic or extremely salty.  All the necessary chemical building blocks were available.   (JC)

Mars does not have a global magnetic field the way Earth does, which helps shield the atmosphere from stripped away by the sun's damaging radiation. So while there is plenty of CO2 and H20 ice, no liquid is possible.  If life arose on Mars, it would have been millions or even billions of years ago, and preserving evidence of life for billions of years is very hard.

I majored in Mechanical Engineering but any science, engineering, programming job would be an option on the technical side. - MR.
 |Update: Hi Everyone, I'm so glad there's so much interest! Definitely check out or online applications: [Link to careerlaunch.jpl.nasa.gov](https://careerlaunch.jpl.nasa.gov). Read through job descriptions and see what requirements there are for the types of positions you are interested in. That may help you decide on a major. As a high school or college student you can apply for internships or co-ops. There are several hundred summer interns on lab right now. I've met a few high school students but college students are more common. Look on the career launch website, Space Grants: [Link to www.jpl.nasa.gov](http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/education/index.cfm?page=35)  or SURF programs: [Link to www.surf.caltech.edu](http://www.surf.caltech.edu/.)
 |From an engineering side, it is common for employees to get hired on with a Bachelor's or Maser's degree. Higher degrees are more common on the science side, though you see a mix of everything. It is also fairly common for co-ops and interns to convert to full-time employees so I really recommend looking into those options. I myself did 2, 6-month long co-ops before I started full time. It was a great way to see what the job entailed and make connections that would help me get a full-time offer.
 |For those of you mentioning Purdue, I know many Purdue Alumni working at JPL. Cornell, RPI, Caltech, Stanford, Georgia Tech, and Cal Poly Pomona are popular but people come from all over. I graduated from Northeastern University with a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering.
 |I hope this helps. Good luck to you all. With enough ambition and hard work I'm sure you can land your dream job!  -MR.

Miniaturization of electronics has been helpful for medical devices that can be implanted into bodies or for arthroscopic surgery, satellites in orbit that support your cell phone or weather forecasts are two easy spin-offs that help all of us.  Also we can answer some fundamental questions about whether we are alone in the universe! - SM.
 |Fascinating results or pictures of beautiful scenery can provide a sense of excitement, awe, and wonder in the public, making them more interested in learning about ""how things work"" and could encourage more young people to be interested in science and engineering, causing some of them to change career paths.   This is important because science and technological innovation are critical to our economic prosperity and national security.  Results from space missions can provide positive news that makes us proud of what humankind has accomplished, and shows the world that we’re still interested in exploring new frontiers and learning more about how the Universe works.  The Curiosity mission has contributions from 8 other countries (Spain, Russia, France, Canada, Germany, Finland, Mexico, Switzerland) and joint efforts like this can help bolster international cooperation.

 |For me landing was the most intense moment. We all gathered together with all the team members who had put so much into this mission that we were on the edge of our seats waiting to hear how the 7 minutes of terror would end. The feeling when we got that first photo back of the wheel on the ground was one of the greatest feelings in the world - MR.
 |For me it was getting ready for launch - I worked on the Cruise ops team before getting to support Surface and that was the first big deadline where we had to be ready or miss the opportunity for another 2 years! EH.
 |On Sol 200, we had a hardware problem on the rover that then caused the software to not work properly.  After looking at the data, we decided the safest thing to do would be to swap to the back-up computer that didn't have the problem.  We did this as soon as we could by getting a large (70m) station over Madrid and sending hardware commands that bypassed software to swap computers.  We then had to wait the round trip light time (~ 30 minutes at the time) to get the signal that it had all worked fine.  It did and now we are on the back-up computer!  JHT.
 |For me, waiting for the MastCam picture of material in the scoop from our first drill hole in the John Klein rock in Yellowknife Bay was pretty intense.

1jd9wo,3,2013-07-30,Transitioning from Programmer to DBA need tips,desiktar,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1jd9wo/transitioning_from_programmer_to_dba_need_tips/,"I have been working as a Programmer Analyst for over 5 years.  Originally I wanted to be a DBA (my degrees are BS in CIS and MS in IS), fell into the programmer role through an internship.

At my current work environment we don't have any DBA's and the programmer do all the DBA work.  In addition I have been to relevant trainings.  So I think I am qualified to apply to some of the DBA postings I have been seeing.

My questions are

*  How should I setup my resume?  Should I only speak about DBA type work or should I include analyst/programming examples.

* I only have had 1 job since graduation, should I list education and work first, then fill the rest of the page with relevant accomplishments?

*  Also for sites like Indeed the couple of postings I have seen only had a spot to attach my resume, should I include a cover letter in the file or not send one?  Most of the posting I see are through hiring firms.

1jd7cl,2,2013-07-30,[Resume question] two page resume... can it be pulled off or is it a serious faux pas? (x-post from /r/interviewfauxyou),turkycat,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1jd7cl/resume_question_two_page_resume_can_it_be_pulled/,"I have a resume with a very unique and clever design. I used it last year at a career fair and got 6 interviews for internships (which led to 5 eventual offers). I received countless compliments on the design, but also got at least two negative comments due to the fact that the resume extended to two pages. One recruiter (from IBM) cringed at the 2nd page, but then suggested that if I have a two page resume to duplex print (front and back) rather than using a staple as I had done at that particular career fair.  
 
the concept- I am a computer science student. I have designed a resume which looks like a computer program. The header of the resume is designed to look like a program being compiled and executed, whereas the rest of the resume then looks like console output. The design is very clever for my technical field, as pretty much every recruiter I have given my resume to will instantly recognize the theme I am going for, and I am very often complimented on the design.  
 
the issue- I am a very active college student, I am involved in several on campus clubs, a teaching assistant, and have a fair amount of professional experience (both internships, campus jobs, and a previous career I began before I returned to school) which quickly consumes a lot of space on the resume. Even after drastic chopping of extra wording and entire sentences, my entire work history falls onto the second page of the resume.  
 
Am I severely crossing an expected boundary here, or does my awesome design and considerable work history make up for the fact that the length is unorthodox?"

And also actively worked on some of my side projects.
Everything was going fine, but now the vacations are over and college has started, I feel overwhelmed with the things on my todo list, and there are days when i just give up.

So I am looking for some suggestions by more learned men/women, to help me out here.

* Should I cancel my internship without shipping a final product, which I can add to my resume, something I worked my ass off in the summers ?

* Should I stop working on my side projects, which is something I really really enjoy doing ?

* I surely can't ignore my college education, so that is out of the option.

1jcs83,11,2013-07-30,Melody,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jcs83/melody/,"I guess it began when I was 6. It didn't feel like anything 'started' at the time, but it was at that age I first experienced the melody. I should note, the only reason I know these events aren't a fabrication my memories assembled is the recent dreams I've had, but we'll get there.


When I was 6 years old, my little brother and sister, twins, had just been born. Up until then I had been sharing a room with my older sister, 8 years old. But when my brother and sister arrived, they took our room and my sister and I had to sleep in the living room. If you were anything like me as a kid, you know that this was *awesome.* My late nights often consisted of repeat viewings of the Jamie Foxx Show, laid out on the floor with my toes perched on the TV power button, ready to shut it off ninja-style before my parents were any the wiser.

Besides the obvious benefit of late night TV, something about sleeping in the living room made night time not so scary. After all, mom and dad were right in their room down the hallway, ready to save me from any evils my imagination plagued me with. I felt safe.


A few months after the twins were born, my parents built my older sister and I rooms in the attic. I hated those rooms, and was happy to go when I turned 18 and left for college. The room had ample floor space, but the ceiling was angled with the roof, and only 5' tall at the highest point along the middle of the room. The only window was at the far end of the room opposite the door and was claustrophobically small. Everything was new and scary, and I longed for the nights when my parents were right around the corner.


My new room made my almost nightly trips to the bathroom a dreaded routine: creep quietly downstairs so I don't wake my parents, use the bathroom and finally sprint back up the stairs and into my room without looking back at the beasties I was sure were nipping at my heels. 


So on the night in question, I woke up with my bladder ready to burst, but it wasn't what woke me up. Instead, I'd been roused by the sound of a very soft, gentle lullaby-like melody. I remember upon waking up feeling a comforting warmth wash over me. I reasoned that if music was playing, one of my parents was likely awake, which meant that no monster in the world could touch me. Not even bothering to turn lights on at this point, I practically danced with the music to the bathroom. I did my business, but noticed on the way out that my parent's room was absolutely dark, and, thinking back on it now, the music didn't seem to be coming from there anyway. A little scared, I walked into my parents' room and gently shook my mom awake.


""Mama? I think you left the radio on.""


She rubbed her face, sighed and still wasn't awake enough to say more than 'what ra- what?' 


""Somebody left their music on... it's pretty piano music.""


And it *was* pretty. I didn't and still don't know the tune, but whatever it was had a profoundly... fundamental familiarity the significance of which I didn't and still don't understand. 


My mom assured me everything was turned off, and insisted there was no music. I tried to convince her, but she just sent me off to bed. I decided I'd just try to go back to sleep, because the music didn't seem too loud and I was very tired. Of course, I was scared to walk around the pitch dark house with my parents asleep, and so I ran as fast as I could. When I got to  the stairs, I stubbed my toe and 'fell up' the stairs onto my elbows and shins. Pain shot through my body, and as if to reflect my agony, the music I'd been listening to changed to organ music so loud that it filled every inch of me. I couldn't get up off the stairs and so I screamed, more scared than I'd ever been. 


My parents came running to me, inspecting me for scrapes and bruises. I was hysterical, crying about the piano music and asking them to turn it off. My parents were helpless until my sister turned on the light at the top of the stairs, and the music finally stopped. I cried and cried, finally finding sleep at the foot of my parents' bed. 


I had frequent night terrors as a child, but nothing this severe. My parents remember it as the night my terrors began, but it seems like more to me. Anyway, I eventually grew out of them like any child. I suppose anything could have caused my hallucinations, assuming that's what they were. My parents owned an old piano, and we had this creepy painting of a church on the living room wall... but neither of those gave me the feeling I got from that tune. Frankly, they seem too obvious and cheesy to really be the source of my horror. This is still a mystery.


___________________________________________



So I eventually outgrew my night terrors and had a pretty normal life, until now. I moved out at 18 and headed to college. This fall will start my 3rd year at university, and for the summer I'm staying at my parents' house while I work. I've been sleeping on the couch most of the summer. My mom kept apologizing for storing stuff in my room, but I didn't mind. I didn't want to sleep in there anyway. Yesterday, unfortunately, my dad surprised me by cleaning it out. 


I haven't had night terrors, or even especially bad nightmares since I was a kid, but last night has me shaking just thinking about it. 


The dream began as if I'd woken up normally. I got up, showered, got dressed, brushed my teeth, ate breakfast. I got to work and sat on reddit until it was time to leave and then headed to my friends' house for beers and a blunt. Frankly, I was having a good day at first. It was dark when I left my friend's house and things started getting weird. I tried to turn on the radio but it wouldn't play, and all my mirrors were matte gray, with no reflection. I made it home and the second my house was in view, the melody began. I hardly recognized it at first, but when I did I got uneasy. Each movement that took me closer to the house seemed to increase the music's volume. The closer I got the door the more I felt like I shouldn't be there... like I didn't belong, even though this was my childhood home.


I walked in and by now the music drowned everything out. My parents mouthed words, but all I heard was my own haunting lullaby. As I finally headed to my room for bed, the music got louder. When I touched the doorknob, the piano again became an organ and seemed to swallow me up.


I swung the door open and looked at my bed. There, lying asleep was...me. Exactly as I'd gone to bed last night. I inched closer toward myself, fascinated to see my own face without a mirror. I got to the side of the bed when a floorboard creaked beneath my foot. The me lying in bed jerked violently awake and stared directly at me. At that same instant, I jerked awake from the dream and found myself in bed, staring at the spot where I'd just been standing in my dream. No one was there. I was alone. But my door was open, and I was sure I'd closed it last night. 


Now I suppose this could just be a dream. It isn't crazy to think my brain would call on past horror in a dream, especially when I'm back in a familiar place like I am. 


There is something about this tune, though... I know it, but I couldn't reproduce it if I tried. It seems somehow... basic. Primal. I can't describe it. 


I'm at work now, and even my coworkers whistling makes me jump. My boss thinks I'm high or something and if anyone knew I was on reddit, I'd probably get some shit, being the intern. I might just be scaring myself, but it doesn't feel like it will stop here. Something is coming."

I realize this isn't as pressing as a lot of the issues on the sub, but I could use some impartial opinions. 

In April of this year, I deferred a final exam to August because I was feeling overwhelmed. As August gets closer, I find myself with a bit of a dilemma - it's important that I study for this exam, but with the way my schedule is currently set up, I would have to study during the night, which I don't think would be as effective as if I were to study in the morning or early afternoon.

So, my courses of action are either: 1.) leave work on the 9th of August and study unperturbed for a week, or 2.) leave work on the 15th of August and study a bit less effectively. It comes down to an academic versus a financial decision, and all the friends I've asked fall on either side of it.

I was just wondering what some anonymous folks had to say about it because I'm having a rough time coming up with a choice.

Thanks!

EDIT: Some additional information. I'm 19 and this is a typical intern tech job. Not a massive amount of money/week, but money nevertheless."

1jbx4e,2,2013-07-30,"Best choice of email address/domain to put on resume for entry-level software engineer, web developer, etc? (also: should I include unrelated jobs on my resume?)",scootey,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jbx4e/best_choice_of_email_addressdomain_to_put_on/,"Hey /r/cscareerquestions:

Two questions. First is rather long.

**First question:**

**TL;DR:** what sorts of domains/email addresses would be best (or worst) to put on a resume or otherwise give to an employer?

I have a ""personal"" email account that I use for people I know well, and many of my online activities. Throughout college, I treated my university (.edu) email address as the one I used for academic and career/job-related endeavors. But now that I'm out of college, chances are that I won't have it forever. And I probably should have just used my own email to begin with.

Anyway, I decided to get my own domain name for the email/website that I give to prospective employers or otherwise put on my resume. Here are the ones that I own and am deliberating amongst:

* *Lastname*.org. It's a relatively uncommon surname, so there were some domains available to register.. Other available possibilities include *Lastname*.net and *Lastname*.us. (*Lastname*.com is taken by an email service that's had it forever and probably won't be dumping it anytime soon.)

* *FirstnameLastname*.com. This is a bit longer than I'd like, around 15 characters or so. Tedious and boring in a sense, too.

* *Firstname*.im. This is what I'm leaning towards. My first name is very common in the US and unavailable on almost every TLD, but I managed to get *Firstname*.im. The registration isn't even that expensive (compared to some TLDs) at $15-20/yr. The .im extension may seem obscure to some; it's the ccTLD for the Isle of Man. The "".im"" TLD seems fairly marketable for English speakers; think ""i'm/I am"", ""IM"", etc. But might the less tech-savvy be suspect of an unfamiliar domain extension? Might I be seen as less ""professional"" than with a typical .com/.net/.org?

    * Also, is it a bad idea to ""market"" myself with my first name like this in the first place?

* *Other possibilities?* Would it possibly be better to use a name that is not related to my real name? Maybe come up with another name to use for email, my ""professional"" portfolio, etc, and use that instead? Or just use a username that I've been using all along?

Also, I would probably end up with an email address like: *Firstname*@*Lastname*.org, me@*FirstnameLastname*.com, me@*Firstname*.im, *Firstname*@*Firstname*.im, etc. Should I avoid ""me"" and the like? Or suggestions on how others do this?

**Second question:**

**TL;DR:** My last job was a customer service job (as an upperclassman), although I had a couple of IT/programming-related jobs before that. Should I list the customer service job on a resume under prior work experience?

Might it be okay/worthwhile to put jobs that aren't related to the field on my resume as previous work experience? Most recently I held a customer service job (gotta pay bills ya know!) But prior to that, I had an IT/programming internship and part-time job that are definitely worth mentioning. I'm thinking I might put the recent service job on for the sake of completeness/full disclosure. And fwiw I left on good terms so I have no worries about them saying bad things about me.

But if it's typical to exclude non-related jobs from ""work experience"", I may consider that. One concern is that they may question why I was working a retail job as a CS upperclassman rather than finding some kind of work coding or etc. On the other hand, I suppose some might find it beneficial if they see it as an indicator of decent people skills or something (although I'm doubtful how many do see it this way). Any ideas?

**Thanks all!**"

I'm preparing coding interview for the intern positions at large software companies. Would it be a bad idea to prepare in ""un-popular"" language such as Objective-c or Golang? In my last internship, I been fixing bug on about to sink framework (upper management want to replace with a newer framework). All I been doing is fixing JavaScript bugs with IE and getting really tried of that piece of sh!t IE. Want to change for the better. I don't have a lot of time either. Need to prepare while working on a full time job.

* I chose these ""un-popular"" language such as Objective-c or Golang because it less error prone, better and easier syntax. Those languages are best for these high pressure situations. Also, show a passion for new technology. 
* I can also see they would be like ""Hey, Buddy! You know C++ or not!?"" ""......""



very biased, I know. Just some of my silly reasons. Can't help it :(



**TL;DR**: prepare for large software code interview, prepare for ""C++""(popular) VS Golang(un-popular)? Time is limited, got about a month.

What do I do now?,IdeallyRelaxed,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jbk1i/graduating_with_a_degree_in_a_major_that_only/,"I'm into my senior year of college now, and I am now realizing that I have spent the past 3 years of my life studying a major that will most likely get me nowhere in the field that I want to get into, programming. After spending the past couple of months interning under a designer doing some creative work while also doing some work on their website, I have realized that I absolutely detest the creative work and I love the coding work. I like to create more than I like to be creative.

My major taught me pretty much the most generic overview of coding in some basic markup languages (HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc.) and designing websites. At the time, I thought it was genius because I was going to be able to design and implement the websites that I created. After I had my realization at the internship though, I realized that this was crap and spent most of the rest of my summer learning everything on codeacademy.com. After doing that, I realized that I simply just learned the syntax of the different languages while being taught the basics of coding over and over again.

Now that I want to get more into computer science, how do I do it without completely breaking the bank? I don't have time to pick up another major, and I don't have money to stay another year or two at my school. The only thing I can think of doing is going to a trade school at night while I HOPEFULLY find a place that can hire me. Any thoughts?"

Significant background:

* I've worked at my company for almost 10 years. Last year I applied for a promotion at a store 2 miles from my house. Got the promo, and was never trained for the position. Tried my hardest to learn ""on the job"" but there's a lot of SOP that gets really intricate, especially in my position, and I don't know all of the answers.

* I have an assistant who is also brand new to the job, from another department, also untrained. I was brought on, and one of my tasks was to get her trained to take over a position on my level within 6months. 

* I have worked for almost 7 out of the past 13 months without an immediate superior who, in most similar stores' cases, is there to train, help, direct, delegate etc. Someone had filled the position in February, but she works in our corporate offices 2 days (soon to be 3) out of every week. In my job performance failings (mentioned below) I had constantly asked her for help in how to improve, to which she shrugged her shoulders numerous times. 

* Two weeks ago, (7/16) my district manager pulled me into his office to tell me that my performance (specifically my quantifiable performance indicators) had not been where it should be, and that he would give me the option of: transferring me to a smaller store, offering me a voluntary demotion, or transferring me to a store 1.5 hours away from my house. 

* This was the first time I had been sat down and told of my myriad shortcomings. I had no idea that this type of conversation was on the horizon. Admittedly I knew I was falling short in some areas, because I didn't have the knowledge or experience to handle the majority of situations I experienced exclusively to this position, but in no way did I think that this lack of training would ever result in a performance-based transfer. I had requested formal training some half-dozen times over the past year, though it was never granted me due to payroll constraints. 

* (7/23) In our next meeting, I told him that I refused to move stores, as my poor performance was directly related to a lack of training for the position to which I was promoted. He said that refusal was not an option. I said that I refused to concede failure, as I am very hardworking, dedicated, and ready to take on the job (in my current store) with the fine-tuning that I need to succeed and otherwise I would be set up for failure. I indicated that if the company did not see fit to accommodate these requests, they would have to fire me.
* At this point, my DM said that as a salaried associate, I didn't have a choice, and that since I refused to move, they would be firing me later in the week. 

* Friday 7/26 at 4pm I still hadn't heard anything, so I sent an e-mail to my Regional VP asking for clarification on my situation. He was unable to advise me. All that he said was that my director of HR would be coming out this coming Monday (8/5) to sit down with me. I'm still not sure what that means. 

* Since all of this has transpired, I no longer feel any attachment for this company. I have already moved my wedding date twice, and prolonged graduation from college as a result of the endless hours I put in trying to do what is best for the store. The day that my DM told me I would be fired later in the week, I registered for college full time, and started looking for internships. Now it sounds like the company higher-ups are backpedaling. I feel that my DM spoke out of turn when he told me I would be fired. I have no intention of quitting (I want to collect unemployment until I find another job/internship, and to do this I must be fired) Now I worry that in my meeting with HR on Monday, they will say that they are not going to fire me, even though my subsequent actions were entirely based on taking my District Manager at face value, and acting as a person whose job was no longer viable. 

* P.S. All conversations (with the exception of the first one--I was totally blindsided by it) have been recorded in accordance with NYS wiretapping/recorded conversation law. 

* Do I have a case to demand termination? I have already made plans for myself with the understanding that I was effectively fired. I have worked too long and too hard to kowtow to a company that so clearly sees me as expendable after almost a decade of dedicated service. I now feel it is time to get my life in order, and in doing so, I would like to know if I will be able to receive unemployment assistance until such time as I am able to find appropriate work. 

tl;dr Apparently I am living the life of George Costanza.  "

I'm a canadian student entering my fourth (and final) year of SE in September.  My school isn't very well known for CS/SE so I want to do everything I can to ensure I get a good first job to build a reputation.

I have a decent amount of experience.  This summer I am a software developer working in a medium-sized agile team at a large, non-tech company.  I worked for the university as a software developer on a two month contract before I left for that internship (I'll probably be returning to the position is September).  The previous summer I was a software intern at a small healthcare IT firm.

Right now, I'm rebuilding my resume (based on the one from careercup), creating a personal website for myself, and improving my github.  I'm also updating my LinkedIn and started adding co-workers and classmates.  I had a couple interviews last year with the big guys (MS and AMZN) and got nailed on the technical stuff, so I've picked up PIE and CCI, bought a white board, and started working through the problems.  I've also become an executive at SE club at my university, to gain some volunteer experience.

What other things should I be doing that I'm not currently doing right now?  Should I be adding recruiters on LinkedIn and stuff?  Ideally I'd like to get a job in the states (higher pay).  My long-term GF is an american citizen and will hopefully be my green card, but she doesn't graduate until 2015 so in the interim I'll need an H1-B.

I am a mobile dev intern at a local company and I plan to stay here for the rest of the year, build up solid experience at the company, apply to next summer's internship opportunities this fall and see what happens.

My college posts quite regularly, on their careers development page, full-time/part-time(entry-level) jobs and internships local companies are looking towards college students to fill. My college hands the resumes (small college, less CS students more-so) themselves to the hiring manager and almost guaranteed an interview, rather than an online blackhole process.

My question:
Would it be wrong, or dangerous to apply to those positions in order to gain interview experience? I'm currently an entering sophomore, and I don't have much experience in that realm, especially technical interviews. I would take it as a learning experience for my (possible) interviews later in the year, when it really counts.

Again, I don't have a master plan of doing this, but it popped in my head and I wanted professional opinions. I don't plan jumping internships, just simple experience.
