If I posted this in the wrong sub, I will post it in the appropriate one.

Hello, I self-taught myself C++ and that's all I've really known in regards to programming languages. Im a CS major and currently taking my classes but its still in C++ and going over things I've already taught myself. Since its going to be my junior year I need to get started on my actual career choices along with internships and what to focus on learning next on my own time. I have a couple of questions:

* Most of my professors say that a lot of people wont get into the actual coding aspect in the Computer Science degree but may do other jobs related to them. Can anyone elaborate on what they meant or were they wrong?

* My assumption most programming work is split between: Web-based development or regular application development and then it goes into front-end and back-end for each of them. How did most of you decide between them? What programming languages should I look into that would help me decide what I like best?

* When talking about job security, is it better to know a little bit of everything or focus down on a certain aspect like Web-based back end development, etc?

* This one is unrelated to the others but since I want to try using API from companies like, [Riot API](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/getting-started) and [Youtube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/), can I do any of this with C++ or is C++ meant more for regular desktop applications? I know it can be done with languages like Ruby, PHP, Java, etc. but since I dont have alot of knowledge with anything other than some C++, I dont know what's the best language to choose.

Any help with any of these questions would be greatly appreciated."

I am a current Junior with double major Comp Sci and Math. I just accepted an offer to be a technical analyst intern this summer at Goldman Sachs. This is my first internship but I'm also my school's Google Student Ambassador. As much as I enjoy my classes, I think I'd rather be a Program/Project Manager. My school offers the option to get a 5th year MBA so I take a few business classes next year and then finish it in one more full year of school. If I did this, I would have one more summer to intern somewhere. The only PM internship I've seen is from Microsoft. Are there others? And, the real question, is getting an MBA and a second internship (hopefully a PM-specific one) worth delaying going into the workforce by another year? I regret not having more internships and I'm worried that my lack of professional experience will make it harder to find a good job as a new grad PM.

Thanks!"

I know this sounds kind of irrational and dumb, but I am a college senior at a pretty decent university and I am set to graduate come this spring (4 months). I've been applying to spring internships right now because my course load is very very light (barely any class), being my last semester and all. However, it seems that when I get a phone interview I do really well...until I get an email to move on to the next round...then I get all anxious, doubtful, and have a mini freak out. I don't know why I do this exactly.    
I have had many doubts about myself. :(   

Last summer I successfully secured an internship after doing the whole apply, cancel interview cycle with many other companies.  For some odd reason, I was feeling very confident (though still scared) and actually went it and did it.    

I think I'm scared of not doing well? Not getting along with he company culture? Scared that I'll hate it and regret it? I know that by cancelling all these interviews I'm just harming myself. I'm letting so many opportunities slip by, and I am really at a loss right now. I do get mild social anxiety...however it NEVER shows (or what I've been told). I feel like it's all in my head. Also the doubting my abilities aspect too. I feel like these doubts keep on manifesting itself in my mind, and I'm starting to feel so doubtful about everything....relationships, friends, career prospects, life.   


What do I do? I don't want to come off as ungrateful, because I really am not!! I just don't know why moments like these come and take over my rational side. When my friends ask, ""how'd the interview(s) go?"" I usually lie and said it went okay...though I really cancelled. 


I think I have a problem. I'm afraid these actions are really hurting me, both in the short run and long run....can anyone please give me some advice? Anyone been in the same situation? 


It's really taking a toll on me :(

I am currently in my third year and last year of Bachelor in Computer Science in Switzerland and I am planning on doing a 2 year Master afterwards at the same university. I want to find an internship for this summer but have no idea where to look really, other than the big companies.

I was wondering if its uncommon for internships to be done at something else than the ""big"" companies. The local job search sites do return job offers for developpement but not any internships.

The college doesn't seem to give much info either. There was a sort of a fair during the semester which I couldn't attend, and job postings on a special site for people from the school do not seem to yield any internships either.

Any advice?"

Trying to find out the most effective balance between being over-selective when looking for openings, and spamming resumes.",meldroc,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/43qywo/jobhunt_strategy_trying_to_find_out_the_most/,"One critique I seem to get from time to time, as I struggle with my job search is that I get over-selective when it comes to picking which openings to apply for.

Sure, I've got qualifications (master's degree in public administration, GIS certification, some paid, volunteer, and internship experience), but it seems like every job opening out there looks something like

&gt; REQUIRED:
&gt; 
&gt; * 15 years of experience straight out of college
&gt; * Fluent in 12 languages
&gt; * Experience writing nuclear reactor control code
&gt; * 5 years experience as an astronaut on the International Space Station
&gt; * etc.
&gt; 
&gt; UNDERQUALIFIED APPLICANTS WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED...

So my friends tell me I need to be sending out five hundred resumes a week to every job opening on the boards - apply in volume.

Except I've come to the conclusion that resume-spamming doesn't get you there either.

So, what IS effective? It seems that if I go by qualifications and look for positions I actually am qualified for, there's hardly any positions out there at all, but if I just apply for everything, all I'm doing is getting spam-filtered by the resume-processing bots that HR departments love to use.

What's actually effective at getting me an offer and a paycheck?"

43rz8p,16,2016-02-01,My experience with online dating,IamClarkBane,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/43rz8p/my_experience_with_online_dating/,"A few years back I began messaging a girl from an online dating website - Soulsearch. Our courtship only lasted a few months, but it will undoubtedly haunt me for the rest of my life. Sometimes, often even, I lie awake and hold back a fit of screams as I ponder what difference I could have made had I only read the signs. 
I’ve just returned to my apartment after seeing my long time therapist, whom I can barely afford because I don't have any insurance. He tells me her mental condition was rare and that my PTSD is treatable, but any relief I've felt has been fleeting. 
It occurred to me that sharing my correspondence with Jenna with the rest of the world might do me some real good. What do I have to lose, right? For years now I couldn’t bear the thought of logging into Soulsearch and facing my message history, but in order to write this, I mustered my courage and logged back in.   
					
I used to work in the public library. It certainly wasn't exciting work, but it suited me, as I could often find a few hours to sneak away and do some personal reading. Typically, the women who come into libraries are mostly mothers and children. Unlike a campus library at a college, my library, being in the inner-city, was normally completely void of women in their mid-twenties. 

One particularly nice spring afternoon, I was restocking a shelf in the western section of our bookcases (one of my favorites) when the most stunning woman I'd ever laid eyes on strolled in and plopped down on the blue upholstered couch we had situated in our reading corner. She was tall, thin and had a cascade of thick brown hair flowing behind her as she sauntered through the nearly empty lobby. I nearly froze as her eyes met mine, and immediately I became a lustful shell of a man, spending the better part of an hour sneaking glances at her as she sat cross-legged with a copy of some cheesy erotica novel spread across her lap. I can't recall the name, but if you're thinking something in the vein of Fifty Shades, you're not far off the mark. 
Eventually, after realizing I was getting none of my work done, I had a moment of self-reflection and worked up the courage to approach her. The conversation was short, and probably awkward, considering my heart felt like it was climbing the walls of my throat in a desperate attempt to flee my body, but despite this my exterior remained as cool and collected as could be expected. I asked if she'd like to have coffee with me when I finished my shift in half an hour. I remember she closed her book and her eyes fluttered up to mine as an endearingly crooked smile crept across her face. She’d said she’d love to.	

Unfortunately, but not unexpectedly, things turned out to be too good to be true. As my shift ended, things seemed to be going well. We strolled down the street and had a refreshingly intellectual conversation. She had recently returned from a backpacking trip through South America, and her worldliness only served to strengthen my infatuation with her. We got to the local Perk and our warm heartfelt conversation continued until a man approached our table and slid into the booth next to her. I had just finished reminiscing about a trip to Iceland I had taken the summer prior and was stopped mid-sentence as he brushed her hair from her cheek and kissed it. Her boyfriend. What is wrong with some women? The rest is just a blur of awkward floundering and some lame excuse to run for the hills, I'm sure. 

When I arrived back at my flat I was an emotional wreck, so naturally, I immediately went to the cupboard and poured myself a large glass of scotch. I downed it, then poured another, then another. Swaying back and forth, jittery and mad, an idea erupted into the forefront of my mind: Online dating. 

For the next few hours, my fingers pounded away at my keyboard. I created a profile and sifted through hundreds of potential women. Soulsearch was just like any other dating website. They ask you questions: How important is a religion to you? And you respond accordingly. Your responses are recorded and then amalgamated into a portrait of your personality. They then attempt to find local women who they deem suitable for you. As you might expect, in a typical testosterone-fueled fashion, I disabled this algorithm immediately so I might get a more superficial glimpse at what was out there. After perusing for some time, I found a couple women that I found incredibly attractive but soon realized that one was a religious zealot and the other had a disconcerting passion for all things equine. Disheartened, and convinced that no truly attractive women could possibly connect with me on a deep level of intellectual compatibility, I slowly moved my cursor up to the top right-hand corner of the screen. However, just before I managed to close the window, I received a pop-up notification explaining that I had received a personal message. Intrigued, I immediately opened it. Jenna. A picture of her perfect face filled my screen. Large brown eyes sat atop her impossibly wide cheekbones which were touched with a light dusting of brown freckles. Her lips were full, and her skin was endearingly bronzed. A plume of mocha colored hair cascaded down her face and ran across her thin shoulders. I couldn’t believe my luck -100 percent match.

Keith,
I'm relatively new to the whole internet dating scene but noticed we had nearly everything in common. Can you believe it? One big problem, though, whoops! I noticed I had forgotten to change my home address after my recent move to Chicago, so I'm no longer in Boston. I hope that isn't a deal breaker because you look really cute! Message me? 
June 6, 2011, 1:42 A.M.
Jenna,
You’re killing me, really? The one girl on Soulsearch whose favorite film is also Un Chien Andalou, and you’ve just moved? What a bummer. I suppose it isn’t necessarily a deal breaker. 
June 6, 2011, 1:52 A.M.
Keith,
Great! I just moved here and am working as a surgical intern. What do you do? 

I was still typing when a trickle of sunlight fluttered through the slit in my blinds. We had been awake all night, but I wasn’t even tired. I had never met nor talked to another human being that understood me on such a deep, intimate level. Religion? Check. Music? Check. Political policy? Check. What had I done to deserve this?

June 6, 2011, 5:52 A.M
Jenna,
Wow! I can’t believe you’ve always wanted to travel to New Zealand. I didn’t put that in my profile, but I’ve been saving to go there for the better part of this year. I don’t want to come off too forward, but I noticed your profile only has two close-up shots of your face. Here're a couple pictures of me in Iceland last summer. Think you could send me a few more pictures of yourself? 
June 6, 2011, 5:55 A.M
Keith, 
Maybe if things keep going this smoothly we can go to NZ together! I’ve attached a few more pictures of myself. Clothes on obviously, yah creep. =]

Attached to the message were two more pictures that were eerily similar to the first. Same bronzed skin, same flowing brown hair, but now the camera was slightly farther away. I could see her upturned breasts behind a pink crop top, but that was it - a face and a torso. The rest of her body was cropped out. I know it’s shallow, but I began to wonder if she didn’t have a bit of a weight problem that she was cleverly hiding. 

June 6, 2011, 5:56 A.M.
Jenna,
Any pictures that aren’t close-ups? Don’t be shy, I’m not shallow. 
June 6, 2011, 6:06 A.M. 
Keith,
I guess with as well as things are going I should probably just come clean, shouldn’t I? My arms, and well, my legs too, they’re horribly disfigured. The skin is marbled and pretty gruesome looking. I typically only wear long sleeve shirts and pants outside, because I’m pretty self-conscience about it. 
June 6, 2011, 6:10 A.M.
Jenna,
I’m really sorry to hear that. Were you born that way? I don’t think you should be self-conscience with me. I’m not in it for the looks. Plus, with that face, you could have tentacles for arms and I’d still take you out.
June 6, 2011, 6:14 A.M.
Keith, 
Lol! You would not! But seriously, though, they’ve been this way as long as I can remember. I won’t show you a picture. Like I said, it’s pretty awful, horribly terrible, actually. If I’m being perfectly honest, I’m mainly interested in online dating, because I hate the thought of anyone seeing them.
June 6, 2011, 6:19 A.M.
Jenna,
Hey now, don’t worry about it. I won’t pressure you into sending me anything you aren’t comfortable with. Consider it forgotten. I meant to ask earlier if you’re into folk music at all. I’ve been…

Things went on like that for the rest of the morning until I eventually passed out at the keyboard. As it turned out, even Jenna wasn’t perfect, and I was okay with that. I’d take a skin condition over a horse obsession any day. 
For weeks, messaging Jenna consumed my life. Our relationship had started to mature, and my day consisted of rushing home from the library to talk to Jenna about the books we were reading together. We had started our own little book club and would exchange notes and talk for hours. It was blissful, truly. The skin condition rarely came up, and if it did I was always sensitive and kind. Perhaps if I had the foresight I would have realized something was awry when she finally sent me her picture, but I don’t believe there was any way I could have known what would unfold. 

July 8th, 2011 3:42 P.M.
Jenna,
Is today the big day? I’m serious when I say you really don’t have to do this. I know this is a big deal for you.  
July 8th, 2011 3:45 P.M.
Keith,
Yes. I think today is the day. I don’t want to keep any secrets from you, but please, if it’s too wretched to look at, take it easy on me. There’s a reason I couldn’t show you before. 

Her message had two attachments with small thumbnails that didn’t reveal much at first glance, being as small as they were. I scrolled down and downloaded them both. Hovering over the files, I prepared myself for the sight I was about to see. When I double clicked the file and the image of Jenna filled my screen, I was dumbfounded. There, before me, standing in the living room of a quaint apartment in the suburbs of Chicago, was a beautiful woman attached to a completely unremarkable set of arms and legs. I couldn’t believe my eyes. 
July 6th, 2011 4:02 P.M.
Jenna, 
So, was this an elaborate scheme to make sure I wasn’t a superficial jerk? I guess I just don’t understand what the big deal was - you look great! Do you have a birthmark or something I can’t see in the pictures?
July 6th, 2011 4:04 P.M.
Keith,
Really? I open up to you and you can’t even be bothered to be sincere? Look, I know how bad it is, and I can take it. Don’t sugar coat it for me, Keith. 
July 6th, 2011 4:05 P.M.
Jenna,
I know you’re sensitive about this, but I am being sincere. You look completely normal. Let’s just move on and talk about something else. Please don’t worry about it! 

I didn’t hear from Jenna for a month after that, and it nearly killed me. I don’t think I’d been that depressed in my entire life, but I knew that pestering her with message after message was not the path to reconciliation. So I was patient and I waited, hoping that she’d message me when she was ready to move forward. Eventually, she did. 

August 2nd, 2011 2:23 P.M
Keith,
I’m sorry about the way we left things. I miss you. I miss talking to you, and I miss our little book club. I’m sorry I haven’t been able to message you sooner, but I’ve been terribly sick. Shortly after our conversation on the sixth, I started getting a terrible stomach ache and couldn’t bear to sit at the computer anymore. I tried to lie down but the pain only got worse. As it turns out, a staph infection had crept into the disfigured portions of my skin. Yikes! Luckily I have some good friends at the hospital who were able to write me a solid prescription and I’ve been recovering from home. Honestly, I’m still feeling pretty weak, but I’ve never felt happier. The treatment actually helped clear up most of the mottling, and I’ve never looked better. I even lost some weight! Can you believe it? Anyways, I know this must come as a shock, and I wish I could have contacted you sooner, but I had hoped you’d come visit me if you haven’t already moved on. I could really use a friendly face around here. 
August 2nd, 2011 2:45 P.M.
Jenna,
I can’t believe this. You’ll have to forgive me but I thought you’d just gone crazy and decided to move on. I’m so happy to hear from you! I can barely type because my hands are shaking. Of course, I’ll come see you. How soon? 
August 2nd, 2011 2:47 P.M.
Keith, 
As soon as possible. =] 

Call me desperate, naïve, pathetic, but I packed my things and booked a flight for the next day. The flight was filled with nervousness and apprehension but was over before I knew it. I was walking down my gate when I realized I had a voicemail from Jenna. She had called while the flight was underway. 
August 3rd, 2011 3:42 P.M. 
Hey, Keith, I know your flight hasn’t arrived yet, but I wanted to let you know that I can’t wait to see you. I thought I’d take you out to dinner and show you around Chi-town. I may be still getting ready when you arrive, though, so don’t be alarmed and just walk right in. My address is 514 W 22nd – Apartment 267 

I had only heard her voice a few other times, but never in a message this long. She sounded odd, faint even. Like she wasn’t fully awake, but I couldn’t tell why. Perhaps she had just awakened from a nap. When that thought crossed my mind it resonated wildly. Here I was visiting some girl I know nearly everything about, but I hadn’t ever seen her in person, nor had I ever carried out a verbal conversation lasting more than a minute. I felt sick and wanted to book a plane back to Boston. I could have told her that I had had a family emergency. My mother was in a car accident, she would understand, right? But I didn’t, I had come too far already. And frankly, I don’t think I could have justified the cost of flying to Chicago without at least meeting her. 

Her apartment was situated on the corner of her city block in a quiet middle-class neighborhood. Two children were playing soccer in a front yard next to her complex. The goal posts had been obviously hand-crafted from PVC pipe by a loving parent. Approaching the apartment, I glanced upward at its beige façade and noticed apartment 267 was visible from the Northern side. The maroon blinds had been drawn tightly shut. 
Like Jenna had explained in the voicemail, her door was unlocked. I knocked a few times to announce myself, and then slowly entered. The apartment had two floors. The bottom was a kitchen and a family room, and the top floor was a lofted bedroom. 

“Jenna?” I called up the stairs, but there was no answer. Loud EDM music flowed down from the upstairs bathroom. It was probably masking my call. I walked halfway up the carpeted stairs and could see light emanating from the crack underneath her bathroom door. Blood rushed to my head as I realized how surreal the situation was. I might as well have been a burglar.  
“Jenna?” I called again, this time, louder. I heard some rustling from the bathroom and she turned the volume down a bit. 
“Uh… He- Hey Keith! I’ll be a little while longer, help yourself to anything in the fridge, I’m so sorry you have to wait for me, just making a few touch ups. I’ll be down in a few.”
Her voice was labored, which concerned me, but I sauntered down the stairwell and made myself at home. She had stylish black granite countertops and a large flat screen TV next to a long leather couch. Sitting on the couch, I sunk in and proceeded to flip through channel after channel nervously waiting. Thirty minutes when by, which led to an hour, which led to two hours. I was frustrated but didn’t really know what to make of the situation. This level of inconsideration was not like Jenna at all, and I figured she was obsessing about her appearance. It was probably her “issues,” so I got up and walked up the stairs, stopping in front of the bathroom door. The EDM was louder now. She had turned it up. It was some new house song that had been released the day before. I recognized it from my RSS feed. Standing in front of the door, I drew in a breath to call for her again when a sound stopped me. Moaning. It was as clear as day - a low, quiet moan. Again, and again. Sex.  

She was cheating on me. I couldn’t believe it. She had invited me here, had me fly halfway across the country to see her, and I was probably one of a dozen guys she’d been corresponding with. He was probably in on it too, and would likely climb out the window when his turn was over. What a god damn joke. My vision turned red, and I couldn’t keep my composure any longer. I charged at the bathroom door and slammed my fists into the wood. 
“I know what you’re doing in there!” I said. 

“No… No… Please don’t come in. I’m, it’s fine we’re almost done.” 
“We’re!? What the fuck Jenna!” 
“It’s not what you think, I swear!”

She was right. It wasn’t. 

Fury overtook me and I kicked in the door with all of my strength. The latch buckled from the force, and the door swung open, careening into a tiled countertop. I locked eyes with Jenna whose pupils had nearly filled her eyes. I couldn’t process what laid before me. The image was there reflecting off of my retina, but some part of me, a subterranean guardian, had its hands clenched around my optic nerves. Black. 
“I wanted to be beautiful for you!” She wailed at me as floodgates opened and torrents of adrenaline rushed into my bloodstream.

I turned around and raced out of that godforsaken apartment. My heart was a V8 with open headers holding 7000 RPM. When I finally stopped running, I collapsed onto a park bench. A metallic taste filled my mouth, and I could barely see. I didn’t know how far I had gone, but that atrocity, that horror. That abysmally tragic thing in the bathroom. It nearly made my heart stop when what I had seen had sunk in. And when it did sink, it sunk deep. 

I had locked eyes with her as she had laid there. Her eyes were surprised, but they betrayed her true emotion, elation. Her skin was pale, the life had been drained out of her, but some sickness was being quelled in the deepest parts of her mind and she was happy. The man with the bone saw had looked back over his shoulder with an expression, not unlike a child being caught with his hand in a cookie jar. He had been diligently working for most of the afternoon.

On the countertop was a polystyrene cooler containing several blood bags, and hanging from the shower head was an intravenous drip. What was left of Jenna had lain in the bathtub. A large Rubbermaid bin stood in the center of the tile floor. It had been filled with all but one of Jenna’s appendages. She was little more than a torso when I saw her. Her last leg had been halfway removed by the man, who was struggling to get through the last inch of her bone. Her skin had been neatly sutured closed around her shoulders and left buttock. Her makeup was done, and a sleeveless dress had been hung from the hook on the wall.

But, if you are fully prepared, you can easily make the transition from home to college life. Take advantage of the following 10 tips to help you get through your college years.

#Stay Organized 

If you are disorganized, you are never going to accomplish anything. The better you are at organizing, and we mean organizing everything, the easier your life, and your college career, are going to be. Keep a weekly planner and write down every important thing that you need to do, from studying for exams to keeping appointments and then some.

#Use Your Resources 

While you are in college, you will have loads of resources available to you, from tutoring to library services to clubs to counseling and more. Take advantage of as many of these resources as possible.

#Get Involved 

While it is never a good idea to take on too much, especially in your first year, you should check out some of the campus clubs and organizations to see what interests you. This is a great way to make new friends, make connections for future employment, etc.

#Get Cheap Textbooks 

Textbooks are ridiculously expensive, but there are plenty of ways to get them without having to pay full price. Check out websites like Textbooks.com, Barnes and Noble, and Amazon. Don’t forget to ask students if they are selling their old textbooks, and look for other ways to get used textbooks.

#Follow Campus Rules

While this may seem like a no-brainer, there are a lot of people who will try and push the boundaries, because they are on their own for the first time. Remember, you are paying good money for your college education. The last thing you want is to get kicked out because you weren’t following campus rules.

#Take Care of Your Pets 

Because studies show that students often perform better when they have pets in their lives, more and more campuses are allowing students to keep small pets in their dorm rooms. If you have a pet, make sure that you take care of its health by having good insurance (start with comparing pet insurance at Pet Insurance University) to pay for vet care.

#Take Advantage of Your Student Discount 

There are loads of places that will offer student discounts, and you can save a lot of money by taking advantage of these discounts. Use as many as are available to you, for everything from school supplies to meals to electronic devices and more.

#Get a Mattress Topper 

Dorm beds aren’t necessarily the most comfortable beds in the world, but you need to get plenty of sleep to do your best in college. You can make your dorm bed a lot more comfortable by investing in a good mattress topper. The more comfortable you are, the more sleep you are going to get, and the more alert you are going to be in classes and when you are studying.

#Check Out Internships – 

If you want to see if you are going to like a career path, an internship is a great way to do it. You get to meet people in the industry, and you will learn a lot. Some companies even offer paid internships. Ask the guidance counselor about internship programs in the area.

#Relax and Enjoy Yourself 

Obviously, your main goal is to graduate and go on to a great career. But, don’t let yourself become overwhelmed by study. You also need to take time out for yourself, so you can relax and do things that you enjoy. If you let yourself get burned out with study and don’t have fun, things may not go as well as you had planned.

Any tips for how to best use my education?,sethosayher,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/43ue61/going_to_school_to_begin_my_2nd_degree_in/,"Let me say from the outset that I've considered bootcamps and getting an MA instead of a second degree, and I may still go that route if the stars align, but I personally prefer the comprehensiveness of a full curriculum.

This is what I've figured out so far about getting a formal Comp Sci Education:

1.) You will not get a job on the merit of your degree alone. Experience goes a very long way, so supplementing your bachelor's with open source projects or internship work can distinguish you from the mass of recent graduates.

2.) It's important to seek out and secure an internship during your summer breaks while studying CS - they give important experience with real world code and may offer you a job if you're a good fit.

3.) Form study groups and social circles within your CS cohort to tackle difficult problems together.

4.) Be prepared to spend at least 10-20 hours a week coding. Maybe aim for a lighter course load if you've got multiple comp sci courses.

5.) Treat your school like a job, or a craft you intend to master. Your education doesn't stop outside the classroom, and it needs to be buttressed by lots of self-study.

Anything you'd add or amend to my list?"

With that said, I want to take these hard CS classes because: 

1. I want to be a GOOD programmer. I'm not satisfied with my programming level right now

2. I can take grad level CS classes next year

3. I can do really well in my internship this summer at FB and also be ready for interviews come senior fall. 

The catch: My GPA right now is 3.50. If I get C's in Operating Systems (it's graded notoriously hard) and B's in the rest of my classes, my GPA will be around 3.1.

43ur7q,2,2016-02-02,[Interview Question] How to design and implement a distributed database?,branchgit,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/43ur7q/interview_question_how_to_design_and_implement_a/,"I got ask this in an interview question from a start up as an about to be new grad. The question is to implement a distributed database with a given set of schema. Although my answer was rejected, I think this was an incredibly interesting question and I would like to know more about the topic. It would be nice if someone can point out my errors in my answers.


So first I started with the basic stuff, 1st, 2nd and 3rd normalization, but then I got stuck on the distributed part. 

So there is multiple problems to consider

1. How do you read from a database
    i. How do you read from a database if you have multiple database with the same data

2. How do you write to a database
    i. How do you split the database if a database gets too large
   ii. How do you write to a database if you have multiple database with the same info.

Here is my final (wrong/rejected by the interviewer, I have no previous database experience class or internship only web dev) answer ,  

Say that you start with one table and one database.

You continue write to a database until the database contains X rows. In this case reading and writing is trivial if you don't have duplicate servers. 

If we have duplicate servers, we should have multiple read servers as slave, and one write server as master. If the master server cannot handle the write volume (Q1. What is the metric, slowness, or perhaps the length of writing queue?) than that means that we should split the database. Here is where the tricky part comes in. Say that a client write to the master and now wants to read their data. Q2. What is the method of propagation, by row? by entire database? If by row we need to check dirty rows, and presumably we need to update multiple rows at the same time and query those rows to update it, this gets very complicated, so I answered by entire database. Now we have a synchronization issue, because if we have slave and master that is out sync we need to update the slave server. Q3. What is the frequency of this update? Imagine if the client is creating an account, ideally we would want to keep the entire write propagation under 4sec. Then the propagation frequency have to be under 4 sec. Assume we split the time cost from master to slave propagation and the entire slave duplication, this means 2 second for master to slave propagation
Lets assume it takes 1sec to write an entire database to slave (Q5. is this even a correct assumption). Then we would have to have a propagation frequency of 2 sec. 

    K
    A B  C D
    - - | - - |     
    1 2  3 4   

Master will propagate at start of second 2 and end at start of second 3. B will not be able to write to server at that time.

At the start of second 3 slave will start replicating to all the duplicate servers, the number of servers we have is 2 to the number of round of replication where number of round of replication is defined by log_2(number of round of replication) * 1 sec/per round = 2 sec, for our case 4 server is replicated, with one root server always busy. So there are 3 servers that we can read from. There are 2second of down time every two second. This also means data is inconsistent. For example if K and A write at the same, and K's input is dependent on A, then we would most likely have wrong answer if K fetch its read from slave. So this means that every write have to read from master. 

Once the database reaches X rows, you need to a key to split it, ideally you would want to split keys that will have equal write and read probability in the split database. That is, a random user that wanted to read would have a equal likelihood of hitting either of the split database. The same goes with writing. To achieve this you really have to look at the access pattern of the database, and since I wasn't given that in the question, I choose to prioritize equal write probability since you can have fast lookup with cache server. In this case I am using authentication database as my example. The main schema contains username, password, email, birthday and creation date. Among the schemas, birthday make more sense to be a variable that is equally distributed across its possible value. Lastly when we split the key we would have to set up routing logic in the load balancer. 

So the above is the theoretical part. I am not sure if its correct at all, since I didn't even design it to be fault tolerant using RAID or redundancy. (Q6. How do I design fault tolerant distributed database, I guess if master fails I can promote one of the slave to become master) But I was ask to implement this. Here is where I got really stuck. I suppose you have to write a wrapper on top of database. But I am not even sure if there is an exposed api for the common sql rdbms doing that. So here is my final question, what are some common libraries to scale sql horizontally. Maybe I can look at the source code of it to figure out what they are doing.

I'm just looking for a bit of advice/perspective on my situation. I'm a 23 year old from Ireland looking to move to New York. I graduated in November 2015 with an Msc in Finance. I got a 3.6 GPA. I have secured a working visa for mid April of this year. 

Having scoured this sub I know the importance of internships when it comes to getting a jobs as an analyst in the big investments banks. I also know that April is off cycle for recruitment, but have been told not to start applying to jobs as I do not have a US address yet. I was wondering if you could shed some light on whether or not I should be applying now, or is applying online really the ""black hole"" that I've read about. 

I have experience working in my friends start up where I did advise him on some financial matters, and he is willing to give me a good reference where I maybe slightly exaggerate my responsibilities. It is a marketing firm that is starting to gain serious traction in Ireland, and I was wondering would putting something like this on my resume be advisable. 

Since I've known that I wanted to work in New York for a while, I'm working at a global recruiting firm in data analytics. They allowed me to take up a six month contract which enabled me to save for New York. This job doesn't have much to do with finance but is extremely detail orientated and I feel like it has taught me a lot. They know that I am leaving and really like me so I will receive an extremely positive reference from here as well.

I'm extremely capable  with software such as R and Stata, as well as being proficient in Microsoft Suite and VBA. I subscribe to seeking alpha to keep up to date with the latest market opinions, as well as reading the Wall Street Journal and Financial Times. I'm also in the middle of completing the Breaking into Wall Street financial modelling course, and will complete some courses related to investment banking on Coursera if it'll help my chances. I've also looked at a few books on valuation such as Damordan's and have been actively reviewing material related to Investment Banking that I obtained from during my masters. 

I was wondering if you think there's a chance that somebody like me could break into a middle market or small boutique with no real relevant experience? I'm trying to network with as many people as I know in New York but so far this hasn't turned up any leads!

Thanks for any feedback or advice on what to work on in the next two months to help me.

43vi6c,1,2016-02-02,What to include and what to exclude on a resume?,amalgamat3,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/43vi6c/what_to_include_and_what_to_exclude_on_a_resume/,"Hi all,

I am a first year undergrad student who is in CS. My school requires co-ops to graduate and I am looking to get a head start, even if an internship doesn't count as a co-op, or even if I don't get any offers - experience and practice is good. There is a career fair in a month, and while I do have a resume completed, I would like to completely redo it, as I'm not happy with it. I'm really just lost when it comes to what goes on a resume and what does not.

Anyways, I have 10 projects on my GitHub page, with languages including C, Java, HTML/CSS/JS, and Python 2.7 &amp; 3.4. I would genuinely say only three of them are 110% *complete*, and the rest are a WIP, including a personal site (not included in the 10 since it's so incredibly incomplete). Some are far more complete than others, and some I have run into roadblocks where I am not really currently sure how to approach the problem. Some are small projects, some are rather large. (As you can tell, I have a hard time sticking to one project.) Which of these do I include on my resume? Only the completed ones? Do I also include WIPs?

Languages: I have 4+ years in Java and I'm confident in Java (Android I am looking to start learning, I've only dabbled a very tiny amount into it). Python an okay amount, Git an okay amount, and JS &amp; C I have only just begun learning. Do I include JS &amp; C? How do I express my confidence levels in each language? I have seen labels like 'Most proficient', 'Familiar', etc, but that doesn't seem very descriptive of how *much* experience there is with the language.

Others: 

* I'm currently enrolled in courses for C &amp; Python/Django. Do I include that I'm enrolled in those and working on a large-scale group project for the Django class?

* In HS I was a programmer for an FRC team for four years, where we used Java, where it was basically an annual 6 week sprint (with a team of 30-45 others, including adult engineer mentors alongside other students) to build a full-fledged robot to do specific tasks, and I was the lead programmer for three of those years.. Built things like a custom subsystem state logger (ie this subsystem did this at this time with this state), and fully re-useable PID Controller (the people who have taken my position literally just copy paste the code into each new codebase). Do I include this stuff? In all honesty, that experience prepared me for college and group work moreso than anything else I've ever done.

* I am basically eager and ecstatic to learn anything at all. Learning is my absolute favorite thing to do. How can I include this, or should I not at all?

* I've only completed one semester of undergrad. Do I post my GPA still?

43vm1z,1,2016-02-02,Anxiety breakdown after physical therapy today - long post,pepsi109,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/43vm1z/anxiety_breakdown_after_physical_therapy_today/,"I just got back from my physical therapist's office. I go there for my shoulder and knee. Normally, I see one doctor and I'm comfortable with the physical contact, as he has to move my body around for treatment purposes. 

I didn't realize that he only worked on certain days. Last week I worked with a different doctor and while he spent much less time with me, I was nervous but still comfortable. 

This week, I worked with my original doctor but then he had their intern do some exercises with me. The intern is my age and kind of attractive. Being around him makes me nervous. As it turns out, being touched by him makes me super uncomfortable. The first exercise was he put my hand under his arm on the side of his chest and he starts moving my shoulder and shaking my arm. He later said this was to help loosen the fluids in my shoulder. So my hand is rubbing up against his chest and I am in total shock. We did some other exercises after that, then repeated everything over again, including the first one. I was going along with the other exercises, trying my best not to let the anxiety get to me (I was lying on my back too - vulnerable position when you're insecure).

He says we're done, puts ice on my knee, walks away, and I quickly sat down in full panic attack mode, silently hyperventilating, trying not to sob, and shaking. I'm pretty sure he noticed I was upset when he came to take the ice off. He said something about making another appointment but I was already walking past him to leave saying, ""Yep...I will.""

It's not his fault I'm a mess. I felt so bad because he was just doing his job. I don't know how to face him when I go back. I'm hoping he'll tell my normal doctor what happened and I won't have to work with him again. I have to take a bus and this office is the only one on my bus line without having to take more than one bus. No female doctors there."
43vnjc,1,2016-02-02,Transfer student graduating soon.,hoppang,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/43vnjc/transfer_student_graduating_soon/,"Hello. I am currently in my last semester at a University. I used to be a chemistry major coming in to college, but I decided to swap my major from chemistry to computer science by the end of my third year. Because of this, after transferring to another university to study computer science, I had to stay for another 2 years (total of 5 years in college).

Currently, I am a senior and I am in my last semester. I just feel like I was rushed throughout my studies. I have taken most of the fundamental classes for computer science (data structures, object oriented programming, algorithm analysis, discrete structures). In addition, in order to make up for not doing anything computer science-related during my freshman to junior year and my lack of experience, I decided to study up on Android development during the summer, after my first year of studying computer science. I was able to make two android games and release it on Google Playstore during that summer. I do not know if this is enough. In addition, during this winter, I decided to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and WordPress by myself using codeacademy and other materials and ended up creating a portfolio website using WordPress.

As of now, I am not sure what to focus on during my last semester and I am not sure when to start applying for jobs because of my lack of experience. I was not able to land any research opportunities and internships due to my lack of experience, so that is why I decided to self-teach web and android development. I do not know whether to study for interview tech questions or if I should work on more projects to showcase. I currently live in NY and would like to land a job in or near NYC. If you guys can give me good advice, I would be very grateful! Thanks!"

Also, if this is in the wrong subreddit I apologize.


For some background info, I am an IT Management major at a public US university in a large metropolitan city. Ultimately, my goal is to get an IT internship here, and If it matters, my GPA is 3.2. Now, at this point I'm nearly done with GERs but have had very little taste of intro IT courses. To be blunt, I don't have any knowledge on most things in IT that I should know. Although I would say I am very technologically literate and learn quickly.


My question for you guys/gals is, what are some steps that I can start taking to get ahead of the curve? I feel as though I'm at a disadvantage in the sense that I haven't had any experience in the technology field; something many internships prefer/require. 


To get to the point, I'm just looking for some guidance that could help me become better prepared/qualified for a potential internship.
Are there any programs or certifications that can help me advance my resume? Or online resources that will help me along my journey? Also looking for any other advice that has helped you or others.

Thanks a ton,

Yesterday I was let go from my job as a technical writer for an up-and-coming software company that I was a part of for 9 months.

I'm a little lost - but I'll keep it short. I have a degree in technical writing and a minor in IT. The job I was let go from left a lot to be desired. I felt ostracized by my team and was left with day-to-day busy work as a copy editor. I had little interaction with my team and my work was uninspired and overly-pedantic. The firing wasn't messy - but it boiled down to not seeing the ""performance"" they would like, despite recognizing my work and commending my improvement over the past month.

Now - the company has a positive reputation in my town and has won many accolades and rewards for their work. I feel like it would be unwise to exclude the position from my resume. Doing so would also create a 9-month gap after my graduation where I was without work.

What would you advise going forward? I obviously did not enjoy the work I did per se, but I would like to remain in the IT field. I don't want to create an image of inefficiency for myself  - and I have thought of ways to explain the termination to job prospects. 

I still have a lot of professional connections at my last job who would recommend me for work. I'm scrambling to find a balance between the positive and negative moving forward so I can avoid this same situation in the future.

Thoughts?

EDIT: I thought I should also mention I interned at this company 3 months prior to coming on as full-time. Maybe I can collect the internship and forego the full-time position in my resume. This would still leave me with a gap of ""unemployment."""

43y7pf,0,2016-02-02,"Graduated with a degree in Cultural Anthropology, need advice on how best to go back to school for Computer Science!",StalwartBlarg,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/43y7pf/graduated_with_a_degree_in_cultural_anthropology/,"First, thank you for taking the time to read this post any advice given is greatly appreciated. I've gone through most of the old posts and the FAQ's in the side-bar, but I've still been left with some questions. To start I'll give a little bit of information about myself. I graduated from a average state university (Northeast United States) last year with a degree in Cultural Anthropology (3.4 GPA overall, 3.5 in-major). It was never my plan to go to graduate school for Anthropology, I simply wanted that piece of paper that said I went to college. Now I realize that was a bit of a mistake as it used up four years of my life in a field I'm not very passionate about, although I do think culture is extremely interesting I never had a drive to learn about Anthropology. After coming to this realization and after experiencing trying to find a job with no desire to work in a field related to Anthropology, I've decided that I want to go back to school, but this time for something I'm actually passionate about. From what I've read and done thus far, Computer Science seems extremely intriguing. At the moment I am enrolled in an introductory Computer Science course from edX and trying to figure out if Computer Science is truly a passion or just another hobby, but I do think it is prudent to at least consider the possibility of this as a future plan. 

Going back to school for either a Master's degree or a Bachelor's degree is my real desire since I know that I get more from structured learning in a classroom rather than self-studying, granted I believe self-studying to some degree will always be required. From most of the posts that I've read on this subreddit it seems that the majority of people favor a Master's degree over a second Bachelor's for returning students. One concern I have is that since I lack a specific focus within Computer Science and it is more of a general desire for knowledge of the field and especially the programming aspect would it be better for a second Bachelors or a Masters? While I do think I can achieve a solid foundation through self-studying I'm worried it'll be lacking for a Master's program. Personally I feel as though it is better for me to go for the Master's degree because there is more financial aid available to students going for their Master's degree as opposed to a second Bachelor's degree. It may be important to mention as well that my debt from my first University isn't terrible, I commuted while going to school so it allowed me to keep costs to a minimal. Another issue that I have with going for a Master's degree is that if I had a desire to go to a well regarded school, most competitive master's programs require you to have prior research or an internship to be a serious candidate. Is there any chance of me having done no research getting into a good program or alternatively is there anyway for someone who isn't currently enrolled in school and has only minimal experience to participate in some form of research? It seems one of my best options is to try to learn as much as possible about different programming language, or at least one in-depth, then start creating things that interest me, be it apps, webpages, etc., then use those as sort of a reference of what I've learned on my own. My main concern is that I don't know the best way to go about continuing my education in Computer Science once I feel as though I've learned enough on my own, I don't have a real path right now that I can take and I would like to make some outline that I can follow. Not looking for pity, mostly wanted to express the fact that the first time I went to college I did it somewhat stupidly I rushed into it with no path. I intend to take my time with this and figure it out, but I would like to have some sort of plan in mind.

Hopefully my situation/questions are unique enough to warrant their own post, if not I'm really sorry I must have just missed some information. Once again thanks for reading and if you have any questions for me, please let me know.  

Side-note, because I was an Anthropology major and no math courses were required by my University, I haven't taken a math course in about five years and I intend to take courses at my local community college to make up for the prerequisites I may be missing for a Master's program if I continue to go forward with this plan "

Your cover letter is your shot at doing that and getting hired.

When you email your CV to a company to apply for a job there's a person reading your email on the other end. A real PERSON. I feel like people forget that.

I used to be a senior business developer at a food-tech startup in London and I often got cover letters like these (these are actual cover letters I got):

*With a strong analytical background, as well as vast client-facing experience, I am now looking to move into a business development or account management role. With a skill set fully aligned to managing the day-to-day relationship with clients, developing long and short-term strategies and tactics to maximise product success, in addition to co-ordinating and performing product demonstrations.*

That’s nice. I don’t really care. It’s also painful to read because no one speaks like that.

Who are you as a person and how are you different to the other 50 people who wrote similar BS-generic emails?

This was for a sales role too. If you can’t spark my interest when you introduce yourself you’re not going to be able to get new clients interested in our product.

Here’s another cover letter I got:

*Dear Sir/Madam,*
*I'd love to discuss your business, I'm currently interviewing with a number of start-ups and am interested in meeting as many as possible before the new year. I'm a multidisciplinary Sales candidate with a background of target delivery.*

Oh, your a target deliverer? You’re interviewing with other startups? So is every other applicant. I’m not even going to open your attached CV because your cover letter is boring as hell.

Unless your experience is both rare and exactly what the company is looking for your CV is pretty much useless anyway. Even if your CV’s contents are the perfect fit, it might get skimmed over or simply not read if your cover letter sucks.

So talk to me. Write some words TO me. Connect with me. Use your cover letter to stand out from the crowd and tell me **who you are**.

**Here’s the cover letter that got me flown from London to Hollywood**

I applied for a business development role at Jumpcut Studios, the guys behind the YouTube channel Simple Pickup. They’re developing a new platform to help YouTube creators monetise their audiences.

My cover letter below cut through the pile of applications they received.

I ended up being the only applicant (out of 100s) that they actually considered, so they flew me cross-Atlantic to their office in Hollywood, LA. There were 2 Skype interviews before that happened, and I used some of the conversation hacks in [this guide](http://beardstrokings.com/conversation-hacks-guide/) to build a connection with them in those interviews and convince them I was legit.

Here’s the cover letter I sent:

*This idea is genius. The opportunity here is huge.*

*There are so many YouTubers out there who know how to get thousands, or even millions, of eyeballs on their content. They've built their own audiences, and YouTube takes a 45% cut out of what is already a pittance that they receive. Those eyeballs have the potential to be worth far more, but most content creators mainly know how to be content creators and engage people. They understand that side of things… the hard part, and while they might have a few business ideas too they don’t have the chops to know what will work and what won’t. They have to waste time and money experimenting to work it out.*

*You guys have done the hard yards by hacking together a Wordpress site, creating products to sell and experimenting &amp; optimizing everything along the way. You’ve worked out what works for you and now you’re thinking bigger to turn your knowledge into a system that works for content creators at large. That shit gets me excited.*

*My passion is creating. What fuels me is giving shape and form to something that previously didn’t exist, then making it better continuously. It gets me in Flow. Whether it’s a better sales process, a YouTube video, a website, a business idea or this cover letter.*

*NOT creating for too long drains my energy.*

*I love startup environments. I’m comfortable embracing shifting priorities, throwing plans out and flying by the seat of my pants. You need flexibility to constantly iterate products and processes in the hunt for market fit and customer love. I’m passionate about learning what makes customers tick and incorporating that insight into the product.*

*Breaking things down and identifying patterns with significant meaning come naturally to me. I’ve always been an analytical problem solver (hence the Civil Engineering background). At my previous startup, dinein.co.uk, I uncovered that 60% of our registered users had never placed an order. There was no dashboard to track these metrics so I did it manually on my own initiative, even though it wasn’t part of my job, because no one else had bothered to do it. Turned out there were 3 pretty obvious (in hindsight) reasons for our high attrition rate, which I also uncovered through user interviews.*

*I value clear communication very highly. I believe that if you applied the 80/20 rule to the list of things that make a business successful, and then applied the 80/20 rule to THAT 20%, you’d be left with ""clear communication"" as the 4% that’s responsible for 64% of the results. If you can get your head around that ;) Part of that means having a culture of openness where everyone is comfortable giving and receiving critical feedback &amp; learning from mistakes. I know how to foster that sort of culture. The interns I managed at my last startup will back that claim.*

*I would very much love to help you guys explore and hopefully find the answer to the ""Big Hairy problems of monetization, community-building, and discovery”.*

*Looking forward to hearing from you.*

*Cheers,*
*Pete*

In the end the job wasn’t a good fit for either side. They didn’t end up hiring anyone. But hey, I got to meet some cool people and hang out in LA for a few days.

**Are you putting ""who you are"" in your cover letters?**

A friend of mine took this cover letter approach a step further when she applied for a Corporate Law role at Deloitte (… a pretty serious job at a massive company). Her cover letter brought up the deeply personal story of how she left Japan when she was 12 to follow Johnny Cash on tour around the United States.

She didn’t hold back, without going overboard, and spattered her charming personality throughout. Have a read:

*Subject: Gradiator in suits*

(note that she’s making fun of her Japanese background and their difficulty in pronouncing the letter ‘L’)

*Dear Sir,*

*My name is Jo XYZ. I am an English and Japanese bilingual who has been working as a corporate lawyer at a consultancy in the City of London. I apologise for suddenly getting in touch, but I would very much appreciate it if you could find the time in your busy schedule to consider me for a role at your Japanese Services Group.*

*I left Japan when I was 12 to study abroad in America. I spent the initial two years following Johnny Cash and travelled down south. My family stayed in Japan and the experience of figuring my way alone has made me very resilient. There were some moments where I very nearly chose the comfort of home, but curiosity is what drove me forward during the enduring days and this now forms the basis of my unshakable confidence. I have since graduated from the University of Manchester with a 2:1 in Law and completed a Master’s degree in corporate governance. I chose the discipline because I wanted what is challenging. This meant that my choice was between law and medicine, and I chose law because there were less blood involved.*

*As a lawyer, I have conducted many comparative analysis of national codes and tracked the development of various regulations applicable to the financial industry. I have also worked on providing board-level governance services, such as board training, evaluation, governance assessments and peer benchmarking. Furthermore, having trained in company secretariat practices, I have supplied extensive administrative support both internally and externally.*

*I am now in search of an opportunity where I could combine my linguistic skill and the experience of working for the financial industry. Although I value the experience gained at the current firm, I now crave working for a larger organisation with the chance to be involved with Japan. Combining my linguistic skill, legal expertise and 'bring it on' attitude, I believe I can be of an asset to your Japanese Services Group given the opportunity.*

*I would like an opportunity that is much more than simply being able to speak Japanese. Rather, I would like to discover what I can do with it, which is the reason for my reaching out to you today. I tried to keep this as brief as possible, though I cannot help but feel I have left so much out. If there is a slightest chance that you would like to find out more about me, please refer to the CV I took the liberty to attach to his email.*

*Thank you very much for taking the time to read this far. It is my sincere hope that I hear from you in the near future.*

*Rock 'n' roll,*
*Jo*

Jo is about as “rock ’n’ roll"" as it gets, and actually speaks this way in real life, which is why her cover letter feels authentic.

Does it surprise you that she built a close relationship with the Senior VP who opened that cover letter? He ended up bringing 6 department heads together to create a new role just for her.

The important thing to consider here is this:

Are you putting **who you are** into your cover letter? Are you writing your cover letter to a real person?

If you aren’t, why not give it a try? Because there's a real person on the other end reading it, and they’re giving your job to the people they connect with.

They mentioned they may have a full time position for me when I graduate, but after I announced I was accepting a co-op offer from a different company, they really vamped up the offer.  Here are some details:

International Software Company:

* Guaranteed full time position

* Chance to live and work in Berlin (which would be cool, and the move is on their dime)

* I don't know German

* Competitive salary already specified

* They'd be grateful if I stayed (for a student, I took on a lot of responsibility)

* I feel completely stalled out at this company, and I'm not emotionally invested

* Despite my junior level, I'm learning from no one

* The team I work on here is disorganized, and I can't stand it, but it's not in me to attempt to organize it (too inexperienced, too introverted)

Domestic Software Company:

* Full time position if I am a good fit upon graduation

* Not sure about salary, but I'm sure it will be as good or better

* The co-op pays a little better than my current internship

* Live where I live now, near family and friends

* Work with some current friends and people I know I'll get along with

* I know work there will be fun, and I can get a change of pace

* I can stand to learn a lot from the people I'll be working under

* I get to learn to work in an organized team where work is actually planned out and divided

Where should I work?

tl;dr  Should I work where I'm guaranteed a well-paying job and a chance to live abroad, but where I'll probably be miserable, or take a chance and work where I'm not guaranteed a full time job, but I'll probably enjoy myself and get to work with friends?"

Manager told him he doesn't have to stay for the meeting, so he left. :/ I like him so it kind of upset me that he left so flippantly. 

Manager said more time is better for them as it will help them transition. I expressed my interest in returning once I graduate. I asked for them to let me know if they wanna keep me. I was thinking of leaving after two weeks if they don't want to keep me, or sooner, but I'd stay until I need to relocate if they wanna keep me after I graduate. Please advise. Should I leave in two weeks or sooner regardless? I've been here for five months as an intern. Would quitting during the internship mean that they for sure wouldn't want me back?

I was an engineering student, but 1.5 years into it just didn't seem to be the right fit for me. (Also, took me a while to switch because I was hesitant whether or not I would do well in CS).

So now I'm a third year here at Rutgers, and struggling trying to find an internship for CS (mostly due to the fact that I don't have any technical or relevant work experience). In terms of CS credits, I finished CS111 (A), CS112 (B, due to pledging..), Discrete I (Math300 A), and Discrete II Honors (B pledging). I am currently enrolled in Algorithms and Computer Architecture this semester. 

Do any of you guys have advice on what I should do, in the case I do not get an internship opportunity this summer? I will obviously attend the career fairs (today and tomorrow) and continue to apply to internships online. 

Will working on a personal project justify lack of summer opportunity? Should I do research to better my chances next time around? Willing to all criticism, advice, etc. :)

They're doing just the type of work that I'm interested in and I have a feeling I will learn a lot. I would have gladly accepted that offer, but just heard back recently from Amazon. I don't know too much about what I can expect from their internship experience, but the name of course has some significant weight.

The pay is the same between the two (6K + 2.5K housing). The HFT has small perks like meals and the typical get-you-to-stay-at-work amenities. Ultimately, my main considerations are how this summer will make me a better problem solver and how the internship will factor in when I am looking for full-time positions in the Fall. I'm leaning towards the HFT company, but does anyone think I'll be at a disadvantage coming from a company that is basically unknown (big enough to have a good glassdoor reputation, but not a household name)."

second, i really hope this is the right subreddit for this question (i looked at posting guidelines and faq and i THINK its an ok question for here?)

anyways--

i want help choosing an internship for this summer. i've received offers from both of these companies, and am honestly very lost. i am a freshman, so this is my first internship and i have very little experience with this stuff. here are my ""pros and cons""-- (basically idk how i should weight the pros or cons and need help)

Square--
$36/hr + 2000/month housing stipend

Seems like a bigger company than Indeed so maybe more prestigious?

Indeed--
$28/hr + is in Austin (this is kind of big for me b/c I live in Austin and would love to not have to leave my home for the summer).

Which of these would be a better work experience for me? Which of these would look better on a resume for future years? I hope to intern with Google/Facebook/Bloomberg next year.

I'm a junior CS major at an average state school. I've been doing pretty well and I believe I'm likely closer to the top of my class in the major.

I applied to tons of internships last semester, and even got to the final rounds with some top companies. Unfortunately nothing big ever came through. I did, however, receive an offer from a local tech company that's seen a great deal of growth over the past few years. They don't pay a whole lot, though, and their internship program isn't very exciting. It doesn't sound very well structured and seems like it might be mostly testing/boring stuff.

This company, however, would not extend the deadline for my decision past about a week and a half. I knew I would have other interviews, though I was scared I might be left with nothing else on the table. So I decided to accept the offer.

I continued to interview with other companies. This week, I received an offer from another company about an hour away with an amazing offer. The company itself seems really great, the work is much more interesting to me, and the pay is literally double the other offer. I could definitely see myself working at this company after I graduate.

I want to and intend to accept this offer. I'm waiting on one final company next week that I don't have high hopes for, and then I'm going to give my answer to this company. I just need to know what the proper course of action is.

My intention is to sign everything and get that squared away before contacting the first company. When I contact the first company, do I say I can no longer intern with them because I accepted another offer? Or do I simply leave it at I can no longer work for them due to personal reasons? I don't want to have to mention the company name. Would/could they ask for it, and would I be required to tell them? I've read online about companies calling up other companies to let them know a candidate reneged. I don't know if this is true or not, but I'd rather it not happen. So what's the proper thing to say?

**TL;DR**: What exactly do you say to a company you want to renege? Do you mention the new offer? Do you just state personal reasons? Can they ask about the other company? Can they find out on their own? Will a company really contact another company over a reneged intern?"

Here's the deal, I have an opportunity to get an internship this summer, which will obviously be great. It isn't directly tied to system administration as far as I can tell; but it's valuable experience to say the least. From the description and conversations I've had with HR it will be more of a development position where I'll be tasked with improving a business process. It's good to have a wide range of skills and experiences, right?

While software development is a hobby at the moment, my primary focus is system administration. Right now I have a server at my house where I've just started working on my home lab. I also have a 6 month sub to Microsoft Azure (and allotted $100 a month) so I have some really good opportunities to setup a wide range of systems (and I take advantage of these things on the weekend when I have time.)

So I'm apprehensive to follow through with the internship because I'm slightly behind credit-wise. If I take this internship I won't be able to take summer classes which means I'll be going to school for another semester. (I'm a junior so this would be the Fall of 2017 as opposed to graduating that spring)
In your experience, how important is that internship? I'll be 27 when I graduate, so the extra semester feels like a lot more than if I was 22 or so.

One last note: When I graduate I'll have 3 to 3 1/2 years of help desk experience. I know that Help Desk != System Administration, but it's experience none the less.

What would you do, given my situation?

Thank you."

They sent me to boarding school for safety reasons when I was around 15. It was the best thing that could have happened to me, I learned to socialize, and be in a normal environment that actually gave me appropriate reactions to my behavior (rather than constant overreactions). 

it's 12 years later, I'm going to graduate school. I have done amazing for myself because I have been given the space to find the way I need to do things, rather than my parents screaming at me to do it their way and if I don't I'm stupid. I do commercials, model, graduated top of my undergraduate class and now am doing well in grad school but of course it's not enough, it's never good enough. 

My parents still help me financially, not everything but a lot. I am gearing to get a real job and start paying for everything on my own so they stop using it to guilt me. 

They've now decided to move to the city that I live in (I know they're doing this because I lived somewhere else a few years ago and they were looking at houses there) and are making plans to do so later this year. They're already starting to guilt me into moving back home with them to ""save money"" to ""spend time"" with my little sisters and ""don't you love us? you're such an ingrate"" 

I am having nightmares about their moving. I can't tell them that their behavior is incredibly toxic, and that spending time with them means I have to take time to ""recover"" from spending time with them (usually they make me come visit them for a month at a time twice a year and have lost their fucking minds when I didn't come last xmas due to my great internship) 

Everything is going to come crashing down and I just know it. I feel pathetic, an adult that wants to run the fuck away, I hate to admit how much I resent them, because even that makes me feel guilty. 

I am their well trained dog :-\ trained to feel guilty and awful every time I try to do or say or even th ink of something for myself instead of them. "

So, currently I am a junior getting a degree in Information Technology. I like my degree, but I am also really interested in Computer Science (mostly software development). I have added a software track to my IT degree, this allows me to take some helpful programming/software engineering classes. I am doing well in them and I am really enjoying them. I am pretty much done with my IT degree, just need a couple more classes. I also have taken quite a few Computer Science classes. So, if I fill up my schedule this for summer and next year with Computer Science classes, I should have around 14 more classes to take to get my degree in Computer Science.  

Now, I don't if that is my best option. My other option would be try to get a Masters in computer science. I've done my research and I've satisfied most of the pre-requisites classes you need to get accepted. Obviously there are other requirements I need to complete, but I believe that I can accomplish that, especially if I begin to focus on that now. So.....my question is should I go for a degree or a masters in computer science? I believe a masters will be better choice, but I need some advice. I also wanted to ask how likely is it for me to be able to get a software development job with my IT degree and programming/software engineering classes I've taken? Also, wanted to mention that I am looking for an internship for software development and/or cybersecurity. So, I believe that will be beneficial. 


Thank you for taking the time to read my post. I know it's all over the place. 

Edit: Also, how do job options differ between a degree and a masters in computer science? I know Masters in some fields are really beneficial, but not sure if it is the same for computer science. "

I had one internship at a small startup during one summer, but don't have a lot of experience besides that.

I recently interviewed with a small tech company in Boston and received an offer for an entry-level QA position. The position comes with benefits (medical, dental, etc.) and 15 days of paid time off a year. Their base salary offer was 40k a year. The position seems to mainly consist of black box testing to start, but with a lot of opportunity to do automation in the future. The company seems like a decent place to work. I feel like 40k is pretty low for a fresh CS grad, even though I don't have too much prior experience.

My question is: is 40k enough to live comfortably in a city like Boston? I feel like it's pretty iffy. I've checked Glassdoor and it seems like most QA positions pay at least 50k + in Boston. I just wanted to get a few second opinions on whether or not this salary seems reasonable, and if not what a good target would be for negotiating.

But as the title says ill give a run down on what my situation is. Currently in school part-time for engineering and was offered a ""job"" at small firm that specializes in my career path. An having difficulty choosing which path i should go.

Car: About 20-25 mpg



Job A (Current job): Deli  
With 4.5 years exp.  
$9.50 an hour  
15 minute drive to work  
Part time hours- 28-30  
Friday-Sunday  


 

Job B (offered): Intern/ Construction Materials Tech.  
$12 an hour  
50 min drive to work on fri.-sat., 25 min. from uni. during weekdays  
No 401(K)  
Hours unknown- Possibly 20-25, possibly more during summer  
Overtime pays x2 per hour  
Would be getting experience in my field and have hands on experience  




Obviously I would like to take job B since its with a firm where I can get valuable knowledge compared to where i'm currently at. Only its pretty far away compared to where i'm at and the hours i just don't know how many id be getting. I'm still on the fence about what is most beneficial to me, I could still apply to other jobs similar to this one a little more locally, but who knows when id get a call or emailed back about a position. Any thoughts or similar experiences is appreciated.

Is it worth it?,banquuuooo,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4490ca/how_do_i_market_myself_as_a_low_level_programmer/,"I'm a 2nd year CS student, and I am working on getting a summer internship this summer, which has been going relatively well. I have found, however, that almost every job I have applied/interviewed for wants mid-high level programmers- mostly for web, mobile and database applications (not sure if database is considered low level? Still doing that course). 

Now, last fall I noticed that many of my peers did not have adequate knowledge in low level programming: they could talk all day about java or python, but once you talked about C or assembly, they stopped listening. As a result of this, and because I enjoy low level programming, I decided to market myself to employers as a student of low level programming. But now I'm wondering if this is a mistake, considering what it seems employers want. 

So Reddit, any advice? Is it worth it to get experience in low level programming? Is it a hard sub field to get into? What kind of languages should I learn to get into it? How do I go about learning about and contributing to low level projects (such as kernel dev)? Am I using the ""low level"" too much or in the wrong context? "

I'm 25 years old and have a bachelors in accounting. I also have good experience (I've done customer service and project managing in my late teens/early twenties), interning in the accounting field in my mid twenties, interning in audit and had a full time accountant position for about 6 months. That accounting position was my most recent job and it just didn't turn out well. I didn't get along well with my team, had more work than I could handle and any time I would voice this concern, my manager would just give the old ""ask your team for help"" type line (which didn't work because they were also bogged down with work). Long story short, I was tasked with the year end accruals and I missed a good bunch because of the time crunch. The external auditors were coming soon afterwards and I got scared and just didn't show up to be yelled at and likely fired once the external auditors found the missed year end accruals. Looking back, it wasn't the best decision, but at this point it's a sunk cost unless someone here has a time machine. 

So that reference is trashed now and now I have about the last year of my work experience evaporated into thin air (6 months as an accountant and I also did 6 months of audit internship at the same company) and am not sure what to do now. 

Should I keep them on my resume and hope my old employer only verifies that I worked there? Or will they bad mouth me if a new perspective employee calls them? Should I test it out myself (call the HR department and pretend I'm looking for a reference for myself to see what they say)? Should I leave them off my resume completely, but then how should I explain a year long gap? Should I leave them on my resume, lie about not giving two-weeks notice and hope they don't contact me last employer? Should I just man up and admit what I did to the perspective employee and how I learned from it (or will that get my resume trashed).

I'm applying to corporate like accounting jobs if that wasn't clear in the text blobs up there. 

Send help!

I had anticipated many of the questions and kind of thought out what my responses would be to them in the preceding days so that I could give a decent answer.

It started with some introductions, some questions about me, my interests, passions, why I want to work here, etc. In the middle I was given technical questions, perhaps about 20-25? It covered a wiiiide range of things from time complexity to the function of a CPU cache, to data structures, math, etc. Then I asked them questions, and at the very end the interviewer has some more questions for me and I gave a really great answer.

So basically I started off strong, and I finished even stronger. The middle part is where I'm concerned though. I answered most of the questions just fine, but given that there was a lot, there were maybe 6-7 that I simply didn't know or simply got wrong. Some I tried to take an educated guess at or just show my thought process, one or two questions seemed outside the scope of what I learned in my undergrad classes.

Overall I think it went well. I think they got a feel for the fact that I'm a reliable person, but I'm worried if I botches the tech part too much. How well do you typically need to hold up on technical questions like these?"
449njt,1,2016-02-05,College is killing creativity (long),Dunedain4,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/449njt/college_is_killing_creativity_long/,"

- SKIP THIS IF YOU WANT 


Just some background... I got super into coding in 8th grade when my parents decided to move to Jerusalem, Israel for a semester and I was mostly locked up in an apartment. During this time, I wrote over 100 pages to a medieval fantasy book, coded some projects using Scratch (an MIT, drag and drop blocks of code type thing), and got into Python. In general I just felt super creative. I did not go to school during this semester whatsoever. With barely any technology, and a super spotty internet connection, I naturally filled my time with doing some pretty creative things. 


I fell in love with sports in high school and even played college football for a year which completely took over my life. I did not have a ton of time for things like reading, writing, coding, and being creative in general. My parents forced me to work so I held jobs over the summers and during the school year, unless I was playing sports (all the more reason to play sports right?)... I was very social and just did not have a ton of free time from my freshman year of high school through my sophomore year of college.  



- IMPORTANT PART 


Fast forward to now: I decided to transfer. I'm currently a second semester sophomore. I'm closer to home. The new college is way cheaper (D3 football players don't get scholarships). I also snagged an awesome internship for this semester. So, my problem is this: I am delving pretty deep into the programming world. I absolutely love it and there are so many things I want to dive deeper into. Lately I've been learning a lot of server and web development stuff, as well as Swift/iOS app programming. I learn best on my own, and its not even close. I don't pay attention in class ever. I'm just not interested in someone making what I love into something boring. I do have a ton of drive, but I have to FEEL it in my gut. I can't stare at a whiteboard all day. I want to have a goal, maybe even an insurmountable goal, and I want to just go for it. I want to feel a burning passion for it. I can't do this when school sucks the time and life out of me. I honestly feel like I'm playing a game. I'm filling my quota of multiple choice and true/false questions before I can move to the next phase of my life.


My internship is great, but its making me realize that the classes I'm taking are even less applicable than I originally thought them to be. I hate that I have to jump through a hoop (an expensive, creativity-killing one) and honestly I just want to run with some of my ideas. But.. between 15 credit hours and 20+ hours at my internship, I just don't have the time to build any of the things I want to build. 


I still want to have a social life. I don't want to miss that aspect of college, but I feel like I'm not getting anything out of the learning part of college which is actually what I'm paying for? Beyond this, I feel like I'm losing my creative edge. A huge part of me wants to just be like some sort of renaissance guy who travels the world for a while and just creates, learns, and soaks in as much as he can, but school doesn't allow for that. Honestly in CS, after the first few programming classes, they should just ask the students what they wanted to do, and the students should just build something from the ground up, in groups or by themselves, and they should build something that they are passionate about. Why do schools constrain the languages that students can use to code in? Why restrain the IDE? Why restrain the specific area? Web development? Mobile? Any sort of software? It's just pathetic and I'm over how less creative school makes me. "

I've been lucky to have my first two internship interviews with companies I like (one small start up and another Big N) and both were bombed before I could even reach a technical screening. All I do is study and practice coding questions in preparation but when asked questions outside of that realm I feel sort of unprepared even though it should logically be the easiest part. I'm not really an anti-social person (though I am mildly on the autism spectrum and definitely introverted) but when thinking about answering questions related to my resume I think ""Oh I used X technology to do Y and achieve result Z"" not ""How did you and your partners overcome disagreements on this project"". It just seems like an extremely obvious answer and thus a trick question and I start stuttering and pausing through my answer to get the ""right"" answer (I do answer the question but I can see how someone would think I may be lying or exaggerating). 

To make it worse, long pauses kill me internally which specifically happened during the Big N interview. The interviewer seemed uncaring and bored from the get go and after I answered their questions there were constant 5 - 10 second pauses which definitely didn't help with anxiety. 

I've got another interview for the number one company on my list next week and although I feel much more prepared thanks to these past two bad experiences, I really want to do my best to avoid getting a ""We're so competitive right now!"" letter again. What can I do to control my nerves? Thanks for any help you guys can offer"

44aw6f,2,2016-02-05,"[URGENT][INTERVIEW TOMORROW] HELP! I DO NOT want companies to reference a certain company, but it's my only reference. What do I do?",iwishforstrength,GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/44aw6f/urgentinterview_tomorrow_help_i_do_not_want/,"Country: USA

Hi guys, I'm hoping to get some genuine insight here - I have been fired by a job before for reasons that I **am** responsible for. Reason in letter of firing: I wasn't experienced enough and I kept making mistakes - very small (on rough drafts, could have sworn I typed a period or comma but I really didn't, being too slow - however, never crossed any deadlines), but supervisor had a really short fuse. So she fired me. I admit and accept these faults, and I do think these are reasonable grounds for firing.

Thing is, there is a second, more subtle reason. 
The supervisor had a strange hostility towards me, which grew inordinately intense over time. I feel it may have been because I didn't fit in to their culture, which made my presence visibly awkward, and she no longer wanted a ""sore thumb sticking out"" around. 

This is the only professional reference I have. And now I'm scared this will create a very bad image of me.

At this point, if you don't want to know details, you can skip to the TLDR.

-----------------------

Actually, both the coworkers and I knew the whole office really did not like me because I did not fit their culture. What kind of culture is so hard to fit, you ask? When we all ate together in the lunchroom, they would commonly say ""cum"" and ""jizz"" and yell disabled people jokes. Including the CEO. Whenever someone made a joke that was the most offensive, they'd all clap and cheer loudly. When I was quiet, they'd comment, ""hey, when are YOU gonna start being offensive?"" Exact words. This was a regular thing. Guys, I can't make this shit up. The cherry on top: it was a small town known for being pretty racist, one where you almost never see asians around. I'm a quiet, shy asian girl, I'm polite towards everyone. They would ""poke fun"" at my race. Very. Very. Often. It would escalate. One time, when I finally got home, I actually found myself crying. 

I'd assert myself sometimes. But it always happened all over again the next day.

I honestly didn't know what the hell to do anymore, because this is the first time I'd ever worked, and I was faced with something weird: the HR manager was often sitting there laughing as well.

I was very thankful to land this job. So I tried for a bit to play along. Vaguely tried some ""offensive humor"".
But I'm not like that. I'm sorry, I know you have to try to ""fit in a little"" when it's work related, but this time, I couldn't. So over time, I tried to fade myself out of all their convos, just kept quiet. Smiled and chuckled when I had to. But that only made me stick out more like a sore thumb there. I'm assuming the cued smiling made me look ""fake"". So by the time I got fired, whenever we had to look at each other, you could see on EVERY coworker's face an expression that just screams ""she doesn't fit in here"", thinly veiled by required politeness. 

But with the supervisor, her looks came off very transparently as **hostile**. 

With her, I can understand. Yes, I did make real mistakes. And that's why I got fired.

But I do think her hostility was aggravated towards me inordinately, heightened only by how I ""didn't fit in"". Thus, I fear if she ever gets asked to reference me, she'll talk about me in an unbalanced and spiteful way. 

Why do I think this? She also expressed very clear signs of suspicion towards me. I have a really weird hunch she may have thought my silence meant I resented them, so I was making mistakes on purpose to spite them. We got off on a very friendly foot, even having free-flowing, casual conversation about music and vacation spots. But over time, she started speaking in VERY short sentences with me, and walk away very very fast, almost like she was running sometimes. Sometimes, when she found out I was doing a task unknown to her given to me by someone else, she'd ask ""why?"" in a very hostile tone.

I know, the past is the past - I move on. So what's the problem now? The last time I did an interview, they told me they ESPECIALLY want reference from this company.

This is because I work in the design field. 
*This is the only design job I've ever had.*

I have nothing else to reference.

If I take that off my reference list, there'll only be 2 references that most recruiters don't want - my college professor, and 2 internships from more than 4 years ago.

HELP. My interview is tomorrow.
I am terrified they will ask for this place's reference. But I can't take that reference off, or I'll have almost nothing.

I also know a reference is different from a recommendation, and those are different from a referral. With references, do they ask how I did? Or is that when you only ask ""did she really work there"", then the company's not allowed to comment on how you actually did?

Please, still comment even after tomorrow, because I want to know for the future.

What do I do?

------------------------

**TLDR**

Help me - I have an interview tomorrow, and there is a terrifying impasse.

I was fired from the first job I've ever had - for a partially unfair reason linked to bias. The company environment was very hostile and judgmental there, and had an extreme culture that was hard to conform to. There was a bit of racism involved that made me feel uncomfortable (and distrustful) there as well. I have put it behind me as an atypical experience, but new companies I've applied to have wanted to, and will consistently want references from THAT COMPANY SPECIFICALLY - because it's the only job I've ever had.

I don't have any other references that companies are interested in.

I am terrified of what they'll say of me.

I can't take it off my reference list or I'll have nothing left. 

*Then I'll never be hired.*

**Have you read the sidebar and [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/rules)? (Please do)**

Yes!

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

The main focus is on gaming. I want to play games like Fallout 4, The Witcher 3, and Starcraft 2. I'm also a Computer Science major (graduating in May!!) and I do a lot of programming, specifically I want my computer to be able to run things like Android Studio comfortably - my current laptop just can't handle it.

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, FPS, game settings)**

I'm aiming for 1440p at 60fps, though I realize that this may vary between games. I'm not worried if I can't get that at Ultra settings, but would like to be able to at least get a step or two below that.

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

Trying not to go over $1500 - $1600, the cheaper the better. If there's a compelling reason to go over, I might be able to swing it, but it will just take a little longer to save up the dough. I have $550 saved right now and my roommate owes me another $716. The rest will come from what's left over in my paychecks after bills (I have a good internship working almost 40 hours a week).

I opted for a liquid cooler because I'd like to overclock my CPU. I know this may be a little beyond a beginner build, but I feel fairly competent with my abilities being a CS major and because I worked in tech support at my University up until December and did a lot of repair and swapping out parts so I know my way around a computer.

I'm definitely open to suggestions on the case, because I had trouble finding one that I felt confident about. I'm worried that the one I picked might not be spacious enough to fit all the components, especially since I'm going for an optical drive. I'm willing to shell out more for a higher quality case, one that will last me a while and possibly be used in future builds.

Also, this is probably a noob question, but I wasn't able to find an answer on Google. Will the optical drive be compatible with my motherboard? The motherboard only lists SATA 6Gb/s but the optical drive is for SATA 1.5Gb/s. Can the 1.5Gb/s go in the 6Gb/s, and just be limited to the 1.5Gb/s?

If you make changes/suggestions, I'd really appreciate a little bit of reasoning behind those so I can learn more. I've been working on this build for awhile and I'm astounded by how much I don't know.

Here's the deal, I have an opportunity to get an internship this summer, which will obviously be great. It isn't directly tied to system administration as far as I can tell; but it's valuable experience to say the least. From the description and conversations I've had with HR it will be more of a development position where I'll be tasked with improving a business process. It's good to have a wide range of skills and experiences, right?
While software development is a hobby at the moment, my primary focus is system administration. Right now I have a server at my house where I've just started working on my home lab. I also have a 6 month sub to Microsoft Azure (and allotted $100 a month) so I have some really good opportunities to setup a wide range of systems (and I take advantage of these things on the weekend when I have time.)
So I'm apprehensive to follow through with the internship because I'm slightly behind credit-wise. If I take this internship I won't be able to take summer classes which means I'll be going to school for another semester. (I'm a junior so this would be the Fall of 2017 as opposed to graduating that spring) In your experience, how important is that internship? I'll be 27 when I graduate, so the extra semester feels like a lot more than if I was 22 or so.
One last note: When I graduate I'll have 3 to 3 1/2 years of help desk experience. I know that Help Desk != System Administration, but it's experience none the less.
What would you do, given my situation?
Thank you.

Quick addon: I recieved an email yesterday about an internship working in a sysadmin role. Specifically a Windows Server environment."
44blo0,1,2016-02-05,Internship after graduating?,omfgitsthatdudeagain,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/44blo0/internship_after_graduating/,"I am currently a senior who's set to gradaute after this semester. Throughtout my college years, I have only done web-development projects / internships, but never mobile development. Over the winter break, I started playing around with iOS Development in Swift, and I love it. Initially I wanted to a web developer, but now I want to change my focus into mobile development. Since I have no experience in mobile development at all, I was thinking of applying for an internship position for the summer, but by that time, I will already have graduated from college. Is it possible for me to land an internship in mobile development despite already graduating from college? Or should I just focus on self-studying, and applying for junior mobile developer roles?"
44bp21,2,2016-02-05,Including future experience on CV for a scholarship application?,OdhranR,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/44bp21/including_future_experience_on_cv_for_a/,"Hey guys,

A semiconductor company in my area offers a scholarship to final year EE undergrads, I'm applying for it and I'm in a bit of a dilemma about including some future experience on my CV.

I was accepted into a 3-month research internship at MIT this summer, which is obviously a huge thing to be able to put on a CV and would hopefully help my chances at getting the scholarship, I'm just not sure how listing future experience might be viewed by the company. I've also got a short co-op internship at another local semiconductor company at the start of the summer, obviously the same question applies in this case too.

The scholarship application says candidates will be chosen for interview. Should I leave out the internships for the coming summer and bring them up if I get called to interview?

There's also a cover letter with the application, I was thinking of including the internships there instead of on my CV but in that case it won't be as prominent and someone getting a lot of applications could easily skim over it, easier than they would if it were on my CV at least.

I'd really appreciate your thoughts on this!"
44bpfy,2,2016-02-05,"23, Brazilian, Chemical Engineer. Would like country recommendations and immigration advice.",BRladier,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/44bpfy/23_brazilian_chemical_engineer_would_like_country/,"Hi everyone.

I'm a 23 years old chemical engineering student on my last year of college in Brazil, in a respected university that often ranks top 5 in LA and number 1 in my country. I had an international experience last year in California where I studied for one year and that just made my existing desire of leaving to another country grow exponentially. I really want to do things right so I'm trying to plan my immigration before I finish college.

Now that I have introduced myself, I would like some recommendations of countries that would be willing to accept me or some immigration advice. A few points to look at:

- For my personal options I'm more of a generalist than a specialist. I currently work as an intern in business intelligence for an american global company (that unfortunately is really hard to give you an expat package). That being said I would prefer not to got to a master's program and get into the technical field just so I can emigrate, but I can consider this option if all others are unavailable.

- If I were to take a master's I would prefer something related to biochemical engineering (industrial biotechnology) or Oil &amp; Gas. If someone can suggest me good places to study in these areas that would be great, but

- Another problem with going for a master's program is money. My family is humble and we don't have any significant savings or income to pay for a loan. Scholarships are the only way to go unfortunately. Any program recommendations are welcome!

- Going back to the US would be the perfect scenario, I loved the country and identified myself with the culture pretty well, but I know it's hard if not impossible for a Brazilian just out of college to get a working visa there.

- Australia is a close second, I find the country amazing and there are lots of opportunities and stability there. But I have no link with the country whatsoever to help me with visa.

- My grandparent was Portuguese and came to Brazil in his mid twenties. My father always had the dream to go back to Portugal (even though he never lived or visited there) and we love the country as well (I proudly declare my Portuguese origins whenever I can). Unfortunately both my father and my grandfather have passed away and that makes getting a PT passport really hard.

- Another important point: are there any countries that accept parents as dependents? I lost my father recently (one year approx) and my mom is not dealing well with the new family situation (we all aren't but she's been having it worse).

That's basically it, I am a hard working guy that dreams about leaving Brazil to work and raise a family, but I find myself quite lost because I don't want a specialist and technical career. If anyone has any advice I would be really appreciated and if you need any more details just let me know! Thank you very much for the support.

I'm posting here because I was looking for advice from people that have been in a similar situation

I'm a Political Science student at a prestigious Canadian university, with one more school year until I'm finished my degree. I enjoy the content, but do not plan on pursuing social sciences further after my degree. I also have experience with Computer Science/programming (Python, Java; mainly do web dev stuff)--which I really enjoy, but do not see myself pursuing a related (e.g., dev) career. I've really been thinking about where I want to be after graduation, and only find myself getting anxious because I really don't know. Over the past year or two, I started taking myself and my future more seriously by putting myself 'out there' more. I.e., recognizing where I excel, volunteering, talking with professionals, and just developing a broader network, I recently landed a director position with a charity (got promoted from a ""specialist"" after 2 months), which I'm enjoying so far. 

Anyways, to make this short, I procrastinated on looking for summer internships (never have had one) and finally started but realized I have no idea what to look for. I have no idea where or what to look for, I don't know what kind of jobs are out there, or what industry to look at. What I tell people (and myself) when asked where I want to be, I say I could see myself in the tech industry--but I truly don't know what that means. I don't want to be a lawyer, or a professional programmer, and I really don't want to work in retail for the rest of my life. The broad implications of my degree and skills just make everything more confusing.

What I'm asking for is some guidance: based on what I’ve written, what direction do you think I should take? What advice do you have for me? Thanks! :D

44ck5c,1,2016-02-05,Cross-Post from r/Batch_Files: Trying to make a Bulk Install Script work with multiple hosts.,powershell_account,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/44ck5c/crosspost_from_rbatch_files_trying_to_make_a_bulk/,"
Hey r/learnprogramming, it seems there is more support in this sub than r/Batch_Files simply due to volume of users in this sub.

For the past 3 weeks, I have been teaching myself Batch/CMD scripting to make a batch script that asks the user for a .TXT file of bunch of hostnames, and then proceeds to copy the Installer folder on their root/temp and then runs a silent installer. I am using Batch because we don't have the capability of pushing this silent installer using SCCM at the moment, so Batch is the simplest method to go.

I used ROBOCOPY command to copy the contents of one folder onto anther folder that I create with the MKDIR command on a remote host.

I keep running onto an error when the remote host is not online (say, the user went off to lunch of something, either turned off their machine, or is offline). How do I put in a condition that will skip to the next host (next item) in a .TXT file and continue on with the script?
lets say, check if host is online, and if they are, continue with script, if not, skip this host and go to next host in .TXT file, then continue with installation script?
This is what I have so far (Also, if you have suggestions for improvement, or a great resource to learn more, I would love to hear it):

    @ECHO OFF
    SETLOCAL ENABLEEXTENSIONS

    :: script global variables
    SET log=c$\BulkInstall_log.txt

    SET /P HostNamesFile=Enter .TXT file path of HOST NAMES: 
    ECHO.

    FOR /F %%i IN (%HostNamesFile%) DO (
        ECHO Found Hostname,%%i
        ECHO Making CarbonBlackSensor Folder in user's c:\Temp directory
        MKDIR \\%%i\c$\Temp\CarbonBlackSensor
        ECHO $ERRORLEVEL%

        ROBOCOPY C:\Temp\CarbonBlackSensor \\%%i\c$\temp\CarbonBlackSensor
        REM IF ROBOCOPY Does not Succeed, go to the next item in the .TXT file

        PSEXEC.EXE \\%%i\ cmd /c ""c:\temp\CarbonBlackSensor\CarbonBlackClientSetup.exe /S""
        TIMEOUT 3
        REM Using this crazy syntax below to store the output of the Net Start command to a variables
        REM Not sure why Batch requires the use of a for loop to store command output to a variable
        FOR /F ""tokens=* USEBACKQ"" %%F IN (`""NET START | findstr Carbon""`) DO (
            SET CheckService=%%F
        )
            REM Now doing a comparison check to make sure that the Carbon Black Service is Running
            IF /I ""%CheckService%""==""Carbon Black Sensor"" (
                ECHO ""Carbon Black Sensor Successfully installed on hostname,%%i,date,%Date%,time,%TIME%,CMD Exit Code,%ERRORLEVEL%"" &gt;&gt; %log%
    ) ELSE (
                ECHO ""Carbon Black Sensor was not Installed Successfully,hostname,%%i,date,%Date%,time,%TIME%,CMD Exit Code Code,%ERRORLEVEL%"" &gt;&gt; %log%
        )
    )   
    ENDLOCAL

This is how far I have gotten. I have a while to go but I am enjoying the simplicity of Batch Scripting, having come from PowerShell world (I learned PowerShell first through an internship). Batch is simpler for our teams to use since there are less version issues and all you really need is the elevated privileges to do the installation.
Thank you for your help."

I always told myself and others that I had a storybook childhood. In retrospect, although I recognize that I have been luckier than most in this fucked up sorry excuse of a world, I just haven't wanted to admit the shit I've been through. I was molested at age 4 by some older playmates, and since then I have been addicted to masturbation. I am female. I was born in the US but my parents never taught me English and I am naturally shy so I shit my pants a lot in preschool. People picked on me but I never really had a bully because I never took anyone's shit. I learned how to make myself invisible. I am also objectively in the  top 1% IQ level but have never been satisfied with my achievements. I made no friends until I went to a STEM oriented highschool. Before that I went through a period of anorexia because some infinitely stupid part of me though that if I could fit into the type of clothes the popular kids wore, regardless of the fact that I could never have afforded them, I would magically make friends. Throughout my childhood I studied human behavior but never understood it. Yet I am not capable of fitting the definition of sociopath or high functioning autistic because I am empathetic and good at reading emotions and recognizing other's perspective. Also I'm a natural politician, though I have always hated that side of me. I almost died at age 12 because I got appendicitis and didn't have health insurance and am Hispanic so my parents never took me to the hospital even when I puked for a week straight and had a fever of 104. Eventually they took me to a clinic and they rushed me to the hospital, days after my appendix had burst ( I knew when it happened because the stabbing pain disappeared). I hated myself intensely for the monetary debt my 10 day hospitalization caused my parents. In highschool I excelled at everything from clubs to classes to flattering the right teachers and getting into the right summer camps. However I was constantly stressed and sleep deprived, and also for the first time realized that even there I didn't fit in because I wasn't rich and my parents weren't educated. Meanwhile in my family I was ostracized for being ""too white"" and a nerd. During the recession my dad went into business with my aunts and uncles which eventually resulted in a giant argument that tore my family apart. Soon after a SWAT team raided my house because of some stupid shit my older brother had gotten involved in. I had an assault rifle pointed to my chest but was explicitly told by my parents never to tell anybody what had happened. I got into my dream school and earned myself some scholarships and worked through my senior year for money and by 18 I was financially independent. I had a lot of fun my first few months in college and was happy to be far enough away from my family that it was impractical to ever visit. Soon though the imposters syndrome set in. I got myself a shiny ass internship 3k miles away from home for the summer and repeated the process sophomore year. However everything went to shit sophomore spring when I developed a severe anxiety disorder. That combined with the strongest bout of depression I had ever experienced, a growing feeling of incompetence, and a number of suicides amongst my broad social circle made me decide to take some time off. I quickly got promised a year long internship in the same city as my school so I didn't bother to job hunt during the summer. I completed my summer internship and was soon informed that I did not in fact have a job. Even though I had some cash in my bank accounts I agreed to move back in with my parents because they were offering free room and board while I searched for a job. I thought it would be extremely temporary, but while back home my depression intensified to the point where I was spending entire days just staring off into space. I couldn't get help because I didn't know my city of residence yet. I became suicidal. I got committed. I spent over a month in intensive therapy. I briefly improved but then it became apparent my meds weren't working and my psych was an incompetent asshat and I decided to off myself out of frustration. I got committed again. I missed many interviews and job opportunities this way. I was too ashamed to tell my friends what I was going through. I finally found a good psych and shrink in my network and after months of work I began to improve. I hung out with my friends from high school, I responded to job offers and regained my confidence as I kicked ass in interviews. I took up skateboarding and busted my face and managed to respond to the situation calmly and rationally. I began to feel like my old self. Then my 5 year old niece suddenly died from a cold induced asthma attack. My family came together in a way I hadn't experienced in many years and thought would never experience again. As sick as it made me feel, I was perversely happy to be reunited with my cousins and brother. We grew up together and they were my only and best friends. Then the panic attacks returned, but only at night so I can't sleep. I adopted a kitten. These past few weeks have been the happiest in a very long time, just as they've been fucked up. I have some very promising job offers and a chance to return to school and still have some money in my bank account. My family is close and I am reconnecting with my friends. I love my cat and she shows affection towards me and comforts me when I lose control. I don't know why I did it but I told my father about my previously repressed memory of my molestation and all the years I suffered hating myself because at first I didn't know what masturbation was, just that the big people said it was wrong, and later because our misogynistic society lead me to believe it was only natural for males to do it. He responded simply with ""I know and so does your mom"". I went about my day's activities unbothered, but when I woke up from an exhausted nap I was inexplicably angry. I attempted to have dinner with my parents but couldn't stop myself from insulting them at every opportunity they gave me. I have thought about it and now realize why I am angry. I feel nothing now except an intense desire to hurt them. I know the most effective way to do so is to kill myself and leave a note telling them that I hate them. They didn't give me a second's glance while I figured out everything from boyfriends to small business tax documents on my own during adolescence because they were always too busy helping my brother. Now I realize that it was a mistake to make myself their dependant once again. I am an adult and a human and it is my fundamental right to decide how I live and how I did. Fuck them, I didn't need them as a child and I sure as hell don't need them now as an adult. I choose to die. Let them deal with the Fucking consequences for one goddamed time."
44edv3,3,2016-02-05,I desperately need some advice about my job situation. Long post. [X-post from r/talesfromthepharmacy],OOTPDA,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/44edv3/i_desperately_need_some_advice_about_my_job/,"Hey there, hello there!
 
I'm a newly registered pharmacist who has posted on reddit before about how [I'm starting to love pharmacy again after a rough year](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePharmacy/comments/3zm0uy/starting_to_love_pharmacy_again_been_a_rough_year/).
 
Anyhow, it seems that the rough year isn't quite over and **I'd love some advice/some steeling of my nerves/some reassurance before I do what I'm about to do**.
 
Let me just preface this by saying that I'm generally very good at making my own decisions and sorting my own life out. But, I feel like some outside perspective from people who have experience with situations like this would be wonderful at the moment.
 
**Summary of previous post:**
After an acquaintance from my previous work (who left to run his own pharmacy) offered me a full time job for after my internship then told me he didn't have anything any more, when I'd all but finished up my internship job, I found 3 days/week at a sole pharmacist pharmacy and got placed as back up for another pharmacy plus got 1 day a week as medical reception. So I had enough to pay the bills.
 
Since then I've also been offered a few days in another pharmacy (which clash with the days I'm doing now, but could be handy later).
 
Once this all happened, **the first guy (who offered me a job, then changed his mind)** - we'll call him Slim (for Slim Shady, cos he's kinda shady)- **calls me and says, ""we've got full time work for you now""**. So, silly me, all for giving people second chances, decided to have coffee with him and hear him out.
Turns out a lot of his pharmacists are leaving the pharmacy and he has ""worked really hard"" to get me ""almost full time work"" (his words, not mine).
 
 
**So the conversation when we had coffee went something like this:**

Me: I have work now, Slim. I had to find something once you told me you didn't have anything.

Slim: But I have some now and it's **almost full time**. I need you. You're like a daughter to me. (bear in mind he says this a lot, but has also said to me, ""if I were 20 years younger, I'd marry you."" Super professional.)
 
Me: But I can't just turn my back on the other guys. (frankly, I just didn't really trust him and the pay he offered me wasn't worth what I'd be doing there). If you get me a contract. I'll read it and think about it.
 
 
So I left with the promise that I'd get a contract to read over. **And here is what he offered wage-wise at the meeting**:
 
* $30/hr Monday-Saturday inclusive (should be time and a half on Saturdays). ($30/hr is about the standard for someone just registered in my town. I know it's probably less than some countries, too, but Australia pays less for pharmacists than say, the US or Canada.)
 
* $45/hr on Sundays
 
* $60/hr to be on call once every 4 weeks (the pharmacists all rotate)- this means if a nursing home (that pharmacy looks after over 1000 patients in nursing homes) calls in the middle of the night with a phone order I would have to get up, go to the pharmacy (which is in a super dodgy area) and open, dispense and take the med out to the home. I'm 5ft 2in and that area is known for addicts, theft and worse.

 
So before I even got the contract, I was thinking I wouldn't do it. I could live off what I have at present with much less stress.
 
The, Slim calls me a few days later, a Monday:
 
Slim: I sent you a contract, why haven't you signed it?
 
Me: I haven't received anything from you and I'll need time to look it over when I do.
 
Slim: Ok, I'll send it again (:/ again)
 
So about 12 hours later, at 8pm, I receive another call:
 
Slim: I have your contract here, I'm sending it now. I've had it for a few days. We'd really like it back by Wednesday
 
Me: Look, I'll need to read over it and it will take a few days
 
Slim: There's not much to it. We can offer you full time. But your contract won't say full time.
 
Me: ... (he's just trying to get out of paying me holiday and sick leave)
 
Slim: **And, I know you were worried about telling your other employer you're leaving, so I called them for you this afternoon and told them you're gonna come and work with me**
 
Me: YOU WHAT?!
 
Slim: Now you don't have to worry!
 
Me: Slim. I do not even have a contract from you! I haven't told my other employer I'm considering leaving! You've backed me into a wall.
 
Slim: I'm just doing what's best for you. Anyway, read the contract and let me know. I'll send it now.
 
So naturally I called my employer straight away (by then it'd been at least 4 hours since Slim called them) and told them that under no condition would I be leaving them to work for Slim and that I hope they didn't think badly of me for the whole incident, and that I hadn't even considered Slim's offer.
 
They were really cool about it, saying they didn't think I would ask someone to do their dirty work and that they didn't trust him and they think I'm fantastic (shucks). But **then they dropped another bomb**:
They're either selling their pharmacy or closing it's doors, so I have a few months with them guaranteed but they can't promise what will happen afterwards. FUUUUUUUUUUU. So I should take a better offer if I get one, but hold out for better than what Slim offered me.
 
Then I went into panic mode and got into contact with a pharmacist who had offered me full time at a pharmacy an hour away from home (I'm in Australia, so taking that job means a long drive on a wide open road with lots of kangaroos to hit, especially in winter- it would be a dangerous drive). He said the position is still open and to come and see him the following Tuesday (Tuesday before last), in one of his pharmacies 2 hrs away. So I did, and it went well (I think). **A summary of the outcomes:**
 
* He said he's interviewing a few other people but I'm ""well ahead of them""
 
* He asked me to come down to the pharmacy I'd be working at, so he could show me around it, the next Saturday (today)
 
* He then messaged me a few days ago to say, ""Hi, I'm not going down to [town with pharmacy in it] this Saturday now, [business partner] can meet you there the following weekend if that suits you."" (I'm like, sh*t, another week of not knowing, but at least they didn't cancel)
 
* I replied, ""That's not a problem, I will come down the following weekend. I'm extremely interested in the position.""
I'm hoping that this means he genuinely can't meet up and not him fobbing me off. I'd like to think he wouldn't chuck a Slim and lead me on when I'm not getting the job. Perhaps he just wants me to meet his business partner and/or is busy?
 
So now I have a week from today to wait before I can go see the pharmacy/hopefully get a yes or no.
 
I haven't officially turned down the job with Slim, cos I wanted something lined up before I do. But now, that will be at least a week away, if I'm offered one at all. And Slim has called me twice in the past 2 days, which I haven't answered cos I've been working. But I really should call him back and give him ~~what for~~ an answer.
 
**Ok, so what I'm wondering:**

* Should I turn down the Slim job? I honestly don't think working with him is a good idea. He can't be trusted and aside from that, he makes a lot of mistakes as a pharmacist (I worked with him in my intern job). I feel like I'd put my registration in danger by working for/with him. On the other hand, it's a job in my home town and it'd be close to full time.
 
* (Since I'm fairly sure you'd all agree that working for Slim is a bad idea) How do I turn down this job professionally, whilst stating why I'm turning it down (him being unethical, bad job offer etc). Bearing in mind that I may find a job in the same town as him in the future and have to liaise with him and his wife, who is a GP in the town.
 
* Would you say I still have a chance with the other job 1 hour away, considering they didn't cancel the meeting at the pharmacy, just rescheduled it? They've already met me and are wanting me to come see the pharmacy, that's a good sign right? Even if it has been rescheduled.

Sorry to bug y'all, I'd just really appreciate a fresh perspective. I also don't like burning bridges (Slim's offer), especially when I don't have anything to go to yet, but in this case it doesn't seem like a bridge I'd want to have.

**Thank you for reading (I'm sory it's so long), I'd love some advice!**"

Preferably, I would do a Mechanical Engineering internship, but I don't really think that will happen this summer(not enough Project experience and other things). My idea is that if I were to get a CS internship, I could use that along with other CS courses that I might take and integrate it with something that wish to go into for Mechanical Engineering as well as to see what CS work might be like. In the end, I just want to know more about possibilities of actually doing a simple programming internship (if those even exist).

In addition, I would also like to ask, how would I go about advertising my Python knowledge on my resume other than just putting it under skills?"

I applied to a bunch of different internships and I had a phone interview. Two months later the phone interview boss A calls me for an in-person interview at internship A.

I had a sudden interview invitation a couple of days ago and the boss asked me to start on Monday at internship A. But since I hadn't heard from them in so long I'd already been invited for an interview on Tuesday, at Internship B. They scheduled it for 11:30 so I was thinking of taking an early lunch break and going to Internship B, but do you guys think this is too risky?

Internship A is full time. That's good because I need at least 120 hours work experience. But it's a problem because my boss was trying to convince me to commit to continuing to work unpaid after the first three weeks (which I don't want to do). Internship B has a small salary. They're both start ups-- A is a photo sharing app (which I'm not really behind as a concept since there is nothing different about it) and B is a health juice brand.

I'm not 100% sure Job A is the right cultural fit for me. Especially since the boss of Internship A is trying to convince me to do web design things when I'm not as interested/skilled/competent in that area and it was advertised as graphic design. One of my friends works downstairs though so that is a plus.

Internship A seems really disorganised. But it's in an office with lots of different companies so I guess it might be good for networking.

The risk I'm taking is leaving Internship A early for my interview at B, getting in trouble/fired, and then maybe not getting internship B.

The thing is since these internships are unpaid(A)/low paid(B) (I need to do intern/professional experienc eto complete my degree for uni) I'm still keeping my casual job at the movies working night hours to make ends meet. So on Tuesday I have to leave early at 4pm anyway to get to my night shift. I feel awkward since I already agreed to the time at Internship B in advance.

What would you do in this situation?"

I hesitated to open this thread, but I think that your advice would greatly help me here. I will give you as much info as I can.

I don't know where to begin. I'm from Spain and looking for a job. So far I rejected 2 offers that sucked (a while ago, when I still hadn't been demoralized by 2 months of fruitless job hunt) and now I'm in a bind with this one.

I don't intend to discuss personal issues in here since it's just not the place to do so, but let's say for context that I have trouble at home, more serious than you might imagine, and I'm heavily pressured to leave my parents house.

I've been preparing for this job hunt for years now while on my last 2 college years, doing internships (1yr), a personal portfolio of mobile and web apps, Open Source contributions to a large well known project, and Stack Overflow contributions. I know there are more people like this but I actually expected this effort to make things easy and I'm really disappointed.

I have a 6 months gap on my resume after graduating due to a medical issue which is probably a dead weight.

Our field is known to be lucrative, I've worked my ass off in order to be a strong candidate, and I wish for a job that allows me to rent a tiny flat of my own with a company that sounds legit, that's all.

Now to this offer I got now: from a vc funded startup, 17,000€ a year before taxes in Valencia, a relatively low COL city, with the promise of 21,000€ a year in 6 months. I think it's an insult, and probably wouldn't even allow me to live on my own. But man I'm so pressured to take something. For more info, in the interview the guys sounded like they think they are hot shit for offering a job in a city with a shitty scene, and I don't trust them. I have to respond next Monday maximum or they call someone else instead. A friend says to just tell them the minimum amount of money I'm willing to take since I don't want the job anyway, another friend says to accept it and keep looking even if I leave within a month.

For more context, I'm getting 1-3 calls a week, but in the end, only 3 shitty offers so far. The 'good' ones won't make me an offer. I'm mainly applying to startups if that matters. I'm through 4 hiring processes, 2 of which probably went silent.

The question here is, what do you think are my chances of it ending up well if I reject this, and what would you do?"

I am currently in a PhD program in the psychological sciences, but I have a BS in computer science. My plan is to leave my program at the end of this semester with an MA, then try to get a job in software development. The problem is that I've been in academia for my entire adult life, and I'm not sure how make my skillset and experience appeal to potential employers. 

I have a BS in computer science and won a number of academic awards as an undergrad, and I have a couple years experience in a non-CS, but still fairly technical, subfield of psychology (computational modeling). The big problem, however, is that my non-academic experience amounts to a single summer internship in software development a few years ago. (I liked it but thought my calling was in academia.) Sure, I've programmed in Java, C#, C++, R, MATLAB, and Python, but (almost) always in a small-scale, academic setting, and my lack of experience makes me pretty nervous not only about how my resume will look to employers, but also about any interviews that I may land down the road.

I am first year student in Software Engineering (maybe that's the problem?) but I already did an associate degree in Computer Science so I am able to technically code. I've been comparing myself to second year students in University, just because I don't have any Software Engineering classes until my 4th semester (for now it's just Math courses and Engineering courses like ethics and stuff like that).

Anyways, right now I am working in a restaurant to pay tuition fees and expenses, so my plan is to get an internship during summer, quit the restaurant and live my whole school year out of those summer savings... Somehow, my plan isn't work out well so far (so I can stop working during my academic year and concentrate in my classes, GPA and stuff).

I've got only one interview but they didn't contact me afterwards. I felt it went good but I didn't have enough time to solve the technical question (I did it verbally but trying to code it made me run out of time). Other than that, nobody has called. 

I will post my Resume here so you can judge.

(CS Major),Yearbookthrowaway1,UMD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/44jnbz/can_someone_help_me_figure_out_what_i_should_be/,"So I'm currently a sophomore CS major, I came into UMD planning on majoring in Bio but switched to CS last semester. This has made me fall pretty far behind the curve in terms of when I will finish all my classes. I'll need to take a bunch of summer and winter classes to graduate on time. This is annoying, but I'm up for the challenge because I'm really excited about moving forward with CS. 

However, I'm trying to figure out the best way to go about the rest of my track. To stay on track I'm *supposed* to take CMSC132 and Math 141 over the summer, so I can do CMSC 216 and 250 in the fall. However, there are a few concerns that I had with doing this. The first is that my home is back in Baltimore County, not down here. Taking classes on campus would mean me taking an hour and a half drive up and down every day all summer. Obviously this is something I'd like to avoid, so I thought of the following plan. CCBC offers Calculus 2 credit that is transferable to UMD, but CMSC credits can't transfer from anywhere into UMD. Would it be a viable plan to take the Calc 2 class at CCBC alongside an equivalent CMSC course to CMSC 132, and then take the UMD placement test, or would I be dooming myself to fail the placement test this way. 

My second concern is that I was hoping to do some kind of internship this summer. But since I have basically zero coding experience besides the 2 weeks of CMSC 131 that I've had, I don't know if it's even realistic to try and do a CompSci internship so early. Do companies even want interns with so little experience? In a field with so many coding wunderkids that have been building apps since they were in diapers, I'm worried that I won't be a competitive candidate for a long time.

Of course im interested! But I risk ruining relationships with my current company, upheaving my progress in my school's co op program, and its back to square one.

Despite the fact that they said that they had accepted me for the internship in December, I have not yet received any details concerning the internship. I guess this is what the meeting is about.

I've been a professional Software Engineer for almost 2 years now. At first, I was excited about getting into new things and doing real business development with a team (I was a one man intern before).

Over these 2 years, I've become a less confident stress ball all of the time. I don't really know what I should do to fix this. Part of this may be that I'm too hard on myself or that I just don't want to disappoint anyone with my code or its delivery.

I would love to here some advice or tips from you guys (and gals)."

I woke up fairly confident since I rocked the phone interview two weeks ago, but I cracked open ""Cracking the Coding Interview"" and attempted some of the problems spurring some nervousness. 

I was wondering how much ""coding"" is actually involved during whiteboarding? Would the interviewer expect me to write out the entire code or just bits and pieces? Should I start out with a list of the steps I would undergo to solve the problem and then jump into coding? This also leads into my next couple questions. 

I'm in the beginning of my second year of CS and I took Algorithms and Data Structures last semester, but I don't quite remember all of the code for these structures. I know how I would go about solving a problem, say a determine if there's a palindrome in a linkedlist problem and could explain it fairly well. I also remember the time/space complexities of these structures, but I cannot remember how to write the code for these structures.  

I also learned these structures in Java, but my current course load is working with C. I'm terrified that along the line I'll end up switching up the code (for example,  accidentally make pointers if I'm writing in java.  I know I'm probably freaking out for no reason, but I was wondering if anyone had any tips for me to recall these structures and prepare for my whiteboarding interview.

What kind of salary should I expect with an associates in Information Technology a resume with being employees at 4+ different IT roles and now as an IT administrator + any suggested certifications?

2. Do you have any suggestions for first year courses? Ideally I'd like to learn enough so that I'm not idle the following summer, that I could either get an internship (unlikely), or do research, or really anything that will potentially look good to a future employer.

3. Any other tips for ECE or just UIUC in general?

I should mention that at the internship I felt like I knew nothing at all and no one was willing to teach me or tell me what to do and that I was useless and a huge burden on my employers. I should also mention that I was only given the internship because the owners are my father's friends.
My last interview about ASP.NET went very well but I think I got rejected as they feared I could not balance work and my graduate education, which I am willing to leave as I want to finish it in the US and only needed 3 subjects to transfer credits to reduce costs there.NOTE: I live in Pakistan, a large part of my family is in the US.

My communication skills especially verbal, and I am beginning to suspect, also written are horrible and I suspect I have some psychological disorder. In particular, I am unable to maintain eye contact, my voice is terrible and I have been told many times that I talk too fast to understand. I will also mention that I have no friends and don't really talk much to people outside my family or even in my family and generally have difficulty talking about anything except computers.

I was the group leader in my Final Year Project at my university and received my project received the highest score awarded that semester(unfortunately, it was still 3.33 and no one got above that in my final BSCS semester). I should also mention that I graduated from one of the top Computer Science universities in my country and and a final GPA of 2.82, with a CGPA above 3.0 for the last two semesters. 
Unfortunately, due to the mentioned communication problems I have, I did not participate in any extra curricular activities or competitions.
My preferred languages are Python or C# and I have used C, C++, Java, a little bit of Scala and Prolog but I don't use them often so I am not as proficient in them. I also did some game development in Unity for a Coursera course, and I am currently also learning Django using a book called Test Driven Development with Python. I know how to use Git as well as some Github, and I am completing a Udacity course to fill any gaps in that subject. I have deployed websites on both Microsoft Azure and Amazon AWS. I have completed many courses on Coursera, including some paid ones.
I am also willing to learn anything else required for a job.
I feel like I don't have enough deep knowledge in any one topic because I have never worked on a full scale professional project.
I also don't know what I should focus on in terms of language or technology, I had a lot of AI related courses in my BS and am doing a Neural Networks course in my MS right.
I am willing to work for free and tried to volunteer for online work but was rejected as they only accept volunteers in person(the country the organization is located in is the UK).

Last year, I started working full time in a company I had worked before as intern and working student. Exactly the same week I started my internship, my coworker also started his full time job. We are a small company, so everyone has to work and talk with one another over time. We didn’t get along very well from the start, maybe because our characters are so extremely different, but I thought that we could nonetheless maintain a professional business relationship. He is around 15 years older than me and he likes to remind everyone of that (“Oh she can’t know this TV series, she’s way too young.”). I’m of course no psychologist, but I think he maybe only acts self-confident to cover up his own deficits. 
Because I started as an intern, he always treated me less respectful than he treated our other coworkers, even though they treated me just like a normal colleague. I always feared that this would stay the same even when I start working full time and of course it did. He still sees me as inferior which has now even increased because he got promoted. He says unflattering things about my work behind my back (“What is she even doing all day long?”), degrades me in front of my boss and I simply don’t have the balls to revolt against this behavior, because I'm more defensive and shy. Funnily, he is not the biggest workaholic the world has ever seen, but he is charismatic and good with words and I guess that’s how he finds his way through life. I however am still young and trying to find my way into the business. All my colleagues confirm that I’m working hard enough and that I shouldn’t take his words to heart, but I think they can’t really relate because he is always nice and friendly to them. That and the fact that he got promoted recently is why nobody stands up to me or helps me, even though they all think it’s unfair.
During the normal day to day working life, I have learned to deal with it. It’s not great, but well, *I don’t have to marry him* as my mother would say. But now, our boss sends us on a business trip together for three days. I don’t suffer from travel anxiety or anything, I already went on a day trip on my own to another country and went on a 2-day trip with another coworker I like, but this is different. I will have to spend a huge amount of time with someone I don’t like and from whom I know also can’t stand me and I will have no possibility to leave at 5pm and just go home to relax. Also, I fear that he will continue to belittle me in front of potential business partners and I obviously don't want that. I tried to talk to my boss but he said that I couldn’t predict how it’s going to be and if I didn’t even try, I would never know. Because I can’t possibly cancel all this, I am now looking for advice and ways to make the best of this unholy trip. I am grateful for any story you might want to share!

I am one of billions from India. I am currently doing my engineering degree from one of best college available in country (IIT ?). I worked all my life in hope of getting better (if it exist :/ ) future. But, now after more than 2 years, I feel broken. 

Everything went perfect in my life, except I made one choice of listening to heart instead of brain, and fall in love for a Muslim girl. (I belong to Hindu family). I love her almost equal to my love for my parents, and I understand my different type of responsibility toward all. (keep it separate, it will be in context after few paragraphs)

Now coming back to the blackmail part, this started from the end of my first year only. I was good with technologies, which landed me into winter internship with ? (say Company). I decided to go for it, and worked with them instead of going to home back. From that event in my life only, the differences b/w me and my family started. They behaved fine in starting.

Soon, the next semester ended and the Company again offered my internship in summer which I couldn't deny. (for those who think why, it was because the company is one of best option in country, package ~18Lakh/year). Thus I went from 1-2 week home in summer, and then rest internship. After this, the differences increased, and I started feeling them. It was first time the emotional blackmail start coming into picture. They made me feel like I have forgotten them, or as if... Well, I don't know, I did everything in life to fulfill their expectations. And, I feel I did well.

Overall, I got pissed by these all events, and then spent this winters with them only. (with some another decent internship/work)

But what happened at last?
They now have started showing this every day I call to them in night. They behave like small kids, seeking if I am coming home these holidays and all. Even when I made it clear when all I am coming. Just for example, I told them I am coming, and even shared reservations for Holi holidays, Summers, etc.

I am sick of this attitude now. I feel like quitting everything at once. What was the use of working in order to get job, when it had to end like this?
Even, they in today's date don't know about my relationship, which I think will just add up more events. I feel tired, should this be the end to everything I am doing?
I wonder if she, and parents will work together. Should I remain in relationship with person who actually care and understand me more than parents, or, I should leave her even, just because they are *parents* ? 

Should I leave engineering, and give a new start to life sitting at hometown?

So some background, I'm in my very early twenties, just out of college a year ago, was lucky enough to have a great job straight away in the suburbs, about 5-10 min away from where I grew up, so I still live at home.  Now my company had a great internship program where I met a lot of other cool people my age who now also work full time with me at the same company. I have a great living situation at home, my parents enjoy having me around and my commute to work is next to nothing.  Most of my friends that I work with (which are like 99 percent of the people I hang out with in the area) live in the city, and commute to work. They all go out alot downtown and just seem to have alot of fun on weekends, meet alot of new people, have more opportunities to meet SOs etc (this may be where my FOMO may just be coming in to play). On the other hand thier commute is like an hour to an hour and a half every day. I have two friends in particular who currently live in the suburbs near me who I have talked to about rooming together. They don't seem to go out really much at all, and they don't want to live in the city and want to look mostly in the suburbs. I feel like I may not be gaining much of anything if I move out of home and in with them in the suburbs as I'll be living in the same area and the same commute, now I'll just be paying way more rent. I don't think I want to live in the city alone or with a random roommate. I guess I have some other friends I could talk to and see if they would be interested at all, but at the same time I don't know that the city is worth it either with the added 2-3 hours a day of driving for the possible added social benefits. Then there is the possibility of just staying put at home, continuing to save money, take the safe route. But then I feel like I might be screwing over my two friends by not living with them, or missing out. Basically I feel like I might be unhappy with all of these options, and I've sort of just moved all these thoughts to the back of my head because I can't find a decision I feel happy with and almost wish I never had to think about it at times which I know is super immature and not the right way to go about this, so I just wanted to see if I could get some thoughts from the community, sorry for the massive wall of text.

44th2i,7,2016-02-08,"Take internship, or remain with current full time.",Spartanis,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/44th2i/take_internship_or_remain_with_current_full_time/,"Hi /r/cscareerquestions,

This is my first time posting, and I figured you might be a great resource to find some advice.

My question. I'm currently working full time for the university (ASU) I attend, making decent pay for my area ($42,000 in PHX), as well as getting benefits (free school, healthcare, PTO etc). I am studying computer science, and will be graduating this December. 

I was recently offered a summer software developer internship in Redlands, CA with Esri, which is going to pay $25/hr, with no living stipend. 

I know taking this job would greatly improve my chances of finding a full time upon graduation, and also possibly offer the chance of going full time with Esri at the end of the internship. 

I just don't know if it's worth it to leave my full time job to work for the summer, and not have any job for my final semester at school.

If I leave my current job, I'm going to have to take out at least $10k in loans to finish school, which I normally wouldn't have to do with my current job, but I'd also gain the internship experience at Esri. 

Any thoughts or suggestions would be much appreciated in helping me make the right choice. "
44tp6t,6,2016-02-08,Don't know what to do,Mira113,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/44tp6t/dont_know_what_to_do/,"I'm tired of trying so hard everyday. There's nobody who would care if I died, they'd either be relieved to finally be rid of me or annoyed at the troubles I cause them. 

I had been wanting to die for years, only thing that kept me from it is my cowardice. I suck at everything I do, so I'm too afraid to fuck up trying to kill myself to do it. It had been ok for a few months, I mean, I didn't want to live, but I didn't want to die either, I was more in a state of whatever happens happens, if I get run over and die that's fine. I had been getting along alright with others in my class, I was even thinking that maybe I could consider them friends, which I was surprised to end up thinking since I've been betrayed by every friends I've ever had and didn't think I'd ever be up for it again. However, I started thinking and, they only ever deal with me when they want my help, never for any reason. I sometimes go to talk to them just for the hell of it and they're polite enough to continue the conversation, but always try to end it so they can do something else. I guess that's still better than how most other people treat me, but I know that's going to change once our big team project is going to be finished since they won't have any uses for me afterwards.

A few months ago I started a transition because I found out I was transgender. I do feel a bit better about myself, which doesn't mean much considering how much I hated myself before. I had figured that if I didn't hate myself I could deal with having a bit more difficulty with other people, but it's proving to be harder than I thought. I expected people to treat me like crap because of what I am, I've been bullied pretty much all my life, so I could have handled that I guess. Turns out nobody does that, instead they all avoid me. I lost the few friends I had shortly after telling them about it since they started ignoring me and because of that we haven't talked or had any form of contact in the past 6 months, the people I was going to school with try to avoid having to deal with me. It just feels so hard being avoided like this. I wouldn't go back to before my transition even if I could, because I know I wouldn't be any better since I'd just hate myself to the point of making myself sick so instead I'm stuck with having everybody act like I don't exist unless I can be useful.

I'm also broke, no money to myself, though I still live with my parents, so I guess that's fine for now, but I can't manage to get a part time job, either because of my bad personality, ugly appearance, how much I suck at everything or because I'm trans, or maybe a bit of everything. I had applied for an internship at a video game company a few summers back, because I got denied being told I would be ""a waste of ressources"". I guess they're not wrong, there's nothing good about me, so no matter what I do, I'm still just wasting everything that's spent on me.

I sort of hate my parents. My dad keeps bringing up that it's thanks to him that I'm alive whenever I do anything that offends him, but it makes me furious every time he says it. I never asked to be born, and I'd rather be dead, and he'd rather never have had me too. After all, my parents cleared told me that they wanted to have a child, but that they regret having had me, and they told me that long ago, before they knew I was trans, or before I because a useless loser who can't get a job and is still living with their parents even though I'm 22 years old.

Honestly, I don't know what to do. I want to die, but I know I'm too much of a coward to actually go through with it and I feel like I'm not going to die anytime soon if I don't do it myself."

Sorry for the long post or jarbled ranting nonsense.  To preface, I was always a quiet kid, not because I was afraid to talk, but because I felt like I never had anything to say.  I didn't feel uncomfortable about being quiet until being bombarded every day with comments from just about everyone about why I was quiet. I guess that eventually developed into shyness/social anxiety/awkwardness.  I had a best friend in middle and high school, and acted just like her (extroverted, silly, etc).  When I moved out of state my junior year of high school, I didn't speak a word to anyone, feel into a deep depression and hated everything about myself and how quiet I was, and realized that I'd only had the friends I had back home because I was essentially a clone of that other girl.  The miniscule amount of friends I had at the new school was due to other people approaching me and asking me to hang out (but never me doing the same).  When I came back home my senior year of high school, I no longer copied the best friend.  I wasn't quiet, but I was definitely more calmed and less attention seeking in my demeanor (the best friend is a very ""PAY ATTENTION TO ME ALWAYS"" person).  I was honestly dead inside, not knowing how to be my own person.

So I thought going to college out of state and ""starting new"" would change things.  Nope, I was awkward and quiet and resting bitched faced there too.  But I always made the excuse ""this school is too small and preppy and so different from my ghetto ass hometown, and I have nothing in common with many people, and yadayada"" So I thought, transferring colleges would definitely change things.  Nope.  The college I'm at now is huge and literally 90 something percent commuter, and a lot of people work and are busy, a lot different from the expensive liberal arts college I transferred from.  But people still have friend groups.  My first semester at college #2 as a commuter, I ""faked it til I made it,"" using internet advice and stuff, and actually made a few friends/acquaintances.  This fall and spring, I decided to live on campus, and I feel like everything is back to square one.  

I've fallen out of touch with the friends I made from my first semester at College #2 (last spring), and now even the few friends from College #1 barely contact me.  For my 21st birthday, everyone who said they would come didn't, except an old friend from from college #1 and one of her friends.  Even my boyfriend (of like a month at the time) didn't come because he ""had a bad headache from work"".  I was devastated and wanted to die, and although I tried to tell myself it was because the night I planned my birthday it was raining really hard and that's why no one came, it was the first moment I realized I truly don't have anyone  close to me.  

Speaking of boyfriend, I feel like the only reason I got with him is because we were coworkers at a retail job, and I had to act bubbly at work, giving him the false impression that that's who I am all the time.  It was also during the summer of my ""fake it til I make it"" phase after my first semester at college #2 that we met.  When I'm at school or elsewhere now, that is not me.  I've over time gained confidence in my physical appearance, and I can communicate with people ""normally"" and be funny and give presentations, and have chitchats and study sessions, but beyond that close friendships do not grow, not even with friends I've had for years.  Not even with that girl I was friends with since middle school. 

I kept telling myself that my social life is fading because I'm overloaded with school and work, and the dorming social life at school #2 isn't for me.  I'm more of a artsy fartsy, outdoorsy scifi chick, and a lot of the people in the dorms at this school are ghetto as fuck.  I kept saying I can't make friends in my major classes, because I can't relate to the basic white girls and the dumb stuff they talked about.  I can't make friends here or there because it's OTHER PEOPLE, not ME with the problem. Communication works both ways, but why should I contact the friends I do have?  It's not like they'd wanna hang out with me anyway.

Basically, typical judgemental superiority/inferiority complex selfishness.  From the outside looking in, I appear confident and friendly and put together.  But I have no one.  I only hang out with my boyfriend and maybe an old friend or two from college #1 once or twice a month, if that.  The rest of my social interaction is with classmates, coworkers, and customers.  When guys talk to me, unless they are obviously gay or have a girlfriend, I am terrified they want something from me other than friendship and are pretending to be nice to get it, and keep myself kind but curt out of fear of being friendly and accidentally leading them on.  For all I know, they could think I'm the ugliest chick they've ever seen, but that's how I act and I hate it.  Many of my few female friends are not necessarily ""hot"" or traditionally attractive, and I would tell myself that it's because they are ""nicer"" than hot girls, but now I think I honestly feel threatened by girls who are attractive or prettier than me.  Even though I tell myself looks are not everything and personality is important, and I'm usually confident/okay with my appearance especially after realizing for the first time that I'm actually really damn good-looking when I try, I still feel like an insecure little girl around attractive women.  Because of my quiet demeanor outside of work, I also feel like I come off as a stuck up bitch, but the way I think sometimes, I feel like I am a stuck up bitch.

I have many attributes and traits about myself that I do not like.  I've reminded myself time and time again to not do such a such today, or to smile when walking to not appear mean, or to understand that every human is the same complex creature, but when I'm out in public outside of my job, I forget everything and don't actively take steps to empathize with or socialize with people beyond the basics.  I can smile and hold small talk with attractive women now, but I'm always wondering ""I bet her life is way better than mine"" (as if that's a problem anyway), I can give class presentations no problem and am usually the one others come to when they don't understand things, but it's been a long time since I've stayed up late laughing, genuinely laughing and bonding, with someone other than my boyfriend and 1 friend.  

Extracurriculars here are basically nonexistent, and I have recently gotten a new job that pays 12/hr, which is a step up from my 7.25/hr retail job.  I'm taken 16 credit hrs, working part time, applying for grad school and summer internships, and in my first real relationship since a two week stint my freshman year of highschool.  I feel overwhelmed but I don't want to lose anything by having a shitty personality, and I would like to be more outgoing and surrounded by friends and close relationships.  I feel as though all of my opportunities in life have come from faking it, but I really want to feel it.  I want to change who I am, like yesterday, and I know that can only happen by just being, in the moment, the person I know I can be.  

What steps can I take to stop being this childish person?  Once I hit grad school, I can not be stand offish with others in my cohort because they're ""basic"" and we have different interests.  I don't want to lose a guy I care about because I act differently when he's not around.  I don't want to spend most nights and free days alone because ""no one gets me"".  I really believe that close emotional relationships with family and friends is a major key to happiness, and something I never learned in my 21 years of life. Another thing I noticed during my ""fake it"" phase is that while trying to be genuinely interested in new people and engaging with them, sometimes after a while I would become physically exhausted.  This is linked to ""introversion,"" but I don't want to use that as a crutch or excuse for coming off as a bitch, and was wondering if there is a way to not feel tired while talking to people for long periods of time without caffeine.  

tldr:  I'm stuck up but also insecure but also like being alone but also get really really sad and lonely if alone for too long but also have personality issues I need to work on, help"

My current goal is to get into help desk tier 1 support to build my experience and career.

I've been an on and off student since January 2009 at my local community college. I've been financially independent since 2010 and feel like I've screwed myself over by working full time and taking a class here and there. They've all been customer service roles and my past employers have gotten to see how adept I am at solving problems, computers or otherwise.

I'm one of those millenials that grew up on Windows 95, 98, and XP. I cracked open my first case at age 8 to upgrade RAM, stuff like that. I worked retail PC repair in 2012-2013 and use a coworker as a reference who is blown away that I'm struggling to find work with my skill set.

My last job was at a call center out of town that paid poorly supporting financial software. I resigned because it wasn't a good fit, being that a call center cares about call center BS and not actually solving problems. That and the commute was costing me a lot of money in gas and a lot of unnecessary wear and tear on my daily driver. 4 months total.

I worked at a dealership before that as I'm a car enthusiast as well and worked there for 22 months before getting dismissed for no explainable reason. I started as a lot tech and took a position at the luxury brand to be basically tech support for the sat nav and radio (its that advanced and well, old people don't understand technology so well).

Before that I was at the retail store and before that I held a mental health staff position at my state's mental health agency (it paid stupid amounts but there was 0 room to grow).

I'm getting letters of recommendation from my former boss at the dealership and from my coworker at the retail store. I have one currently from my boss at the state who absolutely loved me and is dumbfounded I'm not in IT already.

I apply for entry level stuff that I meet minimum qualifications for through shared experience, however because its not truly IT work I feel like I get skipped over. 

I'm 99 credit hours into my Associates degree and have 6 specific classes to complete to get it with a certificate of completion in computer systems support. 3 more classes nets me two additional certificates in systems administration and network management and systems security.

At this time I'm fed up trying to support myself alone and leeching off my parents, so I've applied for FAFSA. The classes I need to take are not offered every term of course and I'm looking at another year to complete them all.

The jobs I've applied for I've seen the starting pay and I've thought that I'd seriously take way less to start just to prove my worth and build up to the listed entry pay. The duties are things I'm more than qualified to do. 

Problem is since I don't have my degree, nor official IT experience, and a varied job history, I'm just straight up struggling to even talk to a human. I just want interviews. Or an internship. But I think employers look at my history and instantly bar me. Or I'm on a blacklist somewhere of people not to hire. It's what it feels like.

I don't know what else to do. I'm sitting down with academic and career advisors in the next two weeks to talk about my situation. If I can manage to survive the next month I'll have a class needed to graduate to take spring term. To fill out my schedule I was thinking about taking business management classes since that's my end goal.

Any advice or help to get me into entry IT would be great. Thanks in advance."

I'm taking an Android programming course at the moment so perhaps I could perhaps create (an) Android app(s).

44w67z,0,2016-02-09,What am I supposed to do after 2 1/2 years of literally absolutely nothing? (for real this time),ThemJohns,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/44w67z/what_am_i_supposed_to_do_after_2_12_years_of/,"I've posted here several times here on a whim and not even look at feedback until days or weeks later because I was afraid, but this time I'm serious. I have been retreating from the corner for far too long and I need to seriously get my act together. I am in desperate need for answers.

Right now, my portfolio is completely barren since I graduated. I have nothing to show that I have been doing any sort of programming because I haven't. I have zero work experience and zero extracurricular work due to my own incompetence, and I have completely lost hope of landing a relevant job without pure blind luck. Every one of them is asking for years of experience in a language I don't know. I've tried applying for jobs online with whatever I had in the past years, but I've been rejected or ignored (mostly the latter) too many times.

At the moment, I am holding out until I could possibly apply for a coding bootcamp and get a job as a web developer, but every time there has been someone here who says it's a bad idea because I am essentially wasting my degree.

Then HOW am I supposed to use my degree if I have no practical way to use it? People have been giving me very vague suggestions, but I need ACTUAL resources. Answers like ""post code to GitHub"" is just extremely vague because I have no idea how to start in the first place. Internships aren't an option because there are virtually none of them that are offered to non-enrolled people. It also doesn't help that I learned almost nothing but C++ in college. I just want something structured and more guaranteed to help me redeem my career, but it's absolutely discouraging to hear that what might be my only hope is no good.

I'm sorry if this post sounds too demanding and personal, but I have almost completely lost hope at this point. I'll answer whatever questions you might have for me for clarity."
44ww4s,33,2016-02-09,I was the perfect patsy,BabyGiraffe2015,GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/44ww4s/i_was_the_perfect_patsy/,"I have been unemployed the last six months. Back in May, I graduated from college (a highly prestigious one at that), and I didn't exactly have a job lined up. Fortunately, I was able to intern (unpaid) for a congressman, but that was just a summer gig. Being new to the job search market as well, I really didn't know how to keep my ear to the ground and look for jobs while interning. Once the August recess began, I was officially unemployed. 

These past six months have been hell, job application after job application, and hardly even a call-back. For a while, I thought I was destined to be one of those 30 year old basement bums who never found work beyond fast food. One day, I downloaded a job search app, Jobr, basically a tinder for job searchers. Their job options aren't the most appealing, but some did grab my interest. 

The same day I swiped right for a certain job, I got a callback asking to set me up for an interview. I was ecstatic. Six months had passed and not even an interview. This was my chance! The next morning, I got a haircut, suited up, and went in to give it my all. 

The Jobr app for some reason said the job was in Arlington, but it was actually in Rockville. I live in Fairfax, so that's a hellish commute for me. Oh well, I've been praying this day would come, and now's my chance to get a job. When I showed up, it was at this frumpy looking quasi-shopping center (not much shopping) that was mostly self-storage places. The front door was hidden and hard to find. The physical building itself gave me second thoughts. 

As a National Guardsman, I abide by the mantra of ""early is on-time, on-time is late, and late is unacceptable."" I walked in 10 minutes early as they said not to be more than 15 minutes early because of the interview schedule. My interview was scheduled for 11:00, but I didn't get called in until 11:20. The initial interview was just a quick tell me about yourself and your qualifications. It went well, and I was granted a second round interview. 

For the second round interview, one of the VPs took me to Dunkin' Donuts and basically told me everything about how the company works. He really made it sound like a fun and exciting place to work with a lot of very fast promotion opportunities. The idea was that I would start out as a trainee and make $500 the first week. Then I would work as a regular worker, making between $3000-4000 a month. After 4-6 months, I'd be a manager making between $5000-6000/month, and after 2 or so years, I'd be a top level executive making $7000-10000/month. He did tell me that hard work and competence is required, but if I work hard enough, anything is possible. I left all starry-eyed, forgetting to ask the basic question of what my day-to-day tasks include. 

Later that day, I got a call-back telling me I got the job offer. I hadn't been that happy in months. For the past six months, I had been unemployed and depressed, but I finally got a job! I eagerly told the VP yes. The next day, I came in for the on-boarding shenanigans, eager to start. I asked him when I should come in, and he told me MWF is around 9:30 and TuThS is 8:30. WTF?! You never told me we have to work Saturdays in my second round interview, but oh well, I had been looking for a job for months and was willing to take anything coming my way. 

Friday through Sunday, I had my National Guard drill. I was talking to my fellow 2LTs about my new job, and I couldn't exactly articulate exactly what I was doing. My actual job title was ""account manager."" I just told them I was doing outsourced marking for Verizon (our current client). I had just fallen into the hype of how awesome the job is. 

Fast forward to Monday, my first day of work. I was told to show up NLT 9:45 and show up at 9:30, eager to learn. One of the current ""managers"" gives me a basic intro to the sales techniques before the other new hires show up. About half of them showed up 30 mins late, and the actual training didn't start until 11:00. It was supposed to start at 10:00. 

My gut feeling from the time I went back to fill out the new hire paperwork was that it would be a door-to-door sales job, not my idea of a good job. It wasn't until the actual training started that it was in fact a door to door job, selling Verizon FiOs upgrades. On top of that, the pay is 100% commission based. It's 55 hours a week, 6 days a week, no guarantee of actually making something, and a 30 mile commute in a gas hog car. 

I came home disappointed. For months, I had been looking for a job, and one finally came, only the entire thing was a sleazy scam to recruit the naive, hard-working, and desperate college grads. I did not study hard in college and earn my degree to do a job a trained monkey could do. They promised I could be a manger quickly and the door-to-door part is only a stepping stone. After talking to my parents about how much this job blows, I decided to call the office back and tell them to rescind my offer. I quit after the first day, and I have zero regrets about it. 

The lesson I want everyone to learn from this is that there are a lot of unscrupulous companies preying on the naive, hard-working, and desperate college grads. Be sure to ask the questions they don't want you to ask such as ""What do the day-to-day tasks entail?"" ""Will I be doing X?"" and ""How is it possible for one to get promoted so fast?""

44xa9f,46,2016-02-09,I was the perfect patsy,BabyGiraffe2015,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/44xa9f/i_was_the_perfect_patsy/,"I have been unemployed the last six months. Back in May, I graduated from college (a highly prestigious one at that), and I didn't exactly have a job lined up. Fortunately, I was able to intern (unpaid) for a congressman, but that was just a summer gig. Being new to the job search market as well, I really didn't know how to keep my ear to the ground and look for jobs while interning. Once the August recess began, I was officially unemployed.

These past six months have been hell, job application after job application, and hardly even a call-back. For a while, I thought I was destined to be one of those 30 year old basement bums who never found work beyond fast food. One day, I downloaded a job search app, Jobr, basically a tinder for job searchers. Their job options aren't the most appealing, but some did grab my interest.

The same day I swiped right for a certain job, I got a callback asking to set me up for an interview. I was ecstatic. Six months had passed and not even an interview. This was my chance! The next morning, I got a haircut, suited up, and went in to give it my all.

The Jobr app for some reason said the job was in Arlington, but it was actually in Rockville. I live in Fairfax, so that's a hellish commute for me. Oh well, I've been praying this day would come, and now's my chance to get a job. When I showed up, it was at this frumpy looking quasi-shopping center (not much shopping) that was mostly self-storage places. The front door was hidden and hard to find. The physical building itself gave me second thoughts.

As a National Guardsman, I abide by the mantra of ""early is on-time, on-time is late, and late is unacceptable."" I walked in 10 minutes early as they said not to be more than 15 minutes early because of the interview schedule. My interview was scheduled for 11:00, but I didn't get called in until 11:20. The initial interview was just a quick tell me about yourself and your qualifications. It went well, and I was granted a second round interview.

For the second round interview, one of the VPs took me to Dunkin' Donuts and basically told me everything about how the company works. He really made it sound like a fun and exciting place to work with a lot of very fast promotion opportunities. The idea was that I would start out as a trainee and make $500 the first week. Then I would work as a regular worker, making between $3000-4000 a month. After 4-6 months, I'd be a manager making between $5000-6000/month, and after 2 or so years, I'd be a top level executive making $7000-10000/month.

They offered $60k salary, benefits kick in after 90 days. This is in California, in the same area as companies that are known to offer $85k or higher for new grads.

I felt insulted, because it isn't by any means my first job. I think they didn't bother to look at my resume. I had an internship as a software developer at a company in the midwest - it lasted for half a year and then the company made me a junior developer with a salary of $68k. I stayed for two months before moving to California  for an internship. Did that for half a year, and now I'm moving to another company in California for one more internship before I graduate. All in all, I'll have had nearly two years of experience in .NET development once I graduate this summer. 

I also had another half-year internship at a startup in Chicago three years ago, and a couple years of employment as an IT contractor. 

Should I feel insulted? Should I laugh my way to another company that understands that long internships are real jobs? At my current internship, the only difference between the full-timers and myself is that I get paid less. I do the same work. At my next internship, I'll be doing full-stack .NET development with the expectations that I'll be able to hit the ground running and produce. 

So should I push back on assertions like ""it's your first job out of college"" and whatnot? It was very irritating to hear and I feel like they're wasting my time. :/ Or should I just swallow my pride, take the role for a couple months, and then renegotiate the compensation package? I have a feeling every company will do this."

I feel like I've absorbed nothing, and have no skills.",knowledgethrownaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/44xsqm/student_finishing_up_cs_bachelors_i_feel_like_ive/,"Bear with me, I'm having a hard time putting this in words.

I should be finishing my degree by the end of this year. I am unable to bring myself to try internships or even try building something independently. I feel like I have almost no knowledge of programming/development, even though I have already taken the majority of classes required to at least begin work on something.

I am barely, if at all, using the knowledge I am getting from my classes. As a result, I believe I am starting to forget the fundamentals of programming. I am dreading having to find work in this field due to this.

With in-class projects, I can focus on working as a team and really get a deep understanding of what is going on. I truly enjoy myself and have no doubts about this degree. Once that project is over, however, the knowledge seemingly disappears. I can't recall how to do the majority, if not all, the work I did.

Outside of uni, I have taken side jobs to aid myself financially. They are not necessarily, or at all, related to my degree. I have done a few years of retail sales, a couple of years at a help-desk style job, and I've had the opportunity to independently handle making an old and large apartment building internet and Wi-Fi ""enabled"" for the tenants (while continually administering/improving the network).
My github/bitbucket repos are empty. I have never been inspired to make something alone..or had a good idea pop into my head, or felt that I had enough knowledge to build anything.

The way it looks to me, is that I am aimless without being pointed at something to do, and my passion only flares up when I'm working on a project with a team (which is something I've only experienced in an academic setting). 

How am I to even present myself to a company as a graduate for a development position or something similar in a situation like mine? Is this somehow all in my head/a confidence issue, or am I really in the pits?

Hell, even if you have any thoughts or anecdotes..it'd be nice to see a different perspective.

I have been looking for a job for nearly a year to no avail. I have applied to all sorts of positions, from software developer (I studied computer science) to administrative assistant to grocery service member.

I started studying computer science in 2010, and I was fortunate enough to get two fantastic software engineering internships. However, I began experiencing symptoms of a mental illness, eventually diagnosed as “cognitive disorder NOS (not otherwise specified)” (sort of like depression with somatic symptoms), which led to me failing (or withdrawing, one semester) out of school basically two years in a row. I decided to postpone trying to graduate from school since I was just failing over and over again, and I also ran out of money to do that. I wanted at least to fail at something different, and I needed some income.

So, I focused on finding a job. I applied to and contacted the companies I had interned for but I did not receive a response. I applied to many local miscellaneous jobs, like at restaurants, grocery stores, retail stores, etc. but had little luck with that. I sometimes was told I was “overqualified” for certain jobs, so I made resumes that excluded my software internships to see if that would help me case, but I had no such luck.

I am willing to work in most places around the world (I live near Chicago) doing most jobs, as long as it doesn’t worsen my mental health. In my head, I imagine an outdoor job with my hands where I’m surrounded by a group of positive coworkers, but it doesn’t have to be exactly that. 

Does anybody have any advice or suggestions? I’ve looked into free volunteering programs for now to keep myself sane.

Although I had a fairly strong start academically, my grades and focus in CSCI began to slip as I progressed through school. During my junior and senior years, I dropped several CSCI courses, didn't really bother making connections, and stopped working on my own projects; I just did the assigned work in my courses. I did end up barely fulfilling the requirements to earn both my degrees; however, by the time I graduated, I was no longer confident in my abilities and lacked the practical experience that I should've developed during my time at college. Thus, I didn't really consider a career in programming to be a viable option for me in the future. My other post-grad plans didn't really pan out, though, and in the time between my graduation and now, I have since enjoyed more time to program on my own. I feel like returning to programming is the best option for me at the moment in terms of doing something in the long-term.

My question is: Where do I start now? What is the best approach to maximize my chances of landing a job and succeeding at it? Should I just start applying for jobs, or should I try and make myself more marketable first by learning more/working on my own projects? Should I be looking for internships first?

More information:

- I held one actual internship during college, from my sophomore to junior year (Jan 2013 - Jan 2014), working on a project. Although my work was adequate, I didn't communicate very well with my employer throughout, and so the most I can do is list the job on a resume (and not cite him as a recommendation). I also volunteered on a website to write several scripts and text-scraping/data-parsing, the last of which I wrote/used in mid-2014. After that, there is a fairly noticeable gap on my resume up until now that I can only justify by saying I was working on my senior theses / had to deal with medical issues in the fall. I am concerned that I must find a job as soon as possible to close this gap; however, I am not sure how much I should be willing to settle. Should I be willing to take any job, even those unrelated to fields I want to pursue, for the sake of resume fodder? Or can I afford to continue foregoing a job and instead spend time developing my skills or working on my own projects (assuming the choice is between an unrelated job or nothing at all)? To clarify, I am not currently in dire need of money. I am debt free thanks to tuition remission, so that's something I have going for me. 

- As far as language proficiency goes, I know the object-oriented languages I was taught in school (Java, Python, C++) and have begun to taught myself JavaScript. I see that more than this tends to be listed on job applications, though. Is it worth picking up more languages/skillsets on my own, or would it be better to try and look harder for openings with requirements that I already meet?

- From reading this sub, it seems connections are the big thing, but I unfortunately did not heed this advice when I was in college. I'll certainly keep it in mind for the future, but for now, is it something I should prioritize worrying about? As in, should I be spending time I would otherwise be using to fill out job apps/practice coding to go out and try and meet other programmers in my area?

It sounds like it will be me along with some other candidates, and they mentioned we'll take part in some lectures on their framework as well as more hands-on stuff. I'm not sure how long they expect us to stay there each of the three days, but it's scheduled over Spring break and I was planning on picking up some more hours at my current internship during that time.

Does this sound like a reasonable thing for them to ask me to do? There's no guarantee I'll be be given an offer and it's a very niche company, so the training will probably be useless anywhere else.

No successful programmer will be able to continually develop their craft if they are unable, or unwilling, to study topics on their own time. 

I graduated from Moravian College in 2012, with a Bachelor’s of Science in Neuroscience. Since graduating, I have studied an undergraduate degree’s worth of computer science and programming courses. Using open courseware, such as coursera.com, Udemy.com, MIT Open Courseware, and other credible online sources, I have b uilt up my programming and computer science skills, while still continuing with my self-education in biological research. 

Georgia Tech’s online Masters program is a perfect fit for me. With coursework that capitalizes on topics I have studied, and projects that will help me hone my programming skills, I am very excited to continue learning in a more formalized setting! There is nothing I would more enjoy at this time in my life than to be with other students who are interested in the same program as I am, and be mentored by professors who are energetic about teaching in their field. I searched through a number of other online computer science programs, but I do not think their coursework affords me the skillset I would like to develop. Many programs are more focused on information technology and security, rather than providing a solid track in software engineering or computing. With the course offerings and value that Georgia Tech offers, it is truly my top choice in continuing my education. 

During the past two years, I have taught myself basic and advanced computer science concepts. Topics I studied include logic, algorithms, cryptography, data structures, databases, computer networks, operating systems, computer architecture, software engineering, and software debugging. I taught myself to program in the following computer languages: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Python and Java. Learning all of these topics on my own taught me better time management, dedication, and drive, while also teaching me where to find answers to questions I have. I had to seek out professionals that I knew in the software field, while also reaching out to strangers on online forums and various websites. In doing so, I have developed connections in the field I want to go into, while also being able to give back to communities that helped me when I was able to answer others’ questions. 

I completed an internship in software engineering, honing my programming skills and filling in any knowledge gaps I had. During the internship, I learned more about relational databases and SQL concepts when helping the other developers maintain their client database. I used HTML/CSS and JavaScript to develop and maintain a software company website, as well as create web-based client documentation that was sold with the software.

Having a masters in computer science would afford me more skills in being able to create not only better databases, but also understanding concepts underlying programs that could make more insightful comparisons, and perhaps providing other pieces of important information. 

During my career development, I have found myself being pulled in the direction of software engineering. My undergraduate degree in neuroscience has helped me in learning computer science by training me how to approach complex subjects in pieces, and learning how to learn.

In looking through the program’s coursework, I recognize many topics that I have studied or have been exposed to. I am excited to take on the challenges of this program starting in Fall 2016. Having a Master’s degree from Georgia Tech in computer science will afford me the extended skills and credibility that will make me more marketable when I begin seeking programming employment positions, and will also provide me a base in the event that I choose to continue my graduate education and earn a PhD in computational neuroscience.

450gbi,88,2016-02-09,Frustrated with my Level of intellect. Need some advice.,ChronoKings,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/450gbi/frustrated_with_my_level_of_intellect_need_some/,"I'm graduating this semester with a degree in electrical engineering. I'm graduating with a GPA of 2.9 and an engineering GPA of about 3.0 from a fairly unknown college that has been accredited for about 2 years now. Going into this program I acknowledged that I wasn't the smartest person but decided to make up for it with effort, and I have, but it's starting to wane on me. I would like to move onto a master or PHD, I would like to do research on topics like machine learning or robotics, I would like to do a lot of things but I feel hindered by my lack of ability. I haven't gotten any internships even though I've applied every semester, and been turned down by every research opportunity that I've applied for, I've been looking for a job for a year and I have haven't been able to get any offers. 
    

Honestly, I feel like I'm not qualified to achieve any of the things I want to achieve and like I'm just not smart enough. I've barley been able to maintain a B in undergrad, how in the world would I be able to maintain a B in grad school if I can even get accepted into one? Basically, I'm mad at myself for not being smart enough to achieve the level of performance that I admire and want to achieve. My question is, at what point do I accept my abilities for what they are and settle with working any average engineering job that I can get? Should I strive to reach a fun high level technical research job in engineering or a job at a company like Lockheed Martin when, compared to me peers, I'm intellectually average? There is no need to sugar coat thing, I need real advice, not exhortation for the purpose of comforting me.

450hoe,1,2016-02-09,Side-project feedback,IPT-2,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/450hoe/sideproject_feedback/,"Hi everyone, 

So I'm working on reviving a side-project ([link](https://github.com/axecheverria/youtube2mp3)) that transforms a YouTube music url into a downloadable mp3 file with its associated metadata (and album art!). 

The project currently is dead (the code is broken) (and not very well written (at all)).

As of right now, I'm trying to market myself as a front-end web developer.

I'm planning on introducing myself to AngularJS (have used it before in the past in an internship but I remember nothing of it) and maybe some other frameworks to manage the back end. 

Currently the project is not functioning and am planning on refactoring it in a way which demonstrates the skills I am going to acquire in the very near future. May I ask, in terms of coding challenges, what I can do to my current code to learn and implement things like:
  
. Dependency injection, controllers and services, filters, testability, and so on -- stuff I remember doing at my internship but remember little of now
  
. In essence, would you be so kind as to look at my code and say where such and such design patterns/AngularJS features/components could be applied?

  .  I'm planning on doing this anyway but it would be great if I could get feedback from others :)

Thank you!"
450l6r,102,2016-02-09,How do you even approach a really tough problem in an interview?,SpaceWarrior1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/450l6r/how_do_you_even_approach_a_really_tough_problem/,"I had an interview for an internship with a ""Big 4"" today, and I was really prepared (or so I thought) for it. I spent every waking hour of Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday studying for it (I only got the interview invite a week prior to the interview itself), and going through every problem in Cracking the Coding Interview. I even did some challenges on their own practice website, and some on Leet Code.

But I think I may have over-prepared. I was given the following question:

Write a traversal such that the following tree

                      A
                     / \
                    B    C
                   / \  / \
                  D  E  F  G

produces the output ` D B A E F C G`

And I tried to think (out loud) about the different traversals. Infix, Prefix, Postfix, BFS, DFS. I tried with infix first (and the interviewer kept going ""mhm mhm""), so I thought I was on the right track. Then I just kept going in circles because I knew I was trapped, and didn't want to ask for help (I heard it's not a good thing to do). When the interview told me the solution, it turns out you're supposed to assign two ""weights"" to each node. How far it is from the middle column with the root (so left nodes are -1, -2,... and right notes are 1, 2,...) and the depth of the node itself. And then sort it first by the horizontal weights, and then by the vertical weights.

Now my question is, in an interview environment, with only 20ish minutes for a question, how are you even supposed to come up with a solution to a problem like this? My interviewer also wanted actual C++/Java code, and did not want pseudo-code, so that made it even more challenging. I talked to friends who also had the same interviewer, and they got questions that I felt I could've at least had an approach to (e.g. Given a matrix of characters, find a specific word). Is it ever a bad thing to ask an interviewer for a different question? I feel like no matter how much I would've practiced, I simply wouldn't have been able to solve this specific problem in full C++/Java code in the limited time range, whereas with the question my friend received, I would've been able to have some kind of code on the whiteboard.

I have an interview with another ""Big 4"" coming soon, so I really want to know how to improve."

Background: 
I am a 27 year old medical intern (year 1 out of 4-5 of post-graduate training) in the US, having graduated from medical school. I am in a fairly competitive field (Ophthalmology) that is relatively speaking better than other medical fields in some of the ways that make many doctors miserable. My internship is in another field (Internal Medicine), which I will finish in June.

Rant portion:
I am miserable. I've had doubts about medicine since my second year of school but kept telling myself I was in too far and that the cost of quitting was too high. I'm just not sure I can do that anymore. I'm able to meaningfully help people with about 20% of my time, while the other 80% is spent on various forms of busy work. I am a forward-looking person, familiar with technology my whole life, and this field drives me crazy. I feel like I'm living in 1980 while the world around me is stepping into the future. Faxes. Endless forms. Slow, awful software and computers. I don't get any intellectual gratification from my job. It's all memorization and algorithms. Critical thinking is helpful for a minority of cases...and you're usually too over-worked to have time to take those opportunities when they arise.

The grass is always greener:
I have several friends in comp sci -- people with similar personalities, backgrounds, interests. They are about as content with their jobs as anyone I've seen. I've dabbled with software -- AP comp sci in high school, Python and Java to help with research (bioinformatics) over the years. The problem solving and novel construction is really fun. I feel like I could be a much happier person, and more fulfilled doing something meaningful and interesting to me, switching fields.

My concerns:
I studied Biology. I haven't had any formal comp sci training since high school, just some self taught stuff that atrophies in between research projects. I have debt (&lt;100k) from medical school. Quitting medical residency is essentially permanent, you are 99% unlikely to ever be allowed to train again. I am miserable -- and cognizant that the grass is always greener, particularly when you feel like your lawn is on fire.

On the other hand, I feel like the writing is on the wall in so many ways. Aside from disliking my work, I simply don't see how medicine is a career that will have the longevity/stability that it historically has. While I am not in the camp believing AI like Watson will replace health care providers anytime soon, I think it's extremely likely that within 10-15 years, it will dramatically lower the human input required. Meaning, someone with far less training can do the same job for much cheaper (lacking the sunken years and school $$). I mean, in Ophthalmology, a laser system is already on the market that performs the bulk of cataract surgery (particularly the skill intensive portions) [this is the bread and butter surgery for most ophthalmologists] -- it's already happening!

Am I totally crazy for throwing everything away? (5 years medical training, 4 years college, 1 year research = 10 years) I'm so bearish on this career, both personally and analytically, but I've sunk a lot into it and I *could be wrong* -- maybe I'll enjoy life after residency, maybe regulatory or technological hurdles will slow the obsoletion of physicians... But whatever it may be, I need to either come to terms with my career or quit and pick a new one, because I wake up every day unhappy.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? Where do I even begin? My idea thus far has been to continue residency (it pays for my roof) and utilize free resources for learning comp sci. What would be the most efficient avenue to do this? I have limited free time (work 70-80 hrs/ week) but am fine spending all of it studying.

MIT CS50 seems high yield
freecodecamp.com seems good?

Is there any particular course or language that would be a good, high yield place to start? How about field? Mobile vs web vs data vs ..?

Thank you so much for any help. Sorry this got long.

451bn4,12,2016-02-10,Is working in the game industry worth it as compared to a more stable employer?,csStudent2,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/451bn4/is_working_in_the_game_industry_worth_it_as/,"I am currently a senior bound to graduate in a few months. I have a had a pretty successful CS college experience with a good GPA, many exciting side projects, and internships. I have a full time offer at a big four employer after graduation.

I imagine I am not alone when I say that videogames were a pretty large influence on deciding to choose CS as a major. Of course, making videogames for a living was an idealistic notion I had before I was more well versed on what computer science was really all about. I have learned that I like making all types of software, and I appreciate the intricacies of software development for what it is. Furthermore, the game industry is notoriously volatile (with frequent layoff cycles, lower-than-average pay, long hours, ect). 

I know I will be very happy working at the big-four employer, as it is literally a dream come true for me in terms of career goals (they also do really exciting stuff that I am excited about!). However, I can't help but think that in the back of my mind, there is a tinge of sadness that I won't be working at a company like Nintendo or Blizzard. I believe this stems from my desire to still make video games and to have them be played by audiences as large as these companies reach.

My gut is telling me to keep videogame development as a side hobby, as a few of my past side projects have involved making ""indie"" games which have been very satisfying and fun to make. I believe this is the route to go as my stable CS job will provide me the security and stability of a promising career doing something I enjoy while the side project games will allow me to have full creative control game ideas that I wish to develop.

As it stands now, I will most likely accept the big-four offer, and make side hobby games in the future. However, before I make the plunge, I would love to hear what input you all have on the matter. I want to eliminate any potential regret.

Thanks =D

**TLDR:** Stable job and making games as a side hobby vs. working at a videogame company?"
451dda,0,2016-02-10,It's all about exposure,pathtolife,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/451dda/its_all_about_exposure/,"I have read a lot of posts here about guys having trouble approaching girls and so I am making this post.

There is this girl I had a crush on when I was in freshman year of college, I hesitated and could never speak to her. When I came to the final year of college, I went for an internship and she was there (although I no longer had a crush on her), and we started hanging out together in a group.

1. In the first few days, I was crazy and felt lucky to be having lunch seated next to her
2. Over one month later, SHE had hesitations and anxiety speaking with ME
3. Later, I expressed my interest in some other girl and she felt jelous/insecure about her beauty
4. Last few days, I ask some of my friends seated around her for lunch but not her - just because I don't think of her as friend (in contrast to point 1) - she notices and complains about it to our mutual friends

It's all about exposure. It's all about how many girls/guys you have interacted with in the past. I hadn't interacted much with anyone in school/college and that changed during the internship. Just 5 months of interactions/exposure changed a lot in me.

Hope this helps someone. Bye."

Last month I applied through my city's HR website to CA's After School Education and Safety (ASES) Program, as a program leader, got an email for a panel interview set for this Thurs.

Interview experience: 

 * My last interview was in December as a temp at a craft store, totally bombed, wasn't really prepared and I was unable to bullshit answers, it was also finals time i was sleep deprived. 
* Before that i worked at a buffet, was able to bullshit through the interview and basically they needed people so my inexperience was overlooked. 
*A year prior i worked at an after school program (totally different city) that also had a summer program as a program leader, and because I was hires under a grant for bilingual staff I was also able to work in the schools summer school. The interview for that job was basically spur of the moment, my friend and i went to college fair type event organized by the after school program, i think we werw the only non staff there, the program's director asked us to come talk to her, she asked us if we ever played soccer, i said yes since I played a few years of city league soccer. She then proceeded to aske if we were interested in helping coach the program's soccer teams and helping out with the programs other activities, meant we were also program leaders, i said why not, had heard great things about the director, her program and their relationship to their community. Easy job interview. 
* A few months prior to that i was an intern at my college's multicultural center, where my friends were working and basically ran the program, no interview just announced i was their intern, they had me sign like two sheets to make it official. Easiesf job interview. 
* A couple of years prior I worked at my universities library as a student assistant, they werw hiring like 100 students for a summer job moving books from the old library to the new one and loading them into the new automated system. Interview was basically just making sure we were cool with physical labor and dust. That job led to me being hired beyond the move because of my work ethic, basically our supervisor picked two people to stay on, asked around the library for openings and recommended us. Which led to a short interview for the audio and media department's student assistant, the interview was just basically asking for availability and if I was okay with working Saturdays.

Basically not a lot of experience with interviews. So i need some help. I moved back home before I finished my Political Science degree, mainly because my mental health affected my schooling so bad my Financial Aid was put on hold i broight down mu unit deficiency by completing my incompletes. Thats when i took the after school program but the funding got pulled for the program not for it failing but mpre like a power grab, so during what was suppose to be their summer program i ended up working for the transitional program since i still had funding under the bilingual grant and thus my program director wanted me to get the full amount so she worked it out with the transitional program and summer school.

 I went back home a month after the summer and soon started taking CS classes while i figured out my next steps.


I Don't have a lot of experience working with kids besides that 5-6 mos stint working for the after school program/summer program/ summer school; organizing and pulling off a youth development conference; taking care of my various cousins, including a summer spent basically as a nanny for my cousins 4 boys varying in ages.  
But this is definately a job I really want because honestly if I'm gonna work right now I want to work in something having to do with education, youth, and community's development. 

So because my interview experience is lacking, especially in this realm, im not sure what to expect, what questions i should ask, who would be there since they had no description on the panel, what i should or shouldnt say, what to highlight and what to downlpay.

Can anyone offer any advice on how to improve my grades and proof skills? I've read all the lectures, course documents and notes multiple times. Is it a matter of lack of practice? Should I try to find practice problems? Just, any and all advice would be so appreciated.

Also on the note of grades, has anyone who's taken CSC240 had their marks adjusted? Right now most assignments are averaging around 50% to 70% at most, and lower in some cases. Would that be grounds for a mark adjustment?

Thank you, and good luck on midterms."

I am wanting to develop task manager system. It is mainly to fulfill my needs, to put it honestly. I didn't know which way would be best/easiest. My ideas are: 

Develop a .JAR file that reads from a tab delimited file (.xls, stored in Dropbox) and just outputs the upcoming reading/assignment from the file. I already have the file and console printing. My main question is whether developing an Android app (with buttons saying ""Add Task"" and ""Show Readings"") would be too much, with a different GUI for the computer? 

Possibly develop a website I could access that would pull everything up from the file in Dropbox (or would it be more complicated than this?) Basically I just came up with this idea and didn't know if it would be easier to do than the original idea. 

Aside: Could I develop the app or anything with C#? I'm supposed to learn C# for my summer internship and need things to work on. "

I am a junior developer currently classified as an exempt employee making ~$50k/year. From how I am reading these laws, I should be either making the minimum salary, or reclassified as non-exempt.

My questions are:

1) Does this apply to me? I was an intern for a few months and then promoted to .net software engineer (there is only one title). I do not hold a degree, but am currently lead developer on a major redesign/rewrite project for the company. I also handle normal and routine maintenance of legacy software and am helping design a larger scale rewrite of the entire framework.

2) If reclassification to non-exempt is the likely outcome, are there any minimum wage restrictions of non-exempt computer professionals?

3) I really enjoy the place I work, and do not want to rock the boat too much. Regardless on if these conditions apply to me, there certainly apply to many of my co-workers. How can I bring this up in a proper, professional manner?[Quote]"

So like many people, a couple days ago I started applying to multiple companies to try to get internships. Now I just got my first e-mail saying the person is reviewing my application and I will hear within the next two weeks. Now all of these applications didn't say anything about salaries but when I asked this question before on reddit, people said most of the comp sci internships are paid these days and you really should just do a paid one.

Now the thing is, how can I know if it's paid or not? In all of these job postings the salary is not there, the person emailed me and asked if I have any questions as well. Should I ask if it's a paid or no paid internship or would that be coming off too strong too soon?

Also, in some of these postings, it generally asks for things like ""General knowledge in one OOP"" ""Ability and the need to learn"" and stuff like that, but in some, for example this company it says stuff like


-Interest in software development experience building highly-reliable, mission-critical software

-Ability to program in at least one OO programming language (e.g. Java, C#, C++)

-Knowledge of web application frameworks, RDBMs’ &amp; Application Servers (experience in one or more preferred)

-Reasonable understanding of network security, encryption, authentication and authorization

-Experience with Selenium, JQuery, .Net, Windows development and Javascript a plus

Like I know Java and C++, but network security, encryption, Selenium, I have no idea about. Should I even bother applying for those companies that ask for this or just let it go?

First of all, thank you, that you started to read my post, I really hope that you will help me in this very strange, but very important in my life career situation. So very short summary about me. I am 25 years old guy which realized quite late what I want to do in my life, so I started my CS studies only being 23 years old. Currently I am third year student of CS. While I was in 2nd years course I started to work in one IT company, but unfortunately they didn't gave me programming tasks and I left that company. So now I want to work in company where I will get only programming tasks. 
Recently I started to look for internships and I applied to IBM company, then I passed online math test and now they wrote email to me by asking when I can come to resume applying process for that internship. In other case I also applied for remote internship in some startup companies. I had some online interviews and with one company we almost met with circumstances that I will do internship. But now I am a bit afraid because it is unpaid internship and maybe they will use of me (I mean, i will do some job for them for free) and they do not select me as a regular employee. 

What would you suggest to me? Continue for applying with IBM or start work with startup company. 

Btw, there are some risk with IBM , because there are no guarantee that they will select me.

    I've only been working as a java developer for a year... and I'm definitely not the best programmer out there. I'd say I'm average and not entirely passionate/crazy about work. I really value my time off and don't care enough to delve deep into my tasks.

 Last summer we had an intern who came to us from a top CS school, who is extremely smart (near 4.0) and picked things up quickly and asked a lot of questions and constantly asked for more work. My teammates were very impressed by him. 

He may be coming back to work with us full time. 
I'm concerned this will bring to light how not-so-amazing I am. Im feeling insecure about my position and about the new guy being much more capable than me (which I know he is...). Anyone gone through anything similar? Is it going to be so bad that I'm not that smart? 

I just feel embarassed about not knowing as much and bring a slower learner. I get along really well with my team and my boss. I get my work done and I try to do it well but I'm not an overachiever. I was an average student in school. I'm still new to my job and still learning a lot, but if there's downtime I don't try to find more work to do, etc. 

So yeah... I'd appreciate any stories or advice here. 
I'm afraid my progress is going to be compared to his and will lead me to being treated differently.

‘Yeah, I can’t ignore him anymore, I’m afraid I’ll do what he tell me to do.’ I said still looking at my hands, trying my best not to cry. 

‘Well, you know the drill, take your shirt off’.

I took my shirt off, which meant I had to show my arms. It is so shameful for me to show my arms, because they are filled with scars, from before I knew what was wrong with me. The worst part was that I had carved in words, words he told me. The anxiety was on full blast, when he took my arm soft and carefully and checked for new wounds. His hands were warm and it felt nice another human touching me but at the same time it felt uncomfortable. 

When I got out of Dr. Jensen’s office, a nurse was ready to walk me to my room. I have not met this nurse before. She was probably an intern. When we arrived to unit 350, I got a small glimpse of the other patients in the tv room. People were quiet except one who was busy telling loudly one of the nurses he had ants living in his teeth, and he demanded to see a doctor. ‘I can’t believe I’m one these crazy people’ I thought to myself, but apparently I’m one of them.  

We came into my room, where I would be living on indefinite time. There was a hospital bed, a desk and two complimentary chairs from the seventies. Everything looked like it was from the seventies in orange and brown colors, except the modern hospital bed. We sat down in the chairs and she took a deep breath while she stared deep into my eyes, like she was trying to figure me out. I had a hard time looking into her eyes, they looked so perfect and I knew mine was so filled with sorrow.

‘Lisa, we are going to take you off the pills you’re on now, because they are not working anyways’.

‘But then he is going to be so much stronger, the last time it almost went terrible bad’.

‘Lisa you must understand he is not real. Remember this is an illness and he is not real’ she said in a firm voice.
 I wanted to believe her but I couldn’t, God I wanted so bad to believe her. I had to look down at my hands again, while I was trying not show my despair.

‘So… I’m gonna go now, see if you can get a little sleep tonight. As you now there is breakfast at 8, and morning meeting is at 9.30, but it’s okay if you don’t want to join in tomorrow’. 

She left the room, and I got up and sat on the bed. I drew the curtains because I didn’t liked to look out in darkness and sat down again.
 I sat and thought to myself while starring into the yellow wall ‘Again, really again. You are such a loser. Now you going to take this semester over again. But I’m going to survive this, he cannot take control. He is not real. He is not real!!’ 
I knew I was lying to myself, but that was my only hope. I went to bed and fell fast asleep, because I knew it only took pulling a red string away to alarm the nurses, if he was going to disturb me. For the first time in a couple of weeks, I felt somewhat safe.

I woke up calm in the morning and I could see the sun shining outside even birds were singing. But then… 

‘So you are here again? Ha! And they are going to take the meds away? I’m gonna get you this time one way or another’ he said laughing almost sounding like he was growling at the same time. 

‘Go away! You are not real! you can’t touch me. You’re only in my head’. Tears was falling down my face and my stomach twisted in fear.

 ‘I cannot touch you? We’ll see about that, I am more real than you ever know’ as he said that, I saw him. Or a part of him. A black stick thin hand with long fingers appeared from under the bed with long black nails. His hand made it’s way under my blanket, and I pulled the red string as fast as I could and I heard the alarm go off. As the alarm went off, I felt an incredible pain as I was cut at my ankle and I saw the hand go back under the bed.
The door blast open and two butch male nurses came in.

‘He was here! I saw him this time! He scratched my ankle. Look under the bed, he is there!’ I said, tearing up to the nurses. The nurses looked frustrated at each other. Then they saw the blood dripping from the bed to the floor. They lifted the blanket, and then we all gazed down at these four big cuts into my leg. 

‘This is going to need stiches. Lisa what did you cut yourself with?’ The nurse looked blaming into my eyes while the other took a towel to put pressure on the wound.

‘I swear to God, it was him! I have just woken up. Please help me!’ 

’Lisa we have to know if you have any weapons on you, we have to know if you’re any danger to us’.

‘I have nothing, you have to believe me.’ I cried while I tried to figure out if I was dreaming.

‘Get her to the emergency room maybe the doctors can tell what had cut her, I’m gonna stay here and speak with Dr. Jensen’ 

The nurse began to roll my bed out of the room and as we was going to out the door, the commanding nurse said: ‘Lisa, this is going to have consequences’.

* When and if I have to write code, can I use any language?

* What data structures and algorithms should I better familiarize myself with?

31 years old, finished an MBA in December. Background is in management and data analysis. Did a summer internship at a national consulting firm last year. Going for PMP designation this year. I have $27k student line of credit debt (growing about $1k per month with living expenses at the moment) and $60K in mutual funds.

Last full time, permanent job I did was in 2013 where I managed to see my salary rise to about $51k (the most I've made). I went abroad for a year after to learn a second language and to clear my mind after significant family crises that ran a course of 3-4 years before the MBA so I spent my immediate savings of $20k there. Well worth it and much needed at the time.

I have been networking and applying for work but nothing yet. Salaries I have been quoted seem pretty low ($55k-$60k max range for positions) for my experience and education. Only one interview so far and it's a role with a lot of admin work albeit with an amazing firm, not sure salary yet as no offer yet.

With the salary quotes I have been given (and with no offer yet) and the debt I took on for more education, it feels like I may have made a bad move. I hear about people on this subreddit in their 20s absolutely killing it financially and I definitely feel left behind a bit.

My questions are very straightforward:

1. How can I maximize my salary in this economy with my experience?
2. What would you do in my shoes? 
3. What sort of realistic financial expectations should I have for myself to guide me so I don't get depressed about where I'm at? The Comparison Game is a tough one!
4. Should I be worried?

A little extra info: I would be willing to move to any part of the country. No dependents or other financial obligations. I also have a UK passport but would need to take a flight there to network to find a job but that's sort of an emergency backup plan.

2. I've been reading up on these interviews and the questions that could come up and I got to say I haven't learned some of these things as I'm a first year. Like I know most but like Hash tables, no idea, and some other stuff aswell. If I get an interview, should I let the interviewee know that I haven't learned this stuff yet or should I not say anything. I mean I plan on trying to learn this stuff but idk how far I could get.

We ignore her for the most part, but recently she's been pasting huge blocks of almost professional work. I happen to know that her parent is a programmer and that she takes full use of the connections that she has (got a professor to sign off on an ""internship"" she didn't do) and I'm pretty sure she's not doing the work.

457wqu,2,2016-02-11,Requesting a shapefile from geoserver and displaying it on a website that runs an,JavidanOfTheWest,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/457wqu/requesting_a_shapefile_from_geoserver_and/,"So I've taken over a project from two other programmers as a part of my internship and I'm having a little trouble pinpointing why a part of it isn't working properly.

The website itself is a very simple bland site with an openlayers map and three buttons. One button is linked to geoserver, where I can fill in the name of the shapefile (*.shp) that I want to load and then it should load the shapefile data onto the openlayers map. The previous interns had this working on localhost and I've also set it up like that, but I still feel like it's a problem with my geoserver-setup rather than a problem with the file path.

My main question is whether it's possible to place a shapefile in the **geoserver map &gt; data_dir &gt; data** directory and if Geoserver is able to provide it just like that through the **GetMap** command of the Geoserver Get Map Service. Or whether I specifically have to add every shapefile manually, as described here: http://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/gettingstarted/shapefile-quickstart/index.html

Adding it manually seems to require me to create a workspace, store &amp; layer for each shapefile. Another problem I run into when I try this approach is that only the shapefile from the tutorial can be added without running into errors. And I can't load the shapefiles I provide by myself. The previous interns (who did not document how they did it) did manage to get it working, so I'm sure the shapefile itself isn't corrupt.

**Steps in which I've added the shapefile to GeoServer:**

[(Add New Workspace) I've probably done this first step right](http://s17.postimg.org/xq8mibknj/Adding_New_Workspace.png)

[(Add New Store) I've probably done this step right as well](http://s17.postimg.org/9xzb6simn/Adding_New_Store.png)

[(Add New Layer) This is where I believe I'm making a mistake](http://s17.postimg.org/6tona01u7/Bounding_Box_Problem.png)

I'm not 100% sure that the lon/lat generated from the **Declared SRS** are the right ones, but when I check it's coordinates it seems to check-out. I need the bounding box of the [sea-area](http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/4289/) (Wadden Sea) in between Northwestern-Holland and the islands.

I also do not know if I picked the right style in the publish tab of the layer.

Anyway, when I preview the layer, I'm supposed to see something similar to the preview in the tutorial, [yet what I see is this](http://s23.postimg.org/5ap2n603v/Preview_Problem.png)

Please help, I have no clue what I'm doing wrong and usually I would second-guess the shapefile itself, but this is the only one I have of this bounding box area and it's the only area I am restricted to look at.

A huge THANK YOU to all the comments and suggestions. I did not get around to thanking everyone before, but did read all the comments.

I took a better look at my resume and reworked it to [this (imgur)](http://i.imgur.com/UgPj97H.jpg).

I'm way happier with this one. I also started a conversation with my college's IT Manager, and today was a job fair at the college where I spoke with a HR specialist and asked about internship/volunteer opportunities.

I was given the names of two other IT Managers to email and ask about internships, if not at the college (would be handy living 1 mile away) then somewhere in town.

As an additional stroke of luck, I received an invitation to interview at the State Hospital as a direct care staff! In 2010/2011, as a temp State worker I was ineligible to apply for internal only job postings, but the times may have changed and getting access to internal postings just might be what I need to find my 'in' with the State's helpdesk.

Any other critiques of my resume or if I should start over again completely welcome and appreciated!"

Now I'm in pre-calc and I understand 0 of what we are doing and I think it's only going to get worse.

I intern on an IT staff during the summers and what I have found is a lot of IT guys don't have that Computer Information System degree. So I did some research and more thinking and I would like to change to management and then get a computer networking cert my college offers. Does this seem like a viable solution? 

Aside from the fact that most of the classes I have already taken are also apart of that management degree I really enjoy my business classes. I also really can't afford college and the cheapest school a few miles away doesn't have an IT degree but they have a very good management program apparently. Also as far as I have checked my school's management degree only requires one math elective and then statistics which I already took in high school and it was the only math I enjoyed and understood 

Should I just drop the precalc and switch degrees? I'm waiting to hear what my intern IT manager says (since he works as what I want to do) and also my business professor but this is a third say in the matter, I don't have an adviser to ask. "

I just wanted to tell you guys about an interesting employment situation I am in. Right now I have two part time jobs, one at a Help Desk working 30 hours a week, then one as a janitor working  20 hours a week.

Last year I had the janitor job cleaning the same building I work the help desk at. I left the janitor late last year to do an internship, before the internship ended I landed the help desk job. Since the help desk job is only 30 hours a week, I needed something else to supplement my income. Since the janitor job is in the same building as the help desk job, I asked my supervisor from my cleaning job if I could pick up some hours, she said yes I was ecstatic. 

So now I work 9 am to 330 PM at the help desk, I then chill at my desk for an hour and a half and then literally walk downstairs and punch in for my second job around 5. I work the cleaning job from 5-9. This is all Monday – Friday.

I don’t get any benefits from my Help Desk job, however the janitor job is a union job so it has dental, life, and PTO. It also pays a a lot better than other janitorial jobs since it’s a union job.

Between the two jobs I work approximately 50 hours a week, and I make out with a pretty good salary for the area (Pittsburgh, PA), and it’s all in the same building so I don’t have to travel.
Now obviously looking for a better employment situation, but for right now I am proud to where two different collars in one day.

First of all. I`m sorry if my post is difficult to read. I`m not a fluent Engish writer or speaker, but I`ll try my best.

My life is a pretty mess for a  long time allready and it seems I don`t make progress. I`m 26 years old and since i`m 18 and left high school I have done a lot of study`s and did`nt finish one of them. Sometimes because of my lack of interest in it (especially with the lower-levelled study`s, I think its called Community College in the US) and with the higher levelled college study`s it was a problem of learning and concentration issues. 

I have a non-congenital brain disability (thanks to the way I was born, with a vacuum pump which damaged my brain) which is probably the reason for my issues with learning and stuff. I`m also high-sensitive which makes it even more difficult. Anyway. You probably would say with all those problems: accept it and try to find your way on a lower level. But I just can`t accept it. I`m hard for myself and always want to get a degree on that level. 

Now I`m doing a education on a lower level and I`m stuck. Again. 
It`s a security-study and I cant find a internship for months now. Its part of the study so I have to find one. But for months I get rejections because my school isnt co-operating with the firm. Or it`s to far away from my hometown ( I dont have a car) or any other reason. This can`t go on like this but I don`t have any other solution. 

I can wait again for months and months for an internship or I can try a new study on a hgher level. Again. With the risk that I fail. Again. 

The 3th option I have is to go away abroad. To go working somewhere and traveling. I like to travel and the option is tempting but I know I disappoint my family with it and especially my mom will be very upset if I do that. Also I think choose this is a bit immature and run away from your problems. Is that a wrong thing to think? 

Anyway, I was hoping to get a little help from people. And again: Sorry for the mess in my post. I hope you all can understand it a bit. 

Thanks a lot.  "

I need some career advice.,Internationaal,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/45c13u/26_years_old_and_feeling_like_a_loser_i_need_some/,"I am 26 years old and currently feeling that I am at a difficult point in my life and don't know what to do.

I have two MA's, both in fields in which it is difficult to find jobs but I managed, I did many internships and side-jobs. Highlight was a stay at an Embassy of my country and in an European Institution.

Problem is that despite my talents and because of some badluck I did not manage to find a job that I like. Last Summer, when (in my view) people around me did find jobs that I would also like, I had to take an internship again. I took this possibility as a way to stay in one place for a change and look from there (at least I have quite an ok background and did many interesting things for employees), it was at a field of work which I really did not like, but at least it gave me a way to prove myself again and keeping up with my contacts in this specific city. 

The first months went excellent. I even managed to find an international job in a different country. The company invited me to fly in so we could talk about the job and arranged everything. However I have a terrible fear of flying. This rarely stopped me before but now I just couldnt go in. I don't know why it was so bad this time I cannot really explain it but I did not enter the plane.

From that moment almost everything went downhill for me. My selfconfidence diminished before my eyes and I was becoming almost depressed by seeing my whole future falling apart because of the fact that I did not enter the plane. I could not concentrate at work and was more busy with myself. Flying became an obsession for me and I even failed to enter a plane the second time.

Now I am doing way better in sense of the problems described above. I took a fear of flying course which is really helping. The last two weeks of the internship I picked myself up and managed, at least for my own feelings, to make a better impression. I can say that I am looking at a different way to flying now and would really like to get back the opportunity (and I probably get another chance but have to wait a couple of months). 

This whole period covered the rest of my internship. What started as a success ended as a faillure. Now I am out of money and had to move back in my hometown with my parents because otherwise I would be living under a bridge ( :) :)). All my savings are gone and ofc uf my hometown is not the hotspot for finding a job in my field.

So in short

* 26, turning 27 later this year, did some impressive and nice things but now living again in my parents home without a gf, and without money, and without knowing where to start

* I said that I feel like a loser, and I do, mostly because of the flying choice. On the other hand I did pick myself up, I tried to fight it, lost a couple of times but now have the feeling that I have at least partially beaten it. The most annoying thing is that often I think ""what if, what if I would have entered that plane, so"". I know it doesn't make a difference right now but it remains a bit difficult certainly because I have thrown away a couple of important months.

* The original job that I would had to go will probably invite me again but this can take a couple of months which I dont want to spend sitting in my parents home doing almost nothing just looking at my computer ( :D :D).

* I am thinking about going abroad for a couple of months. Just doing some shitjob but at least abroad. Making a bit of money, getting some experience, and when I get another opportunity that I like, for example the job above, I will take it. The only problem is that I am almost completely out of money and I dont know where to start. Any advice would be welcome.

* Anything Else.

If anyone Else has been in a similar situation or has any other kind of advice, certainly where to start now, it would be most welcome.

Thanks!!

Why i should do an internship

- I will get paid money

- I will gain experience

- I will probably get a higher paying job after graduation

- I might end up doing nothing during my summer (i.e. last summer I worked really hard for 1 month, then just did nothing for the other 3)

Why I should not do an internship

- I don't want really want to do an internship.  I feel really stressed out during my school year working 80-120 hours a week that I just need a mental break

- I'll have to wake up at 6 am every day for my whole summer for my internship! Yuck! I get to sleep and enjoy my summer (Yay)

- I get really stressed out during the school semester, and I need the summer time to just ""heal""

- I'm already a really great coder.  Working in the industry wouldn't make me better at this, but say writing a compiler this summer or another huge project might make me stand out more than others

- I want to do some theoretical math and physics this summer, for fun.  Also, I'm taking a little interest in analog and digital electronics.  I figured I could read some books this summer and do some design, especially since I've already taken basic courses in these areas

I am afraid that I might not get accepted. This was really my only opportunity to get out of my current job and allow me to move with her. I work in a really renown facility, not only for my university, but also for the the U.S. in plant genetics.

My principal investigator wants me to start a new position (not new title, same pay) that allows me to have more responsibility over my previous position. He just found a new candidate that could replace me for the job he wants me to do. He wants to talk to me on Monday and he wants me to give him a decision if I am going to leave post August, which assumes that I'm going to go live with my girlfriend. I have no idea if I give him the decision to leave , if I don't find employment before August, I will be out of a job. Also, I want to continue applying for my M.S. degree and am not sure how unemployment will affect that situation.

I know that my significant other is the person I want to be with for the rest of my life and don't want to lose her from long distance relations. We tried long distance this summer because of her internship and it wasn't too hard because I knew she was coming back 3 months later. She is going to get her PhD and that means she will be in another state for 6 years. 

I'm not sure if I can handle a long distance relationship. Also, I've explored the options of staying at my job and reapplying for an M.S. degree, but if my relationship fails because of staying where I am currently, I'll be torn for a very long time. I know how distance and time change people, and when others are apart they grow separately.

Also, I hate the place I am living in. I have been here for 6 years (undergrad and 2 years post grad) and I cannot stand this city/town. It's so boring and I'm I don't want to spend this finite amazing life in a shitty place where I can't enjoy the opportunities in other great cities like the University of Minnesota or Wisconsin-Madison, where I would be going.

If you could please give me some type of advice, or some insight on how to look at this, it would be much appreciated. Being caught between love and a career really makes it hard to think logically."

This is going to be a little long, but I just wanted to let it out. 
This morning I got an internship offer today, and it took me by surprise. 
I am an EE student, but i'm not great. My GPA is about 2.9, and I don't participate in any extracurricular activities. When I was notified that I received an interview with the company, I was pleasantly surprised but I didn't really think I have a chance to get in. The position was for ASIC design, and I only knew two people who got a similar job with said company, and I know that they are very hard working and intelligent people. 
I didn't take this interview lightly however, and I reviewed all the relevant stuff that had to do with this position, and even looked at glassdoor reviews about other people's opinions on the interview process to get an idea what to expect. 
When the day of the interview came, the other person who was waiting with me had a much better resume (publishing a paper and assisting a prof), so I felt like the competition was going to be fierce. The only thing that I think distinguished me from many other people is the fact that I attached pieces of code of my previous projects from school to my resume. In the actual interview, they essentially asked me about different aspects of my projects, and asked me theoretical questions about computer and processors, which honestly I had a somewhat difficult time to answer, because while I knew the general idea of how for example interrupts worked, when they asked me about them I was a bit nervous and might have even explained it poorly. 
When they asked questions about some VHDL code, I foolishly said that HDL languages are procedural when in fact they run in parallel. 
The only somewhat good part of the interview was the riddle part, and I was able to answer it after a small hint or helpful tip that they threw, but I had struggled a bit on the next part of the same question, and they eventually helped me out because the time ran out. 

So you can probably see how I was completely shocked when I woke up this morning to an email saying that they are offering me a position within their company.  I of course accepted it right away, but I still thought that there was a mistake somewhere, and that they accidentally congratulated the wrong person. But now that they have emailed me, it seems like that they really did want me.  

So here you go guys, somehow even the normal chaps can get those lucrative positions. If you got similar stories, do tell."

I apologize in advance for a long post.

I'm coming up on graduating from community college with an A.S. this May and feel like  I'm in a bad position. I've been going to school part time because I work a full time job and because of this, nearly all of my time outside of work has been spent on school, including summer semesters. This means I haven't had a chance to work on any personal projects or self-learning.

On top of that, I feel like I've learned very little in school. There were sometimes large chunks of time (a semester, or more) where I was taking only gen ed classes and not putting my coding skills to use so I almost feel like I have to re-learn a lot of things. The class I had been anticipating the most and arguably one of the most important to a CS student, Data Structures and Algorithms, ended up going really horribly for me. Not because I did poorly (I got an A) but I had a really awful teacher and am coming out of school feeling like I know as much about data structures and algorithms as I did before taking the class. The professor didn't give any feedback on our code. When I would email her to ask for feedback just to even understand if I was on the right track, she would reply with things like ""You did fine. I am not looking to give grades, as long as you submitted work you will be fine."" I'm not exaggerating when I say that she was literally useless. Grading based on effort seems fine for a general education class but I actually really needed to learn things in that class and I feel like it was a complete waste of my time. 

So now that I've ranted about that, the point is that I feel very ill-prepared to venture into the world of interviews. I feel that I know so little that I'm even afraid of applying for an internship, which brings me to this post. I have no delusions about applying for a competitive internship, but I know plenty of smaller places offer internships too so I've been looking around and it seems like the requirements they list still expect you to have established and strong skillsets. They use phrasing like ""Expertise in..."" and ""A strong understanding of..."" and tend to list multiple languages and technologies. In school, I've only worked with Java and SQL. I wouldn't say I have a ""strong understanding"" of *anything* I've learned in school but that I have a familiarity with OOP and databases, and a little bit of front-end stuff. I would consider it only a foundation on which to build. I feel really embarrassed that I'm about to have a degree (even if not a BS) in Computer Science and have almost nothing to show for it.

Are there any internships out there that will genuinely be interested in training/teaching someone who has little demonstrable skill to show yet? That would be the reason *why* I need an internship right now, to learn. Is there hope for me, or should I just focus on trying to learn things myself after graduation until I have something to show for it? I thought internships would be more flexible about experience but it looks like the requirements may still be a little above my ability at this time.

At my job I've been working on learning how to build a web application for our user system access requests using ASP.NET MVC which would be something to show if I can actually put together a finished product, but I'm still just in the learning stages of that, reading and watching tutorials in my down time at work in the evenings. 

I guess I'm just feeling a little hopeless and maybe someone out there has been in this situation before and can share their experience. Thanks for listening!

P.S - I've signed a dual admissions agreement with a four year university because my school has a partnership with them so technically I've already been accepted to Temple University's CS program, but I have doubts that I can attend due to my full-time work schedule, which is also really stressing me out. :/ I may have to just call it quits at the A.S. for now.

Exactly what would a software company teach me, if I were to do an internship?

I've written pretty good compilers, servers, operating systems, code mutation engines, and tons of other medium sized projects in my day (100-500k lines of code).  I know all the design patterns, test driven development, version control, code style, etc.  Since I'm in engineering, I've done 4 design projects thus far (design specifications, etc), so I'm good on the technical writing area as well

However, one area I could be improve in is algorithms... as an engineer I didn't learn much algorithms/data structures, only the basics (stuff like quadtrees, redblack trees, trees, hashes, linked lists, stacks, queues, etc) and basic algorithms.   Also, I kind of want to learn more about electronics (digital and analog) and feel like I could do some cool projects this summer, if I didn't have an internship.  Honestly, don't know if its snobby to say, but I feel like I'm better than anybody I'd encounter in the industry

What will do me more good? Do an internship or learn more math? I kind of feel like an internship will be a waste of my time. 

EDIT:  So, is this just my ego talking? Do people in the software industry do more advanced things than what I speak of, or am I correct to assume that they all suck, and spend 90% of their time writing technical documents, attending meetings, and the other 10% of their time writing in crap like ruby on rails with test driven development because they cant code and need to be treated like a baby?  I'm pretty sure 99% of people in the industry don't share the passion I do, and they're just there for the paycheck.  They probably go home and watch TV all night.  Not me. "

The only thing that is stopping me is the price difference between RIT and SUNY schools. The program I am in at my community college almost directly articulates with a program at RIT, so my credits will transfer almost perfectly into the new program, give or take a few credits. RIT also has a co-op program, which to me sounds like a paid internship that is required. 

Another positive is that it is only a 15 minute drive from my home. Since none of the SUNY schools around here offer my program, I would be stuck going to one 2 hours away, and I'd be stuck trying to find housing. I would rather stay home and go to RIT, but I want to hear some of your opinions.

Now, I've gone to school (my school was paid for - but school isn't as expensive in Canada as it is in the states), but I fucked up my first degree. My GPA was really bad since I spent more time playing video games than actually studying. Despite that, I was given a second chance and I decided to do a technical college diploma. Took it more seriously and I actually managed to land internships that gave me experience.

It's been a month since I've graduated, and I'm having trouble finding a job. Even with the experience that I have, the job market is pretty tough. I have an interview this coming week, but it's only a temp job. Still, it's no guarantee that I will get it and even if I do, I have to commute a total of 3 hours a day just to get to work. Better than nothing, I guess?

So what's actually wrong?

Well, I'm battling a League of Legends addiction. Even with how much I've been playing lately, I'm only Platinum 1 (which is top 1.5% of the playerbase), but honestly, it's not enough for me. If there was a way for me to not care about this game anymore and do something else, I would. I just don't have much willpower to start something new. I feel completely lost if I do anything. I can't do sports or weightlifting right now since I'm also suffering from sciatica. Gaming and computers is the only thing I know how to do, and I know I have to expand my skillset, but I just feel lost doing so and I lose interest after maybe 1-2 days of trying.

Anyway, I just don't feel like a useful person. I fucked up all the things that my family has given me. So many people in this world would kill to have their school paid for and do something with their life, but I just threw it away. I can't find another hobby aside from computer and games. I'm way too shy to put myself out there and I'm too sensitive of a person. Also, I don't want to even begin talking about my life because people will just judge me being so pathetic at 26 years old. 

I don't know. I just want my life to be over. I fucked up. Let me just leave. Please. Unfortunately, doing so will hurt my mom and I don't want anything happening to her. Fuck...

Then there are stories of internships of people who work in a start up developed by Ex-Google employees that pays super well as well as a indoor Jacuzzi.

A little background for this massive fuck up of mine; This girl and I met a few years back through a post on Google+, and from there we talked for 3 or so years straight, every night we could. Fast forward 3 years and 5 million messages, she turned 16 and her dad allowed her to start dating. Long story short, we started dating, and so we could spend more time together her dad gave me a job as an intern at his non-profit company where she was also interning.

Here's where the real fuck up starts. On our way to Colorado for the first week of camp we were running (18ish hour van ride), she was pretty upset, because the one week anniversary of her younger sisters death was coming up (stillborn). Me being a very empathetic person told her about my own sister who had been stillborn, so she wouldn't feel alone. Except instead of telling her that she had been stillborn, I thought that it would be a good idea to tell her that she had died in a car crash (yes I'm a moron, I realize). 

Fast forward another few months of me bullshitting this story and keeping up the biggest lie I have ever told, to the last week of camp we ran. Going into that week I was dead tired from doing everything at these camps, and I was also coming down with the flu. On top of all of that, I was supposed to teach the science lesson as well. And as if it couldn't get any worse, I experienced night terrors for the first time. For whatever reason, I got it into my head that it would be a great idea to tell everyone that my parents had kicked me out (complete lie), and that ended up getting the organization I worked for involved. Really long story short; tried to lie my way with an even bigger lie about being too tired to think straight and ""mishearing my parents.""

After all this, I managed to piss off my gf's dad so much from all the trouble I caused that he ended our dating, and now she hates me (of course) and I have been banned from helping at any of the non-profits events.

TL;DR Tried to empathize with my then gf to comfort her, ended up lying to about 20 people for 4 months, got called out on it, lost job and gf.

STL;DR Got called out on biggest lie I've ever told."

I am now almost finished LPTHW and am working on a chess program (in Python).

I really enjoy the problem solving aspects of coding, and the feeling of accomplishment when you build something that actually works. It sure beats editing CAD drawings. So I am seriously considering transferring to CS. But it will set me back by at least one school term, at which point I will be basically be stuck with the program unless I want to waste even more time switching into something else down the road, so I want to make sure that it is something that I really want to do before switching.

Some context: I've never owned a Windows PC before - just Macs. The longest period I've used a Windows PC was 7 weeks during an internship, on an aging machine running Windows 7. My current machine is a 2011 Macbook Pro 13"" (256GB SSD, 16GB DDR3 1600Mhz, Intel HD3000), a miracle because it has only been serviced once for a battery replacement, and I abuse it horribly from time to time (rendering 1080p in Premiere Pro, while having illustrator, photoshop open, and modelling in 3D Max on a Windows 7 VM all at the same time)

I'm currently looking into getting a PC workstation laptop, since my course in University will require me to do architectural renders from time to time. 2 Problems though:

1. I am very used to the gestures and 'Mission Control' functions in Mac OS X, especially the separate virtual desktops, and the 'hot corners'. Does Windows 10 have anything similar that's built-in? I do not wish to install too many 3rd-party softwares just to emulate the way I've worked in the past.

2. I haven't yet managed to find a workstation laptop that has balanced power and battery life. Battery life is important - I've often been in situations where my MBP has to last more than 5 hours. I'm looking at the Lenovo Thinkpad P50s, but I'm not sure about its reliability. Do you guys have advice or recommendations?

The jump between different OSes and ecosystems is going to be tough, but I'm all up for it if I need a different system to take on different jobs. Thanks in advance for all the advice! "

I got offered a full ride scholarship to Florida A&amp;M, and a 14K scholarship to UCF and I wanted to choose between the two for either CS, EE, or CE. 
Some more info:
1.	Through dual enrollment and AP, I will have knocked out most, if not all, of the requirements of my AA by the start of Fall 2016.
2.	I will be getting Bright Futures, and probably FL Pell, so it won’t be *impossible* to afford either.
3.	UCF has a BS/MS joint program for just about every engineering discipline, so some of their scholarship could be used for grad level courses.
4.	The FAMU scholarship is valued at tuition, r&amp;b for 8 semesters, but I’m not sure if it’s only for classes at the undergraduate rate.
5.	I’m originally original from Orlando.

My question is, is the extra cost of UCF justified by the potential “better” opportunities for internships and the like? Or would it be better to take advantage of FAMU’s generosity and live with less of a financial burden before getting rekt by grad school costs?"
45r2hi,636,2016-02-14,TIFU by asking out two ladies for valentines,LeOneThatGetsAway,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/45r2hi/tifu_by_asking_out_two_ladies_for_valentines/,"First post in the sub, thought I'd share this.


I am in college trying to get valentines date. I am abit shy to ask someone out at the moment so I thought I'd fail. I asked this girl who is having her internship at out university; to my surprise, she said yes. I was so amazed how it went smoothly and how easy it was, confidence struck me hard so without hesitating and without thinking, I eventually tried to ask out my college crush. The conversation is getting bad and awkward so I am ready to be turned down, so I ended the conversation with asking her if she'd like to spend valentines day with me. All stars/planets/whatever must have been aligned that day because she actually said YES!! Damn I was so happy I felt invincible from drag downs that day.


I went home then recollected what on earth just happened today; and then, it struck me. I asked two ladies out for valentines day. Holy Fck what am I gonna do?! My mind became a mess. I don't want to suddenly bail on someone and I'm not a kind of person who breaks promises easily so at the end of the day, I said to myself, ' fck it Im gonna have two ladies for valentines'


Valentines day came, I thought of a plan while having breakfast.

I texted Ms. Intern. We spent Valentines day until 4pm. Ice skate, ate at a burger restau, movie, coffee.

I texted Ms. Crush. We spent Valentines day 4pm until 9pm.  Window shopping, movie, pizza and pastries for dinner, liquor, intimate talks


All is well, went home, peak happiness.

And then shit happened, I texted the both of them for an amazing day, the problem is, stupid me accidentally switched the events on both the ladies. Both of them got confused then mad after figuring it out. I explained it to them eventually.


Tomorrow Feb 15, I'll see the aftermath of this crazy valentines day for me. Wish me Luck.


TL;DR:

Asked out college intern, said yes; got cocky, asked out college crush, said yes.

All is well. Until I texted both of them for an amazing day, but I accidentally switch events on both the ladies.

They got confused then mad after figuring out what happened. Explained to them.

Hoping for the best or the worse tomorrow.



**Update:**

So I passed by the library to try to speak to Ms. Intern. Told her about the mix up and that I am at fault for being stupid. I told her that I had fun and she also did but I was not convinced that she forgave me for what I did so I asked her again playfully and again and again, until she jokingly said that I'd have to treat her every Friday and that I should hang out some more time in the library. I nodded, not fully aware/comprehended of what just happened, I guess I just wanted to leave now, like my typical shy side.


Going out for lunch, I saw Ms. Crush but she was talking to another guy and I thought I would not want to interrupt them so I just passed by them, they are so focused in their conversation, I doubt they noticed my face, but as I pass by them I overheard some of their conversation, it seems like the guy wanted to force her to tell him the truth. I do not know though if it was about the date or some other matter.

Later that afternoon, I saw her doing her paperwork in the open laboratory, I got nervous, my mind became blurred, she really looks amazing. I was a completely another guy at that moment, I fcking stuttered H-Hi.
I like to smash my head onto the table that time, but I have started it, and so I continued, explained again to her and my faults. She was upset for a moment when I said I asked her second, I remembered her 
confrontation with the guy earlier and so we talked about it and she said it was about how she feels about me. I tried to keep my composure and asked her about it so casually like a douchy guy who didn't care.
She readied her hand, I am ready to take a slap for what I just did being suddenly douchy, which is inconsiderate now that Ive realized about it. but she just tapped my face, and then held it; damn my face
was so red, I can tell because of that hot feeling in my ears. Cutting after that and all the drama, she thinks that I am a good man and a good catch but she wouldn't want to sully our new-found friendship;
 so yea, she only wanted to be friends; and yes, I just got shoved into the friend purgatory. I don't really get how girls think most of the time. But I am still young and maybe she meant that
we can enter a romantic relationship when we finish college. Maybe I'll just play along and still ask them out, but this time one at a time. I learned my lesson and avoid another TIFU.

One last thing, the last piece of the puzzle is that I didn't reveal to them each other's identity from the start, so they won't(?) figure out each other. "

In school, I am currently studying computer engineering so there might be courses that might show that I have experience in hardware (electronic circuits, digital systems, etc) but it is not really in my interest nor do I think I am good enough to interview with Nvidia for something like that.

However, I currently do not have any internship offers at the moment or interviews lined up. Should I risk it and go through the interview and hope that I might somehow get the job? Or should I tell the recruiter that I am not interested in this position and possibly help me seek out a software team?

I'm 18 now, currently attending a community college. When I was 17 in highschool, I was caught shoplifting at a Target. The amount was around $300, so the cops were called and they read me my rights and asked a few questions. They took me home and talked to my parents. If I recall correctly, I was given a court date, but eventually they said I don't need to show up (Probably because it was my first and only issue with the law, I cooperated very well) The items were returned in perfect condition, and I paid the civil demand of $500 just in case. I've never heard anything about it since. I'm not sure if it was a misdemeanor, grand theft, petty theft

However, I was wondering if I apply for university, internships, jobs, etc., will it show up on any background checks or if they ask if I had any problems with the law, do I say yes? 

I thought juvenile records were expunged as soon as you turn 18 but that doesn't seem to be the case. 

If anyone can shed some light, that would be great. It was a one-time thing and I don't want it to affect me at all in the future.

I think I can definitely do better, but there's no way I can achieve like a 4.0 every quarter, I just can't do THAT well on exams due to memory retention issues and anxiety. I don't have very much experience outside of college either, I don't have time because I'm a really, really slow learner/worker so I have to spend like 60~ hours a week on school, and after that I'm just exhausted, though I've done a little bit of work during the Summer. Suggestions on what I should do? I'll definitely apply for internships next year or so, maybe earlier. "

Five months ago I got my first tech job as a programmer. I've been employed before (summer jobs as system administrator and as technical support for 9 months) but I approached this opportunity with great enthusiasm because after all programming is what I want and love doing. I started as an intern and then got an offer for full-time employment and I agreed. The sad thing is I agreed only because I need money since I'm still an undergraduate and I wanted to lift some of the weight off my mothers shoulders (she's a single parent). But I don't like my job and there are reasons: in the last two months I haven't learned a simple new thing that will help me be better with my tasks; I have a very short attention span and when I have to work for months on a single thing (and there it not a single comment in the code) I get very nervous and depressed; the company has something like a framework and I'm afraid that if I spend years on it I won't be able to find a job after that, because I won't be qualified enough; the salary is small for the industry. I dread going to work, and can't wait for the work day to end. This is not beneficial for neither side in my opinion. I'm wondering if these reasons are good enough for me to resign in the end of the next month when my contract expires. I'm just not happy, I feel miserable.

My friends have asked me and I have no idea: Will I pursue internships? Hmm. In my mind I have visions of fetching coffee for a boss my age and being assigned to read git documentation along with the other interns. Maybe awkwardly touring around the office in neon green *INTERN* shirts. There are certainly some great firms here I'd consider interning at, but it strikes me that maybe I should just focus on finishing school. Or might I find an internship that acknowledges my ""different"" situation? Certainly I don't know everything, and working on something hefty like distributed systems or compilers would be valuable for me."

I'm a little in the middle and I feel a little lost as to how to best position myself.

I live in Portland, OR and intend to stay here. (My wife and I have strong family connections.) I went to Reed College (a local school) and majored in English Lit. I worked for years before going to law school. Worked as a lawyer for a few years before discovering coding. Instead of going to code school, I had a unique opportunity to pursue an MSCS at Portland State and am now in my early thirties trying to get going.

So. I'm in an MSCS program. I get data structures and algorithms, and I've done the requisite amount of C and assembly. But I'm also fascinated with Node and Ruby and Clojure. I've got a research position doing some database-related stuff (not super computer sciencey, but still getting me writing a lot of code).

So in the plus column, I've got a lot of related assets: real-world work experience, a strong understanding of corporate and IP law, I'm on the board for a local tech non-profit, etc. In the minus column, I've only been in tech for about two years, and even though I'm smart and hardworking, there's only so much I can absorb. I haven't had three undergrad summers for internships. I haven't had any downtime to do a lot of OS contributions (between three master's levels classes, my work, and my family, I'm pretty taxed out).

I feel like the bar for what I'm looking for is low. I don't care about big salary (~$50K is perfectly fine), I don't care about tech stack (Java and C# are as fascinating to me as Go and Rust), and I'm probably more comfortable in an enterprise environment than in a startup environment (though the beer and ping pong scenario would be nice, too). Mostly I just want to end up in a place with mentorship opportunities because I'm making up for lost time. The only real hitch is my lack of internships and I have to stay local.

**So how do I position myself?** I think I'm an ideal fit for the right company, I just need to find it. I'm looking for internships for this summer, but I'm focusing on companies big enough to absorb me in the fall if I'm awesome. I have a wide but shallow net of contacts (haven't been in the industry long enough). Unsure how to highlight what I'm awesome for.

Any tips?

**tl;dr:** I'm a lawyer with most of an MSCS who wants a job or internship in Portland. How do I highlight ways I'm awesome?

**Edit:** Okay, so rebuild the resume. Got it, and thank you. But is there anything else I can do to put my best foot forward as someone with a unique skillset."

(For context, Kelly dropped out of college and spent his 20s backpacking around Asia and the Middle East.  It seems to have worked out for him).

45zpcv,60,2016-02-15,My time at the Gaebler Children's Center.,Moloko-Plus,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/45zpcv/my_time_at_the_gaebler_childrens_center/,"I've only disclosed this story to 5 people I know. Two are my closest friends, two are my parents, and another is my therapist. That said, I've never spilled all the details, lest I look like a madwoman. 

In 1989, I received my PHD in psychology from Boston College, with a minor in child psychology. After two years of intensive internships, I found myself employed at the Gaebler Children's Center. The Gaebler Children's Center was a children's psychiatric hospital in Waltham Massachussetts. The GCC, as I call it for short, was built in 1955 and demolished in 1992. The GCC was meant for children with ""severe mental illnesses."" State health officials commented that the institution was closed for a lack of funds, but I feel that I know the real reason...

....

On a particularly frigid November morning in 1991, I began working at the GCC. My job was no more than ""assistant to child psychologist"", and my role consisted of checking the rooms, making sure the kids ""played nice,"" and acting as a counselor and therapist when the main psychologist was absent or sick.

The first week was fairly routine. I dealt with kids that had a wide range of mental disorders, from extremely debilitating autism, to kids with horrible anger issues, schizophrenia, and more. Granted, some kids, like Ivan Dyavol, were much more calm and even intelligent. Ivan was supposedly the son of two Russian immigrants with an undiagnosed form of ""anti social personality disorder.""

A week into my job, I opened the door to Ivan's room, only to find a 5 year old named Lucy lying on the floor, convulsing and foaming at the mouth. I disregarded Ivan and rushed to Lucy. I quickly brought her to the nurse who dismissed it as an epiletic seizure. Lucy, however, claimed she visited a ""dark place"" when she had her ""seizure."" When I asked her about the dark place she said she saw ""nothing but fire and darkness, darker than the night."" For a five year old, she was surprisingly articulate in her small description of the dark place.

Timid and admittedly scared, I walked back to Ivan's room after calming Lucy. Ivan was not in his room, despite the fact that it was at 11am, the time when all kids are confined to their individual rooms. 

I alerted the chief psychologist. She looked concerned and told me to check the baby monitor. See, each room was equipped with a small baby monitor of sorts. The baby monitor never delivered any sounds back to us, it just showed us the room in black and white. We were able to replay any moment of the day. We trawled through the archives of the morning, only to find that Ivan had been in his room the entire morning. We didn't even see Lucy having the seizure in his room. The head psychologist, normally the sweetest woman, turned her head at me after seeing the footage. She gazed at me and didn't blink, not once. Her stare was something out of a horror film. She simply told me;

""I think it's best we let this one go, Karen.""

That afternoon, during a small lunch break for the stable kids, I confronted Ivan. He denied that he had done anything wrong, saying that he ""briefly left the room"" to alert the Chief Psychologist about Lucy. When asked why Lucy was in his room, he shrugged his shoulders.

That night, I couldn't sleep. I lived a block away from the institute, and decided to use my key to enter the building at 11pm at night. It was the first day of December, and a light blustery snow was falling softly from the dark sky. 

I entered the building quietly and entered the office of the Chief Psychologist to fetch the baby monitor tapes. I replayed the one I had watched earlier in the morning, only to find more of the same.....That is, until I paused the monitor at about the halfway point. It was completely dark, completely blurred for a solid 15 seconds, before resuming to a sleeping Ivan.

Confused, I focused on the still frame. A small cross was on Ivan's wall. For a split second frame after the darkness, the cross was upside down, before resuming to its normal position. To this day, I've been told a gust of wind was probably the culprit. To this day, I deny that claim.

The next morning, I showed up to work timid and restless. I was told by my two co-workers that the Chief Psychologist had quit her job suddenly, and chose me as a replacement. She left me a note on my new desk that read;

""Hi Karen, due to personal and family issues I must resign from this position. I entrust you to look after the children here at the GCC.""

The note is still eerie for me to this day. Theres something unnerving about it that makes the hair on my neck stand. That same day, I received word that Lucy's parents had pulled her out of the Gaebler's Children's Center. I wasn't notified until she had already left.

That day at evening recess, every child stayed indoors because of the cold. Despite the fact that dead autumn leaves still lay on the ground, a fresh layer of snow had fallen, and the temperature was near 15 degrees fahrenheit with blustery winds. I looked out my window at the lightly falling snow. It soothed me to see the rusty old swingsets and trees covered in a light layer of snow. 

I then looked back at some paperwork. Ten seconds later, I looked back at the snow covered playground. I rubbed my eyes in petrified disbelief to see Ivan sitting motionless on a swingset. He had the most unearthly smile on his face, grinning widely and maniacally. I had to stop myself from shrieking.

That night, as I proceeded to leave work, I received a phone call on the building's main phone. I picked up and was greeted by Lucy's sobbing mother. She told me that Lucy had died that afternoon of a terrible epileptic fit in which she accidentally suffocated on her food. 

I hung up the phone and ran out of my office only to see Ivan walking eerily through the hallways in the West Wing.....

I didn't sleep that night, nor did I hardly sleep for the remainder of the month. I quit my job at the Gaebler Children's Center the next day. My co-workers assured me that it was all a bizarre string of coincidences. 

But, deep down I know something was off with Ivan in the worst of ways..."

My grades are good, a 3.6 cumulative GPA, and I don't dislike programming. Not at all in fact. 

Until recently, I naively thought that just good grades in my coursework would be enough to get a programming job, but the more I read, the more I know that's not the case. The idea of a technical interview scares the crap out of me, because I'm not that good with algorithms or certain programming concepts. At least not good enough to do them by hand. I don't have any internships. I don't have personal projects, not because I'm lazy, but because I feel like I don't know nearly enough to start anything worthwhile. I feel like the only thing I could write is similar to what I've done in classes up to this point, which are programs that have no real practical use in the world. The same goes for contributing to open source. What could I possibly contribute to a project that someone much more knowledgeable than I am won't have already thought of and done? I'm sure you can tell by now I also lack confidence in what skills I do have.

Anyways, this realization has made me think that with only 3 months to graduation, and nothing to show for it except a couple major course projects I'll be doing this semester, I don't have enough time to make up all that ground before I start interviewing. So maybe I should just forget about programming? Or is this feeling somewhat common, and is there a still reason for me to stick with it? As I said, it's not that I dislike it. Sometimes writing programs for school I can get locked into a zone where I code for hours and actually have to force myself to stop and do something else. 

This semester I'm FINALLY taking a Software Engineering course which apparently is more in line with what you actually do as a programmer, and I'll also be writing a group project in Python, probably some kind of messenger app. So perhaps that could help give me some confidence? But is that enough to have on a resume going into interviews?

But if programming isn't for me, what are the options (if any) for someone with a CS degree? I read about QA Testing, but can you get an entry-level job in that with just a CS degree and no testing experience? Or as a sysadmin, or some other related field?

Sorry if I sound panicked or crazy, but this has been a very stressful thing to come to terms with just months from graduating.

463gvb,7,2016-02-16,Any advice on how to leave a toxic job?,toxicjobthrowaway,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/463gvb/any_advice_on_how_to_leave_a_toxic_job/,"Long story short, I work in a toxic environment. I don't want to give too many details in order to remain anonymous, but here's what I feel comfortable sharing -

It's a small company (me + one other employee, plus the two CEOs) work in the main office. There are a couple of offices internationally staffed by one or two people, but they focus on matters within their own country, and don't provide much support to the main office. 

There are way too many tasks to do in a day, and not enough time to complete them all. Myself and my coworker end up putting in many hours of overtime each week, which we don't get compensated for. Our bosses tell us that we can put those towards our vacation hours, but whenever we try to take a vacation it's ""a crazy time"" and we can't leave. There are no stable structures in place to ensure that everything that need to get done happens, and when stuff falls through the cracks there is hell to pay. We are often called in on the weekends for emergencies that wouldn't be an issue if there was more support and organization within the team. I've presented methods of becoming more organized and how to make the lives of everyone better, but my bosses typically brush that aside and say they'll come up with a better system, but they never do.

My coworker and I have asked for another employee, or even an intern to help, but our bosses don't want to hire anyone else at this moment. We don't get paid enough for the work that we do (I have a Masters Degree, and people who work in similar companies with only an undergrad degree and 1/2 the responsibilities make twice as much as I do), and it's a constant source of stress in my life. 

I've decided that I no longer want to work in an environment like this, and I am hoping to leave mid-March. I have a few job applications out, and enough in savings to hold me over for a few months until I find something else, so I'm not concerned about money. 

However, I do have a lot of anxiety about leaving. I am going to feel guilty for leaving my coworker behind to deal with this, and I have a feeling my bosses are going to try to convince me to stay longer to get through this season... I don't want to stay any longer than I need to. This job has become detrimental to my health, and I know leaving is the right choice. However, I am terrified for the repercussions. This is my first ""adult"" job (I've worked for over 10 years since high school, but this is my first full-time, benefits-earning job), so I don't really know what the best protocol is. According to my contract (which I never even signed, which goes to show how unorganized everything is) asks for 2 weeks notice, but I don't know how to stand up for myself and tell them that I'm not going to give them any more time past the two weeks. With past employees, they've convinced them to stay longer (like 6 months past their original plans for leaving). I'm also afraid that the last two weeks will become increasingly hostile, making my life a living hell until I walk out the doors for the last time.

Does anyone have any advice on how the best way to handle it? When I do talk to my boss about resigning, I'm planning on emphasizing that I'm leaving for my own well-being, rather than complaining about the company. But any advice about how to build up the courage to leave and not be manipulated into staying longer would be greatly appreciated."

I'm kind of just looking to vent and obtain general advice about my current status in my career.

So I am a student graduating in December and have been employed as a software developer at my university for the past couple years. I enjoy the job a decent amount, I've learned a lot, but really don't like my managers, they're pretty toxic at times and my pay puts me below the poverty line.

So I didn't want this position to be my only experience programming during school so I obtained an internship a state over for this upcoming summer. I did this originally while talking with my bosses with the understanding that I would continue to do my job here part time over the summer, remotely, so that they wouldn't have to replace me and I'd still have a job when I came back. I figured it also would be a good chance to make some decent money over the summer since I won't work more than 40hr/wk during my internship and will have a decent amount of free time.

After I got an offer for my internship a couple months ago they started talking about replacing me. I offered an alternative, that I would train a coworker (that currently doesn't program but is interested as he's in computer science as well) to cover for me over the summer. My coworker even offered to do this training off the clock simply for the opportunity to learn. The upper management has been considering this for the past couple months but ultimately decided they're replacing me, the job posting will be put up in the next month or so.

This is incredibly demoralizing for myself and my coworker, both of us have put a lot of energy and enthusiasm for learning and working here.  I feel like this decision has been made in such bad faith that I am kinda glad I'm getting out, but that has also made me feel entirely indifferent to my job as a whole. I'm burnt out.

With that all said, I'm looking forward to my internship but I'm trying to figure out what to do afterwards for my final semester. I don't think I can make it the entire semester without the little income I had, but I'm not sure I'll be able to find another software development job for just a single semester.  Will it look bad if I end up with a shitty retail job or something? How about no job at all? Any advice/encouragement about my current position would be greatly appreciated. Thanks"

I went to the engineering and civil ones last semester and didn't really know what I was doing, but am more prepared for these. However, one thing that companies asked was if I had work experience. I'm a sophomore, so I haven't really had actual engineering classes or an internship or anything. 

I am involved in ASCE, and was hoping to go to a huge competition in April on a couple teams but its out of state for four days, and I couldn't get off of work. I'm trying to help out the teams anyway, but I work 25ish hours a week, mainly weekends and nights when the teams meet.I am also teaching myself Python and AutoCAD along with a ton of use of MATLAB in most of my classes.

One of my friends has a few months more experience than me in coop but otherwise has similar qualifications, but he obtained a $100 certificate in Javascript from Coursera last December.

I accepted it because I was getting rejected by many companies but it's a very crappy IT internship from what I can tell (they asked me no technical questions in the interview). It is a fortune 500 company but I doubt I'll learn too much.

I have a cgpa of around 3.3 but it seems like that is not as important. Up until now I just focused on my classes and have tried to understand concepts. I do well in Math/Programming courses but I'm no genius. I'd say I'm better than 70 percent of my class. (so better than average at least). But from what I'm reading, this is not enough as the competition is pretty high. I'm seeing sophomores with better internships and Juniors with their second internship at big 4 companies. Everyone on here is already ahead of me.

I have always aspired being a developer and coding interesting things that matter be it for a big or mid sized company. I truly love programming but it seems like the competition is too difficult. I'm just getting really stressed and feel like I should have done more when I thought I was doing enough.

tl;dr : Thought being in a top 40 school, having a decent gpa, graduating with a CS degree with decent/good understanding of concepts and a love for programming would get me the jobs I wanted.

Turns out I have no internship experience and not substantial enough projects (on top of that, my internship this summer wont help either).

I am in my first year of a program, and right now my GPA is far below what I apparently need to maintain to remain in the program. Last semester I took a course that I soon (but not soon enough) found out that I certainly should not have taken. I originally thought it would be interesting and that I would learn some valuable skills (which in fact I did). However, it ended up being a nightmarish time sink where I had to dedicate basically my entire efforts into it just to stay afloat. I eventually learned that it is common knowledge in the department never to take that course. When all was finished, I earned a C, which was a surprise to me as from the (very scarce) mid-semester feedback on grades, I had been scoring about as the rest of the class was, and given that a C might as well be an F. 

Based on department requirements, essentially, this semester I must earn straight As in two additional classes and research progress, or I'm gone. This is causing me so much anxiety and I don't know if I can do it. Even in undergrad my grades were not that high - although I never did this poorly - as I tended to just take classes that were interesting or valuable and focus more on research, so I don't even have former confidence to fall back on. The worst is that I know it is all my fault.

I feel so fucking stupid for not just realizing I should just take the easy classes, keep my head down and do my research and so fucking angry that this stupid class is going to cost me the PhD program I worked so hard to get. I don't have anything else. I never succeeded in getting internships in undergrad, couldn't get a job after, and have a bad time functioning in a rigid corporate environment. I don't see a future beyond this and I wonder how the fuck am I the only retard who fucked up like this? 

I don't know what I can do at this point and I've tried to stay positive and think ""I can do this, I just need to try really hard,"" but doesn't matter if you don't truly believe it, when it just seems almost impossible. Does anyone have advice?"

I searched this sub and found that the last time there was an engineering related post was almost a year ago so I’m not sure how things have changed since then.

About my situation:

•	I graduated with my degree in aerospace engineering about ~9 months ago and still cant find a job.  I have done everything I could think of, short of moving to California and walking into places.  

•	I keep updating my resume and have submitted it to r/resume for advice. 

•	I have submitted almost 100 applications to many companies, big and small.  

•	I got a part time job so I don’t have any excessive gaps in employment. 

•	After the first few months I stopped going after my “Dream Job,” and started looking for a foot in the door.

•	I have had a few phone interviews, including 5 phone/ Skype interviews with various people within one of my top 5 companies.
•	I have been asking everyone that I know for help getting past the “apply online,” wall.

•	I had what I though was a great amount of experience for a college grad (1 internship where I literally designed and built an unmanned aircraft by myself, a class competition that my team won, and a few research experiences) all relevant to my degree and what I want to do eventually.

•	My boss for my internship has given a good recommendation to places that have asked for it, and I have asked them to alert me if they hear about any jobs that I would fit in well. (The reason that I am not working for the company I did my internship with is because it was a research position at a university.

•	I have tried to utilize my alumni network; unfortunately my university doesn’t have a very good one for engineers.

•	I’m looking at possibly picking up a second job because life.

I feel like nothing I do is getting me through.  Am I doing something wrong? Do I just need to give it more time? Do I actually need to relocate to give myself a better chance? Any advice would be great.

Initially my internship was physically helping with office moves, moving the departments computers to a different area in the building, at this time there was also another intern, after the moves finished up they elected to keep me rather than the other intern.

Now that the moves are done my day to day is unboxing workstations to be prepped, setting up servers to make it easier for them to finish up, (loading ESXI but then leaving it) I do some support calls, and some machine imaging.

One of the things I have issue with is that my priority is learning and improving but I am basically just a gopher ex. Move this, unbox this, take this there etc..
I'm not sure how much experience I am really gaining but it concerns me as I am almost done with an AAS in Network Administration and feel very unprepared for this industry. 

One of the main things I am gaining from what I can see is a foot in the door, my boss and I have had multiple discussions about taking a position in his department when it is approved.
These talks were initiated by him and not me so that encouraging.

I have also talked to the head of another department about
potentially applying for a field position which seems like it would be enjoyable while I'm still young.

Which do you guys think would be better entry level experience? A field position or a mixture of Helpdesk/hardware configuration?

So I do IT Support for our states county offices and some private businesses, have been for the past 2 years and since I am only 23 and will be graduating college in May i am still technically an intern so I do just about everything the office needs me to do. New PC setups, printer setups, AD user accounts, Sheriff office tough books, and all the program support that goes along with these many great things. Jack of all trades, master of none type of deal. So I get a service ticket for a user I had just setup a new laptop for in the Sheriff's office, not a tough book for the car just a laptop for in the office. I had done a remote session to her current desktop the other day to see what programs she would need on the new one, file save location things like that, very simple and straight forward setup really. She also had a program on there that runs through the state ITD but is setup on their counties local DC, we will call it *PoliceInfoProgram*. So in this service ticket it says she cant log into *PoliceInfoProgram* for some reason.


So I call her:
&gt; Hey *PoliceWoman* this is *ITGuy*, I have a ticket that you cant log in to *PoliceInfoProgram*?

Her response: &gt; Yes I cant, did you do anything to it when you were logged in yesterday?

Me: &gt; No? I never even clicked on it, I just noted that it was there. And managed to get the link to it and install it on your new laptop like you requested, you cant log in?

Her: &gt; Nope.

Me: &gt; Odd, okay well lets double check your user name, password, let me try typing it **User name\ password error. Check Server Connection**   WTH? (Under my breath) Are you sure you are using the right name and password?

Her: &gt; Yes I use this one all the time, its the one I used yesterday and it worked just fine after you got out of my pc.

Me: &gt; Okay....odd, well lets give it the old restart the PC and see what happens, maybe it just needs to reconnect to the domain and server to fix it. (So we do that, still get the same error and I am very confused because at this point I only know how to install it do the PC and that they have their own login that they know and it works). 

Me: &gt; Okay *PoliceWoman* Let me talk to another tech that might know a little more, hold on.

I walk to the next cube over and describe the situation to *OtherTechGuy*

His response: &gt; Is the time on her PC the exact right time?

Me: &gt; Uhhhh, I dont know, i guess i never looked. That didn't occur to be related to this at all.

I sit back down at MY PC and I  have another remote session going on her PC, and sure enough..her clock is 5 minutes slow according to my phone. So I set it back to the right time.

Me: &gt; Okay *PoliceWoman* try it now (I have no hope for this fix what so ever) **IT LOGS IN PERFECTLY** No Fricken way! (My exact words over the phone) 

She says while laughing at the same time: &gt;What the hell?!

Me: &gt; No way that's what it was, I guess your time has to be synced exactly with the state server for you to log into the program. Thats the last thing I would have thought of or bothered to look at.

Her: &gt; Thats fine, Im just glad its fixed. I will have to keep track of the time next time it happens.

Do you find yourself in a position to report on news, or provide social commentary to other news outlets?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4698hl/i_am_larry_wilmore_host_of_the_nightly_show_with/d03c5j9?context=5)|I find many young people are turning more to comedy programs now than actual news. It's a trend that's been going on for the last 10 years. I think a lot of it has to do with authenticity. I think sometimes they feel like they don't know if they can trust the actual news anymore.

He had an amazing ability to emote on screen. The story that sticks out -- Bernie and I were having a discussion and he said, very emphatically, ""Man, just be yourself. Just be yourself, Larry. Be yourself."" He said it several times and I just thought it was one of the coolest things.
[A few months ago, a segment from your show received a lot of flak about two of your contributors writing off the importance of discovering water on mars, and it came off as disrespect to your guest, Bill Nye.

People are allowed to have a point of view. Bill Nye had a great time on that panel. He's been on the show a couple of times. People are allowed to have opinions. For the life of me, I really don't understand why people are so upset that someone would disagree with Bill Nye. I was on Bill's side of that, but still, who cares? It's just a conversation.

That happens more often than naught because we only have about seven minutes to talk about something, so I'm always left with the feeling that there wasn't enough said.

I'm a CS senior that will be graduating in May and I'm currently in my 3rd month of an internship as an SQL developer. I had one very theory heavy SQL class with very little application and the rest has been learned through codeschool/other internet resources and on the job. 

I feel like I'm barely scraping by with this work. Every task I get assigned is something that I feel as if I'm starting from rock bottom. I spend a lot of time looking at robust and weathered SQL queries trying to understand their logic/business logic. I finish some tasks simply because I take the work home and work extra so it won't be late.

My problem is that the person that I was instructed to go to for help started off with a tone that makes me not want to ask for help. The responses were short, blunt, and made me feel like I didn't spend enough time investigating. I really try to refrain from asking for help now because I don't feel good asking them, they are very busy, and I think I've asked too many questions already and am worried it will look like I can't do the job. I want to learn as much as I can and contribute but I'm in a constant limbo looking at crazy code and the tasks that go along with it.

Would anyone have some advice on how to best approach a situation like this? I'm still trying to do my best at making progress but I'm a bit worried now of someone noticing how slowly I'm working and pulling the plug.

Within my first month after starting this course I knew it wasn't for me. I told this to my parents even though I knew that they had been expecting me to do well. Their response was pretty much ""Don't care, do the degree for us as we are an academic family"". Almost everyone in my family has higher qualifications, at the very least a degree but masters and PhD in the case of my parents.

I went through the first year depressed, suicidal at points after having so many conversations with my parents about leaving uni (almost every two months) each conversation started with my explaining my situation and plan and ended with me in tears and I realised I had two options, finish my degree for the sake of my family, or leave university being classed as a drop out and move away from my family potentially lose regular contact with my extended family and parents/brother.

I scraped pass grades in every module in the first year, convincing myself that a pass grade was all I needed to maintain good relations with my parents.

Now in the second year, the work is really demanding, I'm not committed to studying as my only motivation is my parents and I'm afraid I may fail. My parents don't understand this because I've always been a ""good student"" and I was given a scholarship to study at my university for my academic excellence. I also have a really good software engineering internship lined up next year at a multi national company who I won't name. Academic excellence is one thing, but I have no desire to do a degree, I have worked most summers in various roles in the IT field and I have enjoyed it. I want to leave uni and be a ""drop out"" / ""failure"" and work in similar roles that I am qualified for and have experience in.

I'm worried about the potentially permanent damage I could do to my relationship with my parents and younger brother by leaving my course but I am also worried about becoming depressed and anxious with my mental health, I've noticed my personality and outlook on life change, I don't exercise anymore, I eat whatever I want, I take risks I wouldn't take in the past, I'm much more likely to get in an argument with random people and I don't really look forward to waking up on the days where I have class. I'm finding it difficult to make a decision as there are other factors at play, if I fail or don't complete my course, the scholarship becomes nullified so I will be left with a huge debt."

I'm stopping in today looking for some advice. I basically want to know if I am kidding myself trying to get into asset management/investment banking. I need to know if its time to pivot, press the reset button and get a second degree, or if its time to push harder to break into the industry. Feel free to be blunt I just want the truth, I don't want to waste anymore of my time or money pursuing a dream that is out of my grasp.

**Credentials**

I am about to graduate from a small/ medium University with a Bachelor of Commerce and between a B+ - A- average. I have been extremely active with extracurricular during school at case competitions winning 3 international competitions during my time at school. Case competitions really helped me get engaged at school and sparked a lot of my interest in being an analyst in either a consulting or investment banking field. Two of these competitions were Finance specific cases where I finished ahead of teams from more prestigious schools. I'm currently studying for the CFA level 1 exam in June of 2016. My glaring weakness is that I wasn't able to get internships during my time at school (same story, I aggressively pursued positions but never really got a sniff at an interview) so my experience is limited to physical labor jobs that helped me pay for my education.

**The Job Hunt**

Where my school is located (Ottawa) makes it hard to network with the types of companies (Scotiabank, RBC, BMO etc...) I would like to work for. These firms don't even recruit at our school and we are often looked down upon for not being students from top schools. I have sent out nearly 200 resumes and cover letters since the beginning of January, and have yet to receive even a phone interview. 

**What I'm Doing Now?**

Right now I'm trying to do everything I can to be an attractive candidate. I'm working on my excel skills everyday trying to become as proficient as possible. On top of studying for the CFA Level 1 I'm working at reading a book a week on business and finance topics in an effort to improve my knowledge base and critical thinking. This is all while finishing my last semester of studies.

**The Bottom Line**
 
I'm worried that my mediocre grades and experience is going to make it impossible to break into the industry. Realistically I feel like my only way in is through getting a Master's Degree, but I'm worried that even with a Master's Degree I will be looked down on for my lack of experience during undergraduate.

Realistically what would you do if you were in my shoes? I don't want to waste my time and money pursuing a career that I will never get a chance at. "

Back in November a company in Adelaide invited me to go see them after I inquired if they may have any future positions. They didn't have anything at the time, but have now came back to let me know that they have a job, but that they are ""not yet in a position to look at a higher level role due to budget constraints"".
The position is exactly what I've been hoping to find and would match the supply &amp; distribution or procurement manager role if the issue of budget wasn't there.
I replied to his mail giving him a few job titles and let him know the market rate for supply managers I could find, and they have now invited me to come back to speak with them tomorrow morning to discuss if there are any options.

My questions to you:

- Can anybody think of ways to help the firm be able to pay enough to qualify?
I have been thinking of suggesting that I could work for 6 months on my working holiday visa either below market rate in a more junior role or even suggest to bring me in as an intern or so with very little/no pay.
My concern is that I don't want to jeopardize then looking as though I am not qualified to apply, as my background is not as rock solid as I would like it to be. 
(I have a masters in European Business, Culture and Languages and was a Supply Chain Customer Service Manager for 3 years - though the job description fits perfectly. I'm planning on receiving my Supply Chain Professional Certification from APICS to strengthen it further before then)

- Does anybody have suggestions for best websites etc to give them all the info needed while also not overwhelming them?

Thanks!"

He started as an intern working in the lab power and infrastructure, got hired by our company for another department, and finally came back to our team as a full employee. Great guy, works hard, and I found out recently how well he can connect the dots. 

There is a division between our lab and the rest of the company. We own the lab network and infrastructure, and the company IT owns the network and infrastructure outside the lab. The cubicles have two network connections - most users connect to the corporate network behind their phone or a small switch on one port, and a handful connect their workstation to another port that connects to a set of floor switches hooked directly into the lab network. 

We've had tickets come in where a few users complain they cannot keep their SSH connections open between their machines in their cubicles, and their test/dev gear inside the lab. One in particular had us scratching our heads. IT checked their DHCP log, same IP every day. No errors in their logs, the DOS protections and the firewall logs didn't show any dropped packets. 

We moved him over to the alternate port, but the firewall is pretty strict on traffic coming out of the lab. The user finds he cannot live behind such rules and decides to move back to the corporate network, and we resume troubleshooting. 

One morning, my teammate comes by.

&gt; Me: Yeah? What is it? 

&gt; Teammate: There are two outlets at every cubicle, one white and one gray. The white one stays on all the time, and...

I know where this is going. 

&gt; Teammate: ... the gray one turns off every night at the same time. It turns back on the following morning around 7am. 

&gt; Me: Was it his workstation? That'd simply turn off, not just drop the connection. Is he on a UPS? 

&gt; Teammate: No, his workstation stays on the white outlet. He's using a small switch on the corporate network, and that switch is on the gray outlet. 

Oh, for Pete's sake!!!! 

We tell the user the finding, he moved his little switch over to the white outlet, and never had a problem like this since. 

I've left the network in good hands."

Basically I'm looking for a little advice if possible.

I've have now been a sysadmin for 4 months with a small company. 
This is my first ever job in this role, I was a 3d artist but made the jump (Im working full time and doing my degree in I.T. Full time with the open university so extra time is extremely limited) . However I feel like I have been truly screwed over. 
During my Interviews I explained my background and where I felt I lacked knowledge (Computer Guy to friends and family, The odd computer shop job, Learning via homelab).
I was offered the job for a low amount, (13k) but it was explained to me that I would receive constant training and they would review my wage the following year.
However I'm 4 months in and well there's not been a single moment of training.
To add to this I'm contracted to work 35 hours a week with any extra time worked being unpaid. I wouldn't mind this however its  a huge amount of unpaid work due to entire weekends to trips to the datacentre and nights due to server errors.
I'm also expected to get myself certified asap (n+ , ccna , sec+) I honestly cant afford these on this wage. 
I work with 1 other system admin who is great at his job and looks at me as a burden (Which I feel like I am, theres only so much time I can learn extra stuff and he's far to busy to teach me).

Im not sure what I should say to argue my case to have my contract improved. I'm in a semi remote area so there aren't exactly I.T jobs everywhere .. nor do I see people taking the same gamble on my in a city job (I would honestly move if I had another chance somewhere).

Any advice would be fantastic! 

(sorry if this is a garbled mess reddit on a phone is a pain)

Edit: little more info

I'm not considered an apprentice or an intern

I'm older than 25 so can't be an apprentice 


Edit 2: currently being auto moderated,  will ask mods to restore my replies

Thanks for the input so far!

Edit 3 : I'll start replying tomorrow once my automodertaion has lifted.

To make a few more things clear however.

Its not every weekend im doing overtime just now and again (but it does hurt my studies majorly)

The overtime is not a standard length and I can sign in from home to do it etc.

Over all .. Its the lack of training that bugs me more than the wages.. If it was low paid and I had the whole overtime thing I wouldn't mind if I was getting trained well. (Just want to get good at my job asap, I hate feeling like im a burden to people because im clueless in some areas etc.)



Final edit: Spoke with bosses today , got a tiny raise ... Going to stay until I hit 6 months (to make it easier to get another job) and then leave... Again the promise of training was made, But its the same 4 moth old promise.

I have mostly JavaScript, C#, PHP in my background.

However, I've been back in school for 2 years now. I've been using Java and C++ a lot for side projects and school work. I'll be graduating with a Master's Degree in Computer Science in Spring 2017. I'm working on a thesis that will deal with machine learning and neural nets.

For the first time since I started school again, I'll have a summer with no classes. I'm still a full time Web Developer, and I'm wondering if I should: 

a) quit the job and get a Software Engineering internship, to get real experience with actual C++ or Java projects 

b) keep the job, and focus on research for my thesis, and try to contribute to some open source machine learning projects.

Thanks for any words of advice!"

I accepted the interview and it is going to be this friday at 9:00 am. There are 2 rounds to this interview and it is at my university.

I have a few problems:

1. I am not a confident programmer or have much knowledge about programming.
2. Social anxiety. This is a big BIG issue for me so I fear that my nervousness and lack of confidence will throw me off. Being an introvert and dealing with aspergers is another issue; I can't communicate effectively.
3. There are 2 interviews, 1st is behavioral and 2nd is technical (coding). My heart says I won't survive the coding part because I haven't been practicing much programming for a while.
Sleep. With a bad sleeping cycle, I haven't been getting much sleep lately so I am mentally exhausted.
4. Grades. They are taking a big hit.

I don't know what to do, this is an odd question. To avoid the embarrassment, redditors what would you recommend?"

Thinking of quitting.",_XenoChrist_,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/46f454/should_be_finished_with_masters_this_semester_so/,"I'm doing a master's in Computer Science and have been getting slowly more dissatisfied with my research topic and my advisor's counseling over the past year.

My research isn'T going anywhere right now, the idea comes from my advisor and I'm begiining to doubt it can actually be done as I've been at a standstill for a while. I'm not generating usable data, I'm supposed to be depositing a thesis in late April, and when I talk about the research with my advisor he constantly implies that we haven't even gotten to the meat of the research yet. It seems like he has a clear direction in his head but fails to communicate it to me, either that or he's just winging it.

This guy is a Big Deal in his field, and has many publications and brilliant students, but I just don't feel I'm being given enough support - like you have to be a star player to get some consideration, and I'm one of of the more mediocre students. Some other past students have felt the same way as me, where this advisor didn't made them feel supported when compared to the more ""productive"" students.

I'm pretty sure if I want to stay I'd have to take an extension, and the idea of spending another summer in school, doing this research is dreadful right now. I did have an internship in a major company over the fall and they liked my work and told me to apply for a job once I'm out of school; I just don't know if me dropping out would hurt my chances with them, and am scared to reach out and ask them. I'm just scared of moving in either direction.

If anyone has been through this I'll gladly take your experience. I just don't know what to do. Thanks a lot!"

I am a second semester sophomore and feel like I really haven't learned anything useful. The only thing I could really justify is that I know how to break down a problem better. Is it normal to feel this? I still have a bunch of computer science classes, I have only taken 7 and currently in 2, but I still feel like none of it is practical. I only have 3 more gen eds left.

* I don't know how to set up a network.  
* I don't really know what malware is. 
* I don't know how to do the most basic real life application. 
* If my wifi isn't working the only thing I know how to do is unplug my modem and router and hope for the best. I know there is stuff I can figure out using ipconfig in cmd but I don't know what it does.

I understand these are all things I can go and learn on my own but I am paying a TON of money for my education and I shouldn't have to learn all of this on my own. I plan on learning it all in my free time, but I feel like I shouldn't have to.

Maybe I feel this way because I haven't gotten into the more advance courses, but I feel like these questions should be answered in the introduction classes. The fact that I understand how to create a scheduling system but I was never taught how to set up my own environment is crazy to me. I understand these are more IT related compared to CS related, but if I don't want to code the rest of my life I feel like I am on the same playing field as I was in high school. When I go home for breaks I try to talk to my dad about what he is doing to learn more and I am completely lost. He often questions what I am really learning because he breaks it down as simple as possible without actually physically showing me and I am still lost.

Applying for internships is so difficult because I know I will make a fool out of my self when I don't even know how to use VMs, besides using the Windows remote connection application and typing in the server name the school set up for us. 

Maybe this is all just me ranting and I am in the wrong major but I was wondering if there is anyone else who feels the same way. I love computers so I know I want to work with computers, but maybe a CS degree isn't for me. 

**tl;dr:** I have been pursuing my CS degree for about a year and a half now and honestly feel like I haven't learned anything practical. Is it normal to feel this?"

So a little background on me.  I have graduated from a 4 year degree program in Software Engineering.  I didn't have any internships or coops and basically no side projects besides my senior design project.  The only real language we learned at my school was Java.  I tried to teach myself some other languages but I have not gotten very far with those.  I was able to get a job about 2 months after graduating college as a performance engineer and have been working here for about 8 months.

Now the problem.  I was hired on as a Performance Engineer which wasn't my first choice for a job but was the only offer I got so I took it.  I have not once written a performance script here and was basically pushed straight to QA once I started, and have been automating tests using Ranorex.  I have touched a max of 50 lines of code while being here and most of those were copy and paste.  I have told my boss that I would like more coding assignments and he said he would try to find me something and basically put me on another software that doesn't involve coding, and told me I should like it because it is more technical.

I knew I should of left about 6 months ago when I started to feel some what depressed working here but stuck it out.  Now I'm in a bind where I can barely get myself to go to work everyday cause I hate it so much, not really because of the job specifically but because I feel like I wasted 4 or 5 years of my life getting a degree to end up here. I feel like my skills have diminished significantly as a software engineer as well being here and I barely remember how to program at all.

I have debated going back to school to get my masters to specialize in an area, but I missed this years deadline to apply and I wouldn't be able to start school until next fall.  I feel a little bad about trying to get another job if I just plan to leave for school in a year anyways, but  I really don't think I can stay at this company that long without feeling really down about myself.

I'm not completely sure what I should do to get away from this job.  I feel like I have nothing to show on my resume and no good programming skills to showcase since I haven't gotten to work on any projects in such a long time, and I come home feeling so upset about work that I can't get myself to code very much on the side. I feel like I just don't know how to program anymore. I know I should probably power through that feeling but I would like some advice on what you guys would suggest I do to get out of this predicament.

TLDR: Hate my job because I am losing my skills as a programmer. It is making me depressed.  Not sure what to do. Please point me in the right direction."
46fxou,0,2016-02-18,Advice for a Local Internship Please,knokout64,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/46fxou/advice_for_a_local_internship_please/,"So back in November of last year I applied for an internship at a local software company. It would have been part time, and I would work my way from automated test scripts to writing code for their many products. This isn't a big company, but one of the bigger ones in my area. 

Well I had a phone interview, and then an in person one which I understood to be a tour since I was already likely to get the role. I got shown around, and no actual questions were asked by the interviewer. The phone interview was my only formal interview. I was told that the only thing I was waiting on for an offer was some new year budget approvals and then I would be all set to start in January. I waited excitedly but an offer never came. I tried calling and emailing, but got no responses. It was disappointing to say the least.

Well, now the company posted the position back for the internship.  I'm not sure if I should take the hint and move on, or try to apply for it again. I understand they don't have to tell me no, but it just seemed like such a sure thing. It seems that if they still needed somebody and still wanted to bring me on they would have just called me instead of posting the position again. Would I be annoying by reapplying, or would it be in my best interests?"

He crossed his legs; his black-on-black tailored suit looked completely out of place on a dingy sidewalk. ""Well, being the king of hell, you have a lot of duties. You lose sight of the real fun. People mistake me for some big evil monster, but my only sin was loving too much. I'm doing this to remember the joy behind it all. Watching your species fail and sign over their souls to me is utterly delicious. It's an ingenious way to avenge my removal from above.""
-
""You're quite a twisted son of a bitch. Aren't you?"" I laughed inappropriately and lit another cigarette; I needed it to soothe over my worries. I wasn't scared of him, I should have been, but I wasn't. I was going to die anyway, so what was the point of even living in fear.
-
""You're rather peculiar and I can't say that I've come across a soul as brazen yours. Why don't you fear Me? When people call me a son of a bitch, I usually tend to burn them alive. Something about crisp flesh that drives my hounds beyond themselves."" He pulled the cigarette from my lips again and ground it into the pavement with the heel of his perfectly shone, black shoe. 
-
I rolled my eyes and threw up my hands in forfeit; I was too exhausted to have the smoker's argument right now. ""Because I don't see the point. If you were going to kill me, you would have done it the first time we met. And, if you did choose to serve me up to your puppies, I'm sure they'd enjoy what they bit into. There's more than enough to feed a nation on these bones.""
-
""You do have a point there. Well April, I don't have much time to spare, so what will it be?""
-
""Oh you mean the price I'm asking for my soul?""
-
""Your contract, yes."" He stood up and elegantly dusted the filth from his suit. 
-
""How long before you collect?""
-
""5 years.""
-
""How will you collect?""
-
""Now that's a surprise. I can't give away all my party tricks. Now can I? Come on, hurry it up. I have other things to get through tonight.""
-
""Tsk tsk and here I thought you were a gentleman. Okay, may I please have these jackasses off of my case, my designer empire successfully up and running, and most importantly, the safety of my loved ones. I don't want your little puppets trying to do business with my family.""
-
""Is that all?"" He looked at me, his liquid eyes urging me to say something else. 
-
""Fine, it's stupid to even ask you, of all people for this, but I'd like to have a shelter for all kinds of stray animals, and enough resources to look after them all."" I could feel the confusion and disapproval radiating from him. I shrugged and looked at the pavement, ""what? I really love animals. They're better than humans.""
-
""I did not see the animal thing coming. You are quite ....interesting.. Aren't you? It's a wonder why I don't see you with anyone resembling normality."" He rubbed his chin as if mentally going through my terms and deciding the value of each item, then smiled at me. ""It's a piece of cake. Now to close the deal.""
-
""Where do I sign?"" I know, this was the worst thing I could have done. But let's face it. I was depressed. I didn't have anything in my life, and I needed something to come along and make things easier. I didn't care about the price; I was emotionally and physically exhausted from the lackluster life id lived. It was time to make a change. And it just so happened that Lucifer came along and offered it up on a silver platter. Five years wasn't so bad. At least I wouldn't have to endure my current bullshit any longer.
-
""April, you're making a deal with the devil himself. That in itself is not a contract signed by ink, or blood. It's closed by the combining of two bodies. One being a derivative of hell and the other - human. It's the complete and utterly forbidden act that taints the human soul to its core."" He folded his arms across his chest and looked at me; pleased with his argument.
-
""Are you hitting on me or something? Because that's out of the question. You can't possibly close a deal like that. That's not even a proper policy. If this is a business deal, then that's definitely sexual harassment. What's the number for Hell's Human Resources Department again?"" I stood up slowly and relied heavily on my seemingly bad attempt to provide comedic relief for a somewhat fatal agreement. 
-
He raised his eyebrows, ""oh and making a deal with Satan, in some dodgy alleyway, is proper policy?""
-
I rolled my eyes and sighed, annoyed at his valid point. He *was* right. This wasn't exactly some handshake and 'initial here'  kind of contract. This was a full blown 'handing over my soul' kind of contract. ""Is it mandatory with all the salesmen of hell?""
-
""No, theirs is usually sealed with a blood pact. Being the devil has it's perks."" He grinned mischievously, and shifted his weight slightly.
-
Just my luck, why couldn't one of those average salesmen have sought me out? Why did it have to be *him*. There was just one problem. Well no, truthfully, there were a number of problems with this situation, but I forced them all to the back of my mind and jumped head first off of a waterfall. There were two possible endings: I would swim or I would crack my skull on the rocks below and die. The only problem that seemed to nag at my lips was that I was a virgin and, before he pitched up, I was going to die that way. It's not to say that being a virgin is wrong and weird. It's just that I had never gotten around to being intimate with someone. And now, here I was, selling my soul, sleeping with the devil, and seeing gay porn in the form of Broc and Corle. It was a night of firsts. What the fuck was I getting myself into?
I cleared my throat getting ready to speak, ""Uhm so how does it work?""
-
He looked at me disbelievingly , ""the acceptance of the contract?""
-
I shifted uncomfortably; awkwardly folding my arms and stuttering as I formed words, "" N..no..NO of course not. I know what that is. I have sex all the time, hah I mean when am I *ever* not having sex? It's a wonder I can walk properly after all that...s...ss..sex"" I trailed off, just making things worse. I sighed and forced myself off of the topic, ""I meant when do things start happening?"" He was laughing at me. The friggin devil was laughing at me. I saw hints of red develop in the sea of green present in his eyes. 
-
""Oh well of course that's what you meant. What, with all the sex you're having, it's a wonder how you even remember to formulate sentences."" His tone was sarcastic and condescending and it irritated me. I shot a deathly stare at him. He finally got the hint and stopped laughing. Honestly, who knew the devil was such a dick? ""Volatile, aren't you? Well everything happens after the contract has been finalized.""
------------------------------------
------------------------------------
I won't go into deep, sordid details regarding my ""first time"" or reveal Lucifer's mannerisms and techniques in the bedroom; because, well....that's a bit too personal and I'm still trying to figure out how I feel about the whole situation. I will say this however, they call him the inventor of temptation for a reason. An *extremely* valid reason.
-
""And that seals the deal. Any questions April?"" His voice was sultry and husky as he spoke. He propped himself up on his elbow and looked down at me. His body was surprisingly warm, and tender to the touch; each part of it perfectly designed and hand crafted. The warmth in his caresses had taken me by surprise, and he had actually been gentler with his advances once he noticed that I had in fact, never been intimate with anyone before him; and had no clue what I was doing. He had guided me patiently through each motion as a lover would. At one point I had forgotten who he really was and saw him as just that - an intense lover.
-
My innards were in turmoil and my mind had started a war within itself. What the hell had I done? I was close to hyperventilating and tried to calm myself down. I blinked up at the ceiling, gripping my black duvet over my breasts; suddenly self conscious. My parents were away. My parents were away and instead of drinking till I passed out, like a normal human being, I was screwing the devil; *and* selling my soul. Dad would be soooooo proud. Hmm...... dad would lose his mind. That thought somehow made me want to do it all over again. I smiled up at the ceiling, lazily turning to look at those liquid lava eyes. ""A few. Your eyes have changed color.""
-
""Yes, I know. They change with my mood. What color are they now?""
-
""Orange. They were green before with hints of red, but now they look like lava.""
-
""Ahh green is when I'm calm and amused. Red speckles are when I'm enjoying myself and orange is when I'm excited.""
-
""Why are you exci......"" I looked away, noticing a cloaked figure standing in the far side of the room. It was just watching us. The musty woolen cloak hung lifelessly over it's body, shielding every part of it from my view. I could see absolutely nothing, just deep black spaces where his hands and face should be. It was as if a cloak had come to life on it's own will. Wide eyed and panicking, I backed up against Lucifer, speaking fast and tripping over my words, ""What the hell is that? Where did it come from? Can you see it? What the hell is going on here!?"" I don't even know why I had sought comfort in the devils arms, it just happened. Similarly to a reflex- I didn't control it.
-
""Calm down April, he is your little helper from hell."" He spoke calmly, stroking his hand down my arm. I was not expecting him to be this attentive to my needs. He was turning out to be a kinder person than the usual human ones. 
-
""*THAT* does not look like a helper. That looks like the grim reapers boss! This was not mentioned in the terms of our contract."" I huffed at him, shoving him away from me and keeping a cautious eye on the hooded stranger.
-
""He is your helper, because he is your reminder. As the years go by, he will get closer. Reminding you of the deal you've made with me and the time you have left. Nobody will see him besides you. I assure you.""
-
""And you failed to mention my creepy stalker before? That was honestly a son of a bitch move.""
-
""I am the devil after all."" He clicked his fingers and the figure was gone. His lips curled into a smile as he kissed my lips with his, whispering softly, ""He's gone now, it's just you and I here. Shall we go over the contract a few more times?"" His fingers tangled themselves in my hair. 
-
Somewhat relieved that my creepy stalker was gone, and distracted by the calmness that dripped from his every word; I egged him on a little. ""So do your eyes change to orange with every contract you sign?""
-
""Surprisingly not. Not every contract I sign is with an attractive young woman with a razor sharp wit and intelligent mind. It's mostly just old, graying men wishing for money, youth, big dicks and dozens of young, bouncy girlfriends. In those cases, I resort to the blood pact to sign off on the deal. His arm slid around my lower back, pulling me against him.
-
""My gosh, the Devil is one helluva smooth talker."" 
------------------------------------
------------------------------------
It's been 4years and 11months since I signed the contract with Lucifer. He has visited me at least once every 2 weeks, apparently to check on the progress of my remaining time. It usually always ends with us reviewing my contract over and over again. Oh shut up, I know what you're saying behind your screen, and I know. It's completely ridiculous to sleep with the devil. Let alone *keep sleeping* with him on a regular basis. But, in my defense, the temptation is downright impossible to resist. And he's just, *so* mouthwateringly good.
------------------------------------
Over the years, my business has flourished and my designs can be seen spearheading the best of the best fashion shows. Corle and Broc have gotten married (I know, I didn't see that coming either) and my dad, has finally warmed up to me. He's even gone so far as to say he's proud of me. My favorite of all - The animal shelter is doing splendidly, each and every one of our little children are well fed, played with and treated. Good things aside, the cloaked figure has slowly been closing the distance between us. As time has passed by, he's been muttering things in a different language, seemingly chanting the same things over and over again. I assume it's some sort of reminder. Similar to an alarm clock, except this one doesn't have a snooze button. 
------------------------------------
The colours have started to fade slowly. Once bright green leaves, have now dulled to lifeless black smudges over the years. I've started seeing people who are trapped between life and death, lingering around aimlessly. Others who can't see them, walk straight through the souls of loved ones that have past but haven't gone to the other side yet. I Stayed at my parents' place for the weekend of my deadline, somehow all the success of my wish, has made me realize, that all I really want - is to be with my family in my final days. I laid awake under a poster of a kitten rolling around a ball of yarn, tears welling in my eyes. It was my last night and the cloaked figure was right beside me. Bending over me and partially obscuring the view of the carefree ginger kitten. I breathed in deeply, and looked at the bedside clock. Two more hours before id be dragged to hell. I sniffled and picked up Pancake. His soft purring comforting me as I wept into his fur, holding him close to me and kissing him a few more times. I couldn't imagine not seeing him ever again. I stepped aside from the cloaked figure and made my way into the backyard where Whiskers and Pudding tackled me to the ground. They coated me in their wet kisses and refused to let me stand up. After a while they settled by my side as I watched the stars above. Their soft whining a sign that they knew something was wrong. Regret bathed me as I realized - i would never see any of these things again. The cloaked figure standing by my head, chanting the loudest it's ever been, didn't seem to phase both Whiskers and Pudding. My grief drowned out the deafening noise. I couldn't let it get to me. Not yet. I cuddled each of my babies again, kissed them on their noses and dragged myself back inside. My eyes aching from the tears that fell. I needed to say goodbye to my parents. They were asleep by now. I looked at my watch, one hour remained. The chanting getting louder by the minute; it wasn't just one voice anymore. It was many. Their voices causing all the nerve endings present in each of my muscles, to tremble. 
More cloaked figures had made their way towards me. Circling me. Their voices turned from chanting to screaming. Bloodthirsty screams that pierced my ear drums. Tears streaked my face as I sunk to the floor infront of my parents' bedroom door. I started screaming, rocking back and forth on my haunches. I pleaded loudly, begging for more time to say goodbye. I couldn't believe it was almost over. I couldn't believe id traded in whatever time I had left, to settle a silly underlying feud with my dad. I knelt down, touching the floor, my body exhausted from the wailing that riddled through it. The cloaked figures started to reach out to me, their long robes covering the light above. I still couldn't see their hands. There were still no bodies beneath the woolen masses. I clung to one last hope. Lucifer. Irrational I know, but I thought that maybe I could somehow make another deal with him. 
------------------------------------
Just as the robes brushed against my body, I looked down at the floor, and closed my eyes tightly; trying in vain to drown out their maddening crescendo. I licked the tears off of my lips and pleadingly whispered, ""Lucifer please.""
I didn't expect him to come. I mean why would the devil answer a house call. It was unheard of right? Well in that moment, of being tugged back and forth, I decided that it wouldn't hurt to try. I'd be dead anyway. 
The tugging stopped, and Satan's Little Helpers were gone. I opened my eyes, breathing heavily as I cautiously looked up and down the passage. The beige walls were undisturbed. They were all gone. 
------------------------------------
I rushed back to my room, irrationally locking the door behind me and pacing frantically. I didn't know what the hell was going on and I was talking to myself. My ripped and hanging clothing, matched my tousled hair and swollen eyes. I was losing my mind. Surely I had to be losing my mind? What if it was all a hallucination, and it was my hard work that got me to where I am now? What if my mind made up the whole ordeal with Lucifer? What was real? What do I believe now? But most importantly, how do I know which version of the story to trust? My mind was a war zone; possible reasons for my demise were rocketing back and forth and ricocheting off of the perimeter of my brain.
-
""You called?"" His voice snapped me out of my thought process. I stared at his now purple eyes- a clear sign of his irritation. I looked at him briefly and continued to pace.
-
""No, no, no... You can't be real. This can't be real. My mind is playing tricks on me. I'm going insane."" I paced frantically, insanity had reared it's ugly head and obscured the line between reality and fiction.
-
""I assure you April, it's all real."" He placed his hand on my shoulder, and forced me to look at him. The purple soon faded to blue - eagerness.
-
""I'm not ready yet. I don't want to go to hell. Now yet. I'm not ready for an eternity in some overcrowded sauna."" I pulled myself away from him and chewed on my fingernails nervously.
-
""Oh it won't really be an eternity. You're my pet, so I'm offering you a choice that the others don't even have the luxury of making. You'd go through the mandatory ....lessons... And soon become an intern of hell itself. My personal intern. After which you'll graduate into the perfect student. You'll go out there, and recruit more people just like you to fill the pit with souls and troops. Think of it as climbing the corporate ladder- forever. Only in this instance, your boss would literally be the devil.""
-
""You want me to collect souls for you? Hahahaha oh that's a good one."" I started laughing again. It was clearly a joke. No way he could be serious about something as tremendous as that. Was this a figment of my imagination? 
- 
""I don't understand why you're laughing April. It's actually an easy out compared to what will happen if you refuse my kind gesture."" He sat on my bed, neatly folding his arms and watching me as I started pacing again.
-
""That's crazy. I can't. Those are innocent souls! You can't possibly expect me to just jump on the band wagon and start recruiting for you.""
-
""Innocent? Humans are far from innocent. They rape, murder, torture and steal from one another. Yet I am the bad guy for wanting to control their population."" He ran his fingers through his tousled hair, trying to keep himself from getting visibly agitated. ""Plus, If you don't, you'll get thrown into the pit and have your innards carved to pieces. At the end of it, when all that's left is complete mush, you'll be sewn back together again, only to be ripped apart in a number of different ways. Time is nonexistent in Hell, April . And considering you are my pet project, I'd be there personally to oversee it all. So, as you can see, you could choose to be my student, or choose to be my chew toy."" He smiled and shrugged nonchalantly.
------------------------------------
------------------------------------
I'd like to say that I chose the high road and endured endless torturous punishments for my crimes. But I didn't. I chose to be his student. After everything I'd been through, all the rejections; taunting and snide comments had lured me into the blackness. People were cruel. And nothing would change that. They consume and destroy everything they touch. What better punishment for their selfish nature, than an eternity in hell?
------------------------------------
He didnt kill me that night or drag me to hell for that matter , instead he trained me. I was still human. A part of me at least. A very small part at that. He let me keep that part, and the animal shelter as a reward for all the souls I've brought to him. He fed me on his blood, making me stronger each night, allowing it to fuel my blood lust and hate towards mankind. I wasn't a demon. I wasn't a vampire. I was the darkest form of life that walked the earth. I was an unrestrained human being, with no barriers to cage my mind; that fed on the suffering of others. 
Soon enough he let me do as I wished. As long as the numbers were rolling, I was free to have what I wanted and do what was necessary to have it.
------------------------------------
Human blood, was sweet. It tasted like chocolate brownies lathered in caramel sauce and doused in chocolate ice cream. It was pure heaven to me. I savored the little ones especially. They were impossibly sweeter. Lucifer doted on me, feeding my every whim and watching as I grew in experience. I could see the warmth and pride in his fixed molten gaze. The warmth that once filled my life, was now replaced with a cold, demented mind that lacked a withholding soul. 
------------------------------------
I had finally belonged. I was no longer alone. I was respected and loved for what I had done and would continue to do. Not a single judgmental glance would come my way. I was his star player and I knew it. Nothing could stop me. Not when I had this kind of power. He had appointed me as his right hand, to rule over and supervise all of his puppets that walked the Earth, while he ran Hell. A perfect harmony if you ask me. A perfect blending of sensuous chaos and lust.
------------------------------------
As I lay here on my bed, in the same black bedroom; looking up at this screen. I can't help but smile. It's clear my little toys have done me proud. If not, would any of these other stories even be here? I'm not a complete monster, I've kept my family alive and thriving; and I even visit them occasionally, similarly to what I was doing right now. Never forget where you came from, right? 
-
""Good evening April."" His seductive voice caressed my skin. This bond between us was inevitable. 
-
""What brings the royal highness himself into my little bedroom?""
-
He slid on top of me and brushed his lips along mine. ""I have a present for you.""
------------------------------------
That night, just as he uncovered my eyes, he whispered in my ear, ""happy 10th year anniversary Darling."" 
In front of me was a small house. There were three bedrooms, that housed three siblings, whose parents had died when they were very young. Apparently Lucifer had held each of their contracts. One of them had made a deal for successful careers to be thrust upon all three of them, whilst another had wanted a home to house them all; thus freeing themselves from the foster system that had failed them all those years. The remaining one, the youngest, had signed a contract that resulted in the death of their last recorded foster parents. It was said that they had endured years of abuse and torment at the hands of a seemingly average husband and wife. 
------------------------------------
They were all each other had in this world. They were beautiful young adults aged between 22 and 28. Two boys and one girl. I felt Lucifer watching me, waiting for me to notice what was going to happen. And then I saw it, the windows were opened and I could see the entire scene play out, as if on the set of a Broadway Show.
The three siblings were watching tv in the front living room, behind them was a kitchen and immediately to the right, was a bedroom. I watched excitedly as one of our puppets stood behind the couch they were on. It was the one we always used when culling the young adult population, because it never failed. There's just something so creepy about a young murderous child.
------------------------------------
It was a short, 9 year old, little girl whose skin was grey and covered in bruises and cuts. Her arms were magnificently broken at awkward angles and her legs were bowed. She was clothed in a flimsy black dress that bared torn flesh through the holes. I smiled as I admired my personal work of art. She was barefoot and the hem of her dress dripped with blood. It wasn't her own blood of course, because her wounds didn't bleed. My gaze fell onto her spectacular bloodshot eyes. One had been gauged out and dangling from it's socket, while the other was partially covered by long, thick, flowing, black hair that brushed her ankles as she walked. She had a gaping slash roaming from her ear, through to her collar bone. The skin flapped with the rhythm of her steps. In her mutilated hands, she wielded a piece of a broken mirror that was streaked with blood.
-
""Here comes the best part my love."" He whispered in my ear and stood behind me; gripping my shoulders in his hands. 
-
The young girl stepped closer to the three unsuspecting siblings, raised her hand and brought it down into the throat of the eldest boy. The sheer look of horror that crossed their faces was utterly divine. I could taste their fear. The girl had started screaming and flailing her arms frantically. The remaining boy had to drag her across to the bedroom. Locking the doors behind them. I walked up the bedroom window, watching intently. They could hear their predator scraping at their door. The boy turned to the window and saw me. He begged me to help them. His eyes grew wide as he saw a smile stretch across my face. Their bedroom door swung open, and the girl limped towards them, dragging the head of their brother behind her like a lifeless rag doll. She opened her mouth and threw her head back, shrieking with laughter and blocking their way out. 
-
""Let the sister live. She will be my own pet project."" I whispered softly over my shoulder. His warm hands grasped my hips and held me closely.
-
""Anything for my Love.""
- 
Our puppet made her way to the remaining boy and cornered him. His sister frozen with fear as she watched her carve into him like a turkey on Christmas. With each swing, I watched the sister's face. I could see it. The last inkling of faith in humanity, fading. The warmth had drained from her body. She had become the epitome of loneliness, vulnerability and anger in a matter of minutes. I could see the light in her eyes burn out and the insanity settle in; She was now ripe for the picking. 
-
I turned to lucifer and slid my arms around his neck, kissing him softly before whispering, ""You never cease to amaze me darling."" 
-
We kissed passionately. The scene unfolding behind us; a perfect background to the intensity that followed. 
------------------------------------
The young sister, ironically named Mary, would later become my apprentice, and soon my colleague. Over the years we have watched as our puppets stalked and tormented ""innocent"" people, and drained the humanity from their very being; a recipe that ensured the best possible apprentices suited for life in Hell. After all, my priority, was to recruit only the best as Hell's troops. 
------------------------------------
Together, we came up with ingenious methods in trapping the human soul and ripping the faith from their pathetic bodies. I never let her feed though. Not just yet. I was depending solely on the unpredictability and pure irrationality of the human mind. Its remarkable just how fragile the mind is. All that it requires is a little nudge in the right direction, and there you have it - The Perfect Weapon. So I ask you again, can you truly trust your mind? Or would you rather risk living in the unknown, where nightmares are often written of as little tricks of the imagination?"

I've gotten into the master's program and applied to a couple scholarships, but if it means putting off getting a job for 18 months and possibly having to take out a (small) loan, is it worth it?

The main benefits I see are a chance to learn more advanced material across a fairly broad area of computer science and the ability to take on another summer internship which will let me get more variety once again. I have no undergrad loans (university financial aid) but if I don't get the scholarships I've applied for, I'll probably have to take out a loan."

Here is a (long) story detailing my current situation:
I am a junior at my university's honors college (studying Business Management and pursuing a certificate in Intl. Trade &amp; Investment). I have a 3.59 GPA, very involved with a student-led Investment Portfolio managing real money (E-Board member), and other personal entrepreneurial project. Currently, I am being onboarded for a big investment/private bank as an intern down here in FL with the possibility of making the position a full-time one for the summer. I had two interviews with them, and two days after the second interview, they called me saying that they want to onboard me and give me an official offer. So, they sent me an e-mail with the onboarding application. Here, they are asking me to list my employment history (volunteer positions as well if I choose) along with supervisor names and contact information.

Here is my issue...

I left my last paid job (outside of private tutoring, which I can't reference because I am not allowed to list my clients as references) near the end of October. I was working at my state's largest utility as a customer service representative while taking 15 credits in college. I had started over the summer (May) and at that point I knew it was definitely something I didn't want to do for the rest of my life. When the school year started, I started learning a lot more about what I wanted to do (business and finance), and my classes became a lot more demanding. On top of that, the divorce that my parents are currently going through started getting really bad. My dad was the bread winner of the household, and he cheated on my mom and moved away for a promotion my mom was going to go up state with him for. He left her with all of the debts since she had good credit and had her use her 401k to pay off the debt while he hid his for the longest time. He is still paying the mortgage, but he stopped helping me out financially and is trying to force my mom to sell the house. At this point, I started to get sick from all of the pressure coming from home, school, and dealing with customers at work.

At the end of September, I started to get interviews for a lot of big finance firms (got flown out for New York for a BO gig at one of CS/GS/JPM/ML). I explained to my supervisor the situation, and how I needed to take/swap those Monday and Tuesdays so I could have the days off. While being recruited for the on-campus call center job I was at, other students and I were told about how people moved from their positions to other big companies, and how they understood that we are students pursuing bigger dreams than call center jobs. So, if we had something school-related or internship-related that we wanted to pursue, we could always ask for the time off. The problem is, my supervisor considered me being flown out to NYC for an interview as ""vacation"" and wanted me to use my remaining vacation hrs for them. Management declined me request, so I went to the main recruiter who made the promise of the time off for important circumstances (coincidentally he was my supervisor's boss) and he completely understood and overrode the declined request for me so I could take time off for the summer internship interviews.

Shortly after, I left the customer service job. There was too much stress going on in my life, and it was being reflected in my call center metrics. While my quality and soft skills were good, my time available/unavailable, taking unauthorized breaks (during the time my parents were feuding really bad, I had to miss a day that went down as an unscheduled ""occurrence"" because I got a fever and the next day I tested positive for UTI, not to mention, during training over the summer I needed to miss time for oral surgery, and even with two weeks notice it still went down as an unscheduled ""occurrence""). School was taking it's toll on me, and I was coming in later than 8AM (my start time). The problem with this is that we had a call center metric that measures the first 30 minutes of your shift, whether you are there or not. Eventually, I left, knowing that I not only wanted to deal with the stresses in my personal life, but also wanted to gain more experience in finance. My supervisor's boss understood completely why I left and even offered me a letter of recommendation if I ever needed one. He loved how good my quality was on my calls, and understood that I had more in store for my future with the interviews I had. My immediate supervisor was more focused on my metrics and pretty much said I had to leave for my sake because my performance was getting worse as time went on with the situation at home. Some other stuff went on that forced me to leave (my university questioned some of this part-time on-campus job's practices with their student recruiting, work schedules, broken promises, etc. but that's a story for another day) but at the end, he completely understood whereas my immediate supervisor wasn't so cool with my performance leading up to that time.

Fast forward 4 months later, I need to get a reference/confirmation of employment from my former company. I e-mailed and called the supervisor who liked me (my former boss's boss) a week ago, and he hasn't gotten back to me. Since this onboarding application is time-sensitive (needs to be done by 2/23), I went over to my immediate supervisor and asked her if I could use her as a point of contact. She said I definitely could for employee verification, but she questioned whether or not they would ask her about my performance (tardiness/metrics) in the last couple months leading up to my leave. I have no idea what they'll ask during the onboarding or what the two background checkers would want to find out, so I told her that I didn't know what they'd ask if they contact her.

My question is: should I go ahead and put my former immediate supervisor's information, since her boss (the one who completely understood my situation when I left and even offered a reference when the time came) hasn't returned my call or e-mail? I have until 2/23 to complete the onboarding application with former supervisor information, but the firm wants to go ahead and onboard me ASAP. My former immediate supervisor did not think of highly as me as her boss did and would surely give the finance firm her piece of how my performance declined in the last month or so if pressed about certain things, but at this point I may have no choice but to put her as the contact reference for my last job given the time constraints. Or, do I go ahead and put the guy who liked me more's information even though he hasn't returned my e-mails/phone calls in over a week? What should I do?

Thank you in advance!"

Was just wondering whether I could get your thoughts on what my best course of action is.

I'm a senior at my 'average/nothing special public school' in the midwest with no real internship experience. I'm thinking that I want to get into Software Engineering after I graduate. 

However, after this spring semester I'll still need to take English 102 and Speech 101 to graduate (kek) in December 2016. But I also have the option of staying at my school over the summer, finishing off my those two classes then, graduate, and then just look for a full time job. 

Do you guys think this would be superior to landing an internship over the summer (hopefully) and taking the extra semester in the fall? I don't really have any significant projects done at the moment (still in Senior Project and Software Engineering courses) and with no internship experience I was worried that finding a good full time job would be difficult.

Thanks!"

Promise. I know there have been a good number of find-a-job posts lately, but I thought this was something worth showing people as it isn't manually updated and can be used in the future when people want to apply to internships, new grad positions, or anything else, really.

Because Lever and Greenhouse make applying for jobs crazy-easy, you can use Google's operators to find all the jobs indexed by Google that match whatever sort of requirements you want. Some quick and useful ideas:

It should be obvious enough how to manipulate the query to suit your needs; for example, maybe you're good at Rails and you want a [Rails job](https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1&amp;q=site%3Ajobs.lever.co%2F*+OR+site%3Aboards.greenhouse.io%2F*+software+OR+engineer+OR+developer+%22rails%22+OR+%22ruby%22&amp;oq=site%3Ajobs.lever.co%2F*+OR+site%3Aboards.greenhouse.io%2F*+software+OR+engineer+OR+developer+%22rails%22+OR+%22ruby%22).

Right now, I can graduate with only CS next semester by taking a single class. It would be a really relaxed semester (literally 1 class), I could pay for it out of pocket (no loans) with the money I make from my internship this summer, and I would graduate in December. For a Math minor, I can tack on 1 additional class next semester, still probably pay out of pocket (albeit quite a bit more), and still have a somewhat chill semester. To graduate with both majors, I would have to stay an additional semester, take out more loans(I'm ~$20k deep right now), and take 3 classes both semesters, or some combination of 4 and 2. 

I'm curious as to what you guys think. Would it be really beneficial for me to finish both? I'll have 2 internships by the time I graduate (one at a small defense contractor working on drones, and this summer I'll be at a prop trading firm), great experience, and a great GPA regardless. I'm just wondering if more doors would be open to me down the road if I finished out both majors (I'm thinking cool data science jobs or something). I'm also considering just doing CS, but taking 2 or 3 extra CS classes I don't need to graduate. Open to any and all opinions. "

I'm familiar with most of the concepts as I have taken some introductory networking classes, hardware classes, and I'm finishing up this cybersecurity class on technologies and policy management. I've found some great resources here as well as Messer and Mike Meyers that I do plan on going through over the weekends.

I'm sure I could get A+, but I'm not sure about Sec+ and Net+ because I see there are people here that have been in the industry longer than I have and still struggle so I'm not sure if it's even worth the money if I'm probably going to fail.

Considering CompTIA are typically the gateway and lowest tier cert, I might as well be getting them eventually."
46ratl,0,2016-02-20,Honesty in job postings/how do I move forward in the face of discrimination?,GretchenR,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/46ratl/honesty_in_job_postingshow_do_i_move_forward_in/,"The following is an open letter I recently posted to mainstream media editors and their human resources management teams. Although it is directed to them specifically, it is reflective of a systemic problem that covers the job market spectrum. My questions to anyone kind enough to respond here are what do I do? Go back to living a double life? Give up on my career in the hope of finding one more amenable to my identity (if it even exists)? I am at my wits end. 

Let’s be completely honest with each other for a moment.

I wish to my ever-loving God I had not been born a transgender individual. I wish that reparative therapy had worked, or that I had stayed closeted or that I had succeeded in an attempt at suicide in 2001 so that I never would have transitioned to female.

It is killing my career.

I have put in two-and-a-half years as a journalist covering the LGBT community in Chicago. I have already received two major awards and I’m up for three this year. My investigative work set a woman on the road to freedom after sitting in the Cook County Jail for four years without a trial. My features on individuals, politics, protests, crimes arts and events helped garner the paper consistently high social media shares. I organized a job fair for LGBT youth, forced Rahm Emanuel off-script during a pre-election interview along with the senior adviser to Benjamin Netanyahu when I was covering LGBT life in Israel and I was constantly asked to sit on panel discussions thereby elevating and furthering my paper’s name and reputation.

So, in the fall of 2015, I figured it was time to make the move to mainstream media. How hard could it be? Just because the stories I write for my current paper have an LGBT focus doesn’t mean I cannot cover or pitch those that don’t. Just because I have grilled everyone from the mayor to state and federal representatives to aldermen on issues affecting the LGBT community does not mean I can’t do exactly the same thing on a broader spectrum.

My one-page, succinct cover letter was never constructed without taking the time to thoroughly research the publication and even the person who gave the addressee her/his first job in journalism before asking for the same faith once demonstrated in her/him.

Most of the time, it was never even acknowledged.

I didn’t worry at first. I figured that my application was getting buried under a deluge of feisty Columbia grad students all willing to work for one economy-sized bowl of Spaghettios per annum.

But then those few who did interview me always had the same concern. “Can you write about something other than LGBT issues?”

I never even had to pause before answering that question.

I wasn’t out as transgender when I applied for my last job and my resume had a 90 percent response rate. Now I was down to three out of every hundred at best.

Of course, it suddenly occurred to me. My name is now all over Google. “Transgender journalist wins Lisagor Award”, “Gretchen Hammond transcends as transgender journalist”- all red flags from the top to bottom of even the most cursory search.

So I tried a social experiment.

I sent my cover letter, resume and clips to two major organizations advertising on journalismjobs.com. After two weeks, I submitted exactly the same cover letter, resume and clips only this time with everything, including the byline on my clips, changed back to the name I was assigned at birth. Thanks to some equally crafty alterations using a PDF editor, I took out all the LGBT references in the articles and even gave my newspaper an alias.

Imagine my surprise and dismay at our hyperactively evolving, but supposedly progressive profession when, without fail, the human resources manager or editor in question tried to get in touch with Jonathon asking for an interview.

When I called them out on it, I received defensive responses that were variations on the following theme:

“Rest assured, we at ___________________ do not discriminate against LGBT individuals. As a matter of fact we have a transgender employee. We intend to launch a full investigation into what happened here.”

The rest was silence.

Yesterday it happened again. The good news is I am back to a 90 percent response rate. The bad news is there is no going back. 

So respectfully I request that if you don’t want to hire a transgender reporter just say so in your job posting. 

Most of your publications are in states that do not have gender identity discrimination protections anyway. You’re not going to be on the wrong end of litigation. Are you worried about the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)? Sure, they have a few cases meandering aimlessly through regarding gender identity but, right now, it's all about interpretation so you won't need to lawyer up beyond a free, 15-minute consultation with 1-800-SEWERS: specializing in personal injury and defamation on the Food Network.

Are you afraid that one of the aforementioned feisty Columbia grads at Buzzfeed is going to pick up on it and give you 800 words worth of a click-baited dressing down?

Yes it will get shared and you’ll probably get some nasty comments from the armchair-activists who float around social media looking for an argument they can call their own. 

The Human Rights Campaign (HRC) might get off their collective, well-suckled, lackadaisical asses to send out a half-hearted press release and you might even get a persnickety call from some GLAAD intern who has been unceremoniously yanked away from a perfectly enjoyable Hulu binge-fest of Grey’s Anatomy in order to tell you what a naughty no-no it is to discriminate and to point you in the direction of their transgender 101 guidelines updated from about three hours ago.    

That is until Caitlyn Jenner, Donald Trump, Ted Cruz or the South Dakota legislature provide them with another scandalous, bright and shiny object.

So what do you care? In fact, 24-hours later, is anyone even going to remember?

So just be honest. What are you so afraid of? Moreover, what are you ashamed of? Transgender individuals are en vogue right now as the enemies-of-freedom, so why not jump on the bandwagon instead of sneaking between the wheels? 

When it comes down to it,  you are worse than the HR folks at the Westboro Baptist Church. At least they are up-front enough for me to know that an application for a position in their public relations department might not make it past the red-flag keywords they’ve programmed into their self-aware Taleo human resources version 9.0.

So I am simply asking you to have the courage and honesty to add “must NOT be transgender” at the end of your job requirements. Hey, you can even use microscopic print or a voice-over by some guy who used to be an auctioneer for Red Bull.

That said, if you are willing to give me a chance, I can assure you I have been through every last surgical procedure so I am not going to cost your company or cause lasting damage your health insurance rates. I look and sound like a woman so I am not going to make anyone uncomfortable in the rest room. If it does bother anyone, believe me in the past eight-years I’ve learned how to hold my bladder and, if you are worried about the reaction of your readers, I will legally change my name and so erase every single one of my past achievements.

As Shakespeare might have put it, I have eyes, senses, organs, dimensions and passions which extend to walking my dogs, reading voraciously and working out to episodes of The West Wing—only recently discovered because there was nothing else on Netflix outside of the SciFi Channel's latest re-edit of Sharknado's Greatest Bits. The rest of my life is my work.

I am just as human as you but don’t for a minute imagine that a 73 percent job discrimination rate nationwide towards transgender people leaves any room for personal integrity, dignity or the uncompromising journalist. 

Giving up at least two of those traits is therefore a fair trade. It's clearly either that or find a glue-on mustache and go back to living a double life. 

I just want to do the work I have proven time and time again that I do so well and that I love. I want to engage in the continual learning process that drives me every single day. I want to satiate my addiction to journalism.

That’s all.

With what I am willing to sacrifice on the altar of appearances, with how far I have come yet how far I am willing to go, why is that asking too much?

If any of you have the courage and honesty to respond to this post, then I would be as pleasantly surprised as I am currently in awe as to just how hypocritical some iron-plated defenders of the First Amendment actually are.  Of course, I could name names but I just can't seem to sink to their level.

I wonder how we stack up against each other morally?"
46raya,12,2016-02-20,What's your opinion on the level of trust with new IT employees?,cosidian,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/46raya/whats_your_opinion_on_the_level_of_trust_with_new/,"Yesterday, I was offered a full-time position (As a desktop support analyst) at my internship, starting once I graduate. Yay! It comes with the assumption that, given an appropriate amount time and displaying some level of competence, I'll be given bigger and better duties related to the AD, file servers, routers, scripting, hardware projects, etc. in addition to my regular duties. With any luck, it'll turn into a jr. sysadmin position.

While discussing the details of this with the sysadmin at my branch, he mentioned it took him 3 months before he even got access to the firewall / router passwords. Keeping in mind, he's currently the only sysadmin in this part of the country for the company. Our office has about 90-100 users, all of which deal with some confidential information about our customers. The head office is 2300km away. He was hired as a sysadmin.

I was a little taken aback by what he said. Is that considered normal for most companies? I would assume, during the course of your normal duties as a systems administrator, you might need access to those devices. Not having access to those devices might impact your ability to do your job (At least for that 3 month period). 

What you guys think? Do you trust your new employees right off the bat with your IT systems, or do you wait before introducing them slowly. How long do you wait until leaving them to their own devices?

   So I'm a first year comp sci student at a fairly highly ranked uni(top 25 in the world- although I know this doesn't mean anything really). I'm halfway through my first comp sci class and doing very well(80 average 90+ in my comp sci course), but since it is in a stripped down functional language I know I need to start learning a real language on the side. I really want to get an internship as soon as I have enough experience, so I'd like to know the best route to take outside of classes.

I am interested in learning swift and making iOS apps but from what I've read(on this sub/elsewhere) it seems like Java/c/c++ are more sought after for internships? Is this true? I will be taking a Java course next term so maybe it would be smarter to put all my effort into that? Or would it be better to know both? 

Also, at what point should I start applying for internships and not be wasting my time?

46sla6,2,2016-02-20,Wanting to leave my PhD program. Mistake?,Tmrmcc,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/46sla6/wanting_to_leave_my_phd_program_mistake/,"Now I know only I can decide what to do with my life; I am just hoping to get some outside perspective.

So here's the scoop. I graduated with my BS in Biochemistry May of 2015 - almost a year ago. I started working in a lab specializing in plant biochemistry/metabolomics as an undergraduate Jan. of 2014 so all in all I went into grad school with a little over a year of lab experience. It was very good experience as well; very hands-on from the very beginning and I was given my own project and was able to work fairly autonomously. There was even promise of a first-author publication from my research, although the manuscript is still in the works.

I felt pressured into graduate school. I knew from the very beginning that I had no desire to go into academia but from the endeavors of my colleagues I convinced myself that getting a PhD would be the next logical route and would be a jumpstart for a solid industry career. But honestly, I chose grad school as the next step because I did not know what else to do or what I wanted to do with my life (I know, one of the worst reasons to go for a PhD!). I guess I convinced myself that I was passionate about plant biochemistry so that is what I stuck with. I applied to 5 PhD programs and interviewed and was accepted in to 4/5. Do to the nature of my personal life (serious relationship etc.) I chose to stay at my undergraduate institution and join a program which actually housed my undergraduate lab. Much of the pressure I felt to go to grad school and, specifically, join this particular program, was from my undergrad advisor actually. 

Since I’ve been here, I’ve been looking for reasons to stay, and something to be passionate about. But it is just not happening for me. I am finishing up my third rotation and I’ve realized that none of them felt like a good fit for me. My first rotation advisor gave me no direction and left me floundering while expecting me to develop an LC-MS method with no prior method development experience. No one in the lab was experienced enough working with this specific piece of equipment as well to give me much useful help. It was 8 weeks of pulling teeth and feeling unproductive. I really liked the advisor and lab members of my second rotation, and gained some good much needed molecular biology experience but I was very uninterested in the overall scope of the research.

I was really hoping that my final rotation would go better than it has been but it has been the least productive yet, and I do not really like the lab atmosphere. It has been 5 weeks and I’ve yet to do any lab work. There is a policy that you are not allowed to do any experiments until you watch someone perform the experiment, do the experiment together, and then have the experienced person watch you. Great! I think that is a great idea! But there has been ~0 structure regarding making this happen. As a result, I have been learning nothing aside from the 4-5 papers I have been reading each week. And that has grown very old, very fast. Oh, I guess I should mention too that the program I am in is very unique in that classwork is very deemphasized. We are only required to take 1 class (period; not per semester), and are encouraged to take only what we feel will fill any necessary gaps to reach our career goals. I probably would have been better suited for something with more structure…

Since I started in this program, I had been questioning myself as to whether or not it was the right decision to go to grad school. But I wanted to give my rotations a chance and try to find somewhere to see myself for the next 5 years. But I just can’t. I see the passions and experiences of the other students in my program, and most of them have a Master’s already, took some time to work after undergrad, or had an internship prior to starting in this program. I just do not see myself as being ready for the commitment needed to be a successful PhD candidate.

Finally, my boyfriend of 4 years and I are planning to get engaged in the next couple of months and he will likely be moving after he finishes his Master’s in Mechanical Engineering. If he has his way, he wants to move to the SF Bay area. I obviously do not want this to be a deciding factor in my career choices, but keeping this in mind along with everything else, it is really starting to feel like the perfect time to work in industry for a bit and then see where the wind takes us before I commit to anything else. I feel like I can spend time in a more structured 8-5/9-5 work setting and really reflect on how I want my career to take shape and maybe even go back to school later on. 

I’m almost certain at this point that quitting is the way to go for me, but I am curious to see what others think. Am I just getting swept up by imposter syndrome? Maybe I am just looking for validation, I don't know. Thank you for reading.

Some background on me:
Recently, I went through a rough break up with my girlfriend of 3.5 years who I've been with since high school. I really appreciate the time we had together, but juggling my commitment to her with classes, internships, and staying close to friends that go to Texas State, I became complacent with not becoming a part of this great community in UT Austin.

Now with so little time left in my career, I am looking for advice for joining student organizations for meeting friends and, possibly, even try dating in the college scene. As for what type of organizations I'm looking for... um... try me? A few things about me: I'm a Christian, I love STEM, sports, and video games, I'm honestly kinda funny sometimes, I love volunteering when I can, and I want to start going to parties.

Disclaimer: I know there are online resources for sorting through all this, but I don't know where to start and would like to hear more personal statements about your recommendations.

Now, having sort of the minimal experience that I've had, where would be some good places to pick up a bit more knowledge? Cybersecurity, massive computer infrastructures, and things of the sort really interest me, but I know *nothing* about them. 

I know there's going to be internships and college (and that time is coming along for me quite soon) but I have no idea where to start prior to that point. I'd like to brush up a bit more before then and get ahead of the curve.

The third (and last) year of my degree, however, is lingering on my mind, and I would really like to finish it.

However, that's proving to be difficult. My university doesn't offer much in the way of timetable flexibility, and though they record lectures there's things like workshops, tutorials, etc. that I'd miss out on due to it being in the middle of the work day. Additionally, I've discovered that there's a *lot* of group-work assignments in all of my third year classes, and I feel like I'd be hindering my team mates by not being present for some of the class content.

I've been considering transferring to a university that does a lot of online/distance content, such as [Deakin University](http://www.deakin.edu.au/study-at-deakin/find-a-course/computer-science) or [Charles Sturt University](http://www.csu.edu.au/courses/bachelor-of-computer-science) (I'm Australian). I'm not sure about the quality of these courses/universities, though, or if the ""prestige"" of an institution even matters, particularly when I'll have a few years work experience up my sleeve by the time I finish.  Problem here is that I'm not sure how much credit will transfer over and things like that, so it might increase the time I have left at uni.

tl;dr: Stay at my local university and deal with the stress of missing out on course content, or change to a more distance education-friendly university and possibly stretch out my degree a little longer? Or something else?"

46v5f9,7,2016-02-21,Typical Teenager issue..?,gooby_pls2,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/46v5f9/typical_teenager_issue/,"Disclaimer- I am 17 years old, and this is all over the place.
Since my freshman year of high school, I've tried to find what it is I would love to do for the rest of my life. My logic is/was that if I found that in high school, I could get an early start on whatever my passion turned out to be and maybe become great at it. Reading around, it seems like starting when I did was even too late, as a ton of great people started before they hit double digits. I played soccer for 12 years, I still do. I played competitively for about 4 years and last year I transferred from a team I had played on for 9 years into one of the top teams in my state and in the nation only to find that I had loved playing with that team more than I loved playing soccer. Except I don't even know if that's true, I think I might've just loved to be the best. Either way, after years of training hard outside of ""regular"" practice to become better and better, I gave up in only six months on that team because I dreaded going to practice so much that I would go so far as to drive all the way there only to decide I was sick. I don't know if this means soccer isn't my passion, but if it is, I fear it is too late now. It seemingly was always too late for me in soccer- I went competitive a year late, my birthday was in the later part of the year so I was younger than most people, and I never really got into it until that final year. I love the sport but even if I did want to do it for the rest of my life I don't think that's an option now, and I am not backing down from it, or I don't believe I am. I just truly don't think that is what I wanted out of life or not what I want now. Maybe I'm wrong. I do miss it but when I finally got off of that team it was such a weight lifted off of my chest. I think it was definitely for the best, the combination of that and my situation with various relationships at the time was spiraling me towards depression (I believe at least, this was a self-diagnosis completely). I'm not normally a sad person, reading this you might think I sound like I suck but I just want to make it clear that I am very happy, almost all the time. I'm just worried, because I cannot live a ""normal"" life and be satisfied. I don't think I am a special snowflake or anything along those lines, I just can't imagine ever feeling like I didn't miss out on life if I accepted some regular office job. Anyways, afterwards I tried to find something else I loved to do. My dad works in Investor Relations for a big company, so I began to learn about the stock market. Every day, I would come home from school and educate myself on economics and the workings of the stock market. My plan was to become some big-name, incredibly successful investment banker, hedge-fund manager, or something along those lines. But I knew deep down I didn't care at all about the stock market or investing, I just wanted to be rich and after landing an internship and discovering that I absolutely hated it, I dropped that as well. Then, I learned about music production. I began to produce music on my own and I really thought I had found it, I love music so much, I listen to it constantly. I was taking hours out of every day to listen to two new albums a day and use the notes I took on the production and any samples I thought were worth trying to flip into a new sound to make my own beats. Then I thought I should get into singing and rapping over my own beats (I am white and live in Suburbia, which definitely will affect how I am perceived in the industry). That is where I am at now, and I feel like I have spread myself so thin. I just don't even know if I like music production. I really do love rapping, but 17 is a very late start to what is sure to be a massive uphill battle of a career and that's if I can even begin to develop some sort of technical skill. I really thought I would have to bring in my own sort of production style like Kanye did to really stand out and make people pay attention to me in the music industry. Now I feel like I want to go into stand-up comedy. I love funny things, I've been told I am very funny by people who know me well and those who don't, I've watched countless stand-up specials and I am confident in my sense of humor. I love being funny and I know I love being funny but I just don't know if I can give up music, giving up another ""passion"" again for something I might start to get tired of in six months. And I'm scared because I don't even know where to start, I can't think of ways to practice stand-up other than watching it and writing it. I've never liked to do anything you can't practice because I like to think I am making myself better at whatever it is I love to do. I don't want to try making music and comedy, though I do love Bo Burnham, because I don't think I have enough talent in either area to be able to successfully divide my time between the two. To be clear, these aren't the only things I have tried, well, I haven't really tried stand-up, but I have tried things like programming, cooking, writing, even playing video games professionally(this didn't go very far because the time investment was just not worth it to me to spend the rest of my life in front of a screen). To be honest, I haven't found anything I would love to do if I thought I couldn't get rich from it. I've read countless self-help books (reminder that I do have friends and do have fun) and explored being an entrepreneur. I'm happy with how I look and with the relationships in my life. I just want to know what I want to do. To top it all off, I try very hard in school and do quite well, but I don't know why because I have never felt passionate about anything academic, which would be so nice because it sounds much more structured to me. All of my ""passions"" seem to involve such high risk and reward ratios. I know the top comment for this post, if there is one, is going to be something along the lines of ""calm down, you have plenty of time"" but I don't want to calm down, nor do I feel like I really have plenty of time. We have such limited time to make any kind of impact, or even have any fun with our lives, not meant in a morbid way, but like ""why not get started now?"" It really is important to me to be great at something and the longer I take to find that thing the less likely it is that I will be great. Anyways, sorry for the mess of a post this is, the run-on sentences, over-using commas, formatting, grammar, etc. I just need that off my chest and if anyone has any sort of advice or wisdom or anything I would love to hear it because I am lost right now. Thanks for reading."
46vq7j,3,2016-02-21,"My experience with ""The Creative Group.""",penguinzrocknroll,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/46vq7j/my_experience_with_the_creative_group/,"**This is a LONG rant**

Okay, so a bit of backstory about myself. I graduated last December (2015)  from William Paterson University in NJ. My degree is a Bachelor’s of Studio Arts with a concentration in Graphic Design. I also graduated with a 3.5 GPA if it matters.

Anyway, after graduating I obviously began looking around for jobs in my field on all the job searching websites like: Indeed, Monster, Dice, Snag a job, Career Builder, Zipfile, Simplyhired, and even Craig’s List. After a few months of applying and having no responses, I get very discouraged and begin to stress myself a bit. So I contact my school’s career services in hopes that they might give me advice or even place me in an internship or something like that (the “career services” website claims that they “provide employment and mentoring connections” which I can now say is untrue) . The only thing the career services helped me do is help me figure out how to word my resume and also update it so it’s current.

 The career adviser then recommended me to a place called “The Creative Group.” For those of you who don’t know, The Creative Group is a “recruiting agency” that helps place people in the art and design field with companies that their skills suit. So, my career adviser recommended me to The Creative Group of Saddle Brook NJ and  this lady named Kara, saying that she had connections with the college or something like that. So I emailed and called Kara for about a month before giving up because she never contact me back, It was only later on when I began to complain to them that I found out that Kara was on sick leave and only recently came back. And I was like wtf? Even the receptionist failed to mention that Kara wasn’t in and she didn’t offer to connect me to anyone else, instead I was leaving voicemails and emails in a person’s mailbox that wasn’t there! So fast forward a few months later, I’m still applying on my own through various job sites and attempting to freelance through Fiverr because I don’t know what else to do. Then, I get a call from The Creative Group from a different recruiter, her name was Megan. She tells me that she saw my resume online through some job finding website and was interested in talking with me in person about my qualifications and such. Obviously, I was excited to hear back from them, even if it was from a different person. So I set up to interview with Megan at the most convenient time for the both of us. I believe that the interview went over pretty well, Megan explained how The Creative Group works and how people get placed/picked for a certain job and it seemed to make sense. So I pretty much emailed her every week or every other week asking if she had anything available for me or jobs that sounded interesting to me on The Creative Group Website. She would rarely reply..and it got to the point where she didn’t respond anymore: no phone calls or emails, even though I regularly tried to get in contact with her. 

It got so bad, that I tried to reach out to a different branch of The Creative Group (In Woodbridge NJ)  just so I can talk to or get help from anyone else. Still, the results where the same, they rarely pick up their phones and almost never email you back. So, now I was dealing with two branches with the same exact results. I was really stressing myself out at this point, I was still applying to jobs on my own, only to get rejected or never called back and it felt like The Creative Group wasn’t helping me in the slightest. As a side note, before I contacted The Creative Group of Woodbridge I remember applying to a company called Winco through Indeed, they called me in for an interview and tested me on my skills with Photoshop and InDesign (I guess I was too slow with InDesign because they never called me back).. Why do I mention this? It’s because when I called the Woodbridge Creative Group, the lady, her name was Kristin asked me if I had any interviews recently. I told her about Winco, and she asked if I got that interview through the Creative Group.. Implying that job posting was in their system, but no one at the Saddle Brook Creative Group told me about it...so I told her that I found it through Indeed.
 
Continuing the story, I’m so stressed out about not having a job in my field, I’m pretty much crying myself to sleep or waking up in the middle of the night with anxiety, applying to any full time  jobs through all the job posting websites I mentioned because I can’t fall back asleep. I pretty much call The Creative Group asking to speak to the manager, his name is Sam,  and I try to hold back my tears as I explain to him all the stuff that has happened to me so far. He seems sympathetic and asks me to send my resume to him so he can mention it to all his employees and maybe they can do something about it (what a joke). I also begin contacting the complaints department for the Creative Group to complain about the Saddle Brook branch because it is the one I have dealt with the most. So the complaints department process your complaint and sends it up to corporate and someone SHOULD contact you within about 3-5 business days… So..does anyone want to guess what happened? Well.. I contacted the complaint department for a whole month (calling them once every week) because I never heard back from corporate..like ever. I even asked the people who were processing my complaints if they had the number for corporate because I was tired of complaining to them and getting nowhere.

 I was also talking to Sam a lot asking him what I should do and complaining to him about his employees Kara and Megan. It was at this point that I learned that Kara was on sick leave and Megan no longer dealt with placing people as freelance and only did “salaried” people, which meant like you had to be hired by The Creative Group first before they could place you. So obviously, I asked Sam why I couldn’t be hired by The Creative Group and be placed as salaried because I was looking for a full time job anyway.. He gave me some stupid excuse that I don’t really remember. I also remember telling him that I had a part time job, and he had the gall to tell me that it might be because of my part time job (in retail)  that I’m not getting any callbacks from his recruiters. He goes on to explain that companies want someone who can start right away (aka: you’re unemployed). 

I still think his excuse is bullshit. Anyway after a bit more complaining I get to talk to the manager of Robert Half (The Creative Group is part of Robert Half..this was in Saddle Brook too). His name was Rory, I sent him my resume, but the same result, I have yet to hear from anyone. The funny thing is around this time, I actually decided to look up their reviews on Yelp and saw that I wasn’t the only one that was very dissatisfied with them. Other people complained of the same thing: No one picked up their phones no matter how much or when they called, that they were never told that the recruiter they were calling left or was sick so they left voicemails for weeks, etc. There’s also this lady named Gretel on yelp, apologizing to people about their terrible experience with the creative group. She’s a customer service rep, however instead of reaching out to you, she asks you to forward your info to her so you can speak with the president or whatever. I don’t really know how to forward info on yelp, so I haven’t done anything..Though based on the negative reviews...I’m not going to bother.

 So a year, later I finally wised up and gave up on The Creative Group, I have a possible job opportunity lined up for myself right now. Obviously I found it on my own, I’m just praying that the 2nd interview goes as well as the first did. "

46vz9c,5,2016-02-21,Power Electronics Schools (A&amp;M v. Virginia Tech)?,formulaencore,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/46vz9c/power_electronics_schools_am_v_virginia_tech/,"Hi all,

I've gotten admits from A&amp;M and Virginia Tech so far, I applied for the MS EE program. I believe they're both very strong in terms of power electronics research, but A&amp;M is ranked higher overall (like #12 for graduate EE rankings), while Virginia Tech is ranked #21 (or something close to that). 

I wanted to aim for R&amp;D or design after school, like Sandia or Los Alamos National Labs. However, after comparing the career fair companies between the two, the National labs that visit VTech are slightly different than the ones that visit A&amp;M (VTech has like Lincoln Labs and Oak Ridge, east coast lab stuff). I'm not sure if this is a regional thing or if I'm going to lose opportunities by attending VTech over A&amp;M. Does anyone have any insight in regards to this?

The reason I'm considering VTech is because they offered me a Bradley Master's fellowship that covers all tuition/fees, and a graduate TA position with stipend (24.3k). Both are good for 2 years as long as I maintain a 3.5 grad GPA and find my thesis advisor (I applied for a thesis for all schools) by the second semester. Does this seem reasonable in terms of the requirements? I'm sorry if this comes off as a stupid question, I'm not really familiar with this.

One thing that kinda put me off A&amp;M is during the graduate invitational (when they invite down their ""top pick"" US students for a campus/lab tour), I was having trouble asking to just volunteer in a lab. The professors don't seem to want to deal with Master's students, even if we applied for a thesis option and were accepted already. I was going to self fund A&amp;M (and I still expect to if I choose to attend), and all the current graduate students recommended us getting on our thesis projects/advisors ASAP due to just the competitiveness of just finding one. I was seriously considering going to a nonthesis at A&amp;M just because of how much difficulty I had at the graduate invitational just to ask for a volunteer position to help out in the lab (and hopefully contribute while getting a good idea for a thesis).

About myself: I did my BSEE at UT Austin, 3.6, graduated in 3 years as of last Spring, have been at Texas Instruments since. I have no research experience and did two internships at HP.

Cliffs: Is VTech worth the incentive due to the fellowship? They seem to want me more but I'm wondering if I'm shutting out opportunities by attending a (slightly) lower ranked school. Is the difference minimal and I'm just overthinking it?

If it matters, I've also been accepted by ASU and Michigan Ann Arbor so far. No way in hell I can afford either of those two though (Texas resident, and Michigan is 45k out of state just for tuition).

Thank you for taking the time to read this!

46w6og,3,2016-02-21,Finally got an offer for the summer! After months of applications and interviews I thought I would be excited for any relevant CS work... but I'm totally underwhelmed by this offer.,yonoyo,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/46w6og/finally_got_an_offer_for_the_summer_after_months/,"Ok, to start off I am a Junior in a top 10 CS school looking for an internship. I have been applying since last summer and I've had a dozen or so interviews, most of which have been on campus through the career portal. Needless to say this has been a terrible process for me, as my GPA is kind of low (&lt;3.0) and I've had my two absolute hardest semester last fall and this spring. I had my 4 latest interviews last week, and I received my first offer ever yesterday! I said I would be grateful for absolutely ANY relevant work experience this summer, but I can't help but to feel underwhelmed.

First of all, the position is software testing and the starting pay is 10/hr. I am currently working a menial college sales job, where most of my coworkers are high school dropouts. I currently make 10/hr plus commission for every sale, so I will ultimately be taking a pay cut... I understand its software test at a small, newish company but many friends who are interning are pulling in 20+/hr. Would it be appropriate to ask for more starting, like 12/hr just so I don't have to take a cut? 

Also, they asked me if I wanted to quit my current job and start immediately, choosing my own hours during the semester. I'm interested in starting before summer, but I would like to get decisions from the other companies I interviewed with before I make any commitments. I already replied to the offer and asked for a deadline, requesting at least another month so that I can hear from the other companies. 

I guess I'm just asking if I'm handling this the right way. Either way, I will take the position because the experience is more relevant than my current sales job."

I have been given an internship offer from Harris Corporation. The position is as a Test and Integration Engineering. They'll give me a great pay, and relocate me to Palm Bay, Florida. They gave me this offer a week ago and they need an answer by this Monday.

I applied for a Developer internship with Bank of America last November. They flew me out to Charlotte, NC for a leadership conference / interview. I got a second interview a week ago and it went fairly well.

My issue here is that I would much rather get the Bank of America internship, solely because I would be doing more of the writing code, but I wont hear back from them until the end of the month. I notified the Recruiter of my offer, and he called me saying that I was a strong applicant, but they are meeting on a specific day and cannot get me an answer any faster. I asked the other company for an extension, but they said they couldn't.

I would just accept the offer and wait to hear back, but I was connected to both opportunities through an internship program. They do not allow me to do that. In fact, once I accept the offer, then Bank of America gets notified and they pull my application before the decision making process.

What should I do? Should I play it safe and accept the offer? Or should I decline it and take the risk for the company that I really want? Please lend me any advice you can.

Which other universities would you all recommend that have a good engineering program? I currently live in Monterey and I would prefer Northern California over Southern but I'm not completely ruling out SoCal. I was considering UC Davis since I had a friend who went there and I really enjoyed the campus. Plus I lived in Sacramento for a few years and I had a good time living in a ""big city"". I'd like to get peoples opinions on other schools though, specifically they're engineering programs.

I have all my gen ed done. All 3 semesters of calculus, 3 semesters of physics, differential equations, linear algebra, the advanced circuits class, beginning and advanced java, C/C++, a computer architecture class (logic, state machines, machine language, x86 assembly). ~3.5 GPA...could be up to 3.6 by the time I transfer.

I don't have any internships or participation in clubs because of lack of time, but I have documentation of countless ""DIY"" projects I have done in my own time (mostly custom electronics, microprocessor/FPGA stuff...and a few metalworking/woodworking projects. .if that even matters). I also have a resume of work experience from 2000-2012. 

I know my GPA isn't great but I also know quite a few people with worse grades. I completed a few classes right out of high school but dropped out after a couple semesters to work full time. This is why my GPA can never be a 4.0 because I have some C's that I can't get rid of from my first two semesters in college before I got serious.

I'm 34. 

Any help would be appreciated. It seems like there are a lot of knowledgable people here with a lot of experience. I checked the subreddit rules and didn't see anything that forbid this kind of question but if its inappropriate in some way please let me know or tell me where it would be appropriate to post it.

I know that iOS once had the majority of the market. But recently android has surpassed the iOS. However it looks like the tools that iOS programmers use lets them develop apps twice as fast as android developers. Furthermore iOS programmers tend to make more money.

Is it still a good idea to specialize in mobile development and iOS in particular? Will iOS still be big in the future? Is it still one of the fields where you can get a good job if you have the portfolio to show for it even without a CS degree? 

I'm still a CS student, however a lot of people on this subreddit claim that it's hard to find a job without an internship or projects to show for it.

46yhjx,1,2016-02-21,EE Major w/ CS Minor Looking Into a Career in Software,SpartanJones,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/46yhjx/ee_major_w_cs_minor_looking_into_a_career_in/,"Hi everyone,

Some background info: I have 1 more year of college left (graduating December 2016) in the USA...California to be exact. I'm an EE major who has taken two programming courses, and saw it more as a hobby than something I'd do for a job, until recently. I explored everything that EE has to offer, and honestly no field or subfield of pure EE sticks out to me. This is why I picked up the CS minor, because the software world is very appealing from my point of view.

 &amp;nbsp;

Now, hopefully this doesn't come off as arrogant, because I understand that switching from an area that is largely hardware based to an area that's largely (or entirely) software based can be a humbling experience. I've done a lot of research on this topic, from viewing tons of threads on this sub and other places. A tldr; of my research is that it is not uncommon for EE majors to commit to software development, and that was reassuring to me. That's not to say it will be easy, the journey will take a lot of dedication and effort.

 &amp;nbsp;

In terms of my experience, I have one internship at a semiconductor company that has been ongoing from 2014 - present, so about 2 years. The two programming courses I have taken are Intro to Java and an FPGA course that dealt with Verilog (found it to be boring). My interests at the moment are Java/C++ and mobile app development. (Leaning towards Android) 

 &amp;nbsp;

Finally, onto my questions:

 &amp;nbsp;

1) Are these optimal courses to take?



For the two upper division CS courses I have to take for my CS minor, I plan on taking data structures &amp; algorithms and object oriented design. I chose these because they are important topics, and difficult to self-teach.

 &amp;nbsp;

2) What's the best way to build employable skills?



As I mentioned before, I'm interested in C++/Java, namely app development. I will do more research on how to dive into this field in particular, but I also wanted to ask you guys right now while I have the opportunity. I'd like some advice, even general advice, of habits or anything I should be doing to get myself closer to landing a job. I'm looking for the most efficient way to learn, since I only have so much time until I graduate. I'm willing to put in the time to make this work, not just doing the bare minimum, but becoming great. 

 &amp;nbsp;

3) What is some good insurance?



Allow me to explain what I mean by this. Let's say that things don't work out, or that I need more time to build up my skills enough to get employed. I don't want to be unemployed post-graduation, so what would be the fastest way to get employed in a software related field such that I can gain employment experience while honing my skills to the point where I can eventually become a developer? A QA role? I'm trying to think of some way I can gain relevant experience even if it's a lower level job. I don't want to be the newly graduated EE working at Radioshack or Frys, who works on his software skills at home in hopes of landing the job that he may never get.

 &amp;nbsp;

4) What do you think overall, based on what I've presented to you guys?



I'd like to hear any additional comments you guys have, if any. I'm staying optimistic, but I'm not reluctant to shy away from reality. I don't want it to seem like ""guy walks in with CS minor and thinks he's hot shit"" or ""guy takes intro to java and thinks he's the next Bill Gates"". I understand there is a lot to learn: books to read, code to write, interviews to study for, etc. , and that is why I seek to improve myself each and every day.  "
46ymd5,1,2016-02-21,"[Profile] Strange background, realistic for M7?",MBAthrowaway614,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/46ymd5/profile_strange_background_realistic_for_m7/,"I’ve never been promoted in a professional capacity, worked for a major company, or earned a lot of money. Still, I have high hopes. Are they realistic?

**Background**  

*Work experience:* After undergrad, went to graduate school in engineering at a top 3 program in the field. Changed majors to do this. I originally intended a PhD, and in three years of graduate school published four papers, two of which were co-authored with international teams, and was co-inventor on a patent that subsequently was licensed out to a startup. My funding source required an industrial internship which I chose to fulfill at an early-stage startup that has become very successful over the last three years. During my internship, I recommended a key process change that dramatically decreased energy cost for production and solved a key QC problem that “saved the company,” according to the founder/CEO. This was in the first several months of the startup’s existence, so the opportunity for impact was outsized---I regularly presented to investors and the CEO, and was the only engineer of my type working for the company at the time. 
  
After that, I was inspired to leave graduate school and create my own tech startup, for which I recruited three partners and which I bootstrapped from savings. This startup in the planning phases got to a top 75 selection in a business plan competition with 1300 entrants and won an honorable mention in a social impact venture competition. Since then, we've successfully launched our first product, currently sold in three states, and am developing more. I don't really like investment if I don't need it, so for product development capital I've taken up a part time job at a local national lab as a physicist.  
  
Totals by time of matriculation: 3 years grad school, 3 mos internship, 4 years' startup, 1.5 years' physicist (unless I withdraw before then, but the money and flexibility are really helping me expand my business). I also tutor local university students in calculus, chemistry, physics, and biology in the evenings to earn some additional cash.
  
*Extra curriculars:* I'm the youngest president of my local alumni club in the club's history, having earned the spot less than a year after moving here by serving in another officer position. Our club serves about 500 alumni and I am responsible for orchestrating events with a total of 1-2k attendees over a calendar year. We also provide minor scholarships to students from the area and perform acts of community service, while sponsoring summer students from the university to work for a local nonprofit. 
  
I am also working with my local university to launch their first iGEM team, for which we have already raised about $25k and recruited our team, PIs, and graduate advisors. This was fun because it basically started with cold-calling professors until I found someone willing to take up the mantle of PI, and working with this person has been terrific. 
  
In graduate school, I was president of my department's graduate students' council and served as a representative to the university's larger council. 
  
I am also serving as a merit badge councilor for the local Boy Scout council. 
  
*Undergrad school/major:* Top 20 USNWR school (think Rice, WUSTL, Vanderbilt, Notre Dame, Berkeley), majored in physics with a concentration in applied physics and a minor in Chinese. Not sure if relevant, but also completed honors program and won a full scholarship. 
  
*Other education/coursework:* MS in engineering from Flagship Public U, but top 3 program in the field. I also have taken several MOOCs from Stanford and Wharton, but no certificates. No idea where these fit; I just enjoy watching lectures before bed.  
   
*Race/nationality:* White, American
  
*Sex:* Male
  
**Stats**  

*GMAT Score (include breakdown!):* Haven't taken yet, but I usually do pretty well on standardized tests. Got a 2350 on the SAT, a 35 ACT, and 800Q/650V GRE (about 5 years ago). Goal is 720+.
*Undergrad GPA:* 3.7, graduated *cum laude*
  
  
**MBA Info**  

*Goal of MBA:* After my MBA, I would like to work in business development or product management for a large high-technology firm like Genentech, Cargill, Raytheon, etc. I would also consider launching another startup if it felt like the opportunity was there. 
  
Regarding my current startup, I am going to sell my shares to my partners and serve as an advisor during my MBA years. I believe that this is the best strategy to enable it to grow, and I may return to it post-MBA if the other partners and I agree that it is the best course of action at that time. 
  
*Target schools:* Harvard, MIT, Ross, Wharton, Stanford, Booth, Kellogg, Haas, Tepper, Darden. These are schools for investigation right now and I'll eventually wind up paring the list down a bit. Suggestions would be helpful. 
  
Sorry for the long read, it’s been a winding road. I’m currently 28 and will be applying this fall. Who do you guys think would be the most logical choices to ask for rec letters? What other advice can you offer?

So I have an interview at a big bank this week for a risk management internship. I know someone on the inside and they basically told me I would be working heavily with data, data manipulation, and managing/comparing it to the companies risk appetite. When I asked specifically what I should know for the interview I was only really told to have a firm grasp on Access and strong analytical skills. 

I do not have any previous experience with risk management (and little with Access) so I am a bit nervous. My questions to any of you willing to help would be:

What aspects of Access should I really have down?
  -ex. Commonly used functions in risk management

Is there anything I can bring to the interview to show that I know what I am doing such as past work (ex. stock pitch perhaps to prove analytical abilities)?

Any general information/advice.

I appreciate any help you are willing to provide,

Thank you"

Considering how much the tech industry is growing and the increasing demand for those with coding skill grows, and my interest in software, hardware, mechanics of computers, coding, etc. Makes learning this skill seem like a logical choice.

However, I'm a little late into my undergrad, so I have a choice. Maybe you guys can help.

**Choice 1: I change my major to PR and go to my city's coding boot camp in the evening after graduating while working a part time job**

**Pros:**

*Easy to change major, won't affect me in school that much. PR plays to my stengths and love of interaction with others.

*Coding boot camp would give me two big skills under my belt

*Coding boot camp is definitely cheaper than more university tuition. 

*Boot camp where I live gives certifications, aids in job search process, have had nothing but positive buzz and success stories lately

*Could potentially use either skills to eventually break into the video game industry, a very exhaustive industry but one that I love.

**Cons:**

*Would ultimately take more time

*Bootcamp around me is still relatively new

*Would be quite difficult to find a job to help pay the monthly payments of rent and tuition to coding bootcamp and give me evenings off for class...maybe they can compromise? 

**Choice 2: Change major to CIS (Infomation Systems)**

**Pros:**

*BS degree with University contacts and exclusive recruiters

*Would learn not just coding but business and IT backgrounds and be a better job candidate

**Cons:**

*CIS degree is different from my currently enrolled college. It IS possible to change but it is a DRAG to do so. It's hard.

*CIS degree would definitely prolong my time in university, wouldn't graduate on time

*I could maybe reach credit surcharge limits...which could be quite bad.


**Notes:**

*I have prepaid college credits and a state scholarship

For either choice, I'd be trying for internships both as a college undergrad and recent grad, working to fill out my resume with experience. /r/findapath has always given sound advice in the past, so I was wondering what advice everyone could give about the two choices, and which one would be better to follow?

I'm trying to make sure I can get a decent entry job not terribly long out of college, but also one I can enjoy and not dread every day. The job market in the US sucks hard right now, so being a transfer student I'm trying to make the most of what time I have right now, so that later on down the road I'll have an easier time finding work.

Thanks guys. Sorry for the long post. Hope it's readable. I did this all on my phone."

They asked me how I bought it and I did not lie to them I straight up told them I had a fake id since I remembered seeing one of the undercover cops walk out of the store when I was at the counter. 

I ended being charged with:
 (1) Illegal possession of an alcoholic beverage.
(2) possession by minor of false or fraudulent identification
(3)def  knowingly making false statement of age
(4) furnishing alcohol to minor ( since when we left the store we put the alcohol in my friends bookbag. 

They gave me a ticket with these charges and a court date. However on the ticket they have section were you can basically just admit and not have to go to court and pay a fine I think. This was my first time ever getting  in trouble with the law the cop said if I go to court they will lump the 4 charges together and I will probably have to do some community service and a class or something.

 However, I was planning on studying abroad next year and if I have these charges on my record it will probably fuck me up over when I apply for my visa so I need this to be off my record. Should I just admit or should I  go to court. If I go to court is it okay if I get a public defender or should I try to find a defense attorney to pay ( I am low on money). Again this is my first offense ever and cannot afford to have this on my record! It will seriously fuck me over I am a good student with a 3.6 GPA and a bright future and I don't get in trouble.

I have a spinal cord injury from a car accident several years ago, and I need surgery so that the paralysis and nerve pain don't get worse. My insurance is denying coverage for the better surgery, and even when they do approve it, I can't afford my maximum out of pocket fees. I'm a PhD student, so I have all these deadlines breathing down my neck, no money, and no medical leave available to me for my crappy teaching job. So even if my surgery is approved, I'm looking at a grueling recovery period where I have to somehow maintain employment while being in terrible pain. And the surgery itself is terrifying, even though I want it so badly at the same time. I'm in so much debt from all the other medical expenses. I have no family (my family were abusive drug addicts I escaped from years ago). I'd rather be dead than disabled and homeless. 

I started getting worried when I started thinking seriously about how and what I'd do. Tomorrow I might get a final ruling on my insurance claim, and if it's a no, I think that might be it for me. And Wednesday I'm supposed to defend my PhD dissertation proposal, and some of the people on my committee told me straight up that they think I'm an idiot, so I know I'm going to get torn apart. Those things coming up just made me start thinking more seriously about killing myself. 

I have a counselor and a psychiatrist already, and when I saw my counselor on Friday, she was mean to me, and I just felt more hopeless. I think she was trying some techniques to try and push me into a breakthrough or something, but it was just really destructive. She called me ""Whiny and Mousey."" I'm actually *almost* a counselor myself, which is part of why some of this feels even more shameful. I would have been licensed in May, but I had to drop my final internship due to the worsening of my spine injury. I feel like I should be able to help myself more, but I can't. 

I just can't see any hope for my future. It all looks like pain and poverty from here. But I'm terrified of trying and failing. Members of my family tried and failed several times in my childhood, and it was ugly. I don't want to be that person. 

And I don't want to die here, in this state. I live in the desert, but I'm from California, and I'd want to die by the ocean. But I'd feel so bad like doing it in a hotel room and having some poor stranger find me. The fact that I'm still having logical thoughts like that I know makes it seem like maybe I'm not serious, and I don't want to be, but at the same time, I can't see any way out of this. 

Edit: My final appeal failed. Honestly not sure how I'm going to survive this week, that was my last hope. I'm doomed to a life of pain and neverending surgeries. I'd rather be dead. 

Update 2: Well I'm obviously still alive since I'm writing this. I did my dissertation proposal defense and I basically went crazy trying to fix everything they told me I was retarded about. I knocked it out of the park and had a lot of people in awe of my research and its implications. So that's good, but I still have the surgery authorization that failed and now I'm still facing the old shitty surgery that's going to ruin my life. As soon as I finished the defense I had a bunch of calls from surgeons and insurance companies and billing departments. It's like, I did something really incredible and I couldn't even enjoy it for one second. I can't catch a break. "

**Form:**

* Country of purchase: Canada

* Budget range: CAD $1000-$1500

* Purpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.): portable gaming, mainly

* Screen size preference: 15.6"", but I can live with 17.3"" if there's no choice.

* OS preference (Windows/Mac/Linux): Windows.

* Gaming requirements (list example games and desired fps/settings): Enough to run very heavily modded Minecraft at least 50-60 fps, LoL/DOTA/CSGO on high/maxed out, and Street Fighter V on high settings. Other than that, I have no desire of running any game on ultra, ever. I don't know if GTX 960m is enough, or if 970m is the only thing capable of hitting that benchmark. I'd prefer 960m for its vastly reduced price, but please let me know if you absolutely need to use the 970m to meet these benchmarks.

* Other performance requirements (video editing, CAD, etc.): None, outside of *very* light AutoCAD usage.

* Portability requirements (constantly carried, frequently moved, mostly stationary, etc.): Very frequently moved, but will be plugged in while at 90% of those locations.

* Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business compatibility): Can't find a good Sager build under $1500 CAD, though it's my preferred brand, along with ASUS. I do not want to use XOticPC to order a laptop, given their horrendous reputation. Already looked at ASUS ROG G751JL and its other constituents, and I'm not impressed with how quickly its users are reporting its hard drive failing (under a year of usage, even with maintenance). I **absolutely** need a hardy, long-lived laptop to juggle between moving to different countries on internships and the like. Shelf life of 3 years and above with regular, diligent maintenance preferably.

* Any particular style that you like (examples are great): Not too specific, would like good build quality though.

**Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one or two)**

* Long battery life -vs- Low weight -vs- High performance: High performance gets 1st priority, then long battery life as a distant second.

* Build quality -vs- Low price: Build quality

**List any critical features:** 960m or 970m (budget is main limiter here), i7, no thermal throttling, good build quality (not flimsy), 500gb+ storage

**Which features would you pay a premium for?** (eg. high resolution screen, great keyboard/touchpad/audio, low noise/heat): great performance, long laptop life (not battery life, but its overall shelf life, if that makes sense), build quality."

4710ku,2,2016-02-22,Very long vent on the joke that is my life.,nightjesus,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/4710ku/very_long_vent_on_the_joke_that_is_my_life/,"My life just tends to be an endless joke. Some of it is my fault, some of it is not. 

It's my fault that I went on a trip to America that I could not afford. I should not of taken out that bank loan. I should of canceled it when my step sister pulled out and I should not of invited and paid for the person who went with me. I also should of waited for the dollar to go up (I'm Australian, the AUD to USD is murder). I've become unemployed and I live in the highest unemployment rate city in the country. If I don't get a job I have to declare bankruptcy in June. I'm 21. I'm an impulsive little shit. And I should not of done that. And I do agree, I'm a fucking idiot. I just really, really wanted to go to America for my 21st. I had never left the country. 

I lived with my grandparents from the ages of 2 to 18. When I graduated high school I was forced to move on campus or be sent to my ice smoking mother in a different state. Regardless if I was accepted into uni. The catch? I had to pay for it, out right, with my own money (as most kids do, but I thought because of the circumstances, they would of paid for the first year at least since I had no choice.) They are wealthy people. I was 17 going on 18. The money I was saving at my job during my first summer out of high school, they convinced me I was saving for my trip to the US. It wasn't until I was accepted into my uni accommodation that they dropped the bombshell on me. I had to fork out $13k. They thought it was funny. Then they expected me to move home after my first year. As someone who suffers severe depression from just living under that roof, it was a no go. I was staying on campus for my sanity. (I kept telling them during high school that I thought I had depression, they just laughed in my face. Turns out, I was, severely, and I am now on medication for it still.)
 
Yes, they have bailed me out in the last year. They did. And they know I pay back as I always have. I'm just unemployed and not earning any money (every time I see them, the first question is 'when are you paying us back?' knowing fully well that I am unemployed with bills to pay.) I honestly have no money to even feed myself. Thankfully I get fed on campus during the week. On the weekend, my boyfriend feeds me. But my lovely grandmother told me today that if I don't get a job, and I do have to file for bankruptcy, tough luck. No money. No bail out. Can't afford anything? Get your boyfriend to pay for it, or his parents. Don't ask us for any money. We have it, but we just feel like teaching you a lesson. She then proceeded to tell me what happens after you file for bankruptcy. It's not good. And it would ruin my life.

I feel like they just want me to fail. They could easily help me. They just don't want to. The loan is minuscule for them as it's $5,800. If I was employed, I could pay it off easy and still be financially stable. No problem. I just can't seem to get a job. I have handed in close to 50 resume's in the last 2 months. Problem is? So are other university kids. Just when I think I have the job, some one with more experience comes along. I've worked in HR, I know how to resume. I don't know. I just can't seem to find a job. 

Due to the stuff that happened on my trip, my 8 month old, newly fixed iPhone 6 was stolen. They refused to help me. They even said 'It wasn't your fault...but we aren't helping you get a new one. Buy a cheap one from the supermarket'. Thankfully I have travel insurance but that has been a fucked up cycle that takes up to 14 working days to process any new information they need. Which they don't fucking tell you they need. They wait after the 10 working days, wait for you to ring them to see what is going on and then they go '...oh yeah we need this as well, send that to us and it will take another 14 working days...soz'. This has been going on for 2 fucking months. My phone was stolen the day before my 21st at Venice Beach by a homeless guy. Grandparents don't care. It is $500 to replace the phone. They just shrug at me and say 'When can we have the phone back?' 

The insurance should be approved in early March but jesus christ Allianz has the worst customer service ever. 

Then I also find out today there is a very real chance I may have Lupus which seems to be very hereditary in my fucked up family. My grandmother does have it, my mother was just diagnosed with it and I have been showing symptoms. Fucking jim dandy. I kinda wish my boyfriend would message me more asking if I was okay. I'm not. I'm not keeping it together. I guess league of legends is a little more important then his girlfriend having a breakdown. Don't get me wrong, I respect bro time. I just really need him. All I want is a message from him asking me if I'm okay. I don't think I'm going to get that. 

They told me all High School, 'go to uni'. Now that I'm here they tell me that uni is pointless. They praise my pot smoking, unemployed, dirty aunty to the sky and would drop anything for her. But I'm just the granddaughter that goes to uni and is poor. I think they have already written me off as a failure. I'm the only one in my whole family to go to uni. I have a stable relationship (although sometimes I wish he would maybe not play games and talk to me), I have great friends, internships with a great pay lined up later in the year (unfortunately too late for when I would have to file for bankruptcy. They start in July.) And to be honest by the end of Feb 2017, I won't have any debt due to my internships. It's just when I start them, it would be too late. 

I know I sound incredibly privileged, but I'm not. My grandparents are rich. I'm not. My mother is a drug addict. I haven't seen my biological father since I was 6. I have severe depression and anxiety and paranoia. My adopted uncle has Alcohol Fetus Syndrome, he sufferers from paranoia. When my grandma found out about mine, she made it all about him. My aunty has anxiety from all the weed she smokes (like she is a chronic weed smoker), they jump up and down when she needs something. Me? 'Oh well, go talk to a therapist. Sort it out yourself.'   

I don't know what I've done to them. All my life I just wanted them to be proud of me. I've done so much just to hear them say that they are proud. I just feel like because I'm horrible with finances, they have shoved me off and written me down as a lost cause. I was never taught how to money. I wanted help. They never gave it to me. I kept everything bottled up to the point that I was drowning in debt. 

Now I can't sleep at night because I'm stressed and scared. About my finances, phone and my possible lupus diagnoses which is going to cost me a lot if I have it. I feel so alone. 

TL;DR: Uni student cries about how hard her life is. Just needed to get it out. I'm going off to cry now. Bye. "

4711nn,15,2016-02-22,Rejected job after job...what's a graduate got to do to stand out?,charlagold,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4711nn/rejected_job_after_jobwhats_a_graduate_got_to_do/,"I graduated university at the end of 2014, and although I knew it would be hard to get a job in my field (journalism/writing), I presumed that doing a number of internships would get my foot in the door. During uni, I did a 3 week internship to accompany studying. Since graduating, i've done 3 more internships. In total, it's been 6 months worth of internships that have all been unpaid. The last one I did was 3 months long full time, I was given the opportunity to publish my work, and on the side I have been doing some freelance writing for several websites, so I've got quite a strong portfolio at the moment. At the last internship I did, one of my 'mentors' offered her CV for me to use as a template, which was very valuable to me as she has the career I should like to pursue. I have also had people in my field who are employed to help me with my cover letter several times.
For some reason though, I'm just not standing out. Nearly every job I apply to I get ignored or rejected. In some cases, I have been invited the interview but not made it past the next stage. Usually they never give feedback, but on the odd occasion they'll say they gave the role to someone with more experience who were willing to take on a junior. I find this quite unfair that they are giving graduate roles to people who have like 5 years experience?! I've tried to let it not get me down, and have been applying to temp jobs as well, but those are proving to be a struggle too. I would totally understand if I was fresh out of uni with no experience whatsoever, but i'm starting to think that 6 months working for free was a waste of time, when at the time I thought 'Ok, I'm not getting paid, but it will be worth it in the end'.

I've been offered more unpaid internship opportunities, full time, that range from 1-3 months but I simply cannot afford it anymore. If it were for a shorter period, like 2 weeks or so I would definitely take that on, or perhaps if they were offering only one or two days a week. While I was interning before, I had to work at the weekends in order to support myself and had to move back home after University.
So I just want to pose the question, what do you think would make a candidate stand out when applying for a job? I know I'm not the only one facing this issue, there are so many other graduates out there facing the tough job market.

Thanks :)"

471j9n,40,2016-02-22,The Salt Marsh,marbleopia,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/471j9n/the_salt_marsh/,"The police are ruling it a suicide, but I don’t think it’s quite that simple. I was there, and I know what I saw.

This is hard to write, because it happened so recently, but I don’t really know who else I can tell this story too. It’s not that I don’t want people to think I’m crazy. I don’t want them to think that I’m lying, that I’m besmirching her memory or diminishing what she did. Small towns in New England are like small towns anywhere – people like to talk, and they’re quick to judge.

Especially in our group. In high school everyone talked about leaving when they graduated. Then we graduated, and a lot of us did leave. Throughout those four years a number of us started trickling back in, transferring schools to save money or be closer to home. There was no shame in it. At least, not to me. I was one of the ones that stayed at home after high school, commuting to the nearby branch of our state university of my parent’s house. Who was I to judge?

My best friend, on the other hand, was one of the most ambitious people I’ve ever met. I always envied her commitment to her own future. She knew exactly what she wanted and how to get it. She graduated from Fordham (not too-too far, but out of New England, and a different enough environment, being so close to the city and all) in five years with a major in organic chemistry and a minor in math. Yeah, this bitch was smart. 

The summer after we graduated she came home. I was really grateful. I went to visit her at school a bunch of times, but I’m one of those people who gets bogged down just by the daily grind. It took her five years to get two degrees, it took me six to finish with one. Illustration. Oh, gee.

Anyway, by the time she was came home my visits had fallen to about one or two a year. I had friends that I passed the time with at home, and a long term boyfriend to keep me company, but there’s no one like your best friend. I was really hoping she would be home for good, but of course she wasn’t. She got an internship down in Virginia. She was gone from November to April, and by the time she came back she was talking about med school. And not at any school nearby, no. She was talking about Washington, California, even England. She was going to cure cancer, but she wasn’t going to do it in our backyard.

Me and the boyfriend had broken up at this point. I was 23 now and was kind of accepting the fact that, while I might be content with staying home, Michelle was born to roam. One of my other friends, Annie, had filled Michelle’s role after my breakup. Michelle and I would always be friends, I knew, even if we weren’t physically close.

So you can imagine my surprise when Michelle announced she was applying to Brown and Yale. She was going to stay closer to home after all. I like to think that it had something to do with me, but it wasn’t. It was a guy, of course. A guy we had gone to high school with. He hadn’t really been in our circle, but everyone knew him and he was well liked. It wasn’t like there was a history of jilted or unrequited love between them that was playing out now, years later – there just was no history to begin with. Their circles never crossed until we were in our twenties. 

If I’m honest, it kind of pissed me off that she would stay home for a guy. She’d been through a couple of boyfriends in the past that couldn’t keep up with her, and she’d never let them hold her back. And God knows, me and her family weren’t enough to hold her back, either. She was dedicated to the point that it made her an asshole at times. Her school put a pretty steep financial burden on her family, but to her, that was beside the point. She didn’t care much that anyone missed her when she went away. It was kind of like she didn’t realize it was possible for people to depend on her for anything. Nothing emotional, anyway. In her mind there was no such thing as emotional dependence.

Michelle got accepted to Yale School of Medicine, but she never went. She got pregnant. You would think someone as smart and ambitious as her would be more careful about things like that, but if you want my honest opinion, I think she was cracking under pressure. She just didn’t want to admit it to anyone, not even herself. And the saddest thing is that we all loved her regardless of her accomplishments. She put all that pressure on herself. 

She and the boyfriend got engaged and found a place to rent from this elderly couple. It was a small house on their property, at the edge of a salt marsh. If you’re not familiar with a salt marsh, you can kind of picture a swamp, with the difference that a salt marsh floods and drains with the tide. They are truly beautiful, like wet, grassy beaches. They generally aren’t deep, but with some (and this is true of the one near Michelle’s new house) if you go too far out you can find yourself in the ocean.

Alright. I know I’m probably boring you, but I wanted you to know what kind of person Michelle was, the good and the bad, so you can understand how strange her behavior started to become. But from now on I’m just going to cut to the chase.

It wasn’t long after they moved into the little house. At first they loved it. The old couple in the main house were really nice, they were amiable but not nosy, etc. The view of the marsh and the ocean beyond were incredible. For the first time Michelle admitted to me that she could understand why someone wouldn’t want to leave. I knew she was talking about me, but you know. I didn’t want to be a dick. I was just glad she could finally be content here the way I was.

Then I started noticing the bags under her eyes. Her hair, which was curly before, was turning into a rat’s nest. She told me she was having trouble sleeping and she was too tired to shower and comb her hair. Like everyone else, I just attributed it to her being pregnant.

Then she had the baby. A little girl they named Gabrielle, Gabby for short. Obviously I’m not a mother myself, but I’m the oldest of four, so I tried to help out as much as I could. Any time I wasn’t working I would be at Michelle and Dan’s house. And if I wasn’t there, the old woman they were renting the house from would come by.

I felt like I was more her mom than Michelle was at times. I’d be watching TV or something, holding the baby, feeding her, burping her, while Michelle stood at the window, staring out at the marsh. And Dan worked a lot, so he wasn’t usually home. It was just me and the baby. I say that because there were times when I couldn’t really count Michelle as really being there, she was so spaced out.

She wasn’t always staring out the window. She slept a lot, too. She didn’t eat much and she lost a lot of weight. She pumped a lot of her breast milk because we couldn’t always count on her to be awake when Gabby needed to be fed. She got mastitis pretty bad at one point because she just wasn’t taking care of herself.

I was worried, and so was everyone else, but we figured she needed time. My mother had suffered with post-partum depression after the second two kids, so I had already seen it first hand and knew she would come out of it eventually. In the meantime we were there for her and the baby, we encouraged her to eat and sleep and bathe.

I was holding out hope until the morning I got the phone call. 

“Amber?” Michelle sounded frightened, and I pictured her hiding somewhere, clutching the baby, who I could hear crying in the background.

My heart started to race. I am a habitually late riser, and it was maybe 9AM when I got the call, but as soon as I heard that tone of fear in her voice I was wide awake, my mind racing. I was thinking that someone had broken in, or there had been an accident, or the baby was deathly ill and needed to be brought to the hospital.

I sat up in bed, ready to jump out and throw on some clothes.

“What’s wrong?”

“It’s – it’s Gabby.”

“Is she sick?”

“No, she just – she’s crying, but it’s not her crying. It’s not her voice.”

Huh. I was getting out of bed now, but I was moving more slowly. Michelle seemed confused and scared, she wasn’t explaining herself well, but by the time I hung up and was on my way I thought I understood what was going on. The baby was crying, but what Michelle heard wasn’t the sound of a baby crying. She heard a woman, sobbing in agony. A woman crying through her infant daughter’s mouth.

I admit, it gave me chills, the thought of it, but at this point I didn’t really know what to think. I was beginning to be scared, but I was scared for the baby, not Michelle.

I went right in when I got there, like I always do. I found Michelle standing in front of the window, holding Gabby, bouncing her. Gabby was asleep. Michelle turned when she heard me come in. Her face was pale and even from across the room I could see the sheen of sweat.

“Hey,” she said.

“Are you alright?”

She frowned. Then she nodded. I took the baby, who woke up and started crying again. Michelle shrank away from me, her face contorted, her mouth twisted in a horrible grimace.

“There it is again!” she screamed.

My mouth kind of dropped. All I heard was a baby crying, but she looked at me like I was holding an axe, not a baby. Like, yeah, hearing a baby cry is awful, but the way she described it on the phone – the heart wrenching gasps of a grown woman – I was not hearing any of that.

Immediately I thought I knew that Michelle had snapped. The baby was too much for her, the depression was worse than we thought. I needed to call Dan and her parents and tell them. She needed therapy, or medication, or something. Holding Gabby in one arm and taking my phone out of my pocket with the other, I went outside. I know it probably wasn’t the best idea, leaving Michelle alone in the house, but I could see how much she was bothered by Gabby crying and I just needed to get the baby somewhere Michelle couldn’t hear so I could calm her down.

First I called Dan and got his voicemail. I left a message – just real quick, “Hey, it’s Amber. It’s Michelle. She’s really not okay.” Then I called Michelle’s mother and quickly explained what had just happened. She was upset, but she didn’t have any idea what to do, and before she hung up she said she was going to call her husband and see what he thought was best. She sounded so sad when she said goodbye that I almost started crying.

After the two phone calls, I walked around outside with Gabby until she fell asleep, hiccoughing. We found ourselves at the edge of the backyard where thorny bushes separated the sturdy lawn from the shifting mud of the marsh. A heron balanced on one leg somewhere near the middle and gulls squawked overhead. The smell of salt stung the inside of my nose.

Then I felt tingles on the back of my neck. I turned around slowly, but I already knew what I would see. Michelle in the window, staring. But she wasn’t looking at us, she was looking at the marsh. I followed her gaze but all I saw were birds and the tall grass bending with the wind.

This is turning out to be way longer than I thought it would be. I have to stop for now but I’ll update as soon as I can. After this point, things didn’t just go downhill. They dropped off the edge of a cliff.

471krg,17,2016-02-22,Go to the Resume Workshop tonight if you're a Computer Science student,_J_,UMD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/471krg/go_to_the_resume_workshop_tonight_if_youre_a/,"Hi /r/UMD,

It's that time of semester again when the CS Career Fair is coming up and students frantically get their resumes ready.

I am a UMD CS alum who is at the university this week to recruit for Microsoft. In the past two semesters that I've visited the university, I've looked through a lot of resumes and unfortunately a lot of students misrepresent themselves.

During the career fair, I always hear at least one student say ""I wish I went to the resume workshop"". So here's a reminder. Come to the resume workshop. Instead of the 30 seconds I normally get to read your resume and talk to you during the career fair, we get 5 minutes to talk about your experience and how to make your resume look impressive.

Plus, in 3 days when you give me your resume at the career fair, I can just take it and ask you any additional questions because you already had 5 minutes more than everyone else to talk to me!

**What**: CS Resume Workshop

**When**: 5pm to 7:30pm

**Where**: CSIC - Room 1115

*(Last time I was here, students requested that I post messages like this because they didn't know when Microsoft/other events were)*

EDIT: Pro Tip. Bring a few copies of your resume so the recruiters can write on them. It's a lot easier to remember their advice when you let them draw all over your resume :)

Pro Tip 2: Put your graduation month/year on your resume. Every recruiter needs it so they know whether you're looking for Full time or Internship

**tl;dr go to the resume workshop, seriously.**"

Currently, I have a lot of pressure from my dad to pursue something in engineering as my sister had previously done a masters degree and told him that she wanted to study something else, putting his pockets under some serious stress. So he doesn't want me to go off into another field after he has sponsored me to do this. Also, I don't want to end up wasting his money in the long term.

I'm afraid that I'm quite complacent and now, after three years of engineering, can say that I've lost interest in it, then again, I haven't been exposed to it much more than my course and a short internship. I've applied for various graduate schemes and internships but so far, I've been rejected by all but one of them in a telecommunications company back in my home country (I'm studying in the U.K).

I have a few options:

-Continue my studies

-Find a job (not related to my course)

-Find a job (related to my course)

-Tell dad that I'd like a year off to find out what I'd like to do

Thing is, I also wouldn't have a plan for that year and I've been pondering this for weeks now, I really don't know what kind of job I'd like to do. Everything comes to me as an ""okay, yeah I'd give that a shot"", but really, there isn't one thing that I've thought of that I go, ""that's the one!""

I'd really appreciate any advice or help from anyone!

I am 22 old computer science graduated from NIT. I have been working for a MNC (top in security field) for last 7 months (8LPA). I am passionate about computer science and value myself as a good developer but my entrepreneurial skills are bad . I am not enjoying my current work, as development opportunities are less and I am not learning anything. I am not planning for any higher studies.


I am invited to join a startup by a guy who was my manager in a startup I did my internship on. He along with one developer has developed an adverting agency(sort of) startup. They got funding and beta product is released. They are offering around 80% hike also. I will be 3rd member of the entire company.


What do you guys think? I don't have any financial debts but I am the only earning member in my family.
What are things I should look before joining this startup?(stock)
Will early leaving of first job(7 months) affect my career?

Please share your thoughts
Any help is appreciated"

I attended college for three years to get an associates degree in Computer Information Systems program, I graduated with honors. It was a jack-of-all trade's program having me touch on Programming with PHP/Html, Microsoft Server, Networking,  Linux, Computer Repair, and a couple other subjects.

I've had the worst time trying to locate a job in the area, having applied to multiple jobs, gone through a few interviews and being turned down for lack of experience. I've tried to get into an internship in IT to get some experience, but also recently got denied for the internship with a possibility of them looking into an Internship in April.

I have 0 motivation to continue on getting certifications or proceeding in the field because of the constant denying of possible jobs. I feel like the three years I spent in college was honestly a waste of time and amounts to nothing in the IT world.

Has anyone had problems getting into IT that I am having or lack of motivation in continuing IT because of it?"

4736vv,42,2016-02-22,The Co-Op experience that I won't be submitting in the survey at the end of the semester.,BiouxBioux,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4736vv/the_coop_experience_that_i_wont_be_submitting_in/,"For those of you who don't know, Co-Op is short for Cooperative Education and it offers college students, such as myself, working experience during school. As of now, instead of taking my fourth semester of college, I'm working as an electrical engineering intern at a certain company, which I'll leave nameless. I jumped at the opportunity as soon as I learned about it as a freshman- making money *and* not having going to class? That sounded magnificent to me, even if it would keep me in school for five years instead of four and a half. Halfway through my third semester, when the workload of the engineering curriculum finally got to me in the form of four days without sleep and hands too shaky to handle the soldering gun, I knew I had to get in on it.

&amp;nbsp;

Now, here I am, sitting at my own desk, typing on my own computer (which can’t play music, unfortunately), dressed for work and making $15 an hour in my little Quality Assurance office. It's not as glamorous as I expected, but it pays the bills and letting the stress from school fall off my shoulders feels deliriously amazing. I even have my own ID with my picture on it that lets me access my office and lab, which I think is pretty nifty. It’s a very protected and tight facility since we work on classified material, and I feel very professional and adult-like in my noisy office pumps and ironed pants. I never used to iron my pants- but I digress. The building I work in is *old*, with wide, long hallways that I consider creepy enough to be in a horror movie, which is why I’ll never stay late here again (I have, but that’s a story for another time), but it's the lab that I work in that has led me to post in the subreddit that I thought I'd only read from, never post in. 

&amp;nbsp;

Only a handful of people, including myself and my supervisor, have access to this chemistry lab. It has a total of three rooms, although it's basically an open floor plan since the doors are never closed. A better understanding of my current fear needs a better understanding of the setup of my lab, and sadly, as an engineering major with little to no talent for writing, this may be painful to some of you NoSleep regulars. 

&amp;nbsp;

Upon entering, there is a space- a sad excuse for an entranceway, bare aside from a cork bulletin board with flyers from the 80's still pinned into it advertising faculty picnics and outings. There are three doorways visible as soon as one enters: a door to the left, a doorway (no door) at the right, and a door directly ahead. To the right is where I spend most of my time, which is the x-ray and ionic cleansing room- we’ll call this my room. The x-ray I use is the second youngest thing occupying this lab, with me being the first. It uses the oldest Windows I have ever encountered in my life and runs as fast as anything its age should. Anyone who comes into my room while I’m working (which is forbidden, since I’m operating equipment that emits radiation) can see me at my post at the x-ray machine, and vice versa. From my little seat, the end of my room is visible where it meets the chemical storage room.

&amp;nbsp;

The door to the chemical storage room, which is always open despite the fact that no one ever uses it anymore, is directly ahead when you unlock the door and enter. It’s where most of the chemicals are stored in specific temperature environments and tested, along with blocks of solder and specially formulated alcohols that we use for our PWB’s. This room runs in parallel with my room, and they are connected by the doorway visible from my post. It seems to have had a door in it at one point in time because there are hinges on the doorframe, with paint chipping to reveal their age and rust underneath. I never enter this room; it’s always pitch-black, and the only thing visible within it is this old coat stand. I don’t need anything from in there, anyhow.

&amp;nbsp;

The door to the left, which is also perpetually open, leads into a room that, I’m assuming, is the oldest part of the chem lab. It has an old camera that is larger than me, a machine that simulates temperature scenarios for PWB’s, and a bunch of other old technology that I don’t use or have the intelligence to describe. Like a scene from a Wes Anderson film, the lab is vintage to the point of impropriety. The machines and equipment date back to the 1950's- I'm sure of this since I found love notes between two interns from 1957 flattened in the early pages of an old log book on the desk- and there are reference books on the desk shelves that are in dire need of replacing since their contents have long been disproved or updated by modern day science. I’ve even picked up some knickknacks from this desk while some guys worked on the x-ray machine for maintenance; I found some cool old red ink, a stamper, and some stirring rods that would shape clay nicely (I enjoy clay). However, the most important thing at the desk in this room is the computer, just as up-to-date as the one in my office, but even better- it has speakers! They’re old and clunky, but they work when I plug them into the audio jack, so no complaints here. You see, the thing I used to hate most about this job was how quiet and alone I always am. As the intern, I’m doing an important job- important in the sense that it has to be done, but it’s the job no one wants to do. I don’t get many visitors to the lab (I can’t unless they have x-ray protection), and after a week the silence and isolation began to stress me out. I had tried talking to myself, but that just felt worse. Finding these speakers was akin to discovering my Holy Grail.

&amp;nbsp;

I mentioned this before, but the security on this place is pretty tight. You can’t get in without getting your car checked, swiping your ID, entering a personal pin, and addressing the security guard at the entrances/exits of the building. No personal electronic gadgets are allowed either, and Internet access is limited, which is understandable, but for some reason they haven’t blocked reddit and YouTube- at least not fully. I need my daily dose of NoSleep (self-prescribed 4 hours a day at least) and music, so I’m grateful for these loopholes.

&amp;nbsp;

About two weeks ago, I sought to use IT’s negligence to my advantage. Since the chem room is across the hall from my room, I decided to try to play music from the desktop while I worked. I turned the speakers about three-quarters of the way up, as to not make it so obvious that I was abusing the workplace’s ‘no media streaming’ protocol, and put on a full concert of classical music. It didn’t reach me that well from my perch (I could barely hear the high pitch staccato accents) but it was better than the pure silence I was enduring before I got the idea. 

&amp;nbsp;

About a half an hour or so later, when I had finished with my tasks at the x-ray, I noticed that the music had stopped. I thought this strange since usually concert audio lasts more than an hour at least, so I went over to check on the video I had picked out, already disappointed. When I went to check, however, I noticed that the speakers were unplugged from the audio jack. Since I’m easily creeped out, I booked it and ran back to my office to think it over instead of standing there. There was no way they could have fallen out, that was for sure. No one had come in while I was working, either, and if someone *had* come in, I would’ve heard the door unlock and seen them from my chair. But no one had entered the lab that day aside from me, and that’s how it has always been for the past month I’ve worked here.

&amp;nbsp;

I can already imagine it now, some readers looking at my post and thinking, “Um… Okay? So?” since this isn’t really one of those thrilling, chilling stories that I read on here, but it’s just because I needed to set it up for you. I *need* you to imagine and understand my situation thoroughly before I continue.

&amp;nbsp;

The incident happened today. I had just been given enough x-ray work that I had to stay in the lab from 8am to 10:45 without a break, and just as I was signing my initials into the log book, I saw it. I saw it in the corner of my left eye, where the chem storage room meets my room- a flash of white, stark against the darkness where the light of my room is defeated by the shadow of the chem storage room. When I turned my head to look, it was gone; in its place, only the coat stand, dimly lit, staggering under the weight of blue, white, and gray lab coats. Lab coats! Laughing at myself, I almost let go of the fear that had instantly bloomed within my stomach. Almost.

&amp;nbsp;

The relief was short lived. As I turned to leave, a figure stood in the doorway of the chem lab, directly across from me, at least five feet away. It seemed like a person wearing a sheet, like those ghost costumes that kids used to wear for Halloween, except there were no eye or mouth holes. Whatever or whoever it was just stood there, lit by the light of the entranceway and my room. I’d seen The Conjuring laundry scene enough times to know that I should get away, *now*, but I couldn’t leave without passing in front of it or turning my back on it. With my heart beating in my chest, hard enough to allow me to hear it drumming, pumping in my ears, I asked it a question purely out of protocol.

&amp;nbsp;

“This is a radiation area. For your safety, I have to ask you to lea-“

&amp;nbsp;

Despite standing at a distance too far from the door, it slammed the door in my face. I just *knew* it was its doing even if it didn’t make any movement. Then I bolted. I was so panicked that at first I struggled to use the doorknob to let myself out but when I finally managed to turn the damn thing I burst through the door and sprinted to my office, dodging several other puzzled employees along the way. When I got back to my office, I realized I had worked up a sweat, but I felt cold. I was actually freezing, and my teeth were chattering so loudly that my supervisor asked if I was alright. I didn’t know what to say. I can’t tell her about what had happened; I can’t afford to lose this internship. I phoned my boyfriend for some comfort but it didn’t help at all. I’m praying that I don’t get any more work requests that require me to return to the lab today. I don’t know if I can take it. I guess I was never really alone after all."

473to9,2,2016-02-22,Reverse Discrimination in Job Interview? Does it really exist and should I speak up?,rockedrepublic,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/473to9/reverse_discrimination_in_job_interview_does_it/,"I'm going to tell you guys a story about a job interview I recently had. The whole experience was negative for me and others have told me to tell my school about the experience, but I figured I'd ask Reddit to see if I am in the wrong first. Here goes.

I am in graduate school. I applied for a diversity internship program held county-wide. It is one of very, very few paid internship programs for people in my year. The application required extensive personal and research essays as well as professional recommendations. I probably spent about 10-12 hours total on the application. Before applying, however, I attended an information session to ask whether candidates of only certain races were supposed to apply (I am 100% Caucasian; my mother came from a European country, but I am still Caucasian by ethnicity) and was told the program was intended for diverse candidates of different backgrounds and not at all based on race. So, I applied.

I was selected for an interview. I was one of three white applicants selected for an interview (they sent out a list of interviewees and I knew many of them personally from school; maybe 30-40 others selected in total out of around 90-100 applicants). I was floored about the interview because this job is basically my dream internship. I then spent more time and effort preparing for the interview, going in on a weekend for an interview, getting my suit dry cleaned, etc. 

Finally, the interview. I was definitely nervous, I will say that. However, I usually interview well and am generally confident in interviews. The woman who greeted me (one of the two interviewers who would be interviewing me) introduced herself and was friendly. She brought me into the room to meet the second interviewer. The second interviewer, a man, shook my hand and introduced himself. The woman was probably of Asian decent and I believe the man was African American. 

Right from the introduction, the man would not make eye contact with me and seemed annoyed to meet me. I tried to think nothing of it, but starting off an interview on that note did, admittedly, put me on edge a bit. I will say I was more stiff than I would normally be in an interview, but I wasn't an absolute train wreck. From there, the woman began asking me some pretty standard interview questions. I answered them all, trying to make eye contact with both interviewers while answering. The woman was polite and nodded at things I said, etc. The man refused to make eye contact with me and stared into space most of the time. When asked about why I thought I was a good fit for the diversity program (this question was geared towards why I was a diverse person), and I explained my background and how that made me a diverse candidate. The man rolled his eyes and scoffed at me while I was explaining this. He still did not make eye contact. He did ask me a few questions towards the end-- more general interview questions but he never made eye contact with me while I was speaking and seemed very flippant with me throughout the interview. I walked out of the interview confused and feeling extremely uncomfortable with how it went.

We were told we would hear back in 5-7 days about who would be selected. After 24 hours, I received an email that I had been rejected. 

After speaking with others (friends, a couple trusted mentors, other classmates) it was pointed out that maybe I should say something to the school. The program told us in the information session that selection would not be based on race but based on a background/childhood that made you a ""diverse"" person. Had they told me that they did not want White applicants, then I would not have applied. I was also very straightforward in my personal statement, I explained how my childhood was certainly unique and how that made me a diverse applicant with a unique background. In the essay I even mentioned that I had never been discriminated against for my race, ethnicity, socio-economic background or sexual orientation but that what I had outlined in my statement was what made me unique. If my personal statement was enough to get me an interview, then why string me along and interview me like that when I wasn't a good fit in the first place, right?

So my question is this: should I say something about this to the school or to the program? I've read a lot of well thought out essays and articles on how reverse discrimination does not exist. I understand that and I do think there may be some truth to that. I also realize that the male interviewer could have been having a bad day. However, I spoke with another applicant who had the same interviewers and did not get the same reaction from the man that same morning in his interview. I guess my question is whether this is a real issue that I should be concerned about or whether I got what was coming by applying to a program labelled as a diversity program while being a white woman, even though the program urged me to apply because it was not looking exclusively for racially diverse applicants."

We're considered a hybrid between business side and software sides of things, have experience on both ends of the spectrum, a jack of trades is what I refer to it as. 

Currently, I work as a intern business intelligence analyst at a big Public company. (8month intern)  I gather and utilize design, requirements, analysis, process improvement, scope management, and project coordination with stakeholders. I work cross-functionally with every department (engineers, I/T, supply chain, procurement, inventory managers, and project managers). I analyze vast amounts of data daily, prepare reports for senior level Execs, and spot anomalies in data. I took it upon myself to learn VBA and automate reporting (300 lines of code, felt very impressed), made queries in Access, Pivot Table for proof of concept and analysis, and minor SQL experience (company won't allow SQL server for me). I enjoy the project management side of things, managing teams, working cross-functionally, essentially being the ""glue"" between teams and achieving required objectives. I have experience in Java/SQL/ and Python (personal learning).

My question is:

1. Should I get a project management certification and work in the BA field? Work up to Senior BA --&gt; Project Manager?


2. Go into the I/T side of things, do more development and software testing, create applications to interface backend databases. (develop my Java/SQL/ and Python programming further?) 


3. Go towards a database position? move towards the DBA field?

I have such a strong passion for both project management, data analytics and I/T/programming and just confused where to specialize in. I don't want to move into another BA role, and my next intern role comes in September (4 months), really trying to figure out how to best move on from a business intelligence analyst is. I feel like at 25, i really need to figure out what direction of the Business technology world I want to go into. I feel like I should have accomplished a lot more. Probably putting stress on myself, but just looking for advice. "

I was hoping to get input on a situation that's stressing me out (using a burner account since at least one coworker knows my main account.) I'm currently a dev at a small place (~20 employees.) I was an intern here during my last two years of school and got a full-time offer before graduation that I took, so I've been here a total of 3.5 years (2 intern + 1.5 full-time.) I'm in an area where there aren't many developer positions, which is part of the reason why I took this job. Recently I heard through the grapevine that the company has been struggling financially and that a larger company may be looking at acquiring us (and may be trimming fat.) Needless to say, I'm ready to hit the eject button.

In a few days I'll have my resume polished off and will soon thereafter start applying for other positions and contacting people I know at other companies. However, the fact that I have to do this behind my employer's back is stressing me out. In some ways, I secretly wish they'd just lay me off (even without severance) so I could have a month or two to focus on finding a good job. I regret taking this position, since I largely did it mostly out of comfort and laziness (not having to interview immediately after graduation.)

The thing that stresses me out most it that I'll likely be applying to lots of out of state jobs, which would mean 1-2 days away from the office for interviews. As I'm single (no kid-related excuses) and only take off longer chunks of time to visit family, I'm certain my employer will catch on after the third or fourth random Thursday I take off as vacation/personal-leave. It is kinda obvious in a smaller office like mine.

Are there any common strategies for someone in a situation like mine? Is lying about illness (e.g. I'm not feeling good and won't be coming in tomorrow) acceptable?

I'm currently working in the EU but am from Asia.

With limited research, I understand that a Tier 2 (General) visa is what we'd need to process.

A few questions I couldn't find the answers for:

 - Can we process this as a Tier 5 visa ? Start it as an internship and eventually convert to full employment. Haven't been able to completely understand if software engineers come under any of the Tier 5 categories.

 - Can a Tier 2 visa be sponsored by a company other than the employer ?
 - How much time does it take to process the Tier 2 sponsorship licence ? Are there some additional hurdles for a young startup ?

I was taken in by a startup in Boston as an intern because they liked my past experience and because I'm a senior. The expectation is that if I do well enough (which I expect to) that I'll get some sort of offer later down the line. However, I've only been there for about a week.

What's the standard here? Do I tell them that I have an offer, and tell them that it would help if they decided on hiring me or not fairly soon? Or do I just say nothing and wait for a possible offer in the next couple of months? I really, really enjoy the work at the startup, as well as the environment and people, and I'm pretty sure I'll enjoy it more than the larger company I have an offer for already.

I switched into CS from EE my senior year (what) - which was Fall of 2014 - and I'm going to be graduating at the end of this semester.

So I'm applying for jobs now and I'd really appreciate if I could get an answer from you guys to this question I've got:

EE really wrecked my GPA. I just generally disliked it and it didn't play to my strengths. 

But CS is a whole other story - I really enjoy what I'm doing and I've been consistently getting &gt; 3.5 every semester since (which is 3 semesters). So I'd put my major GPA on my resume but there's a little problemo there: somehow some EE classes seeped in as electives (that's how I'm able to graduate in 5 years) so my major GPA is about a 3.3. So that's the backstory, here's the question: would it be weird if I had a 'GPA since CS major' and only that on my resume?


I explain my situation in my cover letter but there's no way I can guarantee that anyone's going to look at that, right? As a side concern, given my predicament, I only have one CS related internship experience listed on my resume. So I've really got to highlight that I've only been a CS major for 1.5 years (without completely relying on my cover letter) but I have no clue how. I'd love some input on that too if you guys have any ideas.

I need work experience to get an internship, but I need an internship to get work experience.

My GPA isn't horrible; it's in the high-2's, but the problem is that with the school I go to, everyone is an ""intelligent, hard-working student"", so at any given Career fair on campus that I go to, with my cookie-cutter CS classes that I've taken, I don't really stand out from other students, even if I may stand out among CS students at another university, and on top of that they won't even talk to you if you're below a 3.0.

I'm not really sure where to go from here as far as getting an internship for this summer.  I've put out plenty of feelers, and I'm even talking to a company that is adamant about not giving internships, but wants me for a co-op next spring/summer, and so I'm still left out to dry in terms of what I'm going to do this summer.  I really don't want to make it another summer where I just wake up, go to the gym, and do chores around the house all day, I want real work experience in the field, and I don't want to wait until spring of my junior year to do it.

I've been told that Craig's list is an option, but most of that stuff is part-time jobs by small ventures that don't really have a need/desire to take on a summer intern.

Any of your guys' insights as to what you guys did while in school to get your feet in the water would be much appreciated, thanks for listening to my whining about not being able to find work for this summer :-)"

So I'll start with some backstory: 

I've smoked weed for a while. I've recently cut down a lot. I wasn't caught that much when I did, and it was maybe 2-4 times a week. My parents don't understand this. And they simply won't. I have stolen money from my parents for this (estimate of maybe 300$ total)

My dads family has a history of becoming deadbeats and shit like that. His brother died while tripping acid. My dad thinks I'm the most disrespectful child he's ever met. My dad is a hard worker. He went to college and struggled. 

My parents ask me to get a B+ average, and I consistently get A's and B's in school. I have never had a job. I play 2 sports, field and football. I have a 4.175 GPA and I am going to become something related to computer science. I'm very good at programming, as I have made a full database using NodeJS and MongoDB. I can get into the colleges near me, as long as I get good SAT scores. My classes next year are going to finish up my required credit, and they'll finish a math class an English class and public speaking for college. I have ADHD, and I take medication for it. I am lazy. Positive reinforcement has worked before for me. I got 99th percentile in math on the PSATs, 88th in English, 97th overall. I'm a very confident person, if this matters. I can get an internship in a computer job without going to college. This can be done via my computer programming class. 

Cool now that that is out of the way, I'll get to the story. 

My parents found a stash of weed and alcohol I had. My mom asked if I stole her alcohol before, and I said no even though I had. That was in the bag along with $5, the weed, a makeshift smoking device, and a lighter. They're mad, because they thought I quit. 

They are going to cut off my phone if I don't get a job in 2 weeks and study for the SATs 1 hour a week. This isn't the real issue. I could go without a phone, and I could realistically tell them to fuck off and do whatever I want. 

I have offered a compromise: I'll take a drug test monthly and I'm not forced to give up field for a job. 

I think they're overreacting, and they're not doing themselves any favors. They speak very condescending of my ideas about college (I.e. That I'm pretty much fully qualified to get in if I do good on the SATs). My dad says I should rely on his experiences, because he got out of the middle of bumfuck nowhere. 

They think I have no chance in college or life, because I don't know how to work. They want me to go, however. They have said repeatedly they don't want me going to a college because it's a party school. It's my 2nd choice. 

This whole situation has physically angered me because of how they handled it. I could have punched holes in the wall, but I didn't. I was pissed they were confronting me. 

So Reddit, what should I do. I need life advice here please help me. 

Ask for any clarifications, even the colleges. I don't really care. "

A bit of background about me: I earned a chemical engineering degree several years ago and went to work in a design firm in Arizona. The notion was that I'd work for a few years and then get a job in the Pacific Northwest, where I've always wanted to live. A few years pass and my office is going through major layoffs due to work shortages. I've been looking for jobs in the Northwest for a while and am beginning to understand that with my skills, the only places I can reliably hope to find work is in the southeast and Texas, and I'm not interested in either of these options. My only aim was to get back to the northwest, and I didn't enjoy my work enough to compromise on that goal.

So I go back to school for computer science. I get an internship in software testing and it's looking good. then I get the motherload: an internship with a big company in Oregon. And it's amazing. I'm doing some engineering, but I'm writing code too and I'm networking well and I'm very hopeful that I'm finally going to make it.

I have recently received an offer from them, but here's the kicker: it's neither in Oregon, nor is it in software. I'd be working in chemical engineering in Phoenix, which I'm less than enthusiastic about. I am worried that the offer is hard and fast and haven't asked if relocation to Oregon is even a possibility,  and now that I'm coming up on the expiration of the offer I'm afraid to ask. Above all I'm concerned that I'll be laid off again and that I'll never be able to get a job in software engineering, which is what I'm more interested in these days. However, while I have had some promising developments in my job search, nothing substantial has materialized. I don't know if it's a good idea to accept this offer as a safety, knowing that if I can't transfer back to Oregon or into a software position I won't be looking to put down roots here. It's a good company with a good culture, but all I want is to be back in the Pacific Northwest, more than anything. 

Do you have any advice on what I should do?

edit: it bears mentioning that I really don't want to burn this bridge if I don't have to. This company is really exceptional to work for and they do hire software people, so if working for them in that capacity in the future is a possibility I'd jump to take it."

&gt;UNI: Yeah.

&gt;Me: Viruses gone too?

&gt;UNI: Yep! Learned how to boot from USB as well. But that's not the weird part. Nearly all the other issues were caused by that batch file.

&gt;Me: Any idea why?

&gt;UNI: Gaze not into the Abyss.

&gt;Me: THAT'S MY LINE

&gt;UNI: Actually, I think he thought it would let him bypass his work firewall.

&gt;Me: Really? What was it called, FirewallKey.bat?

&gt;UNI: Yep.

&gt;Me: Well, hush my mouth I guess.

&gt;Me: Still, one of these days you should see what one of my clients does to everything he touches. 

&gt;UNI: Should I?

&gt;UNI: Actually yeah I should.



~fin

Intrepid reader, this is a cautionary tale. Don't judge people based on their age, as they can surprise you. Also, apparently getting past the work firewall is totally the way to solve all your problems, and you should all definitely 100% totally do that and recommend that to all your friends (/s)

Once I'm confident I can go back to writing regularly and I'm confident that my depression isn't worsening, it'll be back to your regularly scheduled AL programming - unless you want more intern stories. 

TL;DR: Intern learns quick; Firewalls are bad, you can totally get away with no web browser, and Windows belongs on a Mac.

I am an intern at a small film production and part of that work is every once in a while to copy the mail adresses of all the people that ordered dvds into mac in a subcategory. 
Example: 
1. In Outlook we get a mail when someone buys a dvd in a folder, lets call it sales. 

2. I check if that adress is already in our contacts in the contacts app

3. If not I add the Name and Mail and Country into the Form and then put that adress into a subcategory for the year the ordered in.

4. We use those mails to send a newsletter to all those adresses in the respective countries. 

Is it possible to code a bot to check if the mail adress is in the Contact App, if yes, dont do anything, if no, add to contacts with all the above mentioned information. And would it be difficult to code?

I would just like to know if it is worth the effort.

Since I can't be hired for a software position or anything technical that is actually relevant to my major, I thought it might be useful to get different positions that are at least at engineering firms/somewhat related to STEM. One thing I recently landed for this summer was an opportunity to teach minority girls in STEM/aid in the program's overall execution, but I'm wondering if it's a waste of time if I don't end up doing anything really technical. Another option is looking into doing scientific research, since I'm considering entering the biomed/chemical industry after graduation. Ideally I'd end up doing both this summer, but if I only manage the STEM organization thing, should I even bother or just keep looking?"

I appreciate it. I made a similar post in r/PCMasterRacebuilds Trying to get as many opinions as possible. **tl;dr below**.


What follows is background information. **You can skip ahead to important build info below.**

As the title states, I am trying to piece together a budget entry gaming build for my girlfriend. I built my first PC last year (March 2016) and I am in love with [this thing](http://pcpartpicker.com/user/theflashking/saved/#view=tBLKHx). I was already transitioning into the PC gaming world from console, and building this machine has all but clinched that transition (Kingdom Hearts… *sigh*).

I am wanting to share gaming with my girlfriend who lives in a different city than I do, and thought I could use what I learned in building my pc to build her something to get her started. I really hope to get her hooked, but I have to get her going first. With that in mind, I set to building the following.


**Build info starts here**

**Here is what I have put together for her.**

Priorities (**in bold**) and things I have considered as well as have in mind:


 * **Budget**: I am building this myself, using money I earn from my internship. Though I’d love to splurge on her, I cannot afford that right now (collegeeeee). So this is a top priority. Trying to stay max ~$500. Less would be better.

 * **Functionality**: Budget in mind, I still need this to be a good experience for her. So I’m pushing that GPU as best I can. Pretty graphics and smooth playability with current games is a must. Do not want to turn her off to gaming because of a crappy experience caused by her pc. With that said, **I am concerned with bottlenecking the GPU with the CPU**. But that’s ok at first if it lets me get it off the ground at a much lower price.

 * GPU: I want to get her the best manageable GPU I can. 

 * Scalability: I picked these parts with future upgrades in mind. If she really finds things she likes to play, I want to be able to flesh out the machine in the future. An i3 or i5 cpu maybe. A GTX 980 gpu. If I want to be able to get there in the most affordable way possible, I am insuring I have the proper socket mobo in place for those future Intel CPUs. In other words, this is why I am not using AMD.

 * Peripherals/Accessories: Since she's a total noob to gaming, I do not plan on going all out with a gaming mouse, killer headset, and mech keyboard (this one is actually a maybe. Having someone I love type on anything different almost feels like betrayal). I plan to fish around for a keyboard here, a mouse there, two monitors there. Just to get her by at first. Leaves great room for future presents/upgrades too! :D

 * Case: Left it out on purpose, since that will largely depend on her preference (she likes all things ""cute"" &gt;.&gt; can't blame her) and my comments for functionality. Chances are we'd get something I'd have to paint for her to get the colors right.

I could really use tips on where to best get affordable parts. I am not above buying quality used products or finding functioning parts from other machines (except for the GPU). 

I have only built a computer once. I really enjoyed it. I have done and continuing doing more and more research so I can produce the best machine with the right reasons behind them. 

I am open to all tips. Thank you so much for reading again, and for your help!
tl;dr: Building a budget entry level gaming PC for my girlfriend prioritizing budget then functionality. Important bits in bold. Would appreciate reviews.

* *Edits:* Reasons for leaving out case; Edited parts list. I really want to get that i5 in there but the money, it hurtss.... &gt;.&lt;.

* *Edits 2/24/16 1:22 PM:* put in the i5 &gt;.&gt;

* *Edits 2/24/16 2:22 PM:* dropped the i5 &lt;.&lt; budgets man. That will probably be my final point of contention, that cpu"
47d3zj,2,2016-02-24,"How is it like being an intern, and how should you put interns to better use? From an intern's perspective",anton164,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/47d3zj/how_is_it_like_being_an_intern_and_how_should_you/,"Having joined a start-up as an intern just after the company’s inception in May 2013, I can soon boast about completing my third year as an intern, the bottom of the office food chain, and I'm loving it.

I was hired coming straight out of high-school with very limited coding experience. You might be wondering what value a fresh high school graduate could bring to a startup, and frankly so did I. 

Thanks to my founders' well-guided approach to interns, I have been able to succeed with a variety of tasks at the company. That's a win-win, I've learned a lot from them and hopefully I've also contributed to their growth.

If you’re a student, or currently unemployed, hopefully, I can pass on some motivation. Pursuing an internship at a startup has its challenges, but if you’re motivated and passionate about what you do, or rather, what you would like to be doing, there are tons of opportunities in line.

If you’re someone higher up the food chain, you will hopefully gain some insight into the bottom-up perspective and how you can put interns to better use.

Check out the full article on our blog, https://ardoq.com/being-an-intern-at-a-software-startup/, as I've used images and already formatted it nicely. The bottom line is, HIRE INTERNS and do it well."

Don't know what to think about it.",thebargainartist,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/47dn71/had_my_first_real_second_interview_yesterday_dont/,"Backstory: Originally applied to an internship with Beauty Procurement for a major grocery retailer that I've worked for for 8 years. Interview went well, but the director wanted me to apply for a full time salary position as an assistant to a buyer. Had phone interview and was selected for a second in-person interview.

I guess I'm just asking other people with experience in a second interview if my experience is normal and/or positive. Basically, I've met all of the people who work in this department before and am fairly familiar with the work they do there since I've worked in an area that requires their support on a lot of things. My second interview was with my would be boss if I get hired for this position. I went into her office and sat down and she said she would be going over the specifics of the position and would ask me some questions. She also had my resume in front of her. The whole interview was an hour long but she didn't really ask me any questions about my skills. She asked me a few from my resume about my degree, some job related systems that I knew, and how comfortable I was with Microsoft office and Excel which I said ""very"". The only thing I feel weird about was when she asked me how I use Excel now...which I don't and said I haven't used it since college (I graduated in August 2014) which kind of concerns me because this area of the company basically lives in Excel. 

All in all, I don't know how to feel about it because I did prepare for the standard behavioral and skill questions, but she and I just talked about the business and things related to the position. I think we left on a positive note because we were talking about our personal lives for a little bit, but I don't know. She said she is still doing interviews and if selected, I'll have at least one other interview with the director (who asked me to apply) and another member of the team. I feel like if she asked me the standard interview questions and I answered them how I had prepared, I would have a better idea of how I stand. So I guess can anyone tell me what they think or what their experience were in the second interview process?"

So I'm a CS major (sophomore) and I'm in a bit of a dilemma. I don't enjoy CS (gasp). I'm not like the other kids here who all seem so enthusiastic about it and create these insane side projects, win hackathons, etc. I'm in 3410 now and doing ok (still early in the semester). I've taken 1110 (B), 2110 (A-), 2800 (B), and 4320 (B-). My overall GPA is a 3.5.

I don't want to change my major, because it's a hassle, it's too late, and I'd like to have a technical degree. I basically just do the coursework, and not much else during the day. I tried joining clubs, but none accepted me. 

As for career interests, I'm more interested in the product management/business development side of things. I received an internship offer a few days ago from a Fortune 500, however, it's in a smaller city not known for technology or really anything (unlike SF, NY, Seattle). The company's HQ is in this city. It's a software internship, and they really didn't give me any details on it. However, I'm concerned I will be unable to contribute because I really don't feel like I can program (and moreover I find it extremely boring). As an aside, they're paying me $900/week, how does that compare considering it's a very low cost of living area?

I just feel lost. Any thoughts or suggestions? Anything at all would help me at this point. Thank you."

So I've been pretty lucky to have interned for the company that eventually hired me while I was still in college. The interviews and questions for my internship weren't very extensive so I never had a tough entry-level interview because I had already proved myself as an employee when I was applying for a Software Engineer position.  I never applied for any other jobs but I'm currently fishing around.

 I found a dream job, and I know it's a longshot, but I've already heard back and they are putting me through the screening process. The first step is a coding test. I've researched and found that it is probably 20-30 MCQ and 2 coding application problems. I've been out of school for awhile now and I'm not that quick to remember specific details about CS stuff without taking a while to think about it or googling it.

It is now at a 2.64.

I have several projects, have done an internship at a pretty well reputed company. They do not ask for GPA until the on site interview. Lets say Company A is my dream company. 

I applied for a position at Company A in December 2015, and I was contacted by a recruiter to set up a phone interview in early January. I excelled at the phone interview- it was basic algorithms and data structures. Then, I was put on the ""fast track"" - according to my recruiter, and invited for an on site. He made me fill out a second application, this time with a full copy of my transcript. 

I am flown to the company's headquarters in late January, and they have 4 interviews. All of them go well. One of the interviewers even remarks that even she ""wouldn't have thought of such an optimal solution"". 

I email personal thank you notes to all the interviewers and the recruiter.

I fly back, and was told to expect an answer in within 2 weeks. The two weeks pass- no response. So I email the recruiter, politely asking for an update. Until a week ago, I didn't get a response. The recruiter calls me and tells me that ""We unfortunately have decided to pursue other candidates at this time"". I ask him why, and he says that "" we require that students maintain at least a 3.3 gpa for this position. You excelled at the interviews and seem very qualified, but this is our company policy"".  

I'm slightly shocked and surprised. I know some finance companies have GPA cutoffs but why do tech companies? I thoroughly read through the position requirements on the company site, and a GPA requirement is not publicly listed."

I have a keen interest in getting an internship in silicon valley for the experience. 

Particularly, I am very keen to apply for an internship in Google as I love Android and would want to develop for it. 

As mentioned in the title, I would like to get advice on what are the things I should be learning or doing now to increase my chances of getting such an internship.

I understand the need for personal side projects but so far the only side project I have done was a bot written in Java that would host a Mafia game on Skype based on user input. 

What kind of projects should I be doing and are there other things I should be learning/doing now?

Tldr: first year undergrad wants real advice for getting an internship in google"

I know I need a full night's worth of rest, so I'm going to study for an hour than probably go to sleep, so I can get up extra early and study for a while. All together, it looks like I'll have about 7 hours or less to study.

This will be my second interview ever and my first with a potential internship on the line. What are some things I must ABSOLUTELY do in my short study time?

To put it another way, you're going into an interview, what are some quick things to never forget?"

I've been tasked with designing a new course for students nearing the tail end of my college's (2-year) CS and CIS/IT curriculum. The goal is to incorporate skills/experience that are otherwise lacking in a vanilla CS and IT curriculum, and which would be useful for students who are aiming for employment or internship very shortly. We already have all the standard courses in basic programming and algorithms, data structures, pre-architecture, discrete math, networking, Unix-y scripting, some security topics, etc.

Off the top of my head, I'm envisioning something like a ""DevOps"" course, maybe with topics in:

* SCM (version control, release engineering)
* Key-value stores, caching
* Cloud services (computation, content delivery)
* Preparing for interview questions

In your experience, what are some topics that are lacking in new grads, and which are feasible to incorporate into a small (maybe 2 or 3-unit) course? Keep in mind this would go into a course curriculum, so any specific names of software/vendors are generally a bad idea.

If you have any advice, I'd be glad to hear it."

The main issue I am facing is I haven't worked in a big corporate firm or a job with a big title and dedicated roles .  

As a personal hobby and enthusiast I used to review a lot of high end portable consumer audio gear or in short  niche audiophile equipment  while pursuing my Diploma in Electronics 6 years back .  After finishing my course I ended up working as an intern for a small startup which was into imports and distribution of  similar audio equipment.

Over the next 4-5 years , being one of the core members of the startup and since the owner / investor was staying in a different country I was the main person handling the business overall and with my limited knowledge I helped the company expand its business by doing the following and learning each day - 


**Retail-**

Handling all online sales accounts like eBay , Amazon etc. 

Being the key person co-coordinating with local vendors , incorporating new local brands and deciding on the pricing , doing the organic marketing / handling social media accounts .

**Country wide exclusive distribution/ imports of brands -**

&gt;Researching on new brands for the market and deciding which ones to get to the country , handling the price negotiations , imports documentation etc 

&gt;Running sales promotions ,media promotions etc.

&gt;Finally working towards the promotion of new brands by conducting reviews , ads etc 


    While doing all of the above to ensure highest level of customer service satisfaction , I handled some of the important pre-sales (high value customers) or post sales customer issues which my team couldn't handle .  This could be advising a confused customer in making the right purchase decision or technical advise and in case of post sales- helping an angry customer resolve their issue or ensuring they become repeat customers instead of disappointed ones shaming the brand or company online or on forums .

  Over a period of time I realized I was good at my job and liked it cause I loved delighting a customer by helping with the right decision, resolving any issue and trying to keep them happy while trying to get new brands and add more products to our catalog . 

   In the last one year I was also part of a team which developed their own product and brand and got decent success and great reviews from the first product's sales testing .

While working ,  I also finished my 3 years of bachelors in Business Management (Marketing) and wish to pursue a masters course in the near future after I gain some more experience.

Now due to a fall out with the owner of the company i worked for due to difference in vision and expansion, I have quit the job and been looking for something new and challenging in any creative field or marketing / business development related.

The company I worked for was a pretty small one which started with just 2-3 employees and has about 10-12 now in last 6 years . From 50-100 orders a month to about 2000+ orders  today and 400% increase in sales. The way of doing things was also unlike most corporate companies since there was less stress of reports or lot of paper work and more on getting things done while keeping the overheads as low as possible . So I seem to be lacking when it comes to corporate way of doing things and the tools they use for sales analysis etc but I believe shouldn't take much time to learn and pick up. As for job titles and roles as you can see from above - being a startup there was no fixed role and the namesake title also kept changing from sales executive to business development and eventually a Product Manager handling the complete line up.

All these big terms I see for most job positions and their requirements do not make a lot of sense to me and confuse me a lot when it comes to making a CV/ Resume of my own and applying for suitable jobs. 
I really have no clue how to put the above experience in a systematic manner on a resume with the right keywords  and what kind of new job to look for.

Any pointers would be helpful :). Extremely sorry and apologetic  for the long post but this is the shortest I could cut it down to and still feel there is so much missing .

Tomorrow I have a phone interview with a person from Merrill Lynch for a summer internship position with one of their financial advisors.  I'm at a decent school majoring in economics.  This is the first interview I will have done for a ""real"" job, let alone one in wealth/investment management.  Does anybody have any insights as to what a ""typical"" interview for this kind of thing might involve?  The interview is supposed to last 45 minutes, and I want to be prepared for the questions they're likely to throw my way.  I know some computer programming (not sure if this job involves any of that), have experience from other jobs with customer service, and I have a strong-ish work ethic (worked 65 hours/week last summer).  I plan on highlighting these qualities, but if there's anything I'm missing I would greatly appreciate your advice.  Thanks!"

On top of all, I have experience using R (a lot of experience), Stata, SPSS and some Python.

Unfortunately I had a very rough second semester at this school where I got around a 2.35. Averaging the 2 semesters I've spent at my new school comes out to a dismal 2.8. I wouldn't say it was the increased rigor that was solely responsible for my bad semester, but mainly due to some really stupid decisions I made involving procrastination and laziness (putting off projects until the day before the deadline, not studying for tests, etc).

I'm worried that despite my otherwise good track record, the single bad semester is going to sabotage my chances of getting an internship this summer. It looks especially bad considering it was so recent which means downward trend instead of upward. 

How do I put together my resume given this situation? I would hate to not be able to put my GPA for my original school and have my 2.8 being the only thing they see (or having no GPA and have them assume the worst). Can I put both GPA's?

The only other thing I have going for me is that I have had a prior internship the summer before. In a worst case scenario I may be able to go back there but the commute is horrendous and the pay isn't a huge amount. 

I am a computer science major by the way.

I am going to spend a year in Pune working to a big company there and I would love if someone could help me with some questions because I am very excited and terrified about this opportunitie at the same time . First of all, I am doing this as a way to get out of my confort zone, meet new people with different ways of seeing life, experience a cultural shock, get professional experience to improve my resume and so on.

1. My first question is about how influenced is the city by western culture. I am a little familiar with some tradicional aspects of Índia and my understanding of it is very superficial so a lot of what I can ask may sound superficial like: how easy is to find toilet paper there? Or restaurants with cutlery? Or western movie teaters and stores? I know I may look close minded asking these but I wanna be aware of how much of a cultural shock I will need to be prepared for.

2. How tolerant are people to white male foreigners? Can I be expect prejudice for being Christian? I heard foreigners in general are very well treated there and other interns didn't complain about their social experience.

3. How is the social life there in Pune? What do young people (less than 25) do for fun? Are there public events where you can meet people? Are man and women judged by being friends and walking together alone? And that leaves me to my final question...

4. How about the dating life in Pune? In my self aware very close minded notion of indian culture I see dating and pre marital sex as a impossibility in India due to very stricted religions and other aspects of the culture. I am not going there to party and be crazy, but it would be cool to know if there is a possibility of not going throught a dry spell for a year.

Sorry if I ofended anyone with my ignorance wich is just what I hope to be loosing by going there. I Hope someone can be helpful and I expect to have a good experience"

This is also such a tough question. On one hand you have to say ""Boyz n the Hood"" because  that movie was so powerful and amazing. On the other hand you have to say ""Friday"" because the one liners in that movie are just amazing. On the third hand, who wouldn't want to listen to Cedric The Entertainer's amazing stories all day long while cutting people's hair in Barbershop.

We apologize to you too and really to everyone. The sound bleed during Lana was one on hand somewhat unavoidable given her show and size of the conflicting black keys show. On the other hand we could have had more speakers/audio there, and that's something we've changed for 2016 to try and help. Deadmau5 issue had to do with his brand new production and it not being able to be tested enough in advance. Regardless of whose fault it is/was, we apologize and it won't happen again.

It can get hot out there and very tiring. Additionally make sure you plan how you are getting to and leaving the festival each day (which really depends where you are coming from and wanting to go to at the end of the night). Also make sure you look at our Info section for what to bring and what not to bring, and make sure you come with your cell phone fully charged and maybe even a battery case if your phone goes through all its juice. Other than that, just come with a great attitude and your best looking shades and you'll be good. :)

However, what we will be doing is messaging and educating folks on where bathrooms are, so people all don't flock to one area of bathrooms. Certain areas are so overused because of their placement, and others, which aren't that far away at all, are under used. We are so limited by space onsite that we can't add any more, but we think if we educate folks on where they can go, they can make a better informed decision and not wait in lines.

[Wouldn't it have benefited them to pick a weekend further away from you anway? They haven't announced yet either so I can't imagine this was part of their plan.

However, they picked a weekend two weeks after us at a site they did not yet have the permit for, so once they officially got denied the permit, they had to scramble to move those acts to a different weekend, and therefore didn't have all the options in the world.  There's plenty of reasons that go into picking a date, and I'm sure routing artists was a major one, but also pretty sure being competitive specifically to us was another reason.

We are supportive of other events, but we want to create a scenario and environment where everyone can be successful. We were opposing the AEG event because they were trying to go two weeks after us with the same exact type of lineup and that would have resulted in both events losing. Since they are doing their event later in the summer, we are not fighting to prevent it. 
[1.\) Why bring back the Strokes? They were awesome in 2014, yeah, but to bring them back so soon is questionable.

Undercard or headliner, doesn't matter.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47kxxc/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/d0dn9gh?context=5)|Hey! Not sure if you've been following reports or news about The Strokes, but they may or may not have some new music in the works for 2016. This would be their first batch of new tunes in, well, just about a half decade. Kind of a big deal. Also, they've played a total of 8 shows in North America in the last decade, so I'd say it's a pretty big deal any time they hit the stage. Regarding question #2 - I regret not booking Rod Stewart. Would have been great.

Will this be implemented at GovBall this year? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47kxxc/iama_the_promotersproducers_of_the_governors_ball/d0dpv45?context=5)|Hi there. We would love to have T-barrier set ups but our main stage field isn't that wide (it's very linear).

47lrw2,2,2016-02-25,How do I advance from a general IT job?,likeafoxx,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/47lrw2/how_do_i_advance_from_a_general_it_job/,"First, my current situation isn't but so bad. My boss treats me well and stands up for me even to the president/owner. We have ~90 employees (40 non-contract/deploy) and a good chunk of the employees are easy to get along with, which always helps. I make a bit over $45k/yr which feels low, but maybe it fits the position.  I have asked for raises and got one last year but it was less than 5%.

So the job is that I'm *the* IT guy for three locations, two in state and one in Florida (can't wait for an issue that requires me to go there). As plenty of you know that comes with the perk of getting to do a lot of different tasks which is a blessing and a curse. My daily work consists of standard hardware/software related tasks, network admin, Office365 admin (all parts), VoIP service admin, employee hire/term IT tasks, and recently I got an intern that I train (yay minion!). Basically anything IT, nothing special.

edit: Except for the software listed below everything is SaaS.

The problem is that there's not any growth available. The budget is pretty tight (another part of my job this year has been to design the budget with my boss) and most of the laptops are over 2.5 years old (only about 20 are business grade and have Windows Pro). The plan is to replace the laptops over three years because of budget requirements and so that it lines up with how we are planning our life cycle replacement plan. The only ""server"" that we have is a small windows box that I have apache running on serving our opensource helpdesk, asset management software, and MySQL. If possible, my boss and I want to get a Dell server with 2012 R2 on it and that would give me something to train on and learn more, though it doesn't fit in the current budget. As for the networking equipment it's a Cyberoam firewall, CheckPoint firewall, unmanaged Cisco switch, and a UniFi switch + 3 WAPs.

When looking at job postings it seems to be helpdesk, full sys admin, or specialized. When I look at my current skill set it seems as if a ""jr sys admin"" job or something would be what I'm fit for but I can't seem to find positions like that. So with all that info known, how would you suggest I progress?

Also, apologies for what's probably a poorly written/formatted post."
47lthi,1,2016-02-25,Is a poor undergrad GPA (well below 3.0) a death sentence in the world of finance?,incompetentacademic2,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/47lthi/is_a_poor_undergrad_gpa_well_below_30_a_death/,"I have been doing some research on this matter because I graduated college with a 2.5 GPA as a chemistry major. A lot of it has to do with me not taking school seriously and honestly, just messing around in those years as opposed to pushing myself. Lots of C's in science classes, a couple of D's, and some A's and B's.

After being out of college for a few years and working in sales, I have grown a love for the world of finance. Reading the sub though, it seems like I keep hearing mixed things about poor undergrad GPAs. 

On one hand users say that you cannot really come back from a poor undergrad GPA due to competition being so rough in finance, with so many Ivy League grads with A averages and respectable internships being your competition.

On the other hand I hear users say that with some years of re-invention after college, you could get a masters, ace it, and re-invent yourself in the eyes of a lot of the firms.

I want to know if at this point, a career in finance would just be something that doesn't pan out for someone like me due to mistakes I made when I was in the 18-21 age range.

What has been your experience with this?"
47m0dz,148,2016-02-25,You're not supposed to do that!,Bakkster,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/47m0dz/youre_not_supposed_to_do_that/,"Back in high school, I interned in tech support for the school district. Generally a nice gig, didn't have far to go, and lots of experience in tech. Sometimes, though, the processes could be baffling.

First week on the job, I learned to discharge a CRT to make it safe. Get it on the bench, plug it in to ground it, power switch off, use a grounded tool to pop off the plug with your right hand, keep your left hand behind your back (so any shock wouldn't travel through your heart, of course). Easy peasy. It was also a pretty common occurrence since the district was almost entirely Apple all-in-wonder computers, from the 5000-class gray boxes to the brand-new white eMacs (but that's a story for another time).

Anyways, a relatively common and simple task that I'd sometimes do a dozen times a week. Pop the case off a 5000-class, unscrew the shielded enclosure, discharge the CRT so I could work on the machine. I felt I got pretty good at it after a few months.

About two months before graduation (and thus, no longer working), the district $BigBoss was walking through to see how we were doing.

&gt; $BigBoss: How's it going?

&gt; $Me: Pretty well.

&gt; $BigBoss: What are you working on?

&gt; $Me: Oh, this machine needs a new video driver, I'm just about to discharge the CRT so I can work on it safely.

&gt; $BigBoss: Wait a minute, you're an intern. You're not allowed to do that, it's unsafe!

So, for the next two months I got to dig around for one of the full-time techs any time I had a CRT that needed to be discharged (and there were a lot of them) and wait for them to be available to do it before I could do my job. I doubt they liked doing it any more than I liked not being able to do it, being that it was apparently dangerous and the most grunt work of grunt work tasks.

tl;dr: CRTs are easy, until they're 'dangerous', then they're just annoying."

I'll be interviewing for two positions so I do have a few questions, what are the chances that I'll be interviewing for both positions back to back (considering the time estimated for the interview is 1.5  hours). I'm wondering what I should do in preparation for this interview, this is my first technical interview (assuming that what an onsite typically consists of). She provided with the list of people who will be interviewing me so I will be doing diligent research but other than that, what else should I be doing? Like I said first technical interview, and the positions are Internal Auditor and Database Architecture and Development (both are summer internships). So I'd say the chances of me encountering programming questions could be slim? They're aware that I'm a sophomore and haven't taken the typical junior level / 300 level courses. So I shouldn't expect questions beyond data structures and general sql right?

I know people who have created amazing 3D games with a group of friends, and I have no personal projects. They have internships, I have none.

And whenever I say this, people tell me to just go create a useful app or program. I looked into trying to write just a simple Java game, and I feel like there's no way I could do it without just copying someone else's and tweaking it here and there, which I obviously don't want to do. Besides, something so simple would just be embarrassing. I can write the simple Java programs required for my courses with relative ease, but the idea of just starting something like that from scratch seems so far beyond me right now. I wouldn't know where to begin.
 
The worst part is that, with how much I have going on this semester, I don't have enough time for a worthwhile side project. I get stressed out just thinking about how I'm going to finish my school projects, the idea of piling side stuff on top of that makes me stress out even more.

I'm just kind of freaking out at this point. I lose sleep every night. I can't bear the thought of living with my parents for years because I couldn't find any work after school. Sometimes it nearly brings me to tears. It took me so much work just to get to this point (I had social anxiety as a teenager, and put off school and living on my own because of it), and now I'm feeling like it was all for nothing. I have a little over two months until the end of my college career, and I'll be applying to jobs with no experience and no projects to my name. Is there any chance I can find a programming job and make decent living in my situation? Or am I just totally screwed?"

Currently, I live in Seattle, and I work about 20 hours per week. However, Seattle being the expensive place it is, I'm already struggling to make ends meet. 

My wife and I have been considering the possibility of moving to a ridiculously tiny town in order to live with family and cut rent out of the picture. 

There are a couple of problems I'm looking for opinions on:
I can't quit my job because I can't afford to lose my health insurance or stop paying debts. So I'd be looking at about a 2 hour commute each way. Would it be possible to absorb lectures or listen to relevant podcasts or anything like that while driving (half driving half public transit)?

Internships. It seems like this is an important aspect to my burgeoning career. Obviously there are probably a lot more internship opportunities in Seattle as opposed to anywhere else in WA state. But aren't others in this program in less tech heavy areas? Are there internship opportunities that exist online?

47n7b3,2,2016-02-25,Join the Navy or take the chance and finish college?,ndd11,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/47n7b3/join_the_navy_or_take_the_chance_and_finish/,"Really long story. All my life, I wanted to be an engineer, but I had a really hard time with math. I could do it if really motivated, but I have always had motivation issues and so sometimes would do really well and other times, really poorly. So when I’m a senior in high school, I’m trying to choose a major. I talked to my parents about it and two things made me decide not to pursue engineering. A. my mom teaches at a university, so I get free tuition there. But they don’t have engineering, so if I wanted free college, I couldn’t do engineering. B. My dad really made me self-conscious about my math skills. Unfortunately, he always struggled with math too. He tried to become a full-fledged engineer, but couldn’t do the math, so went to engineering technology. So I think he sees me as similar to him and warned me against engineering siting that I’d most likely not be able to do the math.
Bearing these two criteria in mind, I continue my search. I like science, I like the outdoors and I like money. So I settled for geology. It was interesting enough, had cool applications and I could make money in an oil company or something and I could do it for free at my mom’s university. My first red flag comes up before I even officially graduate from high school. I went on a mission trip to El Salvador (already having settled on geology) and I and a small group of amazingly good friends (seriously, I’m still friends with these people 4 years later) and we build a house for a poor family. I just remember how amazing it felt to change someone’s life positively and I wanted to chase that feeling. I remember waking up one morning in El Salvador and saying out loud “why am I not becoming an engineer so I can help people?” I knew it was what I should be doing. But when I got back to the U.S. and “reality” set back in, I decided I should just do the safe thing and major in geology. 
 So I start college and do much to everyone’s surprise, really well. My sister even mentioned to me once that my dad didn’t think I’d make it through the first semester. I’m doing really well in all my classes and I enjoy the people and trips and stuff. But after a while, I start to notice that every few weeks, I have this panic where I feel like I settled for geology and should have tried engineering. I know I enjoy geology, but when I think about how I could be helping people with my life, I just feel like engineering is the answer. But I always calm myself down and again, come back to reality and say geology is good enough. 
Then, the situation gets worse. About two years in to the major (still doing really well) I start working at a factory that designs/builds motors and I also start taking calculus one. So at the factory, I’m officially an intern (my godfather knew I liked technical things and offered me a position as basically his engineering departments bitch, where I do any job no one else wants to do) and I start getting really cool projects where I’m doing easy, but interesting design work for fixturing and things of that nature. I’m great at it and I love it. Simultaneously, I start Calc. one. And you know what, I do amazing in it. I get great grades in it, my professor says I’m good at it, and I seriously can’t wait to do my homework all the time.
I see this as a sign of sorts. Not from God or anything, just an indication that maybe between my love for my job, may apparent aptitude for calculus and the fact that geology is giving me panic attacks every couple weeks, maybe I should look at engineering again.
So I look into it and speak with a professor at the school I would have to transfer to (old university didn’t have engineering) and him and I and a lot of other people think it would be good for me to do. So I make the jump. I transfer schools and begin engineering. But then I get to calculus 2 and I have no idea what is going on. It’s just one of my four classes and they all need attention and because calc was giving me the most trouble, I avoided doing homework and stuff and ended up failing it. Then, I take it again in the summer. Also a mistake. It was a 15 week class crammed into 8 and it was insane. It was four nights a week and 2.5 hour classes. Also, I had to pay for this class out of pocket because loans FASFA loans don’t cover summer courses. So that meant I had to work to actually pay for the class. So I work all day and then go to class for 2.5 hours a night for 8 weeks and ended up getting a D…and my university requires a C- to move on to Calc. 3. 
So by now, I’m revaluating me decision. I feel like I’m spinning my tires and wasting time and money. I know I like engineering and don’t want to go back to geology, but I literally can’t keep taking Calc. 2. So I switch to engineering technology for a semester and quickly decide I hate it more than anything. So I know I need to make some choices. 
Then a bad situation goes to worse. Because I failed calculus 2, my loan allowance went down. And because I made so much money for the year (albeit in order to pay for my classes), my loan goes down even more. So I have to pay about half of my tuition out of pocket and my rent. I decide that paying for classes that I hate isn’t worth it.
So what to do when you can’t do what you want to do which is engineering and helping people? I thought and thought and then I saw an ad for the navy. I was on their website on a particularly stressful dark day and decided to request information. A day or two later, I get a call from a recruiter who asks if I want to come in and talk to him.
Now I had looked at the navy before, but never seriously. My dad was enlisted in the navy and so had a bunch of other family members. But I was always operation under the whole go to college first thing. So I wasn’t going in to sign up or anything, but really just hear about what they have to say. So I walk in and the guy immediately has me take the practice ASVAB. I score a 93 percentile and he immediately says I’d be a great nuke. So he explains that they’re the guys who operate the reactors on submarines and aircraft carriers. I think it’s cool, but still, I’m not that serious about it. He says to think about it and then give him a call. So I research and talk to a select few people and decide it’s actually really cool and pretty elite and everything. You’re in the navy for six years and two of them are training for the rigorous program. So I think long and hard (for like 3 months) and because school isn’t getting better and neither is my mood, I join. I swore in and everything and am told I ship out August 9, 2016. 
So the semester finishes up. I yet again, good grades, but hate engineering technology. So I think, well, I want to finish college after the navy and I think I want to do engineering, so I might as well try Calc. 2 again. So I started the class in January and you know what? I’m doing pretty well. I’m enjoying it, I like my professor, and I even like doing my homework again. And I’m signed up for Calculus 3 this summer. And now, I’m second guessing my decision to join the navy. 
Now just because you swear in doesn’t mean you have to go. You have until your ship date to pull out. The program still sound really cool to me, but 6 years is a long time to give up your freedom. I think I’d do really well in the navy, but I also now again think I could be a great engineer in a few more years. Also, I still don’t have money to pay for more than a couple classes each semester and rent. I could borrow from my grandparents, but if I start failing classes again, I’m not wasting their money. Some days, I operate like I’m for sure going to the navy and its fine. Other days, I operate like I’m staying in college and I just seem like I’m in a better mood. Know what I mean? 
And it also bears in my mind about not finishing college. Most of my friend are finishing their degrees right now. My brother is starting his PhD, my sister is chugging through college well and my other brother finished his degree last May. So I will be the only one in my family without a degree and who dropped out and joined the navy, seemingly wasting four years of college and getting nothing for it. And it still weighs on my mind my dad not believing that I’d survive my first semester. Obviously, I survived my first semester, but his guess is sorta latently becoming true...and I feel terribly about that.

So advice?
P.S. Told you it was a long story.

For example I have knowledge of java and of object oriented programming and of windows os systems and version control like git however I don't have extensive experience with JUnit. Would something like this cause them to automatically move on to the next candidate? Is there such a thing as not knowing enough?"

So beginning a few days ago, all our networked printers started acting strange. At first, they would complete a print job, and then also print out a few strings of random characters along with a GET request string. The print jobs weren't affected so most people in the office just ignored it and didn't report it. Then one morning we come in and find out that each the big xerox copiers printed out thousands of configuration pages. This is a massive waste of resources and administration is furious. The weird thing is that the ""printed on"" date is different for each copier. Best I can figure is that's the day each one was installed. The print server's spooler had thousands of junk jobs clogging it up, and it took several resets to clean it all up. After that day, the network printers would print out the GET request after completing any job, including just making a copy, a network print job, a fax, whatever. It's largely stopped, except for the printers occasionally losing connectivity and needing to be reset.

What's happening here? My best guess is we got port scanned and somebody found a vulnerability in the print server."

You appear to be energetic and charismatic.  You appear to be just the man we are looking for.   We have an open position and think you are the man for the job.    It will involve lots of cold sales calls.  The pay is bad, you will be working in a closet (no lighting), and the hours are intense.  But I think there is good potential for you here.

(Posted a Sticker of a cup of coffee eating a Muffin)

Me:  Sir,  It is truly an honor to receive such an offer.  I am excited!  I am equipped for cold calling!  Bad Base pay is okay as long as I can earn commission!  The closet is totally fine as long as there is a computer screen and chances to leave the closet!   Let me know how I can move forward in the hiring process!

Recruiter:   Mr RoboBiscuit,  It is great to hear back from you so soon!  Well the good news for you is that you will earn excellent commission!  The other upside is that there is no base pay (upside for me).  As for the closet situation, well I'll leave that open for negotiation.  I'm glad to hear that you want to move forward in the hiring process.  For the first step we are going to need to receive your resume and a 20"" head shot.   After reviewing these pieces we will meet with you at a gentleman's club where you will pay for a night that we will all remember.   Depending on the success of that night we will determine what the outcome going forward will be.    I look forward to hearing back from you.       Sincerely,   DefinitelyARealCorp Corp.

Me:  WOW!  This job opportunity is becoming better and better by the minute!  This is indeed a very exciting opportunity for me!  I just have a couple more questions about this phenomenal opportunity ... ... ... Does the position provide any more benefits?  Perhaps a 401k Matching plan?  Does DARC Corp have any good looking female sales representatives?  Are there opportunities for advancement within the organization?     Thanks for your consideration on this matter.  -DJ ROBO BISCUIT

Recruiter:  Mr RoboBiscuit,   I am glad to hear that you are interested in this opportunity.  You bring up some good points.  DARC Corp holds the belief that benefits are very important.  So we provide all of our employees with the biggest benefit of all: Employment.  As for other sorts of benefits, we believe that we should let you help yourself.  You will feel so much more accomplished in life as you provide entirely for your retirement plan and healthcare.        As for the good looking female sales representatives question.   Well that is a question we can't really answer online.   But we can promise you a Kate Upton poster for your closet.        One benefit I forgot to mention is our great hand-me-down system.  We have subscriptions to all of the best dirty magazines and share these with our employees.  Depending on your position in the company you may gain access to these magazines starting at 3 months delayed up to only two weeks delayed as you raise higher in the company.   Believe me, there is a big difference between the magazine after two weeks and the three month marker.  Believe me ...       Opportunities for advancement are unlimited.  You have the ability at any time to refer and hire employees to work under you and you will gain a percentage of each of their revenue.  Additionally if they refer further employees you will get percentages of that as well.  You could start as a nobody and in six months have a team of hundreds working beneath you!    At a certain point we may even upgrade you from a closet to a cubicle!  Imagine having light!       Sincerely, DefinitelyARealCorp Corp.

Response -- (A Cat saying Thank you)

Me:  Wow!   This sounds like an unbelievable opportunity!  With the employees working under me ... ... Do I have to pay them?  Or perhaps they could be unpaid interns ... ...     I am beginning to feel super high motivation, the thought of having the opportunity to be working in a cubicle with LIGHT is possibly a once-in-a-lifetime chance.

In october, I had an interview with Microsoft for a summer internship. However, my recruiter quit his job and the applications were lost. None of us got an answer back (we all had the same recruiter) whether it's a yes or no. My question is: is it crucial to get an internship in the first year of your degree? I understand it's important to acquire experience, but will it affect my career if I don't have an internship this year?

Did I totally screw up?,throwawayc0l,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/47pm0u/i_gave_a_weird_interview_where_the_managers/,"I am not sure what to make of my interview today but I will briefly summarize: 

1. Managers called me 7 minutes late. It was decided earlier that it would be a web conference interview. They actually called me and requested that it would be a phone interview. I was OK with it. 

2. Within the 15 minute mark, as I was going over my technical background, one of the managers explained me about the position in this form of tone, *""I just wanted to let you know that this is what you're getting yourself involved and this is what the job is about...""* I was stunned by this and started losing hope but I was confident throughout the interview. 

3. There was one question I asked if they hired people for internship if they are out of their degree background. Not sure if this was the best question but one of them chuckled. But my other questions were good, as they said it themselves. 

I went over my experience with the tools they were requiring for the position but one of them was rather rusty. I think the communication was not the best at that part because lack of preparation due to school projects clashing and lack of sleep.

This was in web support (Access and SharePoint, maybe some SQL). I have knowledge for these things but I did my best to convey that I can do the job. I am a computer engineering student so I am confident in my abilities. But I am not sure if they understand or if they were convinced with me.

 I really want to become a developer. A little while ago I moved from a crappy retail job to the university IT help desk. I've been working there for about 6 months and looking for developer internships with no luck. I've been offered a tech support internship, but I'm worried that this will get me stuck in IT.

I graduate in May with a BS in Computer Science. My GPA is pretty good, but I don't have any experience making personal projects or in internships, and I spend so much time on course work alone, I can't see how I would ever have the time to just build something of note in my free time. Even if I had the time, I don't feel like I have the same passion for programming that other people in my position do, especially from what I read on r/cscareerquestions.

For the last two years I've been working a student job in a helpdesk-type position for my school. I don't do anything overly complicated, but I would say overall I enjoy the job. I'm thinking of pursuing IT instead of programming when I graduate, because it just seems more in line with my skill set (ability to learn new tech, troubleshooting) than being a developer would be.

To be clear, I wouldn't mind a job where my programming skills come in handy and I do some coding, not at all. I can find coding enjoyable. I just don't know if I have the passion and creative drive to be a full time software engineer. And with my lack of projects and internships, I don't like my chances of getting a job. Everything I read says you at least need to have one or the other - a portfolio of projects or real experience.

But can you do entry level IT with a CS degree and this limited job experience I have? Do employers looking for IT people even want CS degrees? 

I'm just sort of at a crossroads and feeling a little bit like a man without a country. Any advice or insight is appreciated."

I could use some advice about emailing this company I am trying to intern with. So it was last friday I was at a career expo talking to this company that I applied for a while back and the whole interaction went great. The HR representative was there and I spoke to her for a while about my past internship experiences and my recent studies. She seemed very interested in me and spoke about having an interview and a tour of the facility. Then she wrote her company email on a flyer they had and told me to email her to discuss the internship. Later that day I sent her and email saying I was very interested in interning with them and I attached another copy of resume. The email was great it seemed very professional but she still hasn't replied to me one week later.

My question is should I send her another email? Another option is to message her on Linkedin because we are ""connected"" on there. 

I want this internship really bad and I was so happy because she acted like it was already mine at the career expo.

What do I do?

Thanks"

[DAW (and preferably sample libraries\) of choice?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47puve/im_jack_wall_music_composer_of_20_games_including/d0er9sx?context=5)|1 - I'm a Cubase user, converted from Logic a few years ago, and I even used to use DP way back in the day!  As for libraries and synths, I like to use a wide variety - Cinesamples, Heavyocity, 8Dio, and Spitfire are all great, and synths like Omnisphere, Zebra, and Signal are all in my template as well!
[How common is it for professional composers to use Vienna Ensemble Pro? Can I get away with composing on just one machine?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47puve/im_jack_wall_music_composer_of_20_games_including/d0er9sx?context=5)|2 - I find it to be extremely common - almost all professional composers use VEP.  You can potentially get away with using one machine, but spreading the workload among multiple computers is definitely more efficient.
[Any tips on making my template as efficient as possible?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47puve/im_jack_wall_music_composer_of_20_games_including/d0er9sx?context=5)|3 - For me, I think it's important to have things organized so they are ready and easy to find.  That's part of why I like Cubase - I can really break things down into folders that allow me to get right to the sounds I want or need as fast as possible, and keep unused sounds and tracks off the screen to minimize clutter.
[Do you prepare the printed score as well or do you have someone who does that for you (including proofreading and orchestration\)?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47puve/im_jack_wall_music_composer_of_20_games_including/d0er9sx?context=5)|4 - I have my team of trusted orchestrators and copyists that usually help me out with scores and notation, but I am always very involved.  I always proofread myself and have a lot of dialogue so that the score ends up being exactly what is necessary to bring the music to life!
[The most important advice you'd give to a youngster willing to get into composing for media in general?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47puve/im_jack_wall_music_composer_of_20_games_including/d0er9sx?context=5)|5 - No matter what, you have to do the work.

I auditioned for ME and won. For Black Ops II, the audio director and I had worked on a kids game 10 years before and he really liked the ME games and asked me to audition for him. I won that audition and jumped up and down at LEAST 50 times. :)
 |My favorite location for VGL was the Kennedy Center! Great orchestra and 2 sold out shows. Amazing place. But we did a lot of cool things in a lot of great places. See ya Larry! 
 |I studied conducting with a guy who was a protege of the great Leonard Bernstein, Brad Keimach. It seems t hat want you visualize doing something, you manifest it. I started conducting my own scores about 2 years later starting with Myst III.  Jimmy is great and we are now talking about doing another big project together. We'll see, stay tuned!
[1\)  what is/was your musical background prior to getting into creating soundtracks?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47puve/im_jack_wall_music_composer_of_20_games_including/d0erry0?context=5)|My degree is in civil engineering. So yeah, that's odd right? But I've always loved music so I got bored and got involved in learning to become a recording engineer. I did that for about 8 years and got pretty good at producing music. Then someone came to me with an opportunity to actually write a full score to a game. I jumped in and did it and fell in love. That was in 1996. Been writing ever since. 
[2\) how did you get into the business/decide that is what you wanted to do?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47puve/im_jack_wall_music_composer_of_20_games_including/d0erry0?context=5)|After doing my first score for a company called ""Postlinear Entertainment"" which did a lot of games you never heard of, all of the people there went off and did bigger things. Dan Irish did Myst (which I scored the 3rd and 4th renditions of), Gareth Davis who was my producer became an exec at Facebook and Pixar. etc. etc. 
[3\)who are your favorite composers/musical inspirations.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47puve/im_jack_wall_music_composer_of_20_games_including/d0erry0?context=5)|John Williams, Hans Zimmer, James Newton Howard, Thomas Newman, many others. 
[As a person who makes music for a living, what music do you listen to when you're not working? what's your favorite genre?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47puve/im_jack_wall_music_composer_of_20_games_including/d0erokq?context=5)|Looks like I missed this one! sorry...
[Ps. music in the ME series and Jade Empire was killer.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47puve/im_jack_wall_music_composer_of_20_games_including/d0erokq?context=5)|First off, thank you! I like to listen to silence when I'm not working. :) But seriously really like Adele, The Shins, Foo Fighters, Fleetwood Mac, Duke Ellington, other soundtracks, Beck is one of my favorites - just everything he does. Not a huge listener of classical which is rare for an orchestral composer. I do studies of it for work but not for pleasure in general. I also love the work of Cindy Shapiro. www.cindyshapiro.net. Check her out. (full disclaimer: She's my wife but what a creative voice!)
[What do you think of the soundtrack of Mass Effect 3? How did it feel to listen to a Mass Effect soundtrack you didn't work on?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47puve/im_jack_wall_music_composer_of_20_games_including/d0et3t5?context=5)|Honestly I thought all of the music was great and very well produced. However, as a gamer, I was very disappointed with how poorly the music was implemented into the game. It had a very unfinished quality to it. Sound design was missing and the wrong mood of music would come in at the wrong time. The biggest moment had arrived - the Reaper invasion - and it was just so poorly executed in the sound department. It was a bummer. I don't even think I finished the game. But honestly the music itself was really good!
[Hi Jack, you are one of my favourite contemporary composers. My question would be, What were your influences and/or inspirations when you composed Jade Empire OST?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47puve/im_jack_wall_music_composer_of_20_games_including/d0eqlr5?context=5)|Thank you! Well I did a LOT of research about Asian music - specifically Chinese music. Most of what I heard was a bit strident for a video game context, so I went with an ""East meets West"" approach. I hired a chinese music consultant who would bring in super authentic chinese musicians - many of whom did not speak English. My big influence reference for the game's score was ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". Which sort of gave me permission to use percussion as a solo instrument. Loved doing that!
[Hello Jack! Thanks for doing this AMA. I have loved your work in the Mass Effect series and even had the opportunity to go see Video Games Live once, which was spectacular.  What are some of your favorite soundtracks to games/movies? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47puve/im_jack_wall_music_composer_of_20_games_including/d0erjz6?context=5)|I just answered some about games. So I'll hit the movies here. Besides the best movie scores of all time belonging to Star Wars (seriously John Williams is our living, breathing Mozart or better!), I love James Horner's Braveheart, Hans Zimmer's Gladiator, actually I'm a big Zimmer fan though I don't write like him at all and don't want to. But even check out the score to The Holiday. A romcom that is a fantastic set of music and themes. who knew? Lol Anything by James Newton Howard and Tom Newman.
[Unfortunately I haven't played the games you've written for, but I've just looked up some of the works you've talked about in the comments and I love it! How did you managed to get into the business of scoring music for games in the first place? I'm an avid composer at the moment as part of my music degree and I have a big interest in game/film/tv soundtrack writing, but I haven't got the foggiest idea as to how to find a way into the industry, so to speak! Would you have any advice for this?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47puve/im_jack_wall_music_composer_of_20_games_including/d0etfm1?context=5)|When you are done school try to contact composers you admire and see if you can gain an internship with them. Many internships turned to paid gigs within a short period of time, and then opportunities to write additional music. From there, you can begin your own writing career. Plus you'll have the added bonus of working under someone who is very experienced. that knowledge will be key to your own eventual success. My assistant started that way and now he is doing some writing for me. This seems to be the most viable pathway to a rewarding composing career if you're interested in that. 
[Suicide Mission from Mass Effect 2 is one of my favorite pieces of all time. Do you get to view the gameplay beforehand or are you just given a general theme to compose along?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47puve/im_jack_wall_music_composer_of_20_games_including/d0etlj6?context=5)|Thanks!  It varies from project to project, and even sometimes within the same project!  I like to try and get gameplay footage to write to as much as possible, but some times I will write themes or pieces without it - like Suicide Mission, actually.  Originally I was just asked to write a big, epic cue for the end of the game, then once that portion of the game was actually finished, I went back and tailored it more to the final product.
[Hey jack! Do you have any advice for young people looking to make it in the music biz? Any dos and donts? Thanks in advance. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47puve/im_jack_wall_music_composer_of_20_games_including/d0esph6?context=5)|Don't do it if you're not passionate about it. Do it if you are. And if you are, do it with everything you've got. Be a problem solver, not a problem creator. In the end, we all solve the problem of ""Hey, I need great music to tell my story, can you help me?"". If the answer is yes, you are on your way. BTW - always say yes and figure it out later. That's were the passion really pays off!
[Hi Jack! I am wondering what you like to do to get inspired for new work?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47puve/im_jack_wall_music_composer_of_20_games_including/d0eqvxb?context=5)|I normally will take a shower. :D.
 |Seriously, I don't know why but a shower always gives me ideas. That and the several week process of digging into the story and just kind of going about my business, things start to percolate. Then it's just the business of sitting down and writing. No matter what, you have to do the work. 90% perspiration, 10% inspiration kind of thing...
[I absolutely love the games you had done the music for. It really is a very key component that keeps us latched on to every moment and most people just don't notice that it has that effect. Anyway, not related to my question, just wanted to say thanks.  What games in 2016/17 will you be doing the music for?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/47puve/im_jack_wall_music_composer_of_20_games_including/d0eryct?context=5)|Well ""Into the Stars"" comes out next Friday! It's a small indy game with a big heart. Really enjoyed working on it. The team at Fugitive are great. The creative director and others came from the Lost Planet 3 team and other big companies with passion wanting to make a great game. I think they've achieved that. I'm also excited that iam8bit is doing a vinyl release of the soundtrack. Beyond that I am contractually not at liberty to discuss other projects at this time.

We learned what programming is. 

1 We design
2 We realise (code/programming)
3 We implement
4 We maintain

I am following this course 1,5 year already at an community college. And i have in mind to continue 4 more years on a undergraduate bachelor in Informatics with the specialisation software engineering.

So i learned in 1,5 years what programming is. How to design, code.

But now i feel i am stuck.., it may also have to do something with my internship that i have at the moment.

I had to do an internship while i didn't have experience with frameworks, mvc and oop.

The internship is nearly done anyways. 1-2 months to go, as a junior webdeveloper.

But i feel stuck. 

I study appdevelopment at school, full time. 

But how should i learn programming/webdevelopment?

I learned how to design first. Then i learned the basic syntaxes of languages hmtl/css/js/php/sql.

I also learned what classes are, what objects are, what methods are etc. 

I writed some basic websites. Like 5-7 of them. As a beginner, they really are not that complex if i look back at it. But afcourse i am proud of it since it took some time to learn the syntax and scope of it.

But now i need to learn mvc/oop and handle frameworks. But because i am in an internship i really have little to no time since they expect me to already know the basics.. But i am still learning the basics of mvc/oops and framework syntax and logics..

So now i have a hard time, also because of shortage of time, to progress in programming..

I struggle learning oop.., mvc.. and applying those skills in frameworks...

How did you handle this step? Could you give me any advice? I really want to become a better programmer. I am just programming for 1,5 year, but i feel like i am learning slow :(."

As a university student, I would see my female classmates land internships like it is nothing.

One of my female classmates even said me, ""you study for technical interviews?"" as if she was shocked. I know that there are not a lot of female software engineers in the industry, but is this really the right way to go about this?

So this question might be very premature but I thought I might as well ask. I'm a new grad, and I've accepted a pretty good job offer with a well known mid-size company in SF. The base pay seems decent and I think I am able to negotiate the team I want to join.

The thing is, there were other places I wanted to join that I was still in the middle of interviews with. The reason I would prefer those places were mostly to do with the kind of work and industry I want to enter...I want to eventually be doing machine learning / deep learning and have spent some internships doing computer vision etc. I had managed to get interviews with some companies that work in these core areas, but unfortunately due to my visa status, I can't keep interviewing for long and have to accept a job.

As of such, although this is a premature thought, I'm thinking somewhere down the road I might want to change companies and get into the field I want. So this is two questions really...

1. The company I joined are great, and I'm probably going to be building some of the systems that work with their ML models anyway, so no loss of love there. However, in my head getting into the field you want to pursue as soon as possible seems a good idea, but thoughts on this are welcome.

2. I know people recommend jumping ship 3-5 years in, but have people done this after a year and seen progress?

Thanks for the help!"

4: A window and fan filters would be a bonus ( fan filters for me since I'll be the one cleaning it, and my employer requested a window, they think customers would really like the wow factor)


I work for a private company that will be sending me out to give demos using an oculus rift.  I couldn't ask for a better internship honestly.  So portability is major, I've looked at the raven 2 (no window), hadron (is that 500w psu enough?), and the 380T (can't seem to find a bag).

I'll be visiting up to 6 locations a day, so I'll really be depending on the portability factor, and the carrying case to protect it from bumps and bruises.

The company has been around for decades and is by no means a startup software company which is awesome. 

The problem right now is I also have another potential internship offer in the next week or so but with a startup company so my question is, for someone whos still relatively new to the software side of being in the industry, which would be a better choice to gain experience in? A company with a startup sort of environment or a well developed company?

&amp;nbsp;

I am writing this post because I am really scared and don't know what to do about my future.

&amp;nbsp;

**If you don't care about my story please read the tldr;**

&amp;nbsp;

My story:-
Ever since I was four years old (1996) I was fascinated with computers. I remember my dad buying me my first computer when I was nine years old (2001) which was an IBM computer which had a Pentium 1 chip that ran at 133MHz and could be overclocked to 200MHz by changing a jumper on the motherboard. The system had 32Mb of ram and 4GB hard drive with an on-board graphics card and of course Windows 95. I remember the first thing I did when I got it, was open the case up and looked what's inside it.

&amp;nbsp;

I tough myself how to code BASIC and spent most of my time playing Warcraft 1 and Doom. Since then I knew I want to make games. A few years after that my family had some financial issues and from the age of 12 until 17 I had no computer or an internet connection. On my 17th birthday (2009) my dad bought me a laptop to help me in college since I was going to study computer science.

&amp;nbsp;

The college I signed up in was not that great and the students were not motivated to learn or care about computers. Never the less I was very excited and determined to learn programming and game development. My professor gave us the ""intro to programming in C++"" book and he had an entire semester to teach us the course. I read the book from cover to cover in a week. 

&amp;nbsp;

Oops.

&amp;nbsp;

After I was done with the book I went into game development on my own since now I finally had an internet connection. I learned Allegro, SDL and SFML and made few small ""games"".

&amp;nbsp;

In 2012 I had a choice to either keep going and take my bachelor's or stop my education and only get a diploma in computer science. I decided to stop and only get my diploma since everything the college was teaching me I already knew and I felt like it was a huge wast of time and money.

&amp;nbsp;

After I graduated in 2012 with a diploma in computer science I decided to keep learning game development and try to start a small indie gamedev company with my friend. My dad was going to support me as long as I needed. In 2012 I moved from C++ and SFML to C# and XNA 4.0 based on my friend advice. In (2013) my friend gave up on making games and left. However I kept learning and improving my code. When XNA died I moved to MonoGame and I built my first 2D engine in MonoGame. 

&amp;nbsp;

My 2D engine has the following systems:-
&amp;nbsp;

* 2D tile map rendering.
* Basic point and spot lights using HLSL 4.0.
* Multi-threaded clearance based A* pathfinding algorithm using binary tree for sorting the nodes.
* Enemy AI with line of sight.
* Particle system.
* Basic 2D physics engine and collision detection.
* Basic bitmap text rendering. (I don't like MonoGame content pipeline so I made my own). 
* A GUI system that includes buttons, text boxes, windows, check boxes, radio boxes, menus, scroll bars etc...
* 2D sprite based animation system.
* A Server/Client based networking system that utilize both UDP and TCP connections with encrypted packets.
* A login system with SQL database.
* A simple bug reporting system like ""BugSplat"".
* A map editor that exports a custom XML based map to my engine.

&amp;nbsp;

All of these systems are written from the ground up without using any libraries whatsoever, with the exception of MonoGame and C#. I can tell you that I understand every line of code in there.

&amp;nbsp;

Finally that I have my engine ready I planned to start making a 2D procedurally generate dungeon game. Half way through the project my dad told me that he can no longer support me and I had to get a job.

&amp;nbsp;

After few months I got a job in a small company working as web developer. I have been working there for four months and I hate every bit of it. I can't stand web development especially in php.

&amp;nbsp;

So after discovering that the thing I loved the most in game development was the rendering. I decided to learn computer graphics and try apply for an internship or for an entry job level at any of the major game development companies. So in December 2015 decided to move to the big boys club and I started learning OpenGL 4.5.

&amp;nbsp;

I decided to write my own math library and not use something like GLM since I want to learn everything about matrices and vectors and what the hell is a perspective and orthographic projection and how do they work in a matrix.

&amp;nbsp;

So far I know everything about matrix math (I love matrices now). I wrote all my projection, translation, scaling and rotation matrices. I know how to pass them to the vertex shader. I know how the OpenGL pipeline works, I know how to load obj files into my engine. Right now I have a rotating wireframe monkey head in my engine exported from Blender. And now I am studying lighting and how they work in the fragment shader.

&amp;nbsp;

This is all well and good and I am planning on knowing everything there is to know about the basics of computer graphics by the end of this year and then start applying at any major game company.

&amp;nbsp;

**tldr;**
&amp;nbsp;

Here is the problem. I am scared of racism and discrimination in either the US or Europe. I am scared because I am a Syrian national. I was born in Saudi Arabia in 1992 and moved to Oman when I was five. I lived my entire life in Oman. I moved to the United Arab Emirates for college in 2009 and I have been living here ever since. I have never been to Syria in my entire life. To me Syria is only a country that I am associated with because of my passport.

&amp;nbsp;

I am scared of discrimination if I move to the US or Europe. I'm scared I will be walking to my apartment and get shot because of my nationality or and religion. I am scared shitless. 

&amp;nbsp;

If I had the option to join a game development company in UAE or anywhere in the middle east I would. I really would. But the only company in here is Ubisoft and they have no entry level jobs at all. I sent my CV anyways. My only real shot in making games and having a career in game development is to move to somewhere in the US, Europe or Japan.

&amp;nbsp;

And the whole ISIS/war and immigration crisis is not making this any easier for me. I feel like I'm being held back because of my passport and religion. I don't care about religion issues. I don't care about politics. I don't care about the top 10 freaking celebrities.

&amp;nbsp;

I just want to make cool shit. I just want to build games and get paid for it. I don't want any special treatment either. I just want be treated like any normal dude.

&amp;nbsp;

So I don't know where to go from here.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm sorry for the long post."
47seet,1,2016-02-26,"[Canada, Ontario] Fear my employer may not pay me for my work",LAThrowaway891,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/47seet/canada_ontario_fear_my_employer_may_not_pay_me/,"So I am currently working on ""contract"" (a term which I am using loosely right now) with my former full-time employer.  I worked full-time for this guy for two years (marketing agency) before I decided to get away and go back to school.  He offered me part-time ""contract work"" while I was in school so he could still get some money out of me.

These contracts are e-mail agreements where I ""commit"" to fulfilling certain ""accountabilities"" until they are ""approved completion"". I get 50% up front, and 50% when things are finished.  Since September, I have delivered on two jobs and gotten paid for both of them.

The reason why I think this one is different is because we are both aware that I will be off doing an internship by the time this job is finished, and there will be no opportunity to do another job later.  So this would be our last interaction.

A little bit of background on this guy; he runs a very small (&lt;5 people, including himself) agency where he works staff into the ground and has not paid various ex-staff members, suppliers, and other ""contractors"" for the work they have done because they haven't met his expectations.  The caveat is that his expectations constantly change.  This man changes his mind, changes it back, forgets his commitments, and refuses to hold himself accountable for anything.  For example, if he makes decision A, changes his mind to decision B, has all of his staff implement decision B, and then realizes that decision A was the right answer...it is everyone's fault and not his because they didn't get it to him in time to review....or something like that.  If you push back or stand up to him even a little bit, his vindictive side comes out and he will go look for ways to add to your plates without solicitation, to make you fail. Then he will tell all about how you are sabotaging his company.  Every day. He deal creeps very easily, lies, and all in all it's a very harrowing experience. Turnover rate is 98%.

Anyways, the job that I have been given is difficult to achieve to true 100% completion because of the nature of its expectations.  To be vague about it, I need to interview over 200 unique people and measure their answers (I've dumbed it down for anonymity, it's very complex). We aren't 100% positive what the true scope size is of the place where these people do business in the first place (ex: could be less than 200. So me not hitting 200 = me not ""fulfilling my accountability""). I am worried I will not get paid because he knows I'm not coming back and won't feel obligated to have to pay me, and because my other boss who got me my rate approved for this job (approx $4K) is quitting and he didn't want to pay me that much because ""My output is not worth that much"" (despite me spending an incredibly significant work effort and time put into this to get as big as a sample as possible).  So if he is controlling my last paycheque and not my other boss, I don't think I'll actually get paid..

Also he is constantly changing and adding to the scope.  When I send him an email saying this will push back the delivery date he ignores it, and then talks to me in person so there's no paper trail.  If I summarize what we agree to verbally in an email and send it, it gets ignored as well.

Moreso, I am worried that we are not actually bound by a ""contract"" (e-mail agreement only, not even from him, from the other boss) and that he will find ways to manufacture through e-mail a story that makes it look like I didn't do what I was supposed to.

So, any advice for me? I think that if I just dropped everything and stopped working for him he could pursue me for breaching our e-mail agreement.  He has sued people for less. He tried to get us to sign an agreement saying he could sue us in the future if we leaked details about another project and cost him money, whether he had any evidence or not...

I am already kicking myself for working with him after I officially quit but hey, here I am.

The problem I'm coming into is that my structure is pretty atrocious, I feel. I am beginning small in my scripts, testing how well it works along the way, but I find I have to go back constantly and add features, which begins turning the script into an unreadable, unholy mess. No one else sees them but me, but they are still embarrassing

So, I'm sure this is a learning hump, but I'm finding my time is spent fixing bugs and cleaning the script more than being productive and that is getting very frustrating. I've done dozens of little script tutorials and exercises, but none really seem to address writing scripts at the scale I'm reaching, and the best way to organize a script and prepare a script for unforseen changes. Is there any good resources on structure in programming, or is this just going to be a situation where I am just going to have to find my own way.

47ssmu,7,2016-02-26,Why are some web development salaries so much lower than other software engineering disciplines?,katzey,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/47ssmu/why_are_some_web_development_salaries_so_much/,"hello everybody :o) 

I am a junior level CS major whose beginning to look at internships, and potentially, a place to begin my career at. I really like web development. I've been developing a project with some pals of mine, utilizing the MEAN stack. this, by far, has been the most challenging task I've ever undertook during my undergraduate career. I fell in love with how challenging it is to utilise a framework stack. I find this so much more difficult than just writing something in C++ or whatever, which is great because I thoroughly enjoy challenging academic tasks.

unfortunately, web development salaries seem like a mess. I see MEAN stack starting level positions making like, $5-10 less money per hour than their OOP/traditional software development counterparts. 

why is this? why does something, which has a much higher barrier of knowledge requirement (to note, a skill set which is not taught in traditional undergrad CS curriculum), pay so much less? 

to add to the mess, an established full stack web developer around here seems to make well over six figures, meanwhile a junior/internship level full stack developer makes SIGNIFICANTLY less. again, this sort of discrepancy isn't as prevalent in traditional software development roles. 

I have a sneaking suspicion a lot of these low ""web developer"" salaries are really just like squarespace/CMS positions where you don't really do much actual programming, but I'm not quite sure.

I just have a lot of conigitive dissonance towards what I want to do in my career vs what I should do in my career. I want to do web development, but I feel like I should pursue other roles because they'll probably be a fraction of the effort for significantly more money. I just don't really get it, and I'm hoping someone can shed some light on this conundrum."
47t4mf,2,2016-02-26,Resubmitting an updated resume,floridianreader,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/47t4mf/resubmitting_an_updated_resume/,"This may be a complicated issue; I apologize and will try to keep it simple.

2 years ago I was fresh out of grad school (Social work) with an MSW and only internship experience.  I submitted my less than stellar resume and a cover letter to nearly every agency in a 75 mile radius from my home in city A.  Eventually my husband and I agreed to move out of the area and we moved 100 miles north, to a city I'll just call city B.  I used my same resume and cover letter (amended slightly with new addresses and such) and was almost immediately hired by a home health company.  

I (mostly) loved my home health company which is part of a national chain but there were some local politics going on which I did not like.  Several other social workers quit, causing more work to be shifted onto myself and my dwindling number of colleagues.  My husband had also taken a new job but he did not like it and so we made the joint decision to move back to City A.  Husband got a job immediately.   I am still looking.

While finishing out my 2 weeks' notice at home health company (in city B), I noticed on the company website that they were hiring a social worker with my exact job description back in city A.  I immediately applied, sent a cover letter explaining that I already worked for the company and knew all the ins and outs and proprietary software and such and felt I was a shoo-in .  I did try to call HR in City A and no one returned my call.  I got zero response by email, other than the formulaic ""thanks for applying, we'll contact you if we think you're qualified, etc.""

In a moment of desperation, I asked my supervisor to call the company in city A to speak to someone in HR.  My boss thankfully put the call on speaker so I could listen in.  The HR person there said that they had my resume, but that it showed that I had just graduated school and I had no real experience and I wasn't really a good candidate.  Boss said that wasn't possible, because I had been working for the company, had evals and such.  HR person then said something snippy to the effect of ""let me look again"" and then pulled up something on her computer and said ""well we have a resume from summer 2014 [when I had freshly graduated] and then a resume from fall 2015 [the one I had most recently sent them].""  Boss told her to take a look at the resume from 2015 (duh) and she did, and lo and behold, she said, oh, yeah, it looks like she'd be a good candidate. let me get someone from social work dept to talk to her.""  Etc.   End of that part of the story: there was a job opening that I could have if I wanted (without even an interview), but it was at the farthest most point from my home so I decided to wait and see if another job opened up closer.  

Ok.   So we are living back in City A. I am unemployed now, have been since December.  I found another job opening at a different company doing the same exact thing as at my previous job.  I sent them my resume and such.  Minimum 12 months' experience: I have 15 months of paid experience.  When I logged in, it said that I had applied before and displayed my old resume (the one with the no real experience).  The website asked if I wanted to update my stuff, which of course I did.  I got the perfunctory email from the auto-responder thing.  

I haven't heard anything since.  I know that I'm the perfect candidate (aside from being unemployed).  I suspect the same problem that I had with my previous employer may be at play: where the HR person is seeing my old resume and not really looking for the new resume.  But I don't know.  

How do I get around this problem? I suspect this is probably going to be an issue for just about every agency in this area because I already applied at all of them a year or two ago when I had no paid experience, but now I have experience.  

Of course I also attached a cover letter outlining my experience and why I'm a good fit, but it's just hanging around in cyberspace being ignored.  

Help?!
Thanks

I am no superstar and find a lot of subjects demanding but I am coping. I have a few questions regarding mostly UK because it should get more love here, especially for new grad prospects in current tech market.

My issue is that I applied for around 20 companies, starting in late November for software engineering internships. Almost all banks rejected me without interview which cut down on number of internships available in UK. I now have three leads and will go to interviews but in case I fail to obtain internship, what can I do? Build projects over summer and start applying early for graduate roles?

I spoke with a recent graduate in CS who found work successfully without internships and he told me to do market research, i.e. what is in demand in combination with choosing what interests you and delve deeper into that.

Regarding application for graduate roles, I am interested in trying out embedded software path, data science or something more sophisticated because I want to get into the field of IT that is more in demand and has higher barrier of entry, mostly to reduce competition. For embedded, my plan is to go on and do EdX course on embedded systems and learn C/C++. However, at the same time that would make me too specialized and there are a lot fewer embedded software companies(ARM, Nvidia, Qualcomm, AMD, Intel?) and most are highly competitive. I am thinking of a fallback plan of learning something like C#/Java, i.e. build a project and apply to more generic companies like banks(Morgan Stanley, JP, some hedge funds etc).

So, I want to be madly prepared for technical interviews(Leetcode etc.) and have some projects in both embedded software and somewhat more generic apps to show off.

I am pretty happy with embedded project prospect(welcome ideas anyways) but would like to know what project would be something in C#/Java realm and would take at most 2-3 months to complete but still show my skills."

3. I do not have any open interview calls right now. I aim to start afresh. How do I approach this starting now? Would there be companies still just starting to look? I know a few people who got their internships as late as April, in good companies. Thoughts?
4. Most importantly, I'm looking for Systems roles, as I thought the transition from EE to CS would be best if I did Systems programming and C first. (I have done a lot of embedded systems before, so it was easy to sort of blend in)

Any sort of advice is welcome. "

I didn't really know how to handle that. It has just made me think I might be screwed come this time next year when I actually have to find a job.

480fh2,7,2016-02-28,Decided to drop out of grad school. Have I ruined my life? Can I salvage anything from this? Could I go back?,Mash_Ketchum,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/480fh2/decided_to_drop_out_of_grad_school_have_i_ruined/,"I graduated from a 4 year undergrad with a BS in Psychology in 2013. I took a year off afterwards and thought I had firmly decided I wanted to pursue grad school in Industrial/Organizational Psychology. I was wrong, unfortunately. I got accepted into a PhD program in that field, but I soon realized how little interest I had in that field of research, *especially* compared to my colleagues. Even the notion of teaching as a professor became unappealing after a few months of TAing. 

I kept on going because I desperately hoped I would eventually garner a genuine interest in what I was doing. But fast forward to my 4th semester, and nothing has changed. I'm really no closer to defending my Master's Thesis than I was in my first semester (haven't even proposed). So I've decided to withdraw from the program. Faculty have expressed that I'm making a wise and informed decision, but there could be a lot of pity hiding behind that. Colleagues seem supportive as well, especially because they know how much I've been struggling to maintain even the slightest bit of interest. I submitted the withdrawal paperwork on Friday and I'm guessing it will take a few days to process, so I've actually done it. The Psychology department wants to keep me on for the class I'm currently TAing, so they've promised to switch me over from a graduate assistantship stipend to standard hourly wage employment. That gives me plenty of time to get a full-time job once the semester is over. 

I just got off the phone with my mom after letting her know what I'm going to do, and I'm sure you can guess how that went. Extreme disappointment and frustration, a huge guilt trip, I currently feel like scum, and I now feel as though I made a decision that will permanently cripple my life. 

Now that I realize I was wrong in thinking I liked I/O Psychology, I need to reevaluate what I want as a career. I still enjoy aspects of psychology, such as clinical and developmental psychology. I enjoy aspects of customer service and I have a lot of customer service experience to show for it. I have some unrelated interests, such as ornithology (bird science), alternative dispute resolution, and counseling (I suppose that's still related to clinical).  

I'm hoping there might be something to salvage from my time in grad school. I have 2 years of teaching experience and I have references here (I feel like I left on good terms, especially with my advisor). I also gained a lot of content knowledge but I doubt that will mean much. No internship experience. Not much research experience because I could never really motivate myself to actually conduct research.

I was also wondering how feasible it would be in the future to go back to grad school. Let's say I'm able to figure my life out and realize what I truly want, and I want to apply to a Master's program in counseling or therapy, for example. Would I have a really hard time at that, even if I'm honest and elaborate on my lack of fit with my previous institution?

Finally, I was wondering if anyone knows someone who was in a similar situation and could provide some perspective. Because I'm still reeling from that draining conversation with my mother."

Sorry for the wall of text.)
 

I have worked with this company for a little over a year. I started as an intern through a paid school intern program, and so they were able to have me work with the company for free while I got paid through the school. I have done just about everything there, production, shipping, customer service, and their website management. I really learned a lot from being there and also won the intern of the year award through my school internship program. My bosses Steve and Jane were super proud and at the ceremony had nothing but good things to say. Steve also announced at the award ceremony that I was being hired as an intern directly through the company because as he put it “We honestly can’t live without her!” This was in August last year. 


At the end of the year they hired another person, Sara. Sara was laid off from a project management job that she had with a software company previously and she had experience in the industry as our company was in so Steve and Jane hired her. She was actually really nice and I was looking forward to working with someone that could help with our tasks because it was getting pretty overwhelming with school.
Some time went by, like a few weeks and Sara started talking to me about Steve and Jane in pretty weird way to me. She made comments about how the communication was really bad with Steve and Jane. She made comments about Steve behind his back about stuff too, sort of insulting things. For example, she made a comment about how Steve wanted the package to look a certain way and she said “It looks like shit!” behind his back to me. I just sort of sat there and didn’t know what to say. I ignored it until later she started turning on me.


Sara started sending me really condescending e-mails about my work. I ignored it until there was a shipping error with a couple of the international addresses where the country was entered in incorrectly. I had uploaded those addresses to our shipping software and they got shipped out. Sara sent me an e-mail basically chewing me out about it and had both of my bosses copied on it. I accepted responsibility for what happened and also knew this was a time-sensitive issue. 


I was heading into class and so I sent her an e-mail asking her if she could call the shipping company to have the package rerouted. I included instructions in detail with the package information; I was a little late to class but I wanted to get the problem taken care of. She responded saying she couldn’t call because it was a 2 hour hold time and that I needed to take care of it. The e-mails went back and forth because I told her I couldn’t do it because of class and she said she wasn’t going to do it because she didn’t have time. I missed out on half of my lecture because I was e-mailing her trying to get the issue taken care of.


The next day I talked to Sara about how she talked to me and also with the other condescending e-mails she was sending me before. I told her I don’t appreciate being talked to that way and I also addressed her not respecting that I was in class and had missed half my lecture because of the issue. It was literally a waste of time because the issue didn’t even get resolved. She went off at me and said “I’m cleaning up all of your mistakes!” I asked her to explain what mistakes she has fixed because obviously the other day she didn’t want to fix anything. She ignored it and said I messed up the shipping and expected her to fix it. I explained it was time-sensitive and needed to be taken care of, if I hadn’t been in class I would have done it. Now we have to wait for the packages to go overseas and then come back because she didn’t want to do anything about it.


I then went to talk to Steve about what happened. He said that maybe I should be taken off shipping and just have Sara take care of it. I felt pretty hurt by that, like he believed that I was being incompetent, even though I haven’t made a mistake like that before. He expressed how disappointed he was that I made that mistake and said that they were low on money and can’t afford mistakes like this. The total amount for the mistake was about $40. I know $40 may not seem like a lot, but for it being a small start up it is a big deal. I expressed how sorry I was for missing that in the addresses and that if he felt Sara should take over I totally understood. I was neutral about it even though I was really upset.


The next day, Sara told Steve that I was shipping domestic packages for $20 a package, which was a total lie (normal domestic shipping costs $3.70-$7.80 by the way). Steve brought me in the office and yelled at me. I was almost in tears trying to explain that I would never let that happen. I pulled the shipping report and went through it with him right there and he saw that I in fact did not send any domestic shipments out for $20 a package. He apologized, half-heartedly, and left the office to go work on production. It was at that moment that I decided that I didn’t want to be there and wanted to put my 2 week notice in. I knew if I stayed there Sara would just make it more stressful and difficult for me to be there. It’s really just 4 of us in the company and then some interns that do some graphics, so there isn’t really a way for me not to interact with her.


On Friday around 3pm, I put in my two week notice via e-mail (my other main boss Jane was out of the office and would be for at least a couple of weeks) and copied Steve on the e-mail. I basically just said that I wanted to focus more on my school work and that I needed to quit. I thanked both Jane and Steve for everything they have done for me and giving me the opportunity to work there and learn. I kept the e-mail very positive and didn’t mention anything about Sara at all. I have a hunch that my boss Jane has heard some things and I didn’t want to send her a notice with a bunch of complaints. 


I haven’t heard anything back from my bosses since I sent the notice. I just hope I handled everything right. I feel relieved that I am going to be leaving soon. The only thing I am nervous about is that Sara may have said stuff that I am not aware of that would cause Jane and Steve to not give me a reference for other jobs. She lied before, she could do it again without my knowledge I’m sure. I worked really hard there, and I will be pretty upset if they just decide not to give me a reference because of this issue with Sara. I was thinking of asking them, but I’m not sure if I should. I’m not sure how to move forward during the next couple of weeks.


Tl;dr
I work for a company as an intern, where my bosses thought very highly of me until a difficult employee started at the company recently. She has been nit-picking, and lying about me to my bosses. One of my bosses I am pretty sure has bought into it, and the other I don’t know how they feel. I am afraid that this difficult employee has lied and made me look so bad that my bosses are not going to give me a good reference. Should I ask them if they are going to give a good reference? How should I move forward during the next couple of weeks?

Though I received a 4.0 last semester, but only with 3 classes so Im not sure if that counts, I am just battling this life with a sense that even if I finish my bachelors I will never get a job. My background started in Petroleum engineering, before the mad rush, and I had great grades, above a 3.5, solid internships, and scholarships. However, during my Junior-Senior (2010) summer I hurt my lower back. The surgeries consisted of fusions, all up and down the lumbar region.  Several years of recoveries and more surgeries as I had failed fusions. Further my parents got divorced, literally as I was in a hospital bed, and I was used as a financial and psychological sounding board for what seems to be an extended and continuing divorce battle that hopefully will come to an end after 4 years...but basically the past three months I have started to completely breakdown.

A little more background just so if anyone would be willing to give advice could use this to either tell me if this experience works against me or could work for me in future job prospects.

While I was recovery I did what I could do online in engineering. Finishing GECs and working with some teachers to get a few more 300 and 400 level courses out of the way, but the stronghold against finishing an online engineering degrees, even with documented disabilities, is just so reinforced, I don't see any school really offering bachelors for REAL ABET degrees in the foreseeable future. 


This is part of my background that I hope could possibly work in my favor. But it would only extend to the realm of work ethic and ""resilience""/ or better said just continuing to grinding forward in this very depressing life.

I took all the money I saved and invested it in the stock market, and with good research and luck, (the luck being I started investing in 2010 up until 2015 which was basically recovering mode in the market from the recession) I made enough to help pay for everything, from my moms mortgage, divorce, everyday bills, college, sisters college. Also was able to get an investment property for income.  

However I put that information there just so maybe those in the industry may be able to tell me if a recruiter would give any merit to that. Or if that should be left out of any sort of interview process? 

I have over 120 credits. (135 to be exact, with a mix of 300 and 400 level mechanical (fluids, dynamics, thermo, circuits, stats, statics, cs, and petroleum classes, also some industrial) I have all the baseline stuff finished. Calcs, Physics 1-3, Chem 1 &amp;2...etc Also was able to get some little minors while recovering in bed, History and Economics. (online through my university) and its not University of Phoenix.  These are ABET accredited universities, George Mason University, and previously for Petroleum engineering was West Virginia University.

 Once again, I would like to reiterate, I have not been just wasting money, as I am an avid scholarship applier/reciever, and after doing financial advising (Series 65) and investing I do have enough in which instate tuition + scholarships now, at age 27, is really not that much. Especially considering that school is great therapy. 

I promise to anyone reading this and hoping to appeal to a response, that I am not fishing for complements. I have become extremely depressed (which is so real and sucks so much, the mind is so powerful and can turn on you) and have been losing control of myself, with respect to not wanting to live. I don't have hate towards others. I say that last part because it seems like a week doesn't go by without hearing about people taking out others on ones way out. 

So with complete sincerity, and not just fluff comments, could anyone give me any advice, suggestions? Should I just give up trying to finish college, or would  a future employer just look at my resume or during an interview and say ""8,9,10 years, you took forever, you are not someone that will ever be hired by any company because you can't finish things in a timely manner""

I know some may say ""go seek psychological help,"" and I have, but I was hoping that I could hear from Engineers about what and if the competition is just to high for someone like me to ever be considered.

Over the past couple of years I've become more and more interested with pursuing a career in the IT field, specifically Networking/Network Engineering. I was able to shadow a friend of mine in the field and I was intrigued at the knowledge he seemed to possess and it sparked my interest. My problem is I'm completely new to the field.

Besides online courses, there is an accredited tech school nearby which offers both Network Engineering AS and BS degrees, as well as helping attain certs throughout the course. The school has an amazing campus, great reviews, and is known for helping students land great internships and jobs post graduation. The problem is the price. The total bachelors program would run me about 58-60k after help from financial aid. Is this absolutely absurd, or should I be expecting to pay that much for a good education?

I guess what I'm really asking is if this school sounds like a good option from the outside looking in for someone who has no experience in the field but is eager to learn? If not, what other routes do I have to choose from? Is there anything I can do on my own time to get ahead in understanding the field and brushing up on some knowledge? This is the type of work I would like to invest myself in, so I'm really trying to find my best route into it.

The position is also a contract. I am mostly concerned that it will end up hindering my chances of getting into Software Dev positions in the future.  I planned on asking the interviewer if it's possible to transition to a dev position at some point, but the fact that it is contract makes me think that dynamic is a little different, if that makes sense.

Little background:
I just graduated with my B.S. in CS in the Fall '15.  I graduated from a pretty shit tier state school ( I'm in SoCal ) with a 3.2 overall gpa.  My [github](https://github.com/AustinSong) isn't great and the projects aren't very impressive.  No internships, no relevant work experience.

I'm currently not making any money and just learning the Spring framework and attempting to build a web app with it in my free time.  So, it would definitely be nice to be at least making some cash for now.  Also, I figured maybe it would allow me to network within the company since I very much would not mind working there as an SE.

I know that it's only an interview and I haven't even been hired yet for the contract, but I just like to have some opinions on the matter before anything happens.  I have a good number of contacts related to this position, ( how I got the interview in the first place ), and apparently every referral has been hired by my contacts.

Would it be a mistake for me to take this position, if I'm offered it, if my aspirations lie within Software Engineering / Dev.

Thanks to anyone who reads this.

**EDIT**
Just to add.  I've learned that the contract is for 18 months, and that it can apparently be terminated at any time ( sorry if this is common knowledge, I'm not familiar with how contracts work out ).  Also that this is apparently in the ""Software Engineer dept"" as my contact has informed "

I was then told that they would like a follow up ""interview"" where I would basically shadow a current employee in their sales department for an entire work day where I would learn more about the position, what the position pays, etc. 

I agreed to go through with the follow up, however, ever since the first interview, I feel as though I have made a mistake because I really want to gain experience in an HR position, as that is the field that I want to have a career in. 

How should I handle this situation? The more I think about it, the more shady this whole situation feels, almost as if they just want to throw me into a sales position because they need people to fill it. I have applied to other HR internship positions but have yet to hear back from any of them.

If you don't want your personal info on reddit, I am happy to get it over the phone, in a PM, or through email. 

Here is the information required:

Employer name:  
Phone:  
Person contacted:  

- What education, skills, and training do you seek in the ideal candidate?
- Do you generally hire full time for this position?
- Are there specific schools or training programs that you would recommend?
- Does this job have any special requirements such as travel, shift work, special licenses, etc?
- Do you know of other employers who hire for this or similar occupations?
- What is your entry level salary range?
- Are there advancement and educational opportunities?
- Does your company offer internships?
- Any other general comments?

Thanks again for your time!"

I'm interested in netsec, but I'm not entirely too sure which way is the smartest route for me to take. 

I'm interested in going to the [University of Tampa](https://www.ut.edu/cybersecurity/) and majoring in their Cyber Security program, but what ""worries"" me is that: 1. it's considered a ""business degree"" (housed under the school of business), 2. I've heard that many Cyber Security degrees are essentially ""buzzwords"" (for lack of a better term), and are just for a cash grab and they typically don't do a great job preparing students for the real world. Though this program seems fairly good, as there is an entire course that focuses on the CISSP certification. I've also heard there are some companies to do internships with, which would obviously help me out tremendously. 

Since the program is a ""business"" degree, I can knock it out pretty fast since I've taken my fair share of business courses already. One downside is considering that the school is a private school, it's going to be expensive as hell, and not sure if the debt is worth it. 

I know CompSci majors are more sought after, as they are more rounded out than typical CySec majors. I'd do CompSci, but I'd need to take all the pre-reqs to even start the program (all in all, it'd take me at least another 3-4+ years to graduate, and I don't want to graduate at 26/27).

What would be the best option for me? Should I just major in CySec at UT or should I do a different major? I plan on learning to code and work on some skills to make myself stand out from the rest. 

Help would be *greatly* appreciated. Sorry if this is in the wrong place. "

**What I want**

I want to become involved with financial markets, I'd love to do equity research and eventually I want to move to funds/portfolio management.

&amp;nbsp;

**Here is my story**

(*Just to be clear, I take full responsibility for my poor decisions, lack of effort and general apathetic lifestyle.*)

I finished highschool with top 10% grade but didn't want to do anything.

Took a gap year, played video games, hung out with friends and accomplished nothing.

I then spent a year at Uni studying physiotherapy, it wasn't for me so I stopped.

Unsure of what to do with no goals or ambition I took another year off study and worked for 2 companies full-time.

After that year, Uni was back on the table and and I stuck it out this time (thank god) graduating 3.5 years later.

So then I had a Business degree majoring in Finance, no internships of work experience and a 4.25 GPA ( 4.25 is about 55% for people out side of Australia).

I spent the next 6 months not being able to get a job in the investment sector, got a job in a call center for few months, then finally got a job in a retail bank as a personal banker (in hopes to gain access to internal transfers/jobs).

&amp;nbsp;


**So here I am today**  
Sad, defeated, regretful and full of questions I don't have the answers to.

Also, no relevant work experience, low GPA and a limited network.

&amp;nbsp;

**My current network**

Through uni I was paired up with a portfolio manager who I have coffee with once every few months. He is really helpful, through him I met a man that owns a funds management firm that may have an opening (I'm meeting him this week).
I've cold called a lot of companies and also just shown up and dropped off a resume looking for work experience. These efforts have probably netted me 8 or 9 coffees with people that help me with information but no work opportunities.

&amp;nbsp;


**What I've been doing now that I truly appreciated the depth of how fucked I am**

1.  I've been studying 3-5 hours a day and 5-10 hours on weekends for my CFA level 1 I sit this June
2. I spend between 30-45 minutes a day reading financial reviews, investing blogs and related investing content.
3. I have a long list of books I'm going to read once I've finished my CFA level 1 exam.
4. I already have been but I'm trying to network as much as I can, less so now that I work and CFA preparation.
5. I'm involved with the ASX trading game to try and get a deeper understanding of trading.
6. I have a portfolio of two stocks

&amp;nbsp;

**My Plan**

Stay at current role until June, talk with my manager about my goals and ask for her support to move internally to a more suited position. 

While doing this apply aggressively to roles that I previously was out competed for (having passed CFA level 1 should open doors to a few more interviews) 

Come September move to Sydney as there is more potential and more networking opportunities if I still haven't found a role related to investing.

Failing any progression towards equities research or a junior financial analyst position I am contemplating doing my masters in applied finance, in hopes to network, gain access to IB graduate programs and increase my skills and GPA.

&amp;nbsp;


**My Dilemma**

First of all, because I never tried at university I've essentially spent last 5 years of my life struggling, feeling like a failure. After that, finishing uni and getting knocked back from everywhere crushed what little spirit I had left. I don't think I have let myself feel truly happy or appreciate much in the last year. I don't think I have depression or anything of that nature, I think I'm sad because I grasp the depth of how fucked I am, of how behind I am and how near impossible my position is. I just become so overwhelmed being able to see so clearly all the mistakes I've made and the horrid position I am in today because of those decisions. **HOW DO I GET PAST THIS MENTALLY AND EMOTIONALLY?** 

Second, I just don't know what else to do. I don't know if there is anyway I can undue my low GPA bar committing 2 years to a masters degree.

I'm terrified that my life is decided, that my track record on my resume depicts the person that I was in place the committed student to investing that I'm becoming. 

&amp;nbsp;

**What else can I do?**

What excel skills should I be developing?

Which programs that analysts regularly use can I become accustom with from home?

Can you offer any advice or guidance or at least brighten my bleak outlook on where I am?

If you are an analyst or a portfolio manager or anyone in this field with experience, could you set me a task? Say, review this stock and report back to me your findings, then critique my report?

If you are in the investing field, would you mind sending me your email in a message so that I can ask you a question from time to time, or hear your own personal struggles and triumphs?

I'm literally open to anything and everything.

Thank you for taking the time to read this

&amp;nbsp;


**TLDR** My career is fucked, I want your guidance."

I know reddit has a bunch of great marketing + tech professionals so I figure i'll try hiring here.
We're a recently funded cannabis media/tech startup called [TwoCubes](http://www.twocubes.co). We operate a couple of publishing platforms, our biggest of which is called [Cannahacker](http://www.cannahacker.com).
To date, we've been outsourcing web development work but think its time to start onboarding a dedicated growth hacker, future CTO. To do this, we want to start with a paid internship / trial period for 2-3 months which hopefully can develop into something greater.
The skills required are: - Front End Development (HTML5, CSS3, etc.) - Back End Development (minimal though JS/PHP knowledge would be great!) - AB Testing (Kickofflabs , Optimizely) knowledge - Growth Marketing(Email List | newsletter) - Graphic Design
Disclosure: You DO NOT have to be a cannabis consumer to apply. Strictly professional.
Please message me if interested. Thanks!"

Backup plan?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/48bh8j/no_internshipsprojects_graduating_soon_backup_plan/,"I'm graduating in May with a BS in CS, and lately I've been having extreme anxiety over my job prospects when I get out. I didn't really realize the importance of internships and side projects until recently. I didn't start programming until I declared it as my major at 24. I thought that in this field, just having a CS degree with good grades (3.5+) would mean I could at least find *something* to start out and then get better learning on the job, even if it's not a high-paying job you read about people here getting. 

My GitHub by the end of the semester will probably just have some school projects I've contributed to. I'm already incredibly stressed just trying to keep up with my major in-class projects this semester, so the thought of attempting to complete a side-project before May makes me sick with anxiety. And even if I had the time I don't feel like I have the skill. Really, doing other things besides programming on the weekends is the only thing that is keeping me sane. Not that I hate programming, it just dominates my thoughts so much at this point that I can't imagine adding more right now.

I read a lot on this sub and elsewhere that finding a job without these things is very hard for CS majors, so I'm really scared about my future. 

What do I do? Should I bail on programming and start applying for helpdesk type jobs instead? The past two years I've been working a school helpdesk-type position so I would at least have a little bit of experience. Or should I just apply for internships? Or do employers hiring for those not even want someone my age (26) or who is graduating? Should I go for QA instead, or are internships and projects equally important for those jobs?

I'm really struggling with this, so I'd appreciate any advice."

I'm a 24 year old female from Europe living in the southern United States. I have a bachelors in Arts from the university of London but when I moved to the US with my husband I started working just boring retail jobs. I started teaching myself photoshop, illustrator and indesign about two years ago, and am now very adept in all three. I had used HTML and CSS since I was 12 and know bootstrap  ; I am pretty much fluent in both. I started marketing my programming and graphics skills in the last year and picked up about 6 individual paying clients, along the way I learned Wordpress and some basic php. 

I just recently started looking to get into a design agency kind of job. I had a few interviews but didn't get anything, the one that was kind enough to give feedback said they went for a candidate wth 'a lot more experience.'

I'm kind of wondering what my next steps should be? Internships, learn more skills, keep trying? 
Improving coding: get really good at JavaScript, learn angular or another framework.
Improving graphics: learn Adobe animate, or start with mesh 3D graphics
More applying: there's not a ton of graphic design agencies in the southern city I live in. I wonder if I should email the few that there are and ask if they have internship programs? Because there are so few I'm concerned about blowing my chances.

Hopefully this post is okay and some of my questions might be answered. If I've posted a question here that has already been answered then I apologize.

I'm in my 2nd semester of 3rd year for my bachelors in CS and am on track to graduate next May. For the past 3 years (and currently) I've been working part-time as a computer technician (full time on school breaks) to pay my bills. I have quite a few concerns about entering the field and actually getting a job. 

----

Courses I've taken:

*   Introductory Comp Sci Courses (101/102 equivalent)
*   Computer Architecture
*   Data Structures and Algorithms in C++
*   Calculus 1/2 + Linear Algebra/Discrete Maths

Currently Taking:

*   Organization of Programming Languages (ProLog/Haskell/Ruby
*   Computer Networks
*   Web Development (Front End + Back End)

----

What field do I want to go into? I have no idea, should I know by now? I really like automation and I tend to write a lot of little macros in PowerShell/AutoHotKey to help automate software installs at work, and I've been learning how to make custom unattend files to get the most out of sysprep since I deal with a whole lot of imaging. Is there anything like this out there? I also really like video games but completely understand that it's no game actually making them, so I haven't really thought about that further at the moment.

-- --

Do I need an internship before I get a job? Sure i'll graduate with 3-4 years experience as a Computer Technician which is great, I've attained some people skills, obviously basic computing knowledge, and other things, but I'm not getting any real programming experience from this. I'm currently saving up so I can leave my current job before school ends so I'll have time to find an internship or job.

----

Is there a point where I should feel knowledgeable about CS? I mean sure compared to me freshman year I know a whole lot, but when I browse around on some programming subreddits I'm pretty intimidated by some of the stuff going on I feel like I should know, i'm not sure. 

----

How important are personal projects? I've done a little with some social network API's like making basic twitter bots and stuff, and am working with my professor and another student on building a drone and automating it with custom python software. Will I need to invest some time into bigger programming projects though? I love the idea of personal projects but for the life of me can't think of something that I know how to do (or know enough to get started) and feel like I'd enjoy doing it.
